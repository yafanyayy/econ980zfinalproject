We've got over 500 people around the world who are dialed into the call. So we know there's a lot of interest in the quarter. And we've made a decision, we're going to put aside the vast majority of our script so that we can get into Q&A as fast as possible with you. Look, my #1 thing I want to tell you is this is the absolute best quarter we have ever had. It's been just an incredible quarter, way beyond our expectations. It caps an incredible fiscal year for us. I'm sure that you saw that revenues for the quarter rose to $1.8 billion, and that's up 27%, which is really just amazing. Revenue for the full fiscal year was also 27%, $6.7 billion. So you look at those things and you go, wow, I mean, that's a very fast growth rate for our company of our size and scale. We're top 10 enterprise software company. You all know the growth rates, Microsoft, Oracle, SAP are shrinking a negative growth rates in many cases, and here we are to 27% growth rate in this enterprise applications market. And as you get -- and as Keith gets into it, you're going to hear we believe we are selling more enterprise apps than Oracle or SAP. 
Deferred revenue grew to nearly $4.3 billion, which was up 31%. Quarterly operating cash flow was nearly $460 million, up 38%. That number, of course, exceeded everyone's expectation and took us by surprise as well. And we are really proud of that number, $460 million quarterly operating cash flow in the quarter. 
Full year operating cash flow was $1.6 billion, up 37%. And the dollar value of booked business on and off the balance sheet, $11 billion. That is obviously a huge a number for us, something that we've never had before, and it's really a huge reflection of the amount of business that has been achieved in the fiscal year and specifically, in the quarter as well. 
We've got great momentum going into our first quarter. We're guiding to an incredible number here. And $1.895 billion at the high end of our range. And for the full year, we're increasing our revenue guidance to $8.12 billion. So we are really excited and aggressive in our guidance. And it's a -- look, it was an amazing quarter. It was an amazing year. We are confident it's going to be an amazing first quarter. And no other enterprise software company of our size and scale is delivering at this level or as excited as we are. And no one else's is as well positioned for the of customer that we are all moving into this forward investor revolution. 
Before I now hand the call now over to Keith, I just want to thank all of our customers and I want to thank all of our partners and I also want to congratulate all 20,000 of our employees on an amazing year. We are deeply, deeply, deeply grateful for everything that you do for us every day. And we don't forget that for one moment, every single day with us at Salesforce with gratitude. And we know that this is a special time, and we're grateful for all the hard work that everyone has put into. Also, I know you were going to want to catch us on our world tour that's coming off and big events are starting next month. You'll see us at in Germany and in Chicago, Boston, Melbourne, Amsterdam. We'll be in Washington D.C. as well, so come to one of our events. And we've got a great new COO here at Salesforce as well. So Keith, congratulations on your promotion. Well done"

Our team really the whole company delivered the best quarter in 19 years in Salesforce. It was a breakthrough quarter. It certainly was a breakthrough year for us and it translated into an amazing results in every region, every industry and really, across companies of all sizes. We signed 2 of the largest deals that I've seen in my career year. I mean, absolutely fantastic. I mean, first, we signed an exciting 9-figure transaction, one of the world's most respected companies. And second, we signed the largest renewal in the history of the company. And listen, they didn't just renew, they also significantly expanded their 9-figure relationship with us in Q4. And we are now their company-wide platform for innovation. I mean, it's really amazing what the team has done and how these customers have embraced us. 
We also drove an all-time high in the number of large transactions this year which is incredible. More than 600 seven-figure plus transaction and a quarter. And I'll tell you, Marc said it, I'll say it again. No one in the enterprise software, no one in enterprise software is developing more strategic relationships right now than Salesforce. 
And you know what, there's no better example of this in Unilever, which is one of the world's greatest consumer package goods companies. It's a great digital transformation story and a significant, significant expansion for us here in Q4. We've been delivering great levels of success with our consumer and marketing teams. We're now working all across business functions. And Unilever plans to bring 95,000 of their employees onto the Salesforce Platform. So that means they are empowering their digital employee strategy to new levels of engagement. 
Now CharlesSchwabb, another great brand is an exciting new relationship for the quarter. They'll be using Salesforce for the entire CRM platform. This is a great example of how ignited industry team had played a pivotal role when important customer. As you all know, Ignite is part of our go-to-market promotion. Also as mentioned in Q1, if you remember, we had told you about our largest Marketing Cloud win ever. Then, we signed an even bigger one in Q3. And in Q4, we did it again. We topped ourselves, and we entered into our largest marketing cloud relationship ever with a large social network. In fact, Marketing Cloud continues the success and increase the number of large Marketing Cloud transactions by more than 60% in the past year. Also one of the largest resellers in the world expanded with us in the quarter and selected Salesforce as their company-wide collaboration platform. And you know what, there are many, many, many stories. These are the some of the world's greatest brands, some of the greatest stories and we continue to deepen our strategic relationships with all of them. I mean, this is great momentum. It's incredible momentum and growth across all of our key industries, in all of our key markets prickle. And I will say again, as Marc did, I'm very, very proud of it intercompany for all of these accomplishments, all our outstanding results are just positive that our strategy is absolutely more than taking hold. I also like to thank our customers and our partners because they are helping us set the standard for this industry. So with that, I'll hand it over to Mark Hawkins."

In addition to the operating cash flow results, Marc mentioned, we continue to drive increased operating leverage. For the full year, we increased our non-GAAP operating margin by 177 basis points. This is a great result as we continue to grow our top line. Our year-over-year growth was balanced across all of our clouds and all of our regions. Sales Cloud accelerated in the quarter with 12% growth. Service Cloud were 35%, Marketing Cloud grew 31%. And App Cloud in the others grew 43%. In the regions, EMEA grew 32% and APAC continues to accelerate at 26% growth, both in constant currency. We also got off to a great start in Q4, and an early quarter strength translated into strong billings and collections in the quarter and helped drive our cash flow in Q4. It also helped us drive our top line performance in Q4. And when you exclude FX effect, $32 million revenue was up 27% in constant currency. Supporting this great top line growth was our declining attrition rate, which remains below 9%. Our deferred revenue in the quarter reached an all-time high of $4.3 billion. This is up 31% in constant currency when excluding an FX effect of $48 million. We also continue to drive an increase in annual billings in the quarter with 88% of all our subscription and support-related invoices issued with annual terms. This benefit is a year-over-year deferred revenue growth in the quarter by approximately 3 percentage points. 
Moving on to guidance. Coming up a strong Q4, and with our proven business model, we are raising our FY '17 revenue guidance to $8.12 billion at the high end of the range. And we're also finishing FY '17 non-GAAP EPS guidance of $0.99 to $1.01. In context, we expect to deliver 125  to 150 basis points of non-GAAP operating margin improvement in FY '17. And this is just coming off a year where we exceeded the high-end of our FY '16 operating margin guidance. As a result of this, we continue margin expansion. We expect to drive another full year of strong operating cash flow, with year-over-year growth of 23% to 24%. For Q1, we're expecting revenue of $1.885 billion to $1.895 billion, non-GAAP EPS of $0.23 to $0.24, and year-over-year deferred revenue growth of 24% to 25%. 
A quick note in our Q1 guide. As all of you know, FY '17 is a leap year. And given we recognize our revenue on a daily basis, there's an extra day of subscription revenue in the first quarter. This will benefit our first quarter revenue by approximately $20 million that will drive a slightly higher non-GAAP EPS and will reduce our deferred revenue by the corresponding amount. This is simply timing item that has no impact on the full FY '17 fiscal year results, but this will have an impact on your quarterly and full year compares and FY '18. To close, we had an outstanding quarter in the year, and we're well positioned to get another great year in FY '17. And at this time, I'd like to add my thanks to the entire Salesforce team for this great results. With that, I'd like to open up the call for questions."

And when that full portfolio accelerates, that is, they all come in, in the quarter, which we really never expect, every product and every geography, in both enterprise and SMB to come in, then you got this kind of accelerated revenue growth which is what you see is this 27% number of both  year and the quarter. And as I said, in my opening remarks, this is the best quarter we've ever seen. We would never expect to see every product group and every geography and every sector of our business exceed our expectations. So that's what we saw in the fourth quarter. And that creates this phenomenal momentum that we have now. And look at that number on and off the balance sheet, $11 billion. There's no greater predictor of our future success than this deferred revenue that we now have in place."

That compounding effect, in fact, is happening. We see that, and I affirm that. And we can say just a terrific Q4 results and terrific DR performance. On the macro side, to Marc's marks point, we have $11 billion of booked and billed and unbilled deferred revenue, that gives you a lot of confidence. When you see our big deals coming in like Keith referenced, it gives you the confidence, when you see the business performing across geos, across clouds, that gives you the confidence that our book of business and what we're hearing from our customers is basically caused us to raise our guidance.

Of course, analytics applications have been an incredible part of the CRM market for a long time. And there are many vendors who offer analytics applications on our platform. When we first introduce our way of capability which was just a little over a year ago, we didn't introduce applications, we introduced a platform, we introduced the ability to build analytics applications using our way of platform, and we said that this strategy was going to be quite differentiated from others because we were going to be platform first. We were going to build an ecosystem. And then we will later build these applications and then we would later build all of these capabilities from the platform into all of our products and it's all of our ISP capabilities as well. And that's where we are today, I think, that there isn't customer or demonstration or a new sales that's happening where this analytics capability is not a huge part of what we offer to customer. This is analytics as a service. This is scalability that runs on your phone, on your tablet. This runs on your desktop, this runs on your watch. This is a multi-tenant fully scalable system. It has all the characteristics that every other Salesforce products that you know and love that's deeply integrated into our core platform, which is Lightning. And it's amazing.

I think everyone is customers are looking to build applications faster than ever before. And customers want to a build applications once and deploy them on every modern platform, which includes a watch, a phone, a tablet, a PC, and many different types of tablets and many different types of PCs, and many different types of phones. And we have delivered the most modern, most incredible application development and the point of platform, I believe in the enterprise today, which is Lightning. And you've heard Accenture talked about on our February to launch how it's accelerating their own ability to build applications, not only internally, but for their customers using our Lightning platform because there's nothing else like it. Companies in the software industry has kind of doubled down and bounce back and focused on building apps and kind of getting their apps to be kind of sexier and looking better on all these new devices. And that's a huge mistake because what these software company should be focus on his building platforms that can deliver these apps. And that's what Salesforce has done. It delivered this incredible Lightning platform. It's amazing what it can do to. I mean you even saw on the February 2 launch, we delivered our Lightning platform's running on Microsoft Continuum before Microsoft has been able to deliver their own applications running on Microsoft Continuum because of the kind of flexibility and the capabilities of Lightning. And also, I would point out, that's our strategy as to my comment with other on Wave that is we have this incredible platform with our -- with Wave to build this analytic apps. And I think you know that we have the most -- the #1 platform on Amazon Web Services for building applications they're called Heroku. And between Heroku, between Wave, but Lightning and other capabilities that we have, this will give developers a fast, easy, and very low-cost way to build and deploy enterprise apps. And I would probably give you this great example of this company called who with a lot of momentum out of our Dreamforce conference, with this incredible application that they had built using Lightning, and they ended up in my office in November, and that was awesome. And I was like, how did you build this? They're like, we just build all of this and Lightning? I mean I saw this app was running to my dream this is an incredible app, running on the watch, on the phone, on the tablet, everything and making salespeople more productive and more successful. And customer service professionals more successful and more productive. And I'd say, how did you build that Lightning, Lightning, Lightning. And I'm like, wow. And of course, I'd like so much about the company. And I think that I hope I get to buy more Lightning companies because within 30 days, I've already fully integrated that into my product, launched the new product, Sales Cloud Lightning which includes [indiscernible] capability. And in addition to that, I've got a fully expanded and extended capabilities across my whole product line. So I hope there's more Lightning ISVs that our team that come into our family because I mean, this is like auto integration once they've gone to our Lightning platform and our ability to distribute that through this multithousand person distribution organization of all this momentum is really an awesome thing. So it is all about platform. It's a key differentiator for us. Of course, we've got a great company. That the key differentiator for us. Of course, with ecosystem. That's the key difference hater for us. And it's also about this robust platform that's a key differentiator for us. And that's how we're winning all these deals. I think you kind of figure out our secret sauce."

So first of all, just on the  EMEA, I mean, one of our growth strategy is to be an international expansion. And that is certainly proving out in terms of the numbers. And that takes many forms. There's customer-facing, it's support resources. It's our data centers. It's although sort of things that really have expanded our footprint internationally and certainly in EMEA that has very, very well for us. Let me just give you an example. Our 2 customers. Incredible unsolicited CEO level remarks at the World Economy Forum. We have entered into a relationship that we talked about on this call before with ADD. And at the world economic forum, up in their many session where the CEOs of these companies will be host a transformational meeting that talks a little bit with under CEOs about what they're doing, what they see in the industry. And certainly ADD was doing that. And at the end of the meeting, the CEO of ADD stood up unsolicited and listen, I am completely transformed in the way and sell to service customers and engage with them because I've chosen Salesforce as my trusted partner. And that, of course, is a very significant company in Europe. Schneider-Electric is another -- the CEO of Schneider-Electric was a in the panel with Marc talking about digital transformation. Unsolicited comment on Schneider-Electric is transforming its service model because of the capabilities of Salesforce. So we have some of the most incredible global companies in the world who happen to be headquartered in EMEA who are actually evangelizing our message in the marketplace around transformation and connecting the customers inside the new wave. So when you see market leaders coming out there and as a CEO level and evangelizing our story, that's certainly send a great message to other companies whether they're in that industry or not. So again, those are 2 proof points on EMEA. On the line of business questions in terms of budgets, look, IT organizations always have budgets. They typically run to between 1% to 2% of the company revenues. But what we've been able to tap into beyond those budgets are the line of business executives budgets. And also as we've discussed on this call, the CEO agenda. It's an amazing phenomenon when you see the CEO who has a growth priority realigning the budgets in a corporation to take on these growth initiatives. And that's what we're seeing. So it goes well beyond IT. Certainly, IT budgets are a particular component. But when the priority of the company is all about growth, you find the money to make that happen. You find the money to make those investments, and that's what we're seeing in the marketplace."

But when you take a look at our revenue and when you divide it by day when there's 1 extra day, that has the effect of having $20 million of extra revenue recognition in Q1 even know it all washes out in the year, right? But when you have 1 extra day of revenue, it means you have 1 less they of deferred revenue effectively. And so that's the other thing you take a look at. So if you take a look t the compounding effect, and you adjust for the leap year, which washes all out in the year but not in the quarter, I think you'll see just the kind of an appropriate pattern there for a guide, okay?"

And this is having a broad ripple effect through the SI community where I think that honestly, they're all asking themselves why are they not all using the Salesforce, building that app on Salesforce and selling Salesforce and having the same great success that Accenture has had. Some of these SIs are kind of prima donnas who have held on to the past too long and it's affected their growth rates and ability to work with customers and then in some cases dislodge them from strategic customers situations because they were not able to move fast enough to understand these customers' needs and got displaced by Accenture. And the we're seeing that in mass. And it's a -- for sure, is a shot across the bow of the SI community that they better go faster when there is going to be a broad shakeup in regards to the transformations that are happening underway in regards to these next-generation implementations, specifically those regarding Salesforce and our product line.

So first and foremost, I think you all recognize that these SIs, many of them, certainly the upper SIs, very strategic influencers in the boardroom and at a CEO level and thinking transformation to these business executives. Part of our strategy is has been to really strengthen these relationships over time because we know that they bring expertise and asset. They can also drive most importantly the customer success. The alteration I would give you is that the most successful SIs are the ones who are very focused on Salesforce and the ones to actually run their business on Salesforce. Markets given you an example. And we are establishing, what I would call a 360-degree relationship with these SIs. So we go to market with these SIs. They've got a business on Salesforce and in the case of Accentue, they're actually building product. They become a ISV. And they are sort of strategic relationships that we're trying to build here, and we've been very, very successful. And the ones who get it are growing. I had a conversation last week with a CEO of a pretty major consulting organization who was lamenting about their lack of growth, generally speaking. And my comments to this person was quite candidly, you're not focused enough on Salesforce because if you're focused on Salesforce, your business will be growing. And I got this look at the acknowledgment and it's absolutely true. The success stories in these consulting practices, they develop their Salesforce practice. So they've been part of the growth strategy. They're starting to virtually all the large ones are running their business on Salesforce. They made their commitments and they're a big part of our future and our ecosystem strategy."

And we've talked a lot about that on the call already that we have erratically different technology model than the technology model that have been in place at Oracle or SAP or even Microsoft. We have, which is our multi-tenancy system, both on our metadata model. We have a radically different customer model, which is our model built on customer success. And we have a radically different from profit model that we have talked about which is our focus on 1% of our equity, our profit and our employees time go into our Salesforce.org. So we of course, done [ph] about 1.3 million hours of community service I believe. It was even more community service this year than Microsoft, which is a company 10x our size. So we're just very committed to volunteer. We run over 25,000 nonprofit and NGOs for free, which has been a gift of over $250 million in services to the nonprofit community. And we've given a little over $100 million in grants as well. I think also, we're out there fighting for equality where we can. You saw that with our focus on equal pay for women. We are just that the White House speaking about that. Adjustments that we've made on the financial so that we can pay women the same that we pay men here at Salesforce. You saw a slight than Indiana against discrimination of our employees, and we're looking squarely at what's going on in Georgia with House Bill 757, which means that we may have to reduce our investments in the state of Georgia based on what we're seeing with the state government there as well. And I hope that they see like the way that the state of Indiana did. And in addition, I think that you see Salesforce trying to create a culture in an environment where we reflect -- we think the future of the world is, a world where there needs to be more equality, world where there is need to be more focus on sustainability and where there needs to be a world focused on companies that are becoming platform for change. And that's a business-to-business improving the state of the world. Those are the things that are really important to us. I think also probably you noticed that we opened up this call saying thank you. It's really important to us that we have a sense of gratitude when we address our employees and our customers and our partners. That's a huge part of our culture. And at the end of the day, it's deeply a part of customers' success as well that is because of our business model, we're only successful if our customers are successful. So these are the things that I think that are actually somewhat different than when we were at Oracle, the narrative there and the actions, the behavior was rewarded differently to things that were encouraged to do in compensated for. And what we told our employees do and what we direct them to do, it's different than what we do in Salesforce, and I hope that we can be an example, a benevolent company that does well and does good."

We've got over 500 people around the world who are dialed in into the call. So we know there's a lot of interest in the quarter. And we've made a decision we're going to put aside the vast majority of our script so that we can get into Q&A as fast as possible with you. 
Look, my #1 thing I want to tell you is this is the absolute best quarter we have ever had. It's been just an incredible quarter, way beyond our expectations. It caps an incredible fiscal year for us. I'm sure that you saw that revenues for the quarter rose to $1.8 billion, and that's up 27%, which is really just amazing. Revenue for the full fiscal year was also up 27%, $6.7 billion. 
So you look at those things, and you go, wow, I mean, that's a very fast growth rate for a company of our size and scale. We're top 10 enterprise software company. You all know the growth rates of Microsoft, Oracle, SAP are shrinking; negative growth rates in many cases. And here, we are at a 27% growth rate in this enterprise applications market. And as you get -- as Keith gets into it, you're going to hear that we believe that we're selling more enterprise apps than Oracle or SAP. 
Deferred revenue grew to nearly $4.3 billion, which was up 31%. Quarterly operating cash flow was nearly $460 million, up 38%. That number, of course, exceeded everyone's expectation and took us by surprise as well. And we are really proud of that number, $460 million quarterly operating cash flow in the quarter. Full year operating cash flow was $1.6 billion, up 37%; and the dollar value of booked business on and off the balance sheet, $11 billion. That is obviously a huge a number for us, something that we've never had before, and it's really a huge reflection of the amount of business that has been achieved in the fiscal year and, specifically, in the quarter as well. 
We've got great momentum going into our first quarter. We're guiding to an incredible number here and, $1.895 billion, at the high end of our range. And for the full year, we're increasing our revenue guidance to $8.12 billion. So we are really excited and aggressive in our guidance. And it's -- yes, it was an amazing quarter. It was an amazing year. We are confident that it's going to be an amazing first quarter. And no other enterprise software company of our size and scale is delivering at this level or as excited as we are. And no one else is as well positioned for the sake of the customer that we are all moving into in this Fourth Industrial Revolution. 
Before I hand the call now over to Keith, I just want to thank all of our customers, and I want to thank all of our partners, and I also want to congratulate all 20,000 of our employees on an amazing year. We are deeply, deeply, deeply grateful for everything that you do for us everyday. And we don't forget that for one moment, every single day with us, that Salesforce start with gratitude. And we know that this is a special time, and we're grateful for all the hard work that everyone has put in. 
Also, I know you were going to want to catch us on our world tour that's coming up, and big events are starting next month. You'll see us at CeBIT in Germany and in Chicago, Boston, Melbourne, Amsterdam. We'll be in Washington, D.C. as well. So come to one of our events. 
And we've got a great new COO here at Salesforce as well. So Keith, congratulations on your promotion. Well done."

Our team -- really, the whole company delivered the best quarter in 19 years here at Salesforce. It was a breakthrough quarter. It certainly was a breakthrough year for us, and it translated into some amazing results in every region, every industry and, really, across companies of all sizes. We signed 2 of the largest deals that I've seen in my career. I mean, absolutely fantastic. I mean, first, we signed an exciting, new 9-figure transaction to one of the world's most respected companies. And second, we signed the largest renewal in the history of the company. And listen, they didn't just renew, they also significantly expanded their 9-figure relationship with us in Q4. And we are now their company-wide platform for innovation. I mean, it's really amazing what the team has done and how these customers have embraced us. 
We also drove an all-time high in the number of large transaction this year, which is incredible, more than 600 7-figure-plus transactions in the quarter. And I'll tell you, Marc said it, I'll say it again, no one in enterprise software, no one in enterprise software is developing more strategic relationships right now than Salesforce. 
And you know what, there's no better example of this than Unilever, which is one of the world's greatest consumer packaged goods companies. It's a great digital transformation story and a significant, significant expansion for us here in Q4. We've been delivering great levels of success with our consumer and marketing teams. We're now working across all business functions. And Unilever plans to bring 95,000 of their employees onto the Salesforce Platform, so that means that they are empowering their digital employee strategy to new levels of engagement. 
Now Charles Schwab, another great brand, is an exciting new relationship in the quarter. They'll be using Salesforce for their entire CRM platform. This is a great example of how Ignite and industry team had played a pivotal role winning an important customer. As you all know, Ignite is part of our go-to-market motion. 
Also, I mean, we had mentioned in Q1, if you remember, we had told you about our largest Marketing Cloud win ever. Then, we signed an even bigger one in Q3. And in Q4, we did it again. We topped ourselves, and we entered into our largest Marketing Cloud relationship ever with a large social network. In fact, Marketing Cloud continues its success and increase the number of large Marketing Cloud transactions by more than 60% in the past year. 
Also, one of the largest resellers in the world expanded with us in the quarter and selected Salesforce as their company-wide collaboration platform. And you know what, there are many, many, many more stories. There -- these are some of the world's greatest brands, some of the greatest stories, and we continue to deepen our strategic relationships with all of them. I mean, this is great momentum. It's incredible momentum and growth across all of our key industries, in all of our key markets. 
And I will say again, as Marc did, I'm very, very proud of the entire company for all of these accomplishments. All our outstanding results are just proof positive that our strategy is absolutely more than taking hold. I'd also like to thank our customers and our partners because they are helping us set the standard for this industry. 
So with that, I'll hand it over to Mark Hawkins."

In addition to the operating cash flow results Marc mentioned, we continue to drive increased operating leverage. For the full year, we increased our non-GAAP operating margin by 177 basis points. This is a great result as we continue to grow our top line. Our year-over-year growth was balanced across all of our clouds and all of our regions: Sales Cloud accelerated in the quarter with 12% growth; Service Cloud grew 35%; Marketing Cloud grew 31%; and App Cloud and others grew 43%. 
In the regions, EMEA grew 32%, and APAC continues to accelerate at 26% growth, both in constant currency. 
We also got off to a great start in Q4, and that early quarter strength translated into strong billings and collections in the quarter and helped drive our cash flow in Q4. It also helped us drive our top line performance in Q4. And when you exclude the FX effect of $32 million, revenue was up 27% in constant currency. 
Supporting this great top line growth was our decline in attrition rate, which remains below 9%. Our deferred revenue in the quarter reached an all-time high of $4.3 billion. This was up 31% in constant currency when excluding an FX effect of $48 million. We also continue to drive an increase in annual billings in the quarter, with 88% of all our subscription and support-related invoices issued with annual terms. This benefited year-over-year deferred revenue growth in the quarter by approximately 3 percentage points. 
Moving on to guidance. Coming off a strong Q4 and with our proven business model, we are raising our FY '17 revenue guidance to $8.12 billion, at the high end of the range. And we're also initiating FY '17 non-GAAP EPS guidance of $0.99 to $1.01. In context, we expect to deliver 125  to 150 basis points of non-GAAP operating margin improvement in FY '17. And this is just coming off a year where we exceeded the high end of our FY '16 operating margin guidance. As a result of this, we continue margin expansion. We expect to drive another full year of strong operating cash flow, with year-over-year growth of 23% to 24%. For Q1, we're expecting revenue of $1.885 billion to $1.895 billion, non-GAAP EPS of $0.23 to $0.24 and year-over-year deferred revenue growth of 24% to 25%. 
A quick note on our Q1 guide. As all of you know, FY '17 is a leap year. And given we recognize our revenue on a daily basis, there's an extra day of subscription revenue in the first quarter. This will benefit our first quarter revenue by approximately $20 million that will drive a slightly higher non-GAAP EPS and will reduce our deferred revenue by the corresponding amount. This is simply a timing item that has no impact on the full FY '17 fiscal year results, but this will have an impact on your quarterly and full year compares in FY '18. 
To close, we had an outstanding quarter and year, and we are well on -- well positioned for yet another great year in FY '17. And at this time, I'd like to add my thanks to the entire Salesforce team for these great results. 
With that, I'd like to open up the call for questions."

So that's what we saw in the fourth quarter, and that creates this phenomenal momentum that we have now. And look at that number on and off the balance sheet, $11 billion; there's no greater predictor of our future success than this deferred revenue that we now have in place."

Just building on Marc's comments, I think you'd asked a little bit about the seasonality in FY '17, starting with Q1. Back at our Analyst Day Keith is referring to, we looked at this compounding effect; and more and more of our renewals and business happening and then showing up in Q4, showing up in the NPAT and DR; and then having a quarter-on-quarter effect throughout the year, that compounding effect, in fact, is happening. We see that, and I affirm that. And we can say it's just a terrific Q4 result and a terrific DR performance. On the macro side, to Marc's point, when you have $11 billion of booked and billed and unbilled deferred revenue, that gives you a lot of confidence. When you see our big deals coming in, like Keith referenced, that gives you the confidence, when you see the business performing across geos, across clouds, that gives you the confidence that our book of business and what we're hearing from the customer, it basically caused us to raise our guidance. And that's what we're seeing. Now we read the same newspapers as everybody else. We're not seeing a economic impact. We're seeing customers doing the kind of things that we've talked about earlier in the call. So hopefully, that helps."

If I were to characterize these 2 transactions in particular, I would tell you that they are CEO-level sales. We are in the boardroom and find ourselves in a position where our customers, as Marc had indicated earlier, are looking for our help to bring them into the age of the customer. They are looking to embrace the concept and notion of digital transformation. They view us as the market leader and, really, the only company that is uniquely positioned to provide them with that transformation -- with that level of transformation. And this -- and what is happening in these very large deals, it's happening in every deal, where these customers are viewing us as a trusted adviser, and that is becoming the norm.

Of course, analytics applications have been an incredible part of the CRM market for a long time. And there aren't many vendors who offer analytics applications on our platform. When we first introduced our way of capability, which was just a little over a year ago, we didn't introduce applications, we introduced a platform, we introduced the ability to build analytics applications using our way of platform. And we said that this strategy was going to be quite differentiated from others because we were going to be platform first, we are going to build an ecosystem, and then we would later build these applications, and then we would later build all of these capabilities from the platform into all of our products and into all of our ISP capabilities as well. And that's where we are today. I think that there isn't a customer or a demonstration or a new sale that's happening where this analytics capability is not a huge part of what we offer to customer. This is analytics as a service. This is scalability. This runs on your phone, on your tablet; this runs on your desktop; this runs on your watch. This is a multitenant, fully scalable system. It has all the characteristics of every other Salesforce products that you know and love, that's deeply integrated into our core platform, which is Lightning, and way is this amazing. The growth is terrific. We're going to, I believe, start to see an incredible breakout this fiscal year that we're starting now. And we're just finishing our fiscal year kickoff the last 2 days here in San Francisco. And Wave was a huge part of the emphasis of what we're going to do this year. So you're going to see a lot of that products. We're very excited about these capabilities. It's an incredible platform. And I will tell -- [indiscernible] my hand here, that we have been demonstrating internally here a number of core Wave applications, including our new Sales Wave capability, which is our sales applications built on Wave; Service Wave, service capabilities; marketing Wave, marketing capabilities.

And customers want to build the build applications once and deploy them on every modern platform, which includes a watch, a phone, a tablet, a PC and many different types of tablets and many different types of PCs and many different types of phones. And we have delivered the most modern, most incredible application development and deployment platform, I believe, in the enterprise today, which is Lightning. And you heard Accenture talk about on our February 2 launch how it's accelerating their own ability to build applications not only internally but for their customers using our Lightning platform because there's nothing else like it. Companies in the software industry has kind of doubled down and bounced back and focused on building apps and kind of getting their apps to be kind of sexier and looking better on all these new devices. And that's a huge mistake because what these software companies should be focused on is building platforms that can deliver these apps. And that's what Salesforce has done. We've delivered this incredible Lightning platform. I mean, it is amazing, what it can do. I mean, you even saw on the February 2 launch, we delivered our Lightning platform running on Microsoft Continuum before Microsoft has been able to deliver their own applications running on Microsoft Continuum because of the kind of flexibility and capabilities of Lightning. And also, I would point out, that's our strategy, as to my comment with Heather on Wave, that is we have this incredible platform with our -- with Wave to build these analytics apps. And I think you know that we have the most -- the #1 platform on Amazon Web Services for building applications; they're called Heroku. And between Heroku, between Wave, between Lightning and other capabilities that we have, this really give developers a fast, easy and very low-cost way to build and deploy enterprise apps. And I would probably give you this great example of this company called SteelBrick, who came with a lot of momentum out of our Dreamforce conference, with this incredible application that they had built using Lightning, and they ended up in my office in November, and that was awesome. And I'm like, ""How did you build this?"" They're like, ""Well, this is what -- we just build all of this on Lightning."" I mean, I saw this app was running. It's my dream that this incredible app running on the watch, on the phone, on the tablet and everything and making salespeople more productive and more successful and customer service professionals more successful and more productive. And I'd say, ""How did you build it?"" And they'd go, ""Lightning, Lightning, Lightning."" And I'm like, ""Wow."" And I -- of course, I like it so much about the company. And I think that and I hope that I get to buy more Lightning companies because, within 30 days, I've already fully integrated that into my product, launched the new product, Sales Cloud Lightning, which includes the SteelBrick CPQ capability. And in addition to that, I've got a fully expanded and extended capabilities across my whole product line. So I hope there's more Lightning ISVs that are seeing us, that come into our family because, I mean, this is like auto integration. Once they've gone to our Lightning platform and in our ability to distribute that through this multi-thousand person distribution organization, with all this momentum, is really an awesome thing. So it is all about the platform. It's a key differentiator for us. Of course, we've got a great company. That the key differentiator for us. Of course, we have our ecosystem. That's a key differentiator for us. And it's also about this robust platform. That's a key differentiator for us, and that's how we're winning all these deals. I think you've kind of figured out our secret sauce."

So this time, we can hear you loud and clear. So thanks for the question. So first of all, just on EMEA, I mean, one of our growth strategies is an international expansion, and that is certainly about proving out in terms of the numbers. And that takes many forms: it's customer facing; it's support resources; it's our data centers; it's all those sort of things that have really expanded our footprint internationally. And certainly, in EMEA, that has paid out very, very well for us. Let me just give you an example of 2 customers with incredible, unsolicited CEO-level remarks at the World Economic Forum. We have entered into a relationship that we've talked about on this call before, with ABB. And at the World Economic Forum, often there are many sessions where the CEOs of these companies will host a transformational meeting that talks a little bit with other CEOs about what they're doing, what they see in the industry; and certainly, ABB was doing that. And at the end of the meeting, the CEO of ABB stood up unsolicited and said, ""Listen, I'm completely transforming the way that I sell and service to my customers and engage with them because I've chosen Salesforce as my trusted partner."" And that, of course, is a very significant company in Europe. Schneider Electric is another -- the CEO of Schneider Electric was on a panel with Marc talking about digital transformation. Unsolicited comment of Schneider Electric is transforming its service model because of the capabilities of Salesforce. So we have some of the most incredible global companies in the world, who happen to be headquartered in EMEA, who are actually evangelizing our message in the marketplace around transformation and connecting the customers in entirely new ways. So when you see market leaders coming out there and at the CEO level and evangelizing our story, that certainly sends a great message to other companies, whether they're in that industry or not. So again, those are 2 proof points on EMEA. On the line of business question in terms of budgets, look, IT organizations always have budgets. They typically range between 1% and 2% of the company revenue. But what we've been able to tap into beyond those budgets are the line of business executives' budgets and also, as we've discussed on this call, the CEO agenda. It's an amazing phenomenon when you see the CEO, who has a growth priority, realign the budgets in a corporation to take on these growth initiatives. And that's what we're seeing. So it goes well beyond IT. Certainly, IT budgets are a particular component. But when the priority of a company is all about growth, you find the money to make that happen, you find the money to make those investments, and that's what we're seeing in the marketplace."

But to kind of build on your point, there is one other thing that we're trying to make sure that everyone sees and we call out, so I appreciate your question in there, and that's regarding leap year. And it seems like a simple enough point, but when you take a look at our revenue and you divide it out by day, and when there's 1 extra day, that has the effect of having $20 million of extra revenue recognition in Q1 even though it all washes out in the year, right? But when you have 1 extra day of revenue, it means you have 1 less day of deferred revenue, effectively, and so that's the other thing that you take a look at.

Some of these SIs are kind of prima donnas, who have held on to the past too long, and it's affected their growth rates and their ability to work with customers and, in some cases, dislodged them from strategic customer situations because they were not able to move fast enough to understand these customers' needs and got displaced by Accenture. And we're seeing that en masse. And it's a -- for sure, it's a shot across the bow of the SI community that they better go faster where there -- when there is going to be a broad shakeup in regard to the transformations that are happening underway, in regards to these next-generation implementations, specifically those regarding Salesforce and our product line.

So first and foremost, I think you all recognize that these SIs, many of them, certainly, the upper tier of the SIs are very strategic influencers and in the boardroom, and that's a CEO level, and speaking transformation to this line of business executives. Part of our strategy has been to really strengthen these relationships over time because we know that they bring expertise and access. And they can also drive, most importantly, the customer success. The admiration I would give you is that the most successful SIs are the ones who are very focused on Salesforce and the ones who actually run their business on Salesforce. Marc has just given that as an example. And we are establishing what I would call a 360-degree relationship with these SIs. So we go to market with these SIs. They run their business on Salesforce. And in the case of Accenture, they're actually building product. They've become an ISV. And those are the strategic sort of relationships that we're trying to build here, and we've been very, very successful. And the ones who get it are growing. I had a conversation last week with a CEO of a pretty major consulting organization who was lamenting about their lack of growth, generally speaking. And my comments to this person was, quite candidly, you're not focused enough on Salesforce because if you were focused on Salesforce, your business will be growing. And I got this look of acknowledgment, and it's absolutely true. The success stories in these consulting practices, they develop their Salesforce practice. So they've been a big part of our growth strategy. They're starting to -- virtually all the large ones are running their business on Salesforce. They've made their commitments, and they're a big part of our future and our ecosystem strategy."

And we've talked a lot about that on the call already, that is we have a radically different technology model than the technology model that has been in place at Oracle or SAP or even Microsoft. We have -- which is our multitenancy system, both on our metadata model. We have a radically different customer model, which is our model built on customer success. And we have a radically different nonprofit model that we've talked about, which is our focus on 1% of our equity, our profit and our employees' time go into our Salesforce.org. So we, of course, had done about 1.3 million hours of community service, I believe. We'll do even more community service this year than Microsoft, which is a company 10x our size, because we're just very committed to volunteerism. We run over 25,000 nonprofits and NGOs for free, which has been a gift of over $250 million in services to the nonprofit community. And we've given way over $100 million in grants as well. I think also, we're out there fighting for equality where we can. You saw that with our focus on equal pay for women. We're just at the White House speaking about that adjustments that we've made to our own financials so that we can pay women the same that we pay men here at Salesforce. You saw us fight in Indiana against discrimination of our employees. And we're looking squarely at what's going on in Georgia with the House Bill 757, which means that we may have to reduce our investments in the state of Georgia based on what we're seeing with the state government there as well. And I hope that they see the light the way that the state of Indiana did. And in addition, I think that you see Salesforce trying to create a culture and an environment where we reflect what we think the future of the world is, a world where there needs to be more equality, a world where there needs to be more focus on sustainability and where there needs to be a world focused on companies that are becoming platform for change and that business have been -- that this is improving the state of the world. Those are the things that are really important to us. I think also you've probably noticed that we opened up this call saying thank you. It's really important to us that we have a sense of gratitude when we address our employees and our customers and our partners. That's a huge part of our culture. And at the end of the day, it's deeply a part of customer success as well, that is because of our business model, we're only successful if our customers are successful. So these are the things that I think that are actually somewhat different than when we're at Oracle: the narrative there and the actions; the behavior was rewarded differently; the things that we were encouraged to do and compensated for; and what we told our employees to do and what we direct them to do is different than what we do at Salesforce. And I hope that we can be an example of a benevolent company that does well and does good."

And we -- this is our biggest call ever. We've got over 500 people around the world who are dialed in into the call. So we know there's a lot of interest in the quarter. And we've made a decision we're going to put aside the vast major",640,"Okay. Thanks, John. And we -- this is our biggest call ever. We've got over 500 people around the world who are dialed in into the call. So we know there's a lot of interest in the quarter. And we've made a decision we're going to put aside the vast majority of our script so that we can get into Q&A as fast as possible with you. 
Look, my #1 thing I want to tell you is this is the absolute best quarter we have ever had. It's been just an incredible quarter, way beyond our expectations. It caps an incredible fiscal year for us. I'm sure that you saw that revenues for the quarter rose to $1.8 billion, and that's up 27%, which is really just amazing. Revenue for the full fiscal year was also up 27%, $6.7 billion. 
So you look at those things, and you go, wow, I mean, that's a very fast growth rate for a company of our size and scale. We're a top 10 enterprise software company. You all know the growth rates of Microsoft, Oracle, SAP are shrinking; negative growth rates in many cases. And here, we are at a 27% growth rate in this enterprise applications market. And as you get -- as Keith gets into it, you're going to hear that we believe that we're selling more enterprise apps than Oracle or SAP. 
Deferred revenue grew to nearly $4.3 billion, which was up 31%. Quarterly operating cash flow was nearly $460 million, up 38%. That number, of course, exceeded everyone's expectation and took us by surprise as well. And we are really proud of that number, $460 million quarterly operating cash flow in the quarter. Full year operating cash flow was $1.6 billion, up 37%; and the dollar value of booked business on and off the balance sheet, $11 billion. That is obviously a huge a number for us, something that we've never had before, and it's really a huge reflection of the amount of business that has been achieved in the fiscal year and, specifically, in the quarter as well. 
We've got great momentum going into our first quarter. We're guiding to an incredible number here and, $1.895 billion, at the high end of our range. And for the full year, we're increasing our revenue guidance to $8.12 billion. So we are really excited and aggressive in our guidance. And look, it was an amazing quarter. It was an amazing year. We are confident that it's going to be an amazing first quarter. And no other enterprise software company of our size and scale is delivering at this level or is as excited as we are. And no one else is as well positioned for this age of the customer that we are all moving into in this Fourth Industrial Revolution. 
Before I hand the call now over to Keith, I just want to thank all of our customers, and I want to thank all of our partners, and I also want to congratulate all 20,000 of our employees on an amazing year. We are deeply, deeply, deeply grateful for everything that you do for us every day. And we don't forget that for one moment. Every single day with us at Salesforce starts with gratitude. And we know that this is a special time, and we're grateful for all the hard work that everyone has put in. 
Also, I know you were going to want to catch us on our world tour that's coming up, and big events are starting next month. You'll see us at CeBIT in Germany and in Chicago, Boston, Melbourne, Amsterdam. We'll be in Washington, D.C. as well. So come to one of our events. 
And we've got a great new COO here at Salesforce as well. So Keith, congratulations on your promotion. Well done."

Our team -- really, the whole company delivered the best quarter in my 3 years here at Salesforce. It was a breakthrough quarter. It certainly was a breakthrough year for us, and it's translated into some amazing results in every region, every industry and, really, across companies of all sizes. We signed 2 of the largest deals that I've seen in my career. I mean, absolutely fantastic. I mean, first, we signed an exciting, new 9-figure transaction to one of the world's most respected companies. And second, we signed the largest renewal in the history of the company. And listen, they didn't just renew. They also significantly expanded their 9-figure relationship with us in Q4. And we are now their company-wide platform for innovation. I mean, it's really amazing what the team has done and how these customers have embraced us. 
We also drove an all-time high in the number of large transaction this year, which is incredible, more than 600 7-figure-plus transactions in the quarter. And I'll tell you, Marc said it, I'll say it again, no one in enterprise software, no one in enterprise software is developing more strategic relationships right now than Salesforce. 
And you know what, there's no better example of this than Unilever, which is one of the world's greatest consumer packaged goods companies. It's a great digital transformation story and a significant, significant expansion for us here in Q4. We've been delivering great levels of success with our consumer and marketing teams. We're now working across all business functions. And Unilever plans to bring 95,000 of their employees onto the Salesforce Platform, so that means that they are empowering their digital employee strategy to new levels of engagement. 
Now Charles Schwab, another great brand, is an exciting new relationship in the quarter. They'll be using Salesforce for their entire CRM platform. This is a great example of how Ignite and industry teams have played a pivotal role winning an important customer. As you all know, Ignite is part of our go-to-market motion. 
Also, we had mentioned in Q1, if you remember, we had told you about our largest Marketing Cloud win ever. Then we signed an even bigger one in Q3. And in Q4 we did it again. We topped ourselves, and we entered into our largest Marketing Cloud relationship ever with a large social network. In fact, Marketing Cloud continues its success and increased the number of large Marketing Cloud transactions by more than 60% in the past year. 
Also, one of the largest retailers in the world expanded with us in the quarter and selected Salesforce as their company-wide collaboration platform. And you know what, there are many, many, many more stories. There -- these are some of the world's greatest brands, some of the greatest stories, and we continue to deepen our strategic relationships with all of them. I mean, this is great momentum. It's incredible momentum and growth across all of our key industries and all of our key markets. 
And I will say again, as Marc did, I am very, very proud of the entire company for all of these accomplishments. All our outstanding results are just proof positive that our strategy is absolutely more than taking hold. I'd also like to thank our customers and our partners because they are helping us set the standard for this industry. 
So with that, I'll hand it over to Mark Hawkins."

For the full year, we increased our non-GA",558,"Thanks, Keith. We had an incredible financial quarter, so let me start off with some highlights. 
In addition to the operating cash flow results Marc mentioned, we continue to drive increased operating leverage. For the full year, we increased our non-GAAP operating margin by 177 basis points. This is a great result as we continue to grow our top line. Our year-over-year growth was balanced across all of our clouds and all of our regions: Sales Cloud accelerated in the quarter with 12% growth; Service Cloud grew 35%; Marketing Cloud grew 31%; and App Cloud and others grew 43%. 
In the regions, EMEA grew 32%, and APAC continues to accelerate at 26% growth, both in constant currency. 
We also got off to a great start in Q4, and that early quarter strength translated into strong billings and collections in the quarter and helped drive our cash flow in Q4. It also helped us drive our top line performance in Q4. And when you exclude the FX effect of $32 million, revenue was up 27% in constant currency. 
Supporting this great top line growth was our decline in attrition rate, which remains below 9%. Our deferred revenue in the quarter reached an all-time high of $4.3 billion. This was up 31% in constant currency when excluding an FX effect of $48 million. We also continued to drive an increase in annual billings in the quarter, with 88% of all our subscription and support-related invoices issued with annual terms. This benefited year-over-year deferred revenue growth in the quarter by approximately 3 percentage points. 
Moving on to guidance. Coming off a strong Q4 and with our proven business model, we are raising our FY '17 revenue guidance to $8.12 billion, at the high end of the range. And we're also initiating FY '17 non-GAAP EPS guidance of $0.99 to $1.01. In context, we expect to deliver 125 to 150 basis points of non-GAAP operating margin improvement in FY '17. And this is just coming off a year where we exceeded the high end of our FY '16 operating margin guidance. As a result of this, we continue margin expansion. We expect to drive another full year of strong operating cash flow, with year-over-year growth of 23% to 24%. For Q1, we're expecting revenue of $1.885 billion to $1.895 billion, non-GAAP EPS of $0.23 to $0.24 and year-over-year deferred revenue growth of 24% to 25%. 
A quick note on our Q1 guide. As all of you know, FY '17 is a leap year. And given we recognize our revenue on a daily basis, there's an extra day of subscription revenue in the first quarter. This will benefit our first quarter revenue by approximately $20 million, and will drive a slightly higher non-GAAP EPS and will reduce our deferred revenue by the corresponding amount. This is simply a timing item that has no impact on the full FY '17 fiscal year results, but this will have an impact on your quarterly and full year compares in FY '18. 
To close, we had an outstanding quarter and year, and we are well on -- well positioned for yet another great year in FY '17. And at this time, I'd like to add my thanks to the entire Salesforce team for these great results. 
With that, I'd like to open up the call for questions."

Anything you could point us to in terms why you guys are seeing this now? What's really clicking on in the business that'll let you guys accelerate? Then maybe if I could squeeze in one for Mr. Hawkins. Just in terms of as we're thinking about FY '17, the business is getting increasingly seasonal, so in terms of Q1, growth a little bit lower and there's more growth in the back half of the year. Given the current sort of economic environment, how do you garner confidence in the ability to stay in this 20% plus growth for the full year of FY '17?"

And when that full portfolio accelerates, that is they all come in, in the quarter, which we really never expect every product and every geography and both enterprise and SMB to come in. Then you get this kind of accelerated revenue growth, which is what you see is this 27% number on both the year and the quarter. And it's, as I said in my opening remarks, this is the best quarter we've ever seen. We would never expect to see every product group and every geography and every sector of our business exceed our expectations. But that's what we saw in the fourth quarter, and that creates this phenomenal momentum that we have now. And look at that number on and off the balance sheet, $11 billion; there's no greater predictor of our future success than this deferred revenue that we now have in place."

Just building on Marc's comments, I think you'd asked a little bit about the seasonality in FY '17, starting with Q1. Back at our Analyst Day Keith is referring to, we looked at this compounding effect; and more and more of our renewals and business happening and then showing up in Q4, showing up in the impact in DR; and then having a quarter-on-quarter effect throughout the year. That compounding effect, in fact, is happening. We see that, and I affirm that. And you can see it's just a terrific Q4 result and a terrific DR performance. On the macro side, to Marc's point, when you have $11 billion of booked and billed and unbilled deferred revenue that gives you a lot of confidence. When you see our big deals coming in, like Keith referenced, it gives you the confidence. When you see the business performing across geos, across clouds, that gives you the confidence that our book of business and what we're hearing from the customer, it basically caused us to raise our guidance. And that's what we're seeing. Now we read the same newspapers as everybody else. We're not seeing a economic impact. We're seeing customers doing the kinds of things that were talked about earlier in the call. So hopefully, that helps."

They are looking to embrace the concept and notion of digital transformation. They view us as the market leader and, really, the only company that is uniquely positioned to provide them with that transformation -- with that level of transformation.

Of course, analytics applications have been an incredible part of the CRM market for a long time. And there are many vendors who offer analytics applications on our platform. When we first introduced our Wave capability, which was just a little over a year ago, we didn't introduce applications, we introduced a platform. We introduced the ability to build analytics applications using our Wave platform. And we said that this strategy was going to be quite differentiated from others because we were going to be platform first. We were going to build an ecosystem, and then we would later build these applications, and then we would later build all of these capabilities from the platform into all of our products and into all of our ISP capabilities as well. And that's where we are today. I think that there isn't a customer or a demonstration or a new sale that's happening where this analytics capability is not a huge part of what we offer the customer. This is analytics as a service. This is scalability. This runs on your phone, on your tablet; this runs on your desktop; this runs on your watch. This is a multitenant, fully scalable system. It has all the characteristics of every other Salesforce product that you know and love. It's deeply integrated into our core platform, which is Lightning. And Wave is amazing. The growth is terrific. We're going to, I believe, start to see an incredible breakout this fiscal year that we're starting now. And we're just finishing our fiscal year kickoff the last 2 days here in San Francisco. And Wave was a huge part of the emphasis of what we're going to do this year. So you're going to see a lot of that product. We're very excited about its capabilities. It's an incredible platform. And I will tell -- I'll tip my hand here, that we have been demonstrating internally here a number of core Wave applications, including our new Sales Wave capability, which is our sales application built on Wave; Service Wave, service capabilities; marketing Wave, marketing capabilities. And even Mark Hawkins here has built a full set of applications that help him run his entire financial business. And so it's a -- it's an exciting new product, and we're -- we couldn't be more excited to be in the analytics business."

I think, number one, is customers are looking to build applications faster than ever before. And customers want to be able to build applications once and deploy them on every modern platform, which includes a watch, a phone, a tablet, a PC and many different types of tablets and many different types of PCs and many different types of phones. And we have delivered the most modern, most incredible application development and deployment platform, I believe, in the enterprise today, which is Lightning. And you heard Accenture talk about on our February 2 launch how it's accelerating their own ability to build applications not only internally but for their customers using our Lightning platform because there's nothing else like it. Companies in the software industry have kind of doubled down and bounced back and focused on building apps and kind of getting their apps to be kind of sexier and looking better on all these new devices. And that's a huge mistake because what these software companies should be focused on is building platforms that can deliver these apps. And that's what Salesforce has done. We've delivered this incredible Lightning platform. I mean, it is amazing what it can do. I mean, you even saw on the February 2 launch, we delivered our Lightning platform running on Microsoft Continuum before Microsoft has been able to deliver their own applications running on Microsoft Continuum because of the kind of flexibility and capabilities of Lightning. And also, I would point out, that's our strategy, as to my comment with Heather on Wave. That is we have this incredible platform with our -- with Wave to build these analytics apps. And I think you know that we have the most -- the #1 platform on Amazon Web Services for building applications there called Heroku. And between Heroku, between Wave, between Lightning and other capabilities that we have, this really give developers a fast, easy and very low-cost way to build and deploy enterprise apps. And I would probably give you this great example of this company called SteelBrick, who came with a lot of momentum out of our Dreamforce conference, with this incredible application that they had built using Lightning. And they ended up in my office in November, and it was awesome. And I'm like, ""How did you build this?"" And they're like, ""Well, this is what -- we just build all of this on Lightning."" I mean, I saw this app was running. It's my dream of this incredible app running on the watch, on the phone, on the tablet and everything and making salespeople more productive and more successful and customer service professionals more successful and more productive. And I'm saying, ""How did you build it?"" And they're going, ""Lightning, Lightning, Lightning."" And I'm like, ""Wow."" And I -- of course, I liked it so much I bought the company. And I think that -- and I hope that I get to buy more Lightning companies. Because, within 30 days, I've already fully integrated that into my product, launched a new product, Sales Cloud Lightning, which includes the SteelBrick CPQ capability. And in addition to that, I've got a fully expanded and extended capabilities across my whole product line. So I hope there's more Lightning ISVs that are teeing up to come into our family because, I mean, this is like auto integration. Once they get onto our Lightning platform and then our ability to distribute that through this multi-thousand person distribution organization, with all this momentum, is really an awesome thing. So it is all about the platform. It's a key differentiator for us. Of course, we've got a great company. That a key differentiator for us. Of course, we have our ecosystem. That's a key differentiator for us. And it's also about this robust platform. That's a key differentiator for us, and that's how we're winning all these deals. I think you've kind of figured out our secret sauce."

So this time, we can hear you loud and clear. So thanks for the question. So first of all, just on EMEA, I mean, one of our growth strategies is an international expansion, and that is certainly proving out in terms of the numbers. And that takes many forms: it's customer facing; it's support resources; it's our data centers; it's all those sort of things that have really expanded our footprint internationally. And certainly, in EMEA, that has paid out very, very well for us. Let me just give you an example of 2 customers with incredible, unsolicited CEO-level remarks at the World Economic Forum. We have entered into a relationship that we've talked about on this call before, with ABB. And at the World Economic Forum, often there are many sessions where the CEOs of these companies will host a transformational meeting that talks a little bit with other CEOs about what they're doing, what they see in the industry; and certainly, ABB was doing that. And at the end of the meeting, the CEO of ABB stood up unsolicited and said, ""Listen, I'm completely transforming the way that I sell and service to my customers and engage with them because I've chosen Salesforce as my trusted partner."" And that, of course, is a very significant company in Europe. Schneider Electric is another. The CEO of Schneider Electric was on a panel with Marc talking about digital transformation. Unsolicited comment about how Schneider Electric is transforming its service model because of the capabilities of Salesforce. So we have some of the most incredible global companies in the world, who happen to be headquartered in EMEA, who are actually evangelizing our message in the marketplace around transformation and connecting to customers in entirely new ways. So when you see market leaders coming out there and at the CEO level and evangelizing our story, that certainly sends a great message to other companies, whether they're in that industry or not. So again, those are 2 proof points on EMEA. On the line of business question in terms of budgets, look, IT organizations always have budgets. They typically range between 1% and 2% of the company revenues. But what we've been able to tap into beyond those budgets are the line of business executives' budgets and also, as we've discussed on this call, the CEO agenda. It's an amazing phenomenon when you see the CEO, who has a growth priority, realign the budgets in a corporation to take on these growth initiatives. And that's what we're seeing. So it goes well beyond IT. Certainly, IT budgets are a particular component. But when the priority of a company is all about growth, you find the money to make that happen. You find the money to make those investments, and that's what we're seeing in the marketplace."

But to kind of build on your point, there is one other thing that we're trying to make sure that everyone sees and to call out, so I appreciate your question there, and that's regarding leap year. And it seems like a simple enough point, but when you take a look at our revenue and you divide it up by day, and when there's 1 extra day, that has the effect of having $20 million of extra revenue recognition in Q1 even though it all washes out in the year, right? But when you have 1 extra day of revenue, it means you have 1 less day of deferred revenue, effectively, and so that's the other thing that you take a look at. So if you take a look at the compounding effect, and you adjust for the leap year, which washes all out in the year but not in the quarter, I think you'll see just a kind of an appropriate pattern there for a guide, okay?"

We're not only Accenture's fastest-growing business unit; but also, they've now deployed already 25,000 users of Salesforce inside Accenture. You've heard their CIO and their CEO come to our launch on February 2 and give personal testimonial to the success that they've had, that their only regret is that they didn't go faster with Salesforce, that they're transforming their customer relationships at unheard-of rates. And this is having a broad ripple effect through the SI community, where I think that, honestly, they're all asking themselves why are they not all using Salesforce, building apps on Salesforce and selling Salesforce and having the same great success that Accenture has had. Some of these SIs are kind of prima donnas, who have held on to the past too long, and it's affected their growth rates and their ability to work with customers and, in some cases, dislodged them from strategic customer situations because they were not able to move fast enough to understand these customers' needs and got displaced by Accenture. And we're seeing that en masse. And it's a -- for sure, it's a shot across the bow of the SI community that they better go faster or there's going to be a broad shakeup in regards to the transformations that are happening underway, in regards to these next-generation implementations, specifically those regarding Salesforce and our product line.

So first and foremost, I think we all recognize that these SIs, many of them, certainly, the upper tier of the SIs are very strategic influencers and in the boardroom, and at the CEO level and speaking transformation to these line of business executives. Part of our strategy has been to really strengthen these relationships over time because we know that they bring expertise and access. And they can also drive, most importantly, the customer's success. The observation I would give you is that the most successful SIs are the ones who are very focused on Salesforce and the ones who actually run their business on Salesforce. Marc has just given that as an example. And we are establishing what I would call a 360-degree relationship with these SIs. So we go to market with these SIs. They run their business on Salesforce. And in the case of Accenture, they're actually building products. They've become an ISV. And those are the strategic sort of relationships that we're trying to build here, and we've been very, very successful. And the ones who get it are growing. I had a conversation last week with a CEO of a pretty major consulting organization who was lamenting about their lack of growth, generally speaking. And my comment to this person was, quite candidly, you're not focused enough on Salesforce. Because if you were focused on Salesforce, your business would be growing. And I got this look of acknowledgment, and it's absolutely true. The success stories in these consulting practices is about their Salesforce practices. So they've been a big part of our growth strategy. They're starting to -- virtually all the large ones are running their business on Salesforce. They've made their commitments, and they're a big part of our future and our ecosystem strategy."

And we've talked a lot about that on the call already, that is we have a radically different technology model than the technology model that has been in place at Oracle or SAP or even Microsoft. We have -- which is our multitenancy system, both on our metadata model. We have a radically different customer model, which is a model built on customer success. And we have a radically different philanthropic model that we've talked about, which is our focus on 1% of our equity, our profit and our employees' time go into our Salesforce.org. So we, of course, have done about 1.3 million hours of community service. I believe we'll do even more community service this year than Microsoft, which is a company 10x our size, because we're just very committed to volunteerism. We run over 25,000 nonprofits and NGOs for free, which has been a gift of over $250 million in services to the nonprofit community. And we've given away over $100 million in grants as well. I think also, we're out there fighting for equality where we can. You saw that with our focus on equal pay for women. We were just at the White House speaking about that, adjustments that we've made to our own financials so that we can pay women the same that we pay men here at Salesforce. You saw us fight in Indiana against discrimination of our employees. And we're looking squarely at what's going on in Georgia with the House Bill 757, which means that we may have to reduce our investments in the state of Georgia based on what we're seeing with the state government there as well. And I hope that they see the light the way that the state of Indiana did. And in addition, I think that you see Salesforce trying to create a culture and an environment where we reflect what we think the future of the world is: a world where there needs to be more equality; a world where there needs to be more focus on sustainability; and where there needs to be a world focused on companies that are becoming platforms for change and that the business of business is improving the state of the world. Those are the things that are really important to us. I think also you've probably noticed that we opened up this call saying thank you. It's really important to us that we have a sense of gratitude when we address our employees and our customers and our partners. That's a huge part of our culture. And at the end of the day, it's deeply a part of customer success as well, that is because of our business model, we're only successful if our customers are successful. So these are the things that I think that are actually somewhat different than when we were at Oracle: the narrative there and the actions; the behavior was rewarded differently; the things that we were encouraged to do and compensated for; and what we told our employees to do and what we were directed to do is different than what we do at Salesforce. And I hope that we can be an example of a benevolent company that does well and does good."

And we -- this is our biggest call ever. We've got over 500 people around the world who are dialed in into the call. So we know there's a lot of interest in the quarter.

We've got over 500 people around the world who are dialed in into the call. So we know there's a lot of interest in the quarter. And we've made a decision we're going to put aside the vast majority of our script so that we can get into Q&A as fast as possible with you. 
Look, my #1 thing I want to tell you is this is the absolute best quarter we have ever had. It's been just an incredible quarter, way beyond our expectations. It caps an incredible fiscal year for us. I'm sure that you saw that revenues for the quarter rose to $1.8 billion, and that's up 27%, which is really just amazing. Revenue for the full fiscal year was also up 27%, $6.7 billion. 
So you look at those things, and you go, wow, I mean, that's a very fast growth rate for a company of our size and scale. We're a top 10 enterprise software company. You all know the growth rates of Microsoft, Oracle, SAP are shrinking; negative growth rates in many cases. And here, we are at a 27% growth rate in this enterprise applications market. And as you get -- as Keith gets into it, you're going to hear that we believe that we're selling more enterprise apps than Oracle or SAP. 
Deferred revenue grew to nearly $4.3 billion, which was up 31%. Quarterly operating cash flow was nearly $460 million, up 38%. That number, of course, exceeded everyone's expectation and took us by surprise as well. And we are really proud of that number, $460 million quarterly operating cash flow in the quarter. Full year operating cash flow was $1.6 billion, up 37%; and the dollar value of booked business on and off the balance sheet, $11 billion. That is obviously a huge a number for us, something that we've never had before, and it's really a huge reflection of the amount of business that has been achieved in the fiscal year and, specifically, in the quarter as well. 
We've got great momentum going into our first quarter. We're guiding to an incredible number here and, $1.895 billion, at the high end of our range. And for the full year, we're increasing our revenue guidance to $8.12 billion. So we are really excited and aggressive in our guidance. And look, it was an amazing quarter. It was an amazing year. We are confident that it's going to be an amazing first quarter. And no other enterprise software company of our size and scale is delivering at this level or is as excited as we are. And no one else is as well positioned for this age of the customer that we are all moving into in this Fourth Industrial Revolution. 
Before I hand the call now over to Keith, I just want to thank all of our customers, and I want to thank all of our partners, and I also want to congratulate all 20,000 of our employees on an amazing year. We are deeply, deeply, deeply grateful for everything that you do for us every day. And we don't forget that for one moment. Every single day with us at Salesforce starts with gratitude. And we know that this is a special time, and we're grateful for all the hard work that everyone has put in. 
Also, I know you were going to want to catch us on our world tour that's coming up, and big events are starting next month. You'll see us at CeBIT in Germany and in Chicago, Boston, Melbourne, Amsterdam. We'll be in Washington, D.C. as well. So come to one of our events.

Our team -- really, the whole company delivered the best quarter in my 3 years here at Salesforce. It was a breakthrough quarter. It certainly was a breakthrough year for us, and it's translated into some amazing results in every region, every industry and, really, across companies of all sizes. We signed 2 of the largest deals that I've seen in my career. I mean, absolutely fantastic. I mean, first, we signed an exciting, new 9-figure transaction to one of the world's most respected companies. And second, we signed the largest renewal in the history of the company. And listen, they didn't just renew. They also significantly expanded their 9-figure relationship with us in Q4. And we are now their company-wide platform for innovation. I mean, it's really amazing what the team has done and how these customers have embraced us. 
We also drove an all-time high in the number of large transaction this year, which is incredible, more than 600 7-figure-plus transactions in the quarter. And I'll tell you, Marc said it, I'll say it again, no one in enterprise software, no one in enterprise software is developing more strategic relationships right now than Salesforce. 
And you know what, there's no better example of this than Unilever, which is one of the world's greatest consumer packaged goods companies. It's a great digital transformation story and a significant, significant expansion for us here in Q4. We've been delivering great levels of success with our consumer and marketing teams. We're now working across all business functions. And Unilever plans to bring 95,000 of their employees onto the Salesforce Platform, so that means that they are empowering their digital employee strategy to new levels of engagement. 
Now Charles Schwab, another great brand, is an exciting new relationship in the quarter. They'll be using Salesforce for their entire CRM platform. This is a great example of how Ignite and industry teams have played a pivotal role winning an important customer. As you all know, Ignite is part of our go-to-market motion. 
Also, we had mentioned in Q1, if you remember, we had told you about our largest Marketing Cloud win ever. Then we signed an even bigger one in Q3. And in Q4 we did it again. We topped ourselves, and we entered into our largest Marketing Cloud relationship ever with a large social network. In fact, Marketing Cloud continues its success and increased the number of large Marketing Cloud transactions by more than 60% in the past year. 
Also, one of the largest retailers in the world expanded with us in the quarter and selected Salesforce as their company-wide collaboration platform. And you know what, there are many, many, many more stories. There -- these are some of the world's greatest brands, some of the greatest stories, and we continue to deepen our strategic relationships with all of them. I mean, this is great momentum. It's incredible momentum and growth across all of our key industries and all of our key markets. 
And I will say again, as Marc did, I am very, very proud of the entire company for all of these accomplishments. All our outstanding results are just proof positive that our strategy is absolutely more than taking hold. I'd also like to thank our customers and our partners because they are helping us set the standard for this industry. 
So with that, I'll hand it over to Mark Hawkins."

For the full year, we increased our non-GA",558,"Thanks, Keith. We had an incredible financial quarter, so let me start off with some highlights. 
In addition to the operating cash flow results Marc mentioned, we continue to drive increased operating leverage. For the full year, we increased our non-GAAP operating margin by 177 basis points. This is a great result as we continue to grow our top line. Our year-over-year growth was balanced across all of our clouds and all of our regions: Sales Cloud accelerated in the quarter with 12% growth; Service Cloud grew 35%; Marketing Cloud grew 31%; and App Cloud and others grew 43%. 
In the regions, EMEA grew 32%, and APAC continues to accelerate at 26% growth, both in constant currency. 
We also got off to a great start in Q4, and that early quarter strength translated into strong billings and collections in the quarter and helped drive our cash flow in Q4. It also helped us drive our top line performance in Q4. And when you exclude the FX effect of $32 million, revenue was up 27% in constant currency. 
Supporting this great top line growth was our decline in attrition rate, which remains below 9%. Our deferred revenue in the quarter reached an all-time high of $4.3 billion. This was up 31% in constant currency when excluding an FX effect of $48 million. We also continued to drive an increase in annual billings in the quarter, with 88% of all our subscription and support-related invoices issued with annual terms. This benefited year-over-year deferred revenue growth in the quarter by approximately 3 percentage points. 
Moving on to guidance. Coming off a strong Q4 and with our proven business model, we are raising our FY '17 revenue guidance to $8.12 billion, at the high end of the range. And we're also initiating FY '17 non-GAAP EPS guidance of $0.99 to $1.01. In context, we expect to deliver 125 to 150 basis points of non-GAAP operating margin improvement in FY '17. And this is just coming off a year where we exceeded the high end of our FY '16 operating margin guidance. As a result of this, we continue margin expansion. We expect to drive another full year of strong operating cash flow, with year-over-year growth of 23% to 24%. For Q1, we're expecting revenue of $1.885 billion to $1.895 billion, non-GAAP EPS of $0.23 to $0.24 and year-over-year deferred revenue growth of 24% to 25%. 
A quick note on our Q1 guide. As all of you know, FY '17 is a leap year. And given we recognize our revenue on a daily basis, there's an extra day of subscription revenue in the first quarter. This will benefit our first quarter revenue by approximately $20 million, and will drive a slightly higher non-GAAP EPS and will reduce our deferred revenue by the corresponding amount. This is simply a timing item that has no impact on the full FY '17 fiscal year results, but this will have an impact on your quarterly and full year compares in FY '18. 
To close, we had an outstanding quarter and year, and we are well on -- well positioned for yet another great year in FY '17. And at this time, I'd like to add my thanks to the entire Salesforce team for these great results. 
With that, I'd like to open up the call for questions."

And when that full portfolio accelerates, that is they all come in, in the quarter, which we really never expect every product and every geography and both enterprise and SMB to come in. Then you get this kind of accelerated revenue growth, which is what you see is this 27% number on both the year and the quarter. And it's, as I said in my opening remarks, this is the best quarter we've ever seen. We would never expect to see every product group and every geography and every sector of our business exceed our expectations. But that's what we saw in the fourth quarter, and that creates this phenomenal momentum that we have now. And look at that number on and off the balance sheet, $11 billion; there's no greater predictor of our future success than this deferred revenue that we now have in place."

Just building on Marc's comments, I think you'd asked a little bit about the seasonality in FY '17, starting with Q1. Back at our Analyst Day Keith is referring to, we looked at this compounding effect; and more and more of our renewals and business happening and then showing up in Q4, showing up in the impact in DR; and then having a quarter-on-quarter effect throughout the year. That compounding effect, in fact, is happening. We see that, and I affirm that. And you can see it's just a terrific Q4 result and a terrific DR performance. On the macro side, to Marc's point, when you have $11 billion of booked and billed and unbilled deferred revenue that gives you a lot of confidence. When you see our big deals coming in, like Keith referenced, it gives you the confidence. When you see the business performing across geos, across clouds, that gives you the confidence that our book of business and what we're hearing from the customer, it basically caused us to raise our guidance. And that's what we're seeing. Now we read the same newspapers as everybody else. We're not seeing a economic impact. We're seeing customers doing the kinds of things that were talked about earlier in the call. So hopefully, that helps."

If I were to characterize these 2 transactions in particular, I would tell you that they are CEO-level sales. We are in the boardroom and find ourselves in a position where customers, as Marc had indicated earlier, are looking for our help to bring them into the age of the customer. They are looking to embrace the concept and notion of digital transformation. They view us as the market leader and, really, the only company that is uniquely positioned to provide them with that transformation -- with that level of transformation. And this is what is happening in these very large deals. It's happening in every deal, where these customers are viewing us as a trusted adviser. And that is becoming the norm.

Of course, analytics applications have been an incredible part of the CRM market for a long time. And there are many vendors who offer analytics applications on our platform. When we first introduced our Wave capability, which was just a little over a year ago, we didn't introduce applications, we introduced a platform. We introduced the ability to build analytics applications using our Wave platform. And we said that this strategy was going to be quite differentiated from others because we were going to be platform first. We were going to build an ecosystem, and then we would later build these applications, and then we would later build all of these capabilities from the platform into all of our products and into all of our ISP capabilities as well. And that's where we are today. I think that there isn't a customer or a demonstration or a new sale that's happening where this analytics capability is not a huge part of what we offer the customer. This is analytics as a service. This is scalability. This runs on your phone, on your tablet; this runs on your desktop; this runs on your watch. This is a multitenant, fully scalable system. It has all the characteristics of every other Salesforce product that you know and love. It's deeply integrated into our core platform, which is Lightning. And Wave is amazing. The growth is terrific. We're going to, I believe, start to see an incredible breakout this fiscal year that we're starting now. And we're just finishing our fiscal year kickoff the last 2 days here in San Francisco. And Wave was a huge part of the emphasis of what we're going to do this year. So you're going to see a lot of that product. We're very excited about its capabilities. It's an incredible platform. And I will tell -- I'll tip my hand here, that we have been demonstrating internally here a number of core Wave applications, including our new Sales Wave capability, which is our sales application built on Wave; Service Wave, service capabilities; marketing Wave, marketing capabilities. And even Mark Hawkins here has built a full set of applications that help him run his entire financial business. And so it's a -- it's an exciting new product, and we're -- we couldn't be more excited to be in the analytics business."

And we have delivered the most modern, most incredible application development and deployment platform, I believe, in the enterprise today, which is Lightning. And you heard Accenture talk about on our February 2 launch how it's accelerating their own ability to build applications not only internally but for their customers using our Lightning platform because there's nothing else like it. Companies in the software industry have kind of doubled down and bounced back and focused on building apps and kind of getting their apps to be kind of sexier and looking better on all these new devices. And that's a huge mistake because what these software companies should be focused on is building platforms that can deliver these apps. And that's what Salesforce has done. We've delivered this incredible Lightning platform. I mean, it is amazing what it can do. I mean, you even saw on the February 2 launch, we delivered our Lightning platform running on Microsoft Continuum before Microsoft has been able to deliver their own applications running on Microsoft Continuum because of the kind of flexibility and capabilities of Lightning. And also, I would point out, that's our strategy, as to my comment with Heather on Wave. That is we have this incredible platform with our -- with Wave to build these analytics apps. And I think you know that we have the most -- the #1 platform on Amazon Web Services for building applications there called Heroku. And between Heroku, between Wave, between Lightning and other capabilities that we have, this really give developers a fast, easy and very low-cost way to build and deploy enterprise apps. And I would probably give you this great example of this company called SteelBrick, who came with a lot of momentum out of our Dreamforce conference, with this incredible application that they had built using Lightning. And they ended up in my office in November, and it was awesome. And I'm like, ""How did you build this?"" And they're like, ""Well, this is what -- we just build all of this on Lightning."" I mean, I saw this app was running. It's my dream of this incredible app running on the watch, on the phone, on the tablet and everything and making salespeople more productive and more successful and customer service professionals more successful and more productive. And I'm saying, ""How did you build it?"" And they're going, ""Lightning, Lightning, Lightning."" And I'm like, ""Wow."" And I -- of course, I liked it so much I bought the company. And I think that -- and I hope that I get to buy more Lightning companies. Because, within 30 days, I've already fully integrated that into my product, launched a new product, Sales Cloud Lightning, which includes the SteelBrick CPQ capability. And in addition to that, I've got a fully expanded and extended capabilities across my whole product line. So I hope there's more Lightning ISVs that are teeing up to come into our family because, I mean, this is like auto integration. Once they get onto our Lightning platform and then our ability to distribute that through this multi-thousand person distribution organization, with all this momentum, is really an awesome thing. So it is all about the platform. It's a key differentiator for us. Of course, we've got a great company. That a key differentiator for us. Of course, we have our ecosystem. That's a key differentiator for us. And it's also about this robust platform. That's a key differentiator for us, and that's how we're winning all these deals. I think you've kind of figured out our secret sauce."

So this time, we can hear you loud and clear. So thanks for the question. So first of all, just on EMEA, I mean, one of our growth strategies is an international expansion, and that is certainly proving out in terms of the numbers. And that takes many forms: it's customer facing; it's support resources; it's our data centers; it's all those sort of things that have really expanded our footprint internationally. And certainly, in EMEA, that has paid out very, very well for us. Let me just give you an example of 2 customers with incredible, unsolicited CEO-level remarks at the World Economic Forum. We have entered into a relationship that we've talked about on this call before, with ABB. And at the World Economic Forum, often there are many sessions where the CEOs of these companies will host a transformational meeting that talks a little bit with other CEOs about what they're doing, what they see in the industry; and certainly, ABB was doing that. And at the end of the meeting, the CEO of ABB stood up unsolicited and said, ""Listen, I'm completely transforming the way that I sell and service to my customers and engage with them because I've chosen Salesforce as my trusted partner."" And that, of course, is a very significant company in Europe. Schneider Electric is another. The CEO of Schneider Electric was on a panel with Marc talking about digital transformation. Unsolicited comment about how Schneider Electric is transforming its service model because of the capabilities of Salesforce. So we have some of the most incredible global companies in the world, who happen to be headquartered in EMEA, who are actually evangelizing our message in the marketplace around transformation and connecting to customers in entirely new ways. So when you see market leaders coming out there and at the CEO level and evangelizing our story, that certainly sends a great message to other companies, whether they're in that industry or not. So again, those are 2 proof points on EMEA. On the line of business question in terms of budgets, look, IT organizations always have budgets. They typically range between 1% and 2% of the company revenues. But what we've been able to tap into beyond those budgets are the line of business executives' budgets and also, as we've discussed on this call, the CEO agenda. It's an amazing phenomenon when you see the CEO, who has a growth priority, realign the budgets in a corporation to take on these growth initiatives. And that's what we're seeing. So it goes well beyond IT. Certainly, IT budgets are a particular component. But when the priority of a company is all about growth, you find the money to make that happen. You find the money to make those investments, and that's what we're seeing in the marketplace."

But to kind of build on your point, there is one other thing that we're trying to make sure that everyone sees and to call out, so I appreciate your question there, and that's regarding leap year. And it seems like a simple enough point, but when you take a look at our revenue and you divide it up by day, and when there's 1 extra day, that has the effect of having $20 million of extra revenue recognition in Q1 even though it all washes out in the year, right? But when you have 1 extra day of revenue, it means you have 1 less day of deferred revenue, effectively, and so that's the other thing that you take a look at. So if you take a look at the compounding effect, and you adjust for the leap year, which washes all out in the year but not in the quarter, I think you'll see just a kind of an appropriate pattern there for a guide, okay?"

Some of these SIs are kind of prima donnas, who have held on to the past too long, and it's affected their growth rates and their ability to work with customers and, in some cases, dislodged them from strategic customer situations because they were not able to move fast enough to understand these customers' needs and got displaced by Accenture. And we're seeing that en masse. And it's a -- for sure, it's a shot across the bow of the SI community that they better go faster or there's going to be a broad shakeup in regards to the transformations that are happening underway, in regards to these next-generation implementations, specifically those regarding Salesforce and our product line.

So first and foremost, I think we all recognize that these SIs, many of them, certainly, the upper tier of the SIs are very strategic influencers and in the boardroom, and at the CEO level and speaking transformation to these line of business executives. Part of our strategy has been to really strengthen these relationships over time because we know that they bring expertise and access. And they can also drive, most importantly, the customer's success. The observation I would give you is that the most successful SIs are the ones who are very focused on Salesforce and the ones who actually run their business on Salesforce. Marc has just given that as an example. And we are establishing what I would call a 360-degree relationship with these SIs. So we go to market with these SIs. They run their business on Salesforce. And in the case of Accenture, they're actually building products. They've become an ISV. And those are the strategic sort of relationships that we're trying to build here, and we've been very, very successful. And the ones who get it are growing. I had a conversation last week with a CEO of a pretty major consulting organization who was lamenting about their lack of growth, generally speaking. And my comment to this person was, quite candidly, you're not focused enough on Salesforce. Because if you were focused on Salesforce, your business would be growing. And I got this look of acknowledgment, and it's absolutely true. The success stories in these consulting practices is about their Salesforce practices. So they've been a big part of our growth strategy. They're starting to -- virtually all the large ones are running their business on Salesforce. They've made their commitments, and they're a big part of our future and our ecosystem strategy."

And we've talked a lot about that on the call already, that is we have a radically different technology model than the technology model that has been in place at Oracle or SAP or even Microsoft. We have -- which is our multitenancy system, both on our metadata model. We have a radically different customer model, which is a model built on customer success. And we have a radically different philanthropic model that we've talked about, which is our focus on 1% of our equity, our profit and our employees' time go into our Salesforce.org. So we, of course, have done about 1.3 million hours of community service. I believe we'll do even more community service this year than Microsoft, which is a company 10x our size, because we're just very committed to volunteerism. We run over 25,000 nonprofits and NGOs for free, which has been a gift of over $250 million in services to the nonprofit community. And we've given away over $100 million in grants as well. I think also, we're out there fighting for equality where we can. You saw that with our focus on equal pay for women. We were just at the White House speaking about that, adjustments that we've made to our own financials so that we can pay women the same that we pay men here at Salesforce. You saw us fight in Indiana against discrimination of our employees. And we're looking squarely at what's going on in Georgia with the House Bill 757, which means that we may have to reduce our investments in the state of Georgia based on what we're seeing with the state government there as well. And I hope that they see the light the way that the state of Indiana did. And in addition, I think that you see Salesforce trying to create a culture and an environment where we reflect what we think the future of the world is: a world where there needs to be more equality; a world where there needs to be more focus on sustainability; and where there needs to be a world focused on companies that are becoming platforms for change and that the business of business is improving the state of the world. Those are the things that are really important to us. I think also you've probably noticed that we opened up this call saying thank you. It's really important to us that we have a sense of gratitude when we address our employees and our customers and our partners. That's a huge part of our culture. And at the end of the day, it's deeply a part of customer success as well, that is because of our business model, we're only successful if our customers are successful. So these are the things that I think that are actually somewhat different than when we were at Oracle: the narrative there and the actions; the behavior was rewarded differently; the things that we were encouraged to do and compensated for; and what we told our employees to do and what we were directed to do is different than what we do at Salesforce. And I hope that we can be an example of a benevolent company that does well and does good."

And I -- we got some great people here for the call. We've got Keith Block here, our new Chief Operating Officer. Really excited to have Keith here. We have Mark Hawk",852,"Well, thanks, John, and really excited to be here, really excited for the first quarter. And I -- we got some great people here for the call. We've got Keith Block here, our new Chief Operating Officer. Really excited to have Keith here. We have Mark Hawkins here, our Chief Financial Officer. And well, you've all seen the press release. We just had an awesome Q1. It's the best Q1 we've ever seen. There are some incredible numbers that you're going to see, including the cash flow number. 
Revenue for the first quarter, as you saw, grew nearly to $2 billion. That was up 20% in constant currency. That the was just above our expectations. Deferred revenue also grew to more than $4 billion, up 32% in constant currency. That was also above our expectations to see deferred revenue grow with the 3 in front of it is its size and scale.
So our [indiscernible] business on and off the balance sheet at $11.6 billion, up 28% from a year ago. We improved our non-GAAP operating margin, which Mark is going to talk about. And [indiscernible] $1 [ph] billion in operating cash flow as I mentioned, but that's 43% from a year ago. It's pretty great.
I'm also thrilled to announce the raising full year revenue guidance and $80 million raising the guidance. We feel really excited about that $8.2 billion, the high end of our range. And our turnout puts us on a clear path. We all can that. We're going to realize very shortly our $10 billion dream.
We're well positioned for another great year. This is amazing. I think that one of the reasons that we are doing so well is because Oracle and SAP are doing so poorly in the cloud. They've just have not been able to make that transformation that we've made that other companies have made, and we discontinued to take market share from them and gain customers at a record levels. And you can see that their growth numbers are nothing like we're putting up here as we deliver our first quarter. And it's happening because Salesforce is really the only company totally focused on companies helping to connect with their customers in a whole new way. We're in the midst of a massive generational shift, new generation of customers and consumers is clearly emerging. We've been calling them here at Salesforce C generation customers. Customer generation, consumer generation, these are people who want it now, they want it fast, they want it easy in their mobile, their social, they're always on. And our customers are working to connect with the C generation in new ways, very exciting. I mean, this is really part of a huge shift that's happening in computing. We've gone from the first generation of computing, which was very much about systems of for record to the second generation, which was systems of engagement. We talked about that on these calls many times over the last 10 years, and we are clearly moving into this incredible world. It's a system of intelligence that's all yielding these incredible systems of customers or C generation customers that our customers are connecting to. And that's what we're so excited about.
I know you want to hear more about the shifts that are going on. Well, I encourage you to come to our World Tour event in London tomorrow. We will have 15,000 people in person, bigger than most companies user circumferences. For us, it's an just another visit to a great city in the world. And the next week, we're going to be in New York, the World Tour in New York, which is already sold out. So we'll be excited to see you there. And in San Francisco on June 7 and 8, we're going to be hosting Trailer Head VX, which is our new brand-new developer conference. It also I believe has already sold out, but it's going to be an amazing event. We're going to have plenty of opportunities to watch it online. Hard to find venues around the world that host these large events. Trailhead VX, you're going to see the next generation of software's, Salesforce's software development capability, including our new lightning systems, component-based development as well as the ability to go one-on-one journeys with customers and a huge focus, a huge focus VX on how to rapidly and easily they'll mobile applications and really excited to visit with all the Salesforce customers, developers, who are coming to Trailhead VX.
Okay. Well, finally, let me tell you, we've got Dreamforce coming October 4, the 7th [ph]. Got 2 [ph] details. I know the bands that are playing and I was going on I'm not going to give you too much of that yet I can just tell you it's going to be the biggest and most exciting Dreamforce ever. And it's going to be also just a great year, and Keith here has been a huge part in making such a great year. I think we're getting ready to celebrate your third anniversary at Salesforce.

I think as you heard from Marc, we had an extremely fast start to the year. And that is terrific onto itself, but it is on the heels of a fantastic Q4. So we saw great execution across the board. We fine tuned our go-to-market approach. We've aligned our operations to bring our resources closer to our customers because at the end of the day, it's all about driving success for those customers.
And all these investments that we've made over the last 3 years, the innovation at our industries, building out our partner ecosystem, expanding internationally, all this is really paying off in our results. So we began fiscal 2017 with a record number of large transactions more than any other first quarter in our history as a company.
The value of these large transactions across our cloud continues to increase. We've built on our tremendous momentum from Q4. And in fact, we closed yet again another 9-figure transaction in the first quarter, so we're very, very proud of that. 
All this was too positive to scale and depth of relationships that we are building and continue to build with our customers worldwide everywhere, all shapes and sizes, geographies, industries. An example, in Q1, we signed a significant and strategic agreement with Amazon. We are now the company-wide customer platform in this is a huge expansion of our relationship with them and we plan to use more Amazon services in the future.
Uber, one of the world's great innovative companies, another expansion in the quarter. They're an incredible innovator with off-the-charts growth. They selected Salesforce to be their global Customer Success Platform, so they can build one-to-one journeys at scale for millions of Uber riders worldwide. This is one of the most innovative companies as I said, and they are driving their innovation by leveraging our Customer Success Platform.
Samsung. Another great brand, decided to standardize their B2B business on salesforce in Q1, so they can engage with their customers anytime from any place and run their businesses right from the galaxy phones.
Another great brand is New York Life. They have selected Salesforce to power their digital transformation, and they are planning to mobilize their field agents with Salesforce and enhance the service they deliver to their customers.
In Europe, one of the world's leaders in pioneers in robotics decided to go wall to wall with Salesforce to advance their digital transformation of their business. Now Marc alluded to this, but this is a strategic partnership where we completely replaced SAP with every cloud in our portfolio to drive the customer success with our product suite. So not only are we their Customer Success Platform, but Salesforce will be their IoT platform connecting all the robotic devices to open up new services and apps and create new experiences for the customers. There are many, many more examples. I mean, everyone of these companies are turning to Salesforce as their trusted advisers to redefine their customer strategies and take their businesses into the future. And we're delivering this level of customer success at scale and across the entire portfolio.
I want to thank our customers for their continued trust, the commitment and always, their inspiration; and our partner ecosystem, which is second to none for their ongoing investment in our customer success; and last but not the least, I want to thank everybody at Salesforce for again another outstanding performance in the quarter.
So I'd like to hand this over to Mark to talk a little bit more about our financial execution in the quarter. Mark?"

As you heard, we had a great start to the fiscal year with very strong results across-the-board. Our total revenue was up 28% in constant currency when you exclude the year-over-year FX headwind of $20 million.
Sequentially, we saw $4 million FX headwind. Sales start accelerated in the quarter with a 15% year-over-year growth; [indiscernible], 32%, Marketing Cloud were 29%, cap cloud and other grew 45%.
In the region, EMEA gerw 33% and APAC continued to accelerate at 29% growth, both on a constant currency basis year-over-year. Saw our attrition for the first quarter remained below 9%. While we continue to deliver outstanding top line performance, we also continued to improve our bottom line as well. In the quarter, we delivered 283 basis points of year-over-year noncapital operating margin improvement, our eighth consecutive quarter of expansion. This helped drive record operating cash flow this quarter as we delivered more than $1 billion of operating cash flow, up 43% over last year. I'm very pleased with these outstanding results. Our first $1 billion cash flow quarter, very exciting.
These outstanding results reflect the continued compounding of our employees in Q4 and to a lesser extent, the early adoption of ASC 2016 '09 [ph], which benefited operating cash flow by approximately $25 million in Q1.
Deferred revenue ended the quarter at more than $4 million [ph]. This was up 32% in constant currency when excluding our year-over-year FX headwind of $10 million. Sequentially, deferred revenue had an FX tailwind of $51 million. We also continued to drive an increase in annual billings in the quarter, with 79% of all subscription and support-related invoices issued with annual terms. This benefited year-over-year deferred revenue growth by approximately 1 percentage point.
Moving on to guidance. With our strong start in Q1, we are raising our FY '17 revenue guidance to $8.16 billion to $8.2 billion. We're also raising our FY '17 non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance to $1 to $1.02. We now expect year-over-year operating cash flow growth of 25% to 26%. For Q2, we are expecting revenues of $2.005 billion to $2.015 billion, non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.24 to $0.25 and a year-over-year deferred revenue growth of 26% to 28%.
To close, we had an outstanding quarter and we're off to a great start for FY '17. I'd like to thank the entire Salesforce team for these great results.
With that, I'd like to open up the call for questions."

You probably know we completely rebuilt our core platform of Salesforce, which we now call Lightning, and we have rebuilt how the Sales Cloud is manifested to our customers, especially in regards to mobile technologies. You can see that as you go on the app store and download our Salesforce1 app, which is now millions of users, millions are using that to access Salesforce. Two, we've also created some amazing new capabilities for the Sales Cloud, probably the most popular is our car dot capability which is part of the Sales Cloud, very exciting accelerator for us as well as SteelBrick.

I mean, we are ranked as the leader and in so many other court analysis by these independent analysts agencies, they have marked to our platform as the leverage. And I'll tell you why that is, because there is a whole segment of developer population that we are speaking to who want to rapidly build and deploy applications, especially, and I said this in the previous answer, in the mobile environment. And only Salesforce, only Salesforce has rapidly build and expand and trade these applications using Lightning and deploy them on all these different devices. And for those of the we have tried it was seen the traffic around it on social networks like Twitter and others know we have had a huge home run in regards to Lightning. We have our customer's imagination. For those of you who attended the February 2 event with the same regions, you heard Accenture, who is deploying this technology not just for its customers but internally to tens of thousands of users almost 100,000 users, and how they have accelerated their application developing capability internally but any to Lightning. And so that is what is driving the power. We've rebooted our core platform, and you're seeing that reflected in our Sales Cloud and our Service Cloud coming our platform, in our community, in our core applications that are running currently on that Lightning platform. That's been a huge growth driver. And I believe that because Lightning is so unique and so special in the industry that it lets our customers build these applications quickly at a very low cost and deploy them across so many different platforms that we're going to see a continued growth in these core clouds."

It's been an exciting moment because for the software industry and specifically in enterprise application, there's really been only 2 other companies that has really hit that kind of number. So I would say that we are already looking forward to blasting right through that and getting to the next level, and I'm excited that Salesforce doesn't show any signs of slowing down as a kind of get the these levels. We're moving rapidly in to a world that you talked about. Of course, many transformation in our industry, which is a world with the cloud of course Salesforcethese growth for many years [indiscernible] social that Salesforce script for many us and also mobility that's also currently driving Salesforce's growth. When I look at kind of them next major trend for Salesforce in our industry that will drive tremendous growth, it's got to be artificial intelligence. And as we look out into the future and we start to look at extreme improvements and advances in artificial intelligence whether it's machine learning, whether it's deep learning, whether it's machine intelligence itself come I think that those kind of capabilities appearing inside our application that is going to be a major growth capability going forward. And one other area that I think will advance is that we can bring this type of technology very much to everyone. And that -- that's going to be the power of Salesforce. That's certainly what we're doing with mobility today. That's what we will do in the I as we shift Salesforce to be an AI-first company. You can see the beginning of this and one of our most exciting new products of the quarter and also a part of the Sales Cloud growth for sure because it's in there, is not just Salesforce IQ, which you can get on the app store but also our new product Salesforce inbox. And salesforce inbox is very exciting because it uses artificial intelligence and machine intelligence to work with our users, to work with our e-mails, to work with their calendars and to work with their CRM data to give them prescriptive ideas on exactly how to be more efficient in the sales service and marketing processes of their companies. And when you look at technologies like Salesforce IQ and like Salesforce inbox, well -- and I'm sure you know those came out of an incredible acquisition we did approximately 2 years ago with IQ, which was a world-class team that we were able to pick up that's based in Palo Alto. And then you can see the this is another in sales, it will appear and service kind will appear in marketing where you saw actually last week if you attended our Connections Conference, you saw our new Predictive Journeys capability and this kind of predictive capability that appeared in our Marketing Cloud that was driven out of our new Salesforce IQ services. You also see it, of course, in communities. You see it in our platform. You're going to see it in mobility. You're going to see it in our analytics. Of course, at the core. This is a very powerful next-generation technology. So Heather, when I look forward, what I see is an AI first world and for every customer going to be able to get a whole generation of productivity out of artificial intelligence machine learning and deep learning. 
Yes, so Heather, you want to add to that?"

Look, large deals are certainly an indication of how deep these relationships are becoming with these customers, but they're not the only indication. I mean, certainly, in Q4, we had 2 of the largest 9-figure deals that we've had in the history of the company. In Q1, we signed up again a very strategic long-term relationship, but our business is based on a balanced portfolio across all market segments, whether it's SMB or midmarket or the enterprise space beginner's a lot of room there. So there's an expectation from our customers to play a more significant role across-the-board and certainly the enterprise. In fact, Marc and I met with a couple of CEOs yesterday. they were talking to us about how they bring their companies into kind of this age of the customer and drive through the transformation, and that's becoming a regular dialogue. But this is what the mind share the market share gain, and we strive for balance in our execution and a balance in our portfolio of business and customers. Again, from top to bottom, SMB all the way up to the enterprise. So we've got great momentum. We expect that to continue and I think we've got a terrific playbook with an incredible portfolio of products that satisfy our customer's need."

We did a very significant and very large transaction with Amazon and Jeff and I had a great meeting of the minds of the future of the cloud, I think that it's a great relationship and partnership for us. We want to continue to grow that an expand that strategically. We are definitely exploring ways the we can use AWS more aggressively with Salesforce. Of course, we know that we run one of the largest application developing capabilities in the world on AWS, which is Heroku. We also are building our new IoT cloud on AWS. We also introduced new capabilities to our Marketing Cloud last week on AWS, and we have a lot of research development, capabilities in AWS. When you look at Amazon today, there is no public cloud that is more sophisticated, more well used by enterprises and one that has more robust capabilities than Amazon. They have done a spectacular job in defining this kind of Infrastructure as a Service market. They, of course dominated. I think you know they're doing themselves more than $10 billion a year in it, and we're very happy to be so tightly aligned with Amazon and AWS. In regards to kind of the future capabilities that you're going to see with other parts of Salesforce, well as we head towards developer conference and as you head towards Dreamforce, I think you'll continue to see more announcements between Salesforce and Amazon and you'll see our partnership and strategic alliance with them continue to grow and develop. And Jeff and I have a lot of very exciting ideas on what the next steps are. Okay, would you take the next question?"

They look to kind of Jeff Moore's commentary on what is the next wave or whatever and they move to that next product. For us, we're not -- we have that. Of course. We have multiple successful multibillion-dollar products in a company. Everybody knows that. So we have not given up on sales side because there is so much more than we can do. And you saw that this quarter in that we have rebuilt this quarter with Lightning so that it works better on mobility. We have Salesforce1, which now has millions of users on it. I use it every day. It's never been faster and easier. The level of acuity with Salesforce when his phenomenal. We have SteelBrick, which our customers love this kind of CPQ kind of capability to be able to do quotes and orders and all this incredible new stuff that SteelBrick does that's built natively in our Lightning platform. We have Salesforce IQ, which is an artificial intelligence front end, machine learning front-end to Sales Cloud, which is incredible. We have Sales Cloud -- we have Salesforce inbox, which is an e-mail front-end of Sales Cloud that's incredible. And we have many, many other things coming, many that you'll see at Trailhead VX, many more you're going to see at Dreamforce. We have not abandoned Sales Cloud. We have doubled. We have tripled down on Sales Cloud. And because of that, we've accelerated our growth rate and it's exciting. Our vision for Sales Cloud have not yet been fully realized. I mean, we know that there is, not just a cloud -- there's not just this incredible cloud vision for Sales Cloud, not just incredible social vision, you all know it's built on this incredible engagement platform built on our Chatter core and then extended into Salesforce1. Of course, it has incredible mobility. The best of an enterprise application in the world with more mobile users on it than any other application that I'm aware off. And we are now introducing this new AI wrapper that you can see that artificial intelligence is becoming part of Sales Cloud. You can see that already and Salesforce IQ, Salesforce inbox you can see that in Predictive Journeys, you're going to start to see that more aggressively. And because we are innovating so aggressively on Sales Cloud, you are going to continue to see great results. Because what customer does not want we need this ability to grow that top line? And that's what Sales Cloud is giving them in tough environment. And by the way, all those same things that I just mentioned work with Service Cloud. They work with our platform. They work with our community. We all have 1 very solid core platform that has extended to this work that we are doing. So I'm never been more jazzed about the capabilities of the company and what our developers are doing, what our integrators are doing. I mean, it's so exciting."

But the third thing I would say is when you look at all the innovation Marc's talking about and you look at market share and you've probably seen the Gartner data that just came out, again, we took market share, again in Sales Cloud. But even more importantly, we took market share at the CRM level, #1 again, took 150 basis points and our key competitors are falling behind and actually losing market share. And so that's exciting, too. But this is a continuing trend, and it's not just 1 acceleration quarter to do."

Obviously, we've made investments with data centers in Europe, which we're very, very excited about. Our customers are to be excited about that. We're just responding to our customers in that regard. But we've also invested more in terms of customer-facing assets internationally because our customers want to engage with us more deeply. They want those more strategic relationships. So we're just seeing the results of the us investment that we've made over the last 2 [ph] years. As far as kind of the market trends, there's a lot of legacy on-premise providers out there quite frankly. They're still trying to figure out if and how they can possibly transition to the cloud, which is very difficult. A lot of companies will claim that they are cloud company. But the reality is being a cloud company is about technology, it is about a business model and it's about a culture of driving customer success. And these companies that have had poor results or software results, they represent the past and they do not have these 3 pillars that really, the foundation for Salesforce 17 years ago. And that's why we continue to drive success to our customers. We see great results in the marketplace. We are taking share, quite frankly these other companies are losing share as we gain shares, so we're creating separation with them in the market. And we have the right vision.

Now for all of them, they are kind of competing to grow to be the fastest grower with an Salesforce's ecosystem, because all of our customers want service capabilities because Salesforce itself provides actually only strategic services. We don't really provide these kind of core implementation services. So these large players have acquired many of the key parts of our ecosystem, and you just saw that with IBM. They just bought [indiscernible] they just [indiscernible] there as a company but they all made strategic bets on and they are trying to acquire our ecosystem as fast as possible. We're continuing to invest in these companies and in this ecosystem companies. We want to start more companies that provide service capabilities, regionally in the United States, in Europe, in Japan, in Australia coming other places in the world. And these companies grow up and they get acquired by these large companies, that's a great model for us. Of course, our venture firm has made a incredible return on that strategy over the last 10 years. Now on top of that, I will tell you that I don't think that there is a strategic systems integrator who isn't making massive investments in Salesforce right now. And a lot of that has been led by Keith. I'm going to turn it over to him. He's really given us a partner focus [indiscernible] happy for him. Keith, can you kind of tell us how you doubled down on that and now you provided such great leadership are in the systems integrators?"

And Marc mentioned a lot of the large and significant players. I mean, these are firms that have deep relationships in the boardroom, companies of all shapes and sizes all over the world. I mean, Deloitte has rebranded to Deloitte Digital. And really when you look at the centerpiece of everything that Deloitte brings to the table in terms of digital transformation, it starts with Salesforce. They've done a terrific job there. I just -- last week, I addressed the Global Partners Forum at Accenture in Munich and talked about digital transformation in how Accenture and Salesforce are doing so well together. Just to give you an example of Accenture. We just don't ever go-to-market relationship with them, which is terrific and they can continue to build their practice. They're also a very large customer, so they are leveraging the Lightning platform. They're rolling it out very aggressively. They're getting all the benefits of it, and they are building products on top of our platform. So with a beautiful 360-degree relationship with Accenture, they really served as a model for all of these great systems integrators. I'm going to be with Cap Gemini next week to explore how we accelerate going to market with Cap Gemini. We collaborate with them very regularly about how to drive the market together. I was with the Vice Chairman of PWC a couple of weeks ago talking about our growth strategies together. And our job is really to work very closely with these very trusted advisers to listen to them, to help feed and our ecosystem because is this a huge part of our strategy."

Are enterprise is just more willing to engage with SaaS and specifically Salesforce? There are some of the processes that you came in.

And we've been able to gain incredible market share and momentum starting with Marc's vision for cloud computing 17 years ago. So we've been able to capitalize on that, so that's kind of point number one. Point number two is we find ourselves in a world where this convergence of cloud and mobile and social and data science and IoT all coming together, and we kind of lit the match again with Marc's vision 17 years ago and we've been able to reinforce that vision by driving success to our customers. And then over the last -- the third point is over the last 3 years, and successful as the company has always been, we have put a particular emphasis on the enterprise and a focus on expansion in our international markets become and trusted advisers be speaking the language of the customer and the industries and building out our ecosystem kind of how I answered the question about our SI partners before. So all of these things come together. We have built the last, that's been part of the strategy from 17 years back.

We've got Keith Block here, our new Chief Operating Officer. Really excited to have Keith here. We have Mark Hawkins here, our Chief Financial Officer.
And well, you've all seen the press release. We just had an awesome Q1. It's the best Q1 we've ever seen. There are some incredible numbers that you're going to see, including the cash flow number. Revenue for the first quarter, as you saw, grew nearly to $2 billion. That was up 28% in constant currency. That was just above our expectations. Deferred revenue also grew to more than $4 billion, up 32% in constant currency. That was also above our expectations, to see deferred revenue grow with a 3 in front of it at this size and scale.
Dollar value of booked business, on and off the balance sheet at $11.6 billion, up 28% from a year ago. We improved our non-GAAP operating margin, which Mark is going to talk about. And it drove $1 billion in operating cash flow, as I mentioned, but that's 43% from a year ago. It's pretty great.
I'm also thrilled to announce we're raising full year revenue guidance and $80 million raise in the guidance. We feel really excited about that, $8.2 billion at the high end of our range. And our turnout puts us on a clear path. We all can see now that we're going to realize very shortly our $10 billion dream.
We're well positioned for another great year. This is amazing. I think that one of the reasons that we are doing so well is because Oracle and SAP are doing so poorly in the cloud. They just have not been able to make that transformation that we've made, that other companies have made. And we just continue to take market share from them and gain customers at record levels. And you can see that their growth numbers are nothing like we're putting up here as we deliver our first quarter. And it's happening because Salesforce is really the only company totally focused on companies helping to connect with their customers in a whole new way.
We're in the midst of a massive generational shift. A new generation of customers and consumers is clearly emerging. We've been calling them here at Salesforce C-generation customers. Customer generation, consumer generation, these are people who want it now. They want it fast. They want it easy. And they're mobile. They're social. They're always on. And our customers are working to connect with the C-generation in new ways, very exciting.
I mean, this is really part of a huge shift that's happening in computing. We've gone from the first generation of computing, which was very much about systems of record, to the second generation, which was systems of engagement. We talked about that on these calls many times over the last 10 years, and we are clearly moving into this incredible world. It's a system of intelligence that's all yielding these incredible systems of customers or C-generation customers that our customers are connecting to. And that's what we're so excited about.
I know you all want to hear more about those shifts that are going on. Well, I encourage you to come to our World Tour event in London tomorrow. We will have 15,000 people in person, bigger than most companies' user conferences. For us, it's just another visit to a great city in the world. And then next week, we're going to be in New York for a World Tour in New York, which is already sold out. So we'll be excited to see you there.
And in San Francisco on June 7 and 8, we're going to be hosting TrailheaDX, which is our new brand-new developer conference. It also, I believe, has already sold out, but it's going to be an amazing event. We're going to have plenty of opportunities to watch it online. Hard to find venues around the world to host these large events. TrailheaDX, you're going to see the next generation of software's -- Salesforce's software development capability, including our new Lightning systems, component-based development as well as the ability to build one-on-one journeys with customers and a huge focus, a huge focus at TrailheaDX on how to rapidly and easily build mobile applications and really excited to visit with all the Salesforce customers, developers who are coming to TrailheaDX.
Okay. Well, finally, let me tell you, we've got Dreamforce coming on October 4 to 7. I've seen the details. I know the bands that are playing. I know what's going on. I'm not going to give you too much of that yet. I can just tell you it's going to be the biggest and most exciting Dreamforce ever. And it's going to be also just a great year.
And Keith, you're a huge part in making this such a great year. I think we're getting ready to celebrate your third anniversary at Salesforce. Is that right?"

I think as you heard from Marc, we had an extremely fast start to the year. And that is terrific onto itself, but it is on the heels of a fantastic Q4. So we saw great execution across the board. We fine-tuned our go-to-market approach. We've aligned our operations to bring our resources closer to our customers because at the end of the day, it's all about driving success for those customers.
And all these investments that we've made over the last 3 years, the innovation in our industries, building out our partner ecosystem, expanding internationally, all this is really paying off in our results. So we began fiscal 2017 with a record number of large transactions, more than any other first quarter in our history as a company. The value of these large transactions across our clouds continues to increase. We've built on our tremendous momentum from Q4. And in fact, we closed yet again another 9-figure transaction in the first quarter. So we're very, very proud of that. 
All this was due to positive [ph] scale and depth of relationships that we are building and continue to build with our customers worldwide, everywhere, all shapes and sizes, geographies, industries. An example, in Q1, we signed a significant and strategic agreement with Amazon. We are now the company-wide customer platform, and this is a huge expansion of our relationship with them. And we plan to use more Amazon services in the future.
Uber, one of the world's great innovative companies, another expansion in the quarter. They're an incredible innovator with off-the-chart growth. They selected Salesforce to be their global Customer Success Platform so they can build one-to-one journeys at scale for millions of Uber riders worldwide. This is one of the most innovative companies, as I said, and they are driving their innovation by leveraging our Customer Success Platform.
Samsung. Another great brand, decided to standardize their B2B business on Salesforce in Q1 so they can engage with their customers anytime from any place and run their businesses right from their Galaxy phones.
Another great brand is New York Life. They have selected Salesforce to power their digital transformation, and they are planning to mobilize their field agents with Salesforce and enhance the service they deliver to their customers.
In Europe, one of the world's leaders and pioneers in robotics, decided to go wall to wall with Salesforce to advance the digital transformation of their business. Now Marc alluded to this, but this is a strategic partnership where we completely replaced SAP with every cloud in our portfolio to drive the customer success with our product suite. So not only are we their Customer Success Platform, but Salesforce will be their IoT platform, connecting all the robotic devices to open up new services and apps and create new experiences for their customers.
There are many, many more examples. And in every one of these, these companies are turning to Salesforce as their trusted advisers to redefine their customer strategies and take their businesses into the future. And we are delivering this level of customer success at scale and across the entire portfolio.
I want to thank our customers for their continued trust, their commitment and always, their inspiration; and our partner ecosystem, which is second to none for their ongoing investment in our customer success; and last but not least, I want to thank everybody at Salesforce for again another outstanding performance in the quarter.
So I'd like to hand this over to Mark to talk a little bit more about our financial execution in the quarter. Mark?"

As you've heard, we had a great start to the fiscal year with very strong results across-the-board. Our total revenue was up 28% in constant currency when you exclude the year-over-year FX headwind of $20 million. Sequentially, we saw a $4 million FX headwind.
Sales Cloud accelerated in the quarter with a 15% year-over-year growth. Service Cloud grew 32%. Marketing Cloud grew 29%. App Cloud and Other grew 45%.
In the region, EMEA grew 33% and APAC continued to accelerate at 29% growth, both on a constant currency basis year-over-year. Dollar attrition for the first quarter remained below 9%.
While we continue to deliver this outstanding top line performance, we also continued to improve our bottom line as well. In the quarter, we delivered 283 basis points of year-over-year non-GAAP operating margin improvement, our eighth consecutive quarter of expansion. This helped drive record operating cash flow this quarter as we delivered more than $1 billion of operating cash flow, up 43% over last year. I'm very pleased with these outstanding results, our first $1 billion cash flow quarter, very exciting. These outstanding results reflect the continued compounding of our invoicing in Q4 and to a lesser extent the early adoption of ASU 2016-09, which benefited operating cash flow by approximately $25 million in Q1.
Deferred revenue ended the quarter at more than $4 billion. This was up 32% in constant currency when excluding a year-over-year FX headwind of $10 million. Sequentially, deferred revenue had an FX tailwind of $51 million. We also continue to drive an increase in annual billings in the quarter, with 79% of all subscription and support-related invoices issued with annual terms. This benefited year-over-year deferred revenue growth by approximately 1 percentage point.
Moving on to guidance. With our strong start in Q1, we are raising our FY '17 revenue guidance to $8.16 billion to $8.2 billion. We are also raising our FY '17 non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance to $1 to $1.02. We now expect year-over-year operating cash flow growth of 25% to 26%. For Q2, we are expecting revenues of $2.005 billion to $2.015 billion, non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.24 to $0.25 and a year-over-year deferred revenue growth of 26% to 28%.
To close, we had an outstanding quarter, and we're off to a great start for FY '17. I'd like to thank the entire Salesforce team for these great results.
With that, I'd like to open up the call for questions."

I mean, we are ranked as the leader. And in so many other course analysis by these independent analyst agencies, they have marked our platform as the leader. And I'll tell you why that is, because there is a whole segment of developer population that we are speaking to who want to rapidly build and deploy applications, especially, and I said this in the previous answer, in the mobile environment. And only Salesforce, only Salesforce has let you rapidly build and expand and create these applications using Lightning and deploy them on all these different devices. And for those of you who have tried it or seen the traffic around it on social networks like Twitter and others know, we have hit a huge home run in regards to Lightning. And we have our customers' imagination. For those of you who attended the February 2 event with the -- at the St. Regis, you heard Accenture, who is deploying this technology not just for its customers but internally to tens of thousands of users, almost 100,000 users, and how they have accelerated their application development capability internally by turning to Lightning. And so that is what is driving the power. We've rebooted our core platform, and you're seeing that reflected in our Sales Cloud, in our Service Cloud, in our platform, in our community, in our core applications that are running currently on that Lightning platform. That's been a huge growth driver. And I believe that because Lightning is so unique and so special in the industry that it lets our customers build these applications quickly at a very low cost and deploy them across so many different platforms, that we're going to see continued growth in these core clouds."

And this has been a refocus point for us to continue to innovate and accelerate innovation around Sales Cloud, and you see that in the results. And we've leveraged that great innovation and that base to drive vertical specialization. As you know, we announced and made for GA available the Financial Services Cloud and the Health Cloud in Q1, and we had several customers sign up in the quarter. So we're starting to get a lot of momentum. So we've been talking about it for a while. Part of our industry strategy has been around messaging and then releasing these first vertical products focused on the financial services industry and the health care industry and life sciences industry. And again, you do that with amazing technology with Force. You do that with amazing technology leveraging the underlying cloud and you add industry specialization to it, and that's why we're getting to see these results and this reacceleration."

And so what happens is the first year gets billed, and that will show up in our deferred revenue and then ratably recognized over time. But the multiyear aspect of that does not show up in our DR. It shows up in our unbilled DR. And what's amazing about that is when you put our billed and unbilled book of business together, you have $11.6 billion now growing at 27% year-on-year. So you're picking up some of that really, really good business that's going to show up. It hasn't been billed yet but it will over time. Great question, Kash."

And I know that you have created and keep a comprehensive financial model on Salesforce and have for a number of years as well as many of the financial analysts on the call. And I'm sure that all of you can figure out exactly -- or approximately based on our deferred revenue numbers and adjusting your models around when you think we're going to have $10 billion. That is an exciting moment. It's an exciting moment because for the software industry and specifically in enterprise application, there's really only been 2 other companies that have really hit that kind of number. So I would say that we are already looking forward to blasting right through that and getting to the next level, and I'm excited that Salesforce doesn't show any signs of slowing down as we kind of get to these levels. We're moving rapidly into a world that we've talked about. Of course, many transformations in our industry, which is a world with the cloud that drove Salesforce's growth for many years, a world with social that drove Salesforce's growth for many years and also mobility. And that's also currently driving Salesforce's growth. When I look at kind of the next major trend for Salesforce and our industry that will drive tremendous growth, it's got to be artificial intelligence. And as we look out into the future and we start to look at extreme improvements and advances in artificial intelligence, whether it's machine learning, whether it's deep learning, whether it's machine intelligence itself, I think that those kind of capabilities appearing inside our application, that is going to be a major growth capability going forward. And one other area that I think will advance that is that we can bring this type of new technology very much to everyone. And that's going to be the power of Salesforce. That's certainly what we're doing with mobility today. That's what we will do in AI as we shift Salesforce to be an AI-first company. You can see the beginning of this. And one of our most exciting new products of the quarter and also a part of the Sales Cloud growth for sure because it's in there is not just SalesforceIQ, which you can get on the App Store, but also our new product Salesforce Inbox. And Salesforce Inbox is very exciting because it uses artificial intelligence and machine intelligence to work with our users, to work with their e-mails, to work with their calendars and to work with their CRM data to give them prescriptive ideas on exactly how to be more efficient in the sales, service and marketing processes of their companies. And when you look at technologies like SalesforceIQ and like Salesforce Inbox, well -- and I'm sure you know those came out of an incredible acquisition we did approximately 2 years ago, RelateIQ, which was just a world-class team that we were able to pick up that's based in Palo Alto, well, then you can see that this is another major growth factor because it will appear in sales, it will appear in service, it will appear in marketing. Well, you saw it actually last week. If you attended our Connections conference, you saw our new Predictive Journeys capability. And this kind of predictive capability that appeared in our Marketing Cloud, that was driven out of our new SalesforceIQ services. You also see it, of course, in Communities. You see it in our Platform. You're going to see it in mobility. You're going to see it in our analytics, of course, at the core. This is a very powerful next-generation technology. So Heather, when I look forward, what I see is an AI-first world, and for every customer, going to be able to get a whole another generation of productivity out of artificial intelligence, machine learning and deep learning. Keith, do you want to add to that?"

Look, large deals are certainly an indication of how deep these relationships are becoming with these customers, but they're not the only indication. I mean, certainly in Q4, we had 2 of the largest 9-figure deals that we've had in the history of the company. And in Q1, we signed up again another very strategic long-term relationship. But our business is based on a balanced portfolio across all market segments, whether it's SMB or midmarket or the enterprise space. And there is a lot of room there. So there is an expectation from our customers to play a more significant role across-the-board and certainly in the enterprise. In fact, Marc and I met with a couple of CEOs yesterday who were talking to us about how they bring their companies into kind of this age of the customer and drive digital transformation. And that's becoming a regular dialogue. But this is both a mind share and a market share gain, and we strive for balance in our execution and a balance in our portfolio of business and customers. Again, from top to bottom, SMB all the way up to enterprise. So we've got great momentum. We expect that to continue.

And Jeff Bezos and I have a great meeting of the minds of the future of the cloud. I think that it's been a great relationship and partnership for us. We want to continue to grow that and expand that strategically. We are definitely exploring ways that we can use AWS more aggressively with Salesforce. Of course, you know that we run one of the largest application development capabilities in the world on AWS, which is Heroku. We also are building our new IoT Cloud on AWS. We also introduced new capabilities for our Marketing Cloud last week on AWS, and we have a lot of research development capabilities in AWS. When you look at Amazon today, there is no public cloud that is more sophisticated, more well used by enterprises and one that has more robust capabilities than Amazon. They have done a spectacular job in defining this kind of Infrastructure-as-a-Service market. They, of course, dominated. I think you know they're doing themselves more than $10 billion a year in it, and we're very happy to be so tightly aligned with Amazon and AWS. In regards to kind of future capabilities that you're going to see with other parts of Salesforce, well as we head towards our Developer Conference and as you head towards Dreamforce, I think you'll continue to see more announcements between Salesforce and Amazon.

But we have not given up on sales side because there is so much more that we can do.

It's never been faster and easier. The level of acuity with Salesforce when is phenomenal. We have SteelBrick, which our customers love this kind of CPQ kind of capability to be able to do quotes and orders and all this incredible new stuff that SteelBrick does for us that's built natively in our Lightning platform. We have SalesforceIQ, which is an artificial intelligence front end, machine learning front end to Sales Cloud, which is incredible. We have Sales Cloud -- we have Salesforce Inbox, which is an e-mail front end of the Sales Cloud that's incredible. And we have many, many other things coming, many that you'll see at TrailheaDX, many more you're going to see at Dreamforce. We have not abandoned Sales Cloud. We have doubled. We have tripled down on Sales Cloud. And because of that, we've accelerated our growth rate and it's exciting. And our visions for Sales Cloud have not yet been fully realized. I mean, we know that there is not just a cloud -- there's not just this incredible cloud vision for Sales Cloud, not just incredible social vision, you all know it's built on this incredible engagement platform built on our Chatter core and then extended into Salesforce1. Of course, it has incredible mobility, the best of any enterprise application in the world with more mobile users on it than any other application that I'm aware of. And we are now introducing this new AI wrapper that you can see that artificial intelligence is becoming part of Sales Cloud. You can see that already in SalesforceIQ, Salesforce Inbox. You can see that in Predictive Journeys. You're going to start to see that more aggressively. And because we are innovating so aggressively on Sales Cloud, you are going to continue to see great results because what customer does not want or need this ability to grow their top line? And that's what Sales Cloud is giving them in this tough environment. And by the way, all those same things that I just mentioned work with Service Cloud, they work with our Platform, they work with our Community.

So let me just start with the international market since it was the second part of the question. This has been a big focus area for us over the last 3 years as part of our -- 1 of the 3 growth levers, again, expanding our partner ecosystems, speaking the language of industries and focusing our resources internationally. Obviously, we've made investments with data centers in Europe, which we're very, very excited about. Our customers are obviously excited about that. We're just responding to our customers in that regard. But we've also invested more in terms of customer-facing assets internationally because our customers want to engage with us more deeply. They want those more strategic relationships. So we're just seeing the results of this investment that we've made over the last 3 years. As far as kind of the market trends, there's a lot of legacy on-premise providers out there, quite frankly, that are still trying to figure out if and how they can possibly transition to the cloud, which is very difficult. A lot of companies will claim that they are a cloud company. But the reality is being a cloud company is about technology. It is about a business model, and it's about a culture of driving customer success. And these companies that have had poor results or soft results, they represent the past and they do not have these 3 pillars that really were the foundation for Salesforce 17 years ago. And that's why we continue to drive success to our customers. We see great results in the marketplace. We are taking share. Quite frankly, these other companies are losing share as we gain share. So we're creating separation with them in the market. And we have the right vision. We have the right story. We have the right products. We have the right execution. We have great partners, and we have great customers. And that's why you're seeing these results."

In recent months, we have seen a lot of evidence of the major consulting firms such as Accenture and Deloitte and PWC moving pretty aggressively to build out their Salesforce practices.

And we've seen them converging their services with apps from multiple of your app exchange partners, and they're kind of wrapping that around Salesforce. And it seems to be resulting in part in this growth trajectory that you've got.

Well, this is a great question, and I'm going to go to Keith pretty quickly on this. But you saw it in my February 2 presentation where we highlighted Accenture, and we've also now toured them around the world. You've seen the videos on YouTube between Salesforce and Accenture. If you haven't, it's a great opportunity, go and check that out as well as the demos. You've heard from their CIO, from their CEO, from their President. Salesforce is their fastest and most strategic growing practice. And it is their transformation practice. It is their key cloud practice. You also see that with some of the other major SIs as well. I'm especially proud of our work with Deloitte. I'm especially proud of our work with Capgemini. And you know from the fourth quarter, PwC was just an awesome, awesome relationship that is emerging. And we are delighted with that as well. All of these players have our full attention. Now for all of them, they are kind of competing to grow to be the fastest grower with Salesforce's ecosystem because all of our customers want service capabilities because Salesforce itself provides actually only strategic services. We don't really provide these kind of core implementation services. So these large players have acquired many of the key parts of our ecosystem, and you just saw that with IBM. They just bought Bluewolf. And they are an interesting [ph] company, but they've all made strategic bets on and they are trying to acquire our ecosystem as fast as possible. We're continuing to invest in these companies, into these ecosystem companies. We want to start more companies that provide service capabilities regionally, in the United States, in Europe, in Japan, in Australia, in other places in the world. And these companies grow up and they get acquired by these large companies. That's a great model for us. Of course, our venture firm has made an incredible return on that strategy over the last 10 years. Now on top of that, I will tell you that I don't think that there is a strategic systems integrator who isn't making massive investments in Salesforce right now. And a lot of that has been led by Keith. I'm going to turn it over to him. He's really given us a partner focus like we did have before. Keith, can you kind of tell us how you doubled down on that and how you provided such great leadership around the systems integrators?"

And Marc mentioned a lot of the large and significant players. I mean, these are firms that have deep relationships in the boardroom, companies of all shapes and sizes all over the world. I mean, Deloitte has rebranded to Deloitte Digital. And really when you look at the centerpiece of everything that Deloitte brings to the table in terms of digital transformation, it starts with Salesforce. They've done a terrific job there. I just -- last week, I addressed the Global Partners Forum at Accenture in Munich and talked about digital transformation and how Accenture and Salesforce are doing so well together. And just to give you an example of Accenture, we just don't have a go-to-market relationship with them, which is terrific, and they can continue to build their practice. They're also a very large customer of ours. So they are leveraging the Lightning platform. They're rolling it out very aggressively. They're getting all the benefits of it, and they are building products on top of our platform. So with a beautiful 360-degree relationship with Accenture, that has really served as a model for all of these great systems integrators. I'm going to be with Capgemini next week to explore how we accelerate going to market with Capgemini. We collaborate with them very regularly about how to drive the market together. I was with the Vice Chairman of PwC a couple of weeks ago, talking about our growth strategies together. And our job is really to work very closely with these very trusted advisers to listen to them, to help feed and drive the ecosystem because this is just a huge part of our strategy."

Are enterprises just more willing to engage with SaaS vendors and specifically Salesforce? Or have some of the processes, when you came in, Marc said it's your third year anniversary coming up, you obviously made some changes and put some things in place.

And we've been able to gain incredible market share and momentum starting with Marc's vision for cloud computing 17 years ago. So we've been able to capitalize on that. So that's kind of point number one. Point number two is that we find ourselves in a world where there's this convergence of cloud and mobile and social and data science and IoT all coming together, and we kind of lit the match again with Marc's vision 17 years ago. And we've been able to reinforce that vision by driving success for our customers. And then over the last -- the third point is over the last 3 years, as successful as the company has always been, we have put a particular emphasis on the enterprise and a focus on expansion in our international markets, becoming trusted advisers by speaking the language of the customer around the industries and building out our ecosystem, kind of how I answered the question about our SI partners before. So all of these things are coming together. We have built to last. That's been part of the strategy from 17 years back.

We've got Keith Block here, our new Chief Operating Officer. Really excited to have Keith here. We have Mark Hawkins here, our Chief Financial Officer.
And well, you've all seen the press release. We just had an awesome Q1. It's the best Q1 we've ever seen. There are some incredible numbers that you're going to see, including the cash flow number. Revenue for the first quarter, as you saw, grew nearly to $2 billion. That was up 28% in constant currency. That was just above our expectations. Deferred revenue also grew to more than $4 billion, up 32% in constant currency. That was also above our expectations, to see deferred revenue grow with a 3 in front of it at this size and scale.
Dollar value of booked business, on and off the balance sheet at $11.6 billion, up 28% from a year ago. We improved our non-GAAP operating margin, which Mark is going to talk about. And it drove $1 billion in operating cash flow, as I mentioned, but that's 43% from a year ago. It's pretty great.
I'm also thrilled to announce we're raising full year revenue guidance and $80 million raise in the guidance. We feel really excited about that, $8.2 billion at the high end of our range. And our turnout puts us on a clear path. We all can see now that we're going to realize very shortly our $10 billion dream.
We're well positioned for another great year. This is amazing. I think that one of the reasons that we are doing so well is because Oracle and SAP are doing so poorly in the cloud. They just have not been able to make that transformation that we've made, that other companies have made. And we just continue to take market share from them and gain customers at record levels. And you can see that their growth numbers are nothing like we're putting up here as we deliver our first quarter. And it's happening because Salesforce is really the only company totally focused on companies helping to connect with their customers in a whole new way.
We're in the midst of a massive generational shift. A new generation of customers and consumers is clearly emerging. We've been calling them here at Salesforce C-generation customers. Customer generation, consumer generation, these are people who want it now. They want it fast. They want it easy. And they're mobile. They're social. They're always on. And our customers are working to connect with the C-generation in new ways, very exciting.
I mean, this is really part of a huge shift that's happening in computing. We've gone from the first generation of computing, which was very much about systems of record, to the second generation, which was systems of engagement. We talked about that on these calls many times over the last 10 years, and we are clearly moving into this incredible world. It's a system of intelligence that's all yielding these incredible systems of customers or C-generation customers that our customers are connecting to. And that's what we're so excited about.
I know you all want to hear more about those shifts that are going on. Well, I encourage you to come to our World Tour event in London tomorrow. We will have 15,000 people in person, bigger than most companies' user conferences. For us, it's just another visit to a great city in the world. And then next week, we're going to be in New York for a World Tour in New York, which is already sold out. So we'll be excited to see you there.
And in San Francisco on June 7 and 8, we're going to be hosting TrailheaDX, which is our new brand-new developer conference. It also, I believe, has already sold out, but it's going to be an amazing event. We're going to have plenty of opportunities to watch it online. Hard to find venues around the world to host these large events. TrailheaDX, you're going to see the next generation of software's -- Salesforce's software development capability, including our new Lightning systems, component-based development as well as the ability to build one-on-one journeys with customers and a huge focus, a huge focus at TrailheaDX on how to rapidly and easily build mobile applications, and really excited to visit with all the Salesforce customers, developers who are coming to TrailheaDX.
Okay. Well, finally, let me tell you, we've got Dreamforce coming on October 4 to 7. I've seen the details. I know the bands that are playing. I know what's going on. I'm not going to give you too much of that yet. I can just tell you it's going to be the biggest and most exciting Dreamforce ever. And it's going to be also just a great year.
And Keith, you're a huge part in making this such a great year. I think we're getting ready to celebrate your third anniversary at Salesforce. Is that right?"

I think as you heard from Marc, we had an extremely fast start to the year. And that is terrific unto itself, but it is on the heels of a fantastic Q4. So we saw great execution across the board. We fine-tuned our go-to-market approach. We've aligned our operations to bring our resources closer to our customers because at the end of the day, it's all about driving success for those customers.
And all these investments that we've made over the last 3 years, the innovation in our industries, building out our partner ecosystem, expanding internationally, all this is really paying off in our results. So we began fiscal 2017 with a record number of large transactions, more than any other first quarter in our history as a company. The value of these large transactions across our clouds continues to increase. We have built on our tremendous momentum from Q4. And in fact, we closed yet again another 9-figure transaction in the first quarter. So we're very, very proud of that. 
All this was proof positive that the scale and depth of relationships that we are building and continue to build with our customers worldwide, everywhere, all shapes and sizes, geographies, industries. An example, in Q1, we signed a significant and strategic agreement with Amazon. We are now their company-wide customer platform, and this is a huge expansion of our relationship with them. And we plan to use more Amazon services in the future.
Uber, one of the world's great innovative companies, another expansion in the quarter. They're an incredible innovator with off-the-chart growth. They selected Salesforce to be their global Customer Success Platform so they can build one-to-one journeys at scale for millions of Uber riders worldwide. This is one of the most innovative companies, as I said, and they are driving their innovation by leveraging our Customer Success Platform.
Samsung. Another great brand, decided to standardize their B2B business on Salesforce in Q1 so they can engage with their customers anytime from any place and run their businesses right from their Galaxy phones.
Another great brand is New York Life. They have selected Salesforce to power their digital transformation, and they are planning to mobilize their field agents with Salesforce and enhance the service they deliver to their customers.
In Europe, one of the world's leaders and pioneers in robotics decided to go wall to wall with Salesforce to advance the digital transformation of their business. Now Marc alluded to this, but this is a strategic partnership where we completely replaced SAP with every cloud in our portfolio to drive their customers' success with our product suite. So not only are we their Customer Success Platform, but Salesforce will be their IoT platform, connecting all the robotic devices to open up new services and apps and create new experiences for their customers.
There are many, many more examples. And in every one of these, these companies are turning to Salesforce as their trusted advisers to redefine their customer strategies and take their businesses into the future. And we are delivering this level of customer success at scale and across the entire portfolio.
I want to thank our customers for their continued trust, their commitment and always, their inspiration; and our partner ecosystem, which is second to none for their ongoing investment in our customers' success; and last but not least, I want to thank everybody at Salesforce for again another outstanding performance in the quarter.
So I'd like to hand this over to Mark to talk a little bit more about our financial execution in the quarter. Mark?"

As you've heard, we had a great start to the fiscal year with very strong results across-the-board. Our total revenue was up 28% in constant currency when you exclude the year-over-year FX headwind of $20 million. Sequentially, we saw a $4 million FX headwind.
Sales Cloud accelerated in the quarter with a 15% year-over-year growth. Service Cloud grew 32%. Marketing Cloud grew 29%. App Cloud and Other grew 45%.
In the region, EMEA grew 33% and APAC continued to accelerate at 29% growth, both on a constant currency basis year-over-year. Dollar attrition for the first quarter remained below 9%.
While we continue to deliver this outstanding top line performance, we also continued to improve our bottom line as well. In the quarter, we delivered 283 basis points of year-over-year non-GAAP operating margin improvement, our eighth consecutive quarter of expansion. This helped drive record operating cash flow this quarter as we delivered more than $1 billion of operating cash flow, up 43% over last year. I'm very pleased with these outstanding results, our first $1 billion cash flow quarter, very exciting. These outstanding results reflect the continued compounding of our invoicing in Q4 and to a lesser extent the early adoption of ASU 2016-09, which benefited operating cash flow by approximately $25 million in Q1.
Deferred revenue ended the quarter at more than $4 billion. This was up 32% in constant currency when excluding a year-over-year FX headwind of $10 million. Sequentially, deferred revenue had an FX tailwind of $51 million. We also continue to drive an increase in annual billings in the quarter, with 79% of all subscription and support-related invoices issued with annual terms. This benefited year-over-year deferred revenue growth by approximately 1 percentage point.
Moving on to guidance. With our strong start in Q1, we are raising our FY '17 revenue guidance to $8.16 billion to $8.2 billion. We are also raising our FY '17 non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance to $1 to $1.02. We now expect year-over-year operating cash flow growth of 25% to 26%. For Q2, we are expecting revenues of $2.005 billion to $2.015 billion, non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.24 to $0.25 and a year-over-year deferred revenue growth of 26% to 28%.
To close, we had an outstanding quarter, and we're off to a great start for FY '17. I'd like to thank the entire Salesforce team for these great results.
With that, I'd like to open up the call for questions."

The revenue number's incredible and the growth rate is also incredible. And the areas where the Sales Cloud has really accelerated are, number  one, we've done a huge amount of innovation with the Sales Cloud starting with Lightning. You probably know we've completely rebuilt our core platform of Salesforce, which we now call Lightning, and we have rebuilt how the Sales Cloud is manifested to our customers, especially in regards to mobile technologies. You can see that if you go on the App Store and download our Salesforce1 app, which is now millions of users, millions are using that to access Salesforce. Two, we've also created some amazing new capabilities for the Sales Cloud. Probably the most popular is our Pardot capability, which is a part of the Sales Cloud, very exciting accelerator for us as well as SteelBrick. And these things and others really have let us to kind of what I would say almost reboot the Sales Cloud, recreate the Sales Cloud, re-energize it. And this kind of accelerated revenue growth forward is something that we're very, very excited about."

I mean, we are ranked as the leader. And in so many other course analysis by these independent analyst agencies, they have marked our platform as the leader. And I'll tell you why that is, because there is a whole segment of the developer population that we are speaking to who want to rapidly build and deploy applications, especially, and I said this in the previous answer, in the mobile environment. And only Salesforce -- only Salesforce has let you rapidly build and expand and create these applications using Lightning and deploy them on all these different devices. And for those of you who have tried it or seen the traffic around it on social networks like Twitter and others know, we have hit a huge home run in regards to Lightning. And we have our customers' imagination. For those of you who attended the February 2 event with the -- at the St. Regis, you heard Accenture, who is deploying this technology not just for its customers but internally to tens of thousands of users, almost 100,000 users, and how they have accelerated their application development capability internally by turning to Lightning. And so that is what is driving the power. We've rebooted our core platform, and you're seeing that reflected in our Sales Cloud, in our Service Cloud, in our platform, in our community, in our core applications that are running currently on that Lightning platform. That's been a huge growth driver. And I believe that because Lightning is so unique and so special in the industry that it lets our customers build these applications quickly at a very low cost and deploy them across so many different platforms, that we're going to see continued growth in these core clouds."

And we've leveraged that great innovation and that base to drive vertical specialization. As you know, we announced and made for GA available the Financial Services Cloud and the Health Cloud in Q1, and we had several customers sign up in the quarter. So we're starting to get a lot of momentum. So we've been talking about it for a while. Part of our industry strategy has been around messaging and then releasing these first vertical products focused on the financial services industry and the health care industry and life sciences industry.

And so what happens is the first year gets billed, and that will show up in our deferred revenue and then ratably recognized over time. But the multiyear aspect of that does not show up in our DR. It shows up in our unbilled DR. And what's amazing about that is when you put our billed and unbilled book of business together, you have $11.6 billion now growing at 27% year-on-year.

And I know that you have created and keep a comprehensive financial model in Salesforce and have for a number of years as well as many of the financial analysts on the call. And I'm sure that all of you can figure out exactly -- or approximately based on our deferred revenue numbers and adjusting your models around when you think we're going to have $10 billion. That is an exciting moment. It's an exciting moment because for the software industry and specifically in enterprise applications, there's really only been 2 other companies that have really hit that kind of number. So I would say that we are already looking forward to blasting right through that and getting to the next level, and I'm excited that Salesforce doesn't show any signs of slowing down as we kind of get to these levels. We're moving rapidly into a world that we've talked about. Of course, many transformations in our industry, which is a world with the cloud that drove Salesforce's growth for many years, a world with social that drove Salesforce's growth for many years and also mobility. And that's also currently driving Salesforce's growth. When I look at kind of the next major trend for Salesforce and our industry that will drive tremendous growth, it's got to be artificial intelligence. And as we look out into the future and we start to look at extreme improvements and advances in artificial intelligence, whether it's machine learning, whether it's deep learning, whether it's machine intelligence itself, I think that those kind of capabilities appearing inside our application, that is going to be a major growth capability going forward. And one other area that I think will advance that is that we can bring this type of new technology very much to everyone. And that's going to be the power of Salesforce. That's certainly what we're doing with mobility today. That's what we will do in AI as we shift Salesforce to be an AI-first company. You can see the beginning of this in one of our most exciting new products of the quarter and also a part of the Sales Cloud growth for sure because it's in there is not just SalesforceIQ, which you can get on the App Store, but also our new product, Salesforce Inbox. And Salesforce Inbox is very exciting because it uses artificial intelligence and machine intelligence to work with our users, to work with their e-mails, to work with their calendars and to work with their CRM data to give them prescriptive ideas on exactly how to be more efficient in the sales, service and marketing processes of their companies. And when you look at technologies like SalesforceIQ and like Salesforce Inbox, well -- and I'm sure you know those came out of an incredible acquisition we did approximately 2 years ago, RelateIQ, which was just a world-class team that we were able to pick up that's based in Palo Alto, well, then you can see that this is another major growth factor because it will appear in sales, it will appear in service, it will appear in marketing. We saw it actually last week. If you attended our Connections conference, you saw our new Predictive Journeys capability. And this kind of predictive capability that appeared in our Marketing Cloud, that was driven out of our new SalesforceIQ services. You also see it, of course, in Communities. You see it in our Platform. You're going to see it in mobility. You're going to see it in our analytics, of course, at the core. This is a very powerful next-generation technology. So Heather, when I look forward, what I see is an AI-first world, and for every customer, going to be able to get a whole another generation of productivity out of artificial intelligence, machine learning and deep learning. Keith, do you want to add to that?"

Look, large deals are certainly an indication of how deep these relationships are becoming with these customers, but they're not the only indication. I mean, certainly in Q4, we had 2 of the largest 9-figure deals that we've had in the history of the company. And in Q1, we signed up again another very strategic long-term relationship. But our business is based on a balanced portfolio across all market segments, whether it's SMB or midmarket or the enterprise space. And there is a lot of room there. So there is an expectation from our customers to play a more significant role across-the-board and certainly in the enterprise. In fact, Marc and I met with a couple of CEOs yesterday who were talking to us about how they bring their companies into kind of this age of the customer and drive digital transformation. And that's becoming a regular dialogue. But this is both a mind share and a market share gain, and we strive for balance in our execution and a balance in our portfolio of business and customers. Again, from top to bottom, SMB all the way up to enterprise. So we've got great momentum. We expect that to continue.

They're a huge user of Salesforce, and that certainly has been a huge part of this quarter as well. We did a very significant and very large transaction with Amazon. And Jeff Bezos and I have a great meeting of the minds of the future of the cloud. I think that it's been a great relationship and partnership for us. We want to continue to grow that and expand that strategically. We are definitely exploring ways that we can use AWS more aggressively with Salesforce. Of course, you know that we run one of the largest application development capabilities in the world on AWS, which is Heroku. We also are building our new IoT Cloud on AWS. We also introduced new capabilities for our Marketing Cloud last week on AWS, and we have a lot of research development capabilities in AWS. When you look at Amazon today, there is no public cloud that is more sophisticated, more well used by enterprises and one that has more robust capabilities than Amazon. They have done a spectacular job in defining this kind of Infrastructure-as-a-Service market. They, of course, dominated. I think you know they're doing themselves more than $10 billion a year in it, and we're very happy to be so tightly aligned with Amazon and AWS. In regards to kind of the future capabilities that you're going to see with other parts of Salesforce, well as we head towards our Developer Conference and as you head towards Dreamforce, I think you'll continue to see more announcements between Salesforce and Amazon. And you'll see our partnership and strategic alliance with them continue to grow and develop. And Jeff and I have a lot of very exciting ideas on what the next steps are. Okay, Alexa [ph], would you take the next question?"

By the way, I use Wave, as we run a Fortune 500 company and absolutely love it. So I love the growth rate. I love the large deal penetration with it. I love the momentum. Keep in mind, it's version 1. But the thing I'd call out, and maybe Marc or Keith want to talk about this, but Bob Stutz, we're just super happy to have Bob here. He's thinking beyond version 1, and that's just really exciting for me. And that's the Wave comment from my standpoint.

They look another way, and they hope to kind of bring in the next horizon. They look to kind of Geoff Moore's commentary on what is the next wave or whatever, and then move to that next product. For us, we're not -- we have that, of course. We have multiple successful multibillion-dollar products in the company. Everybody knows that. But we have not given up on Sales Cloud because there is so much more that we can do. And you saw that this quarter in that we have rebuilt this core with Lightning so that it works better on mobility. We have Salesforce1, which now has millions of users on it. I use it every day. It's never been faster and easier. The level of acuity with Salesforce1 is phenomenal. We have SteelBrick, which our customers love this kind of CPQ kind of capability to be able to do quotes and orders and all this incredible new stuff that SteelBrick does for us that's built natively in our Lightning platform. We have SalesforceIQ, which is an artificial intelligence front end, machine learning front end to Sales Cloud, which is incredible. We have Sales Cloud -- we have Salesforce Inbox, which is an e-mail front end of the Sales Cloud that's incredible. And we have many, many other things coming, many that you'll see at TrailheaDX, many more you're going to see at Dreamforce. We have not abandoned Sales Cloud. We have doubled. We have tripled down on Sales Cloud. And because of that, we've accelerated our growth rate and it's exciting. And our visions for Sales Cloud have not yet been fully realized. I mean, we know that there is not just a cloud -- there's not just this incredible cloud vision for Sales Cloud, not just incredible social vision -- you all know it's built on this incredible engagement platform built on our Chatter core and then extended into Salesforce1. Of course, it has incredible mobility, the best of any enterprise application in the world with more mobile users on it than any other application that I'm aware of. And we are now introducing this new AI wrapper that you can see that artificial intelligence is becoming part of Sales Cloud. You can see that already in SalesforceIQ, Salesforce Inbox. You can see that in Predictive Journeys. You're going to start to see that more aggressively. And because we are innovating so aggressively on Sales Cloud, you are going to continue to see great results because what customer does not want or need this ability to grow their top line? And that's what Sales Cloud is giving them in this tough environment. And by the way, all those same things that I just mentioned work with Service Cloud, they work with our Platform, they work with our Community. We have one very solid core platform that has extended through this work that we're doing. So I've never been more jazzed about the capabilities in the company and what our developers are doing, what our innovators are doing. I mean, it's so exciting."

That's another point to be aware of. But the third thing I would say is when you look at all the innovation Marc's talking about and you look at market share and you've probably seen the Gartner data that just came out, again, we took market share again in Sales Cloud. But even more importantly, we took market share at the CRM level, #1 again, took 150 basis points. And our key competitors are falling behind and actually losing market share. And so that's exciting, too. But this is a continuing trend, and it's not just one acceleration quarter, Steve."

This has been a big focus area for us over the last 3 years as part of our -- 1 of the 3 growth levers, again, expanding our partner ecosystems, speaking the language of industries and focusing our resources internationally. Obviously, we've made investments with data centers in Europe, which we're very, very excited about. Our customers are obviously excited about that, and we're just responding to our customers in that regard. But we've also invested more in terms of customer-facing assets internationally because our customers want to engage with us more deeply. They want those more strategic relationships. So we're just seeing the results of this investment that we've made over the last 3 years. As far as kind of the market trends, there's a lot of legacy on-premise providers out there, quite frankly, that are still trying to figure out if and how they can possibly transition to the cloud, which is very difficult. A lot of companies will claim that they are a cloud company. But the reality is being a cloud company is about technology. It is about a business model, and it's about a culture of driving customer success. And these companies that have had poor results or soft results, they represent the past and they do not have these 3 pillars that really were the foundation for Salesforce 17 years ago. And that's why we continue to drive success to our customers. We see great results in the marketplace. We are taking share. Quite frankly, these other companies are losing share as we gain share. So we're creating separation with them in the market. And we have the right vision. We have the right story. We have the right products. We have the right execution. We have great partners, and we have great customers. And that's why you're seeing these results."

If you haven't, it's a great opportunity, go and check that out as well as the demos. You've heard from their CIO, from their CEO, from their President. Salesforce is their fastest and most strategic growing practice. And it is their transformation practice. It is their key cloud practice. You also see that with some of the other major SIs as well. I'm especially proud of our work with Deloitte. I'm especially proud of our work with Capgemini. And you know from the fourth quarter, PwC was just an awesome, awesome relationship that is emerging. And we are delighted with that as well. All of these players have our full attention. Now for all of them, they are kind of competing to grow to be the fastest grower with Salesforce's ecosystem because all of our customers want service capabilities because Salesforce itself provides actually only strategic services. We don't really provide these kind of core implementation services. So these large players have acquired many of the key parts of our ecosystem, and you just saw that with IBM. They just bought Bluewolf. And they are a -- company, but they've all made strategic bets on and they are trying to acquire our ecosystem as fast as possible. We're continuing to invest in these companies, into these ecosystem companies. We want to start more companies that provide service capabilities regionally, in the United States, in Europe, in Japan, in Australia and other places in the world. And these companies grow up and they get acquired by these large companies. That's a great model for us. Of course, our venture firm has made an incredible return on that strategy over the last 10 years. Now on top of that, I will tell you that I don't think that there is a strategic systems integrator who isn't making massive investments in Salesforce right now. And a lot of that has been led by Keith. I'm going to turn it over to him. He's really given us a partner focus like we did have before, and Keith, can you kind of tell us how you doubled down on that and how you provided such great leadership around the systems integrators?"

I mean, Deloitte has rebranded to Deloitte Digital. And really when you look at the centerpiece of everything that Deloitte brings to the table in terms of digital transformation, it starts with Salesforce. They've done a terrific job there. I just -- last week, I addressed the Global Partners Forum at Accenture in Munich and talked about digital transformation and how Accenture and Salesforce are doing so well together. And just to give you an example of Accenture, we just don't have a go-to-market relationship with them, which is terrific, and they can continue to build their practice. They're also a very large customer of ours. So they are leveraging the Lightning platform. They're rolling it out very aggressively. They're getting all the benefits of it, and they are building products on top of our platform. So we have a beautiful 360-degree relationship with Accenture, that has really served as a model for all of these great systems integrators. I'm going to be with Capgemini next week to explore how we accelerate going to market with Capgemini. We collaborate with them very regularly about how to drive the market together. I was with the Vice Chairman of PwC a couple of weeks ago, talking about our growth strategies together.

This has been 2 quarters -- I mean, Salesforce has been putting up numbers that are good numbers for a while. But these last few quarters look to us to be really strong, and strong primarily it looks anyway from the enterprise. I mean, the SMB seems to have been pretty consistent for quite some time. But something seems to have changed with the enterprise, the enterprise customers. So Keith, can you talk about what's driving this? What's happening? Are enterprises just more willing to engage with SaaS vendors and specifically Salesforce? Or have some of the processes -- I mean, you came in, Marc said it's your third year anniversary coming up, you obviously made some changes and put some things in place. Are they just starting to really sink in right now? And I guess how sustainable is this? We've seen it now for a couple of quarters."

Number one, this -- honestly, this has been 17 years in the making. I mean, this is an incredible company with incredible people, and an incredible set of core products and customers that I alluded to earlier. And we've been able to gain incredible market share and momentum starting with Marc's vision for cloud computing 17 years ago. So we've been able to capitalize on that. So that's kind of point number one. Point number two is that we find ourselves in a world where there's this convergence of cloud and mobile and social and data science and IoT all coming together, and we kind of lit the match again with Marc's vision 17 years ago. And we've been able to reinforce that vision by driving success for our customers. And then over the last -- the third point is over the last 3 years, as successful as the company has always been, we have put a particular emphasis on the enterprise and a focus on expansion in our international markets, becoming trusted advisers by speaking the language of the customer around the industries and building out our ecosystem, kind of how I answered the question about our SI partners before. So all of these things are coming together. We are built to last. That's been part of the strategy from 17 years back. And I think in the last 3 years, as I said, all these piece parts are just augmenting. But it's always been a great company with great products and great leadership and incredible employees and customers."

We do create demand. But there also is timing in the market, as I talked about earlier, between this convergence of cloud and mobile, social, data science and IoT all coming together. So customers are seeing the need because the market is ripe for disruption with all these technologies. Our platform is amazing. So we're able to deliver on that promise. And then we have built out this incredible ecosystem of ISVs who are building on our platform. And they are driving success for our customers by building unique solutions.

We've got Keith Block here, our new Chief Operating Officer. Really excited to have Keith here. We have Mark Hawkins here, our Chief Financial Officer.
And well, you've all seen the press release. We just had an awesome Q1. It's the best Q1 we've ever seen. There are some incredible numbers that you're going to see, including the cash flow number. Revenue for the first quarter, as you saw, grew nearly to $2 billion. That was up 28% in constant currency. That was just above our expectations. Deferred revenue also grew to more than $4 billion, up 32% in constant currency. That was also above our expectations, to see deferred revenue grow with a 3 in front of it at this size and scale.
Dollar value of booked business, on and off the balance sheet at $11.6 billion, up 28% from a year ago. We improved our non-GAAP operating margin, which Mark is going to talk about. And it drove $1 billion in operating cash flow, as I mentioned, but that's 43% from a year ago. It's pretty great.
I'm also thrilled to announce we're raising full year revenue guidance and $80 million raise in the guidance. We feel really excited about that, $8.2 billion at the high end of our range. And our turnout puts us on a clear path. We all can see now that we're going to realize very shortly our $10 billion dream.
We're well positioned for another great year. This is amazing. I think that one of the reasons that we are doing so well is because Oracle and SAP are doing so poorly in the cloud. They just have not been able to make that transformation that we've made, that other companies have made. And we just continue to take market share from them and gain customers at record levels. And you can see that their growth numbers are nothing like we're putting up here as we deliver our first quarter. And it's happening because Salesforce is really the only company totally focused on companies helping to connect with their customers in a whole new way.
We're in the midst of a massive generational shift. A new generation of customers and consumers is clearly emerging. We've been calling them here at Salesforce C-generation customers. Customer generation, consumer generation, these are people who want it now. They want it fast. They want it easy. And they're mobile. They're social. They're always on. And our customers are working to connect with the C-generation in new ways, very exciting.
I mean, this is really part of a huge shift that's happening in computing. We've gone from the first generation of computing, which was very much about systems of record, to the second generation, which was systems of engagement. We talked about that on these calls many times over the last 10 years, and we are clearly moving into this incredible world. It's a system of intelligence that's all yielding these incredible systems of customers or C-generation customers that our customers are connecting to. And that's what we're so excited about.
I know you all want to hear more about those shifts that are going on. Well, I encourage you to come to our World Tour event in London tomorrow. We will have 15,000 people in person, bigger than most companies' user conferences. For us, it's just another visit to a great city in the world. And then next week, we're going to be in New York for a World Tour in New York, which is already sold out. So we'll be excited to see you there.
And in San Francisco on June 7 and 8, we're going to be hosting TrailheaDX, which is our new brand-new developer conference. It also, I believe, has already sold out, but it's going to be an amazing event. We're going to have plenty of opportunities to watch it online. Hard to find venues around the world to host these large events. TrailheaDX, you're going to see the next generation of software's -- Salesforce's software development capability, including our new Lightning systems, component-based development as well as the ability to build one-on-one journeys with customers and a huge focus, a huge focus at TrailheaDX on how to rapidly and easily build mobile applications, and really excited to visit with all the Salesforce customers, developers who are coming to TrailheaDX.
Okay. Well, finally, let me tell you, we've got Dreamforce coming on October 4 to 7. I've seen the details. I know the bands that are playing. I know what's going on. I'm not going to give you too much of that yet. I can just tell you it's going to be the biggest and most exciting Dreamforce ever. And it's going to be also just a great year.
And Keith, you're a huge part in making this such a great year. I think we're getting ready to celebrate your third anniversary at Salesforce. Is that right?"

I think as you heard from Marc, we had an extremely fast start to the year. And that is terrific unto itself, but it is on the heels of a fantastic Q4. So we saw great execution across the board. We fine-tuned our go-to-market approach. We've aligned our operations to bring our resources closer to our customers because at the end of the day, it's all about driving success for those customers.
And all these investments that we've made over the last 3 years, the innovation in our industries, building out our partner ecosystem, expanding internationally, all this is really paying off in our results. So we began fiscal 2017 with a record number of large transactions, more than any other first quarter in our history as a company. The value of these large transactions across our clouds continues to increase. We have built on our tremendous momentum from Q4. And in fact, we closed yet again another 9-figure transaction in the first quarter. So we're very, very proud of that. 
All this was proof positive that the scale and depth of relationships that we are building and continue to build with our customers worldwide, everywhere, all shapes and sizes, geographies, industries. An example, in Q1, we signed a significant and strategic agreement with Amazon. We are now their company-wide customer platform, and this is a huge expansion of our relationship with them. And we plan to use more Amazon services in the future.
Uber, one of the world's great innovative companies, another expansion in the quarter. They're an incredible innovator with off-the-chart growth. They selected Salesforce to be their global Customer Success Platform so they can build one-to-one journeys at scale for millions of Uber riders worldwide. This is one of the most innovative companies, as I said, and they are driving their innovation by leveraging our Customer Success Platform.
Samsung. Another great brand, decided to standardize their B2B business on Salesforce in Q1 so they can engage with their customers anytime from any place and run their businesses right from their Galaxy phones.
Another great brand is New York Life. They have selected Salesforce to power their digital transformation, and they are planning to mobilize their field agents with Salesforce and enhance the service they deliver to their customers.
In Europe, one of the world's leaders and pioneers in robotics decided to go wall to wall with Salesforce to advance the digital transformation of their business. Now Marc alluded to this, but this is a strategic partnership where we completely replaced SAP with every cloud in our portfolio to drive their customers' success with our product suite. So not only are we their Customer Success Platform, but Salesforce will be their IoT platform, connecting all the robotic devices to open up new services and apps and create new experiences for their customers.
There are many, many more examples. And in every one of these, these companies are turning to Salesforce as their trusted advisers to redefine their customer strategies and take their businesses into the future. And we are delivering this level of customer success at scale and across the entire portfolio.
I want to thank our customers for their continued trust, their commitment and always, their inspiration; and our partner ecosystem, which is second to none for their ongoing investment in our customers' success; and last but not least, I want to thank everybody at Salesforce for again another outstanding performance in the quarter.
So I'd like to hand this over to Mark to talk a little bit more about our financial execution in the quarter. Mark?"

As you've heard, we had a great start to the fiscal year with very strong results across-the-board. Our total revenue was up 28% in constant currency when you exclude the year-over-year FX headwind of $20 million. Sequentially, we saw a $4 million FX headwind.
Sales Cloud accelerated in the quarter with a 15% year-over-year growth. Service Cloud grew 32%. Marketing Cloud grew 29%. App Cloud and Other grew 45%.
In the region, EMEA grew 33% and APAC continued to accelerate at 29% growth, both on a constant currency basis year-over-year. Dollar attrition for the first quarter remained below 9%.
While we continue to deliver this outstanding top line performance, we also continued to improve our bottom line as well. In the quarter, we delivered 283 basis points of year-over-year non-GAAP operating margin improvement, our eighth consecutive quarter of expansion. This helped drive record operating cash flow this quarter as we delivered more than $1 billion of operating cash flow, up 43% over last year. I'm very pleased with these outstanding results, our first $1 billion cash flow quarter, very exciting. These outstanding results reflect the continued compounding of our invoicing in Q4 and to a lesser extent the early adoption of ASU 2016-09, which benefited operating cash flow by approximately $25 million in Q1.
Deferred revenue ended the quarter at more than $4 billion. This was up 32% in constant currency when excluding a year-over-year FX headwind of $10 million. Sequentially, deferred revenue had an FX tailwind of $51 million. We also continue to drive an increase in annual billings in the quarter, with 79% of all subscription and support-related invoices issued with annual terms. This benefited year-over-year deferred revenue growth by approximately 1 percentage point.
Moving on to guidance. With our strong start in Q1, we are raising our FY '17 revenue guidance to $8.16 billion to $8.2 billion. We are also raising our FY '17 non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance to $1 to $1.02. We now expect year-over-year operating cash flow growth of 25% to 26%. For Q2, we are expecting revenues of $2.005 billion to $2.015 billion, non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.24 to $0.25 and a year-over-year deferred revenue growth of 26% to 28%.
To close, we had an outstanding quarter, and we're off to a great start for FY '17. I'd like to thank the entire Salesforce team for these great results.
With that, I'd like to open up the call for questions."

You probably know we've completely rebuilt our core platform of Salesforce, which we now call Lightning, and we have rebuilt how the Sales Cloud is manifested to our customers, especially in regards to mobile technologies. You can see that if you go on the App Store and download our Salesforce1 app, which is now millions of users, millions are using that to access Salesforce. Two, we've also created some amazing new capabilities for the Sales Cloud. Probably the most popular is our Pardot capability, which is a part of the Sales Cloud, very exciting accelerator for us as well as SteelBrick.

And I'll tell you why that is, because there is a whole segment of the developer population that we are speaking to who want to rapidly build and deploy applications, especially, and I said this in the previous answer, in the mobile environment. And only Salesforce -- only Salesforce has let you rapidly build and expand and create these applications using Lightning and deploy them on all these different devices. And for those of you who have tried it or seen the traffic around it on social networks like Twitter and others know, we have hit a huge home run in regards to Lightning. And we have our customers' imagination. For those of you who attended the February 2 event with the -- at the St. Regis, you heard Accenture, who is deploying this technology not just for its customers but internally to tens of thousands of users, almost 100,000 users, and how they have accelerated their application development capability internally by turning to Lightning. And so that is what is driving the power. We've rebooted our core platform, and you're seeing that reflected in our Sales Cloud, in our Service Cloud, in our platform, in our community, in our core applications that are running currently on that Lightning platform. That's been a huge growth driver.

And this has been a refocus point for us, to continue to innovate and accelerate innovation around Sales Cloud, and you see that in the results. And we've leveraged that great innovation and that base to drive vertical specialization. As you know, we announced and made for GA available the Financial Services Cloud and the Health Cloud in Q1, and we had several customers sign up in the quarter. So we're starting to get a lot of momentum. So we've been talking about it for a while. Part of our industry strategy has been around messaging and then releasing these first vertical products focused on the financial services industry and the health care industry and life sciences industry. And again, you do that with amazing technology with Force. You do that with amazing technology leveraging the underlying cloud and you add industry specialization to it, and that's why we're getting to see these results and this reacceleration."

And so what happens is the first year gets billed, and that will show up in our deferred revenue and then ratably recognized over time. But the multiyear aspect of that does not show up in our DR. It shows up in our unbilled DR. And what's amazing about that is when you put our billed and unbilled book of business together, you have $11.6 billion now growing at 27% year-on-year. So you're picking up some of that really, really good business that's going to show up. It hasn't been billed yet but it will over time. Great question, Kash."

And I know that you have created and keep a comprehensive financial model in Salesforce and have for a number of years as well as many of the financial analysts on the call. And I'm sure that all of you can figure out exactly -- or approximately based on our deferred revenue numbers and adjusting your models around when you think we're going to have $10 billion. That is an exciting moment. It's an exciting moment because for the software industry and specifically in enterprise applications, there's really only been 2 other companies that have really hit that kind of number. So I would say that we are already looking forward to blasting right through that and getting to the next level, and I'm excited that Salesforce doesn't show any signs of slowing down as we kind of get to these levels. We're moving rapidly into a world that we've talked about. Of course, many transformations in our industry, which is a world with the cloud that drove Salesforce's growth for many years, a world with social that drove Salesforce's growth for many years and also mobility. And that's also currently driving Salesforce's growth. When I look at kind of the next major trend for Salesforce and our industry that will drive tremendous growth, it's got to be artificial intelligence. And as we look out into the future and we start to look at extreme improvements and advances in artificial intelligence, whether it's machine learning, whether it's deep learning, whether it's machine intelligence itself, I think that those kind of capabilities appearing inside our application, that is going to be a major growth capability going forward. And one other area that I think will advance that is that we can bring this type of new technology very much to everyone. And that's going to be the power of Salesforce. That's certainly what we're doing with mobility today. That's what we will do in AI as we shift Salesforce to be an AI-first company. You can see the beginning of this in one of our most exciting new products of the quarter and also a part of the Sales Cloud growth for sure because it's in there is not just SalesforceIQ, which you can get on the App Store, but also our new product, Salesforce Inbox. And Salesforce Inbox is very exciting because it uses artificial intelligence and machine intelligence to work with our users, to work with their e-mails, to work with their calendars and to work with their CRM data to give them prescriptive ideas on exactly how to be more efficient in the sales, service and marketing processes of their companies. And when you look at technologies like SalesforceIQ and like Salesforce Inbox, well -- and I'm sure you know those came out of an incredible acquisition we did approximately 2 years ago, RelateIQ, which was just a world-class team that we were able to pick up that's based in Palo Alto, well, then you can see that this is another major growth factor because it will appear in sales, it will appear in service, it will appear in marketing. We saw it actually last week. If you attended our Connections conference, you saw our new Predictive Journeys capability. And this kind of predictive capability that appeared in our Marketing Cloud, that was driven out of our new SalesforceIQ services. You also see it, of course, in Communities. You see it in our Platform. You're going to see it in mobility. You're going to see it in our analytics, of course, at the core. This is a very powerful next-generation technology. So Heather, when I look forward, what I see is an AI-first world, and for every customer, going to be able to get a whole another generation of productivity out of artificial intelligence, machine learning and deep learning. Keith, do you want to add to that?"

Look, large deals are certainly an indication of how deep these relationships are becoming with these customers, but they're not the only indication. I mean, certainly in Q4, we had 2 of the largest 9-figure deals that we've had in the history of the company. And in Q1, we signed up again another very strategic long-term relationship. But our business is based on a balanced portfolio across all market segments, whether it's SMB or midmarket or the enterprise space. And there is a lot of room there. So there is an expectation from our customers to play a more significant role across-the-board and certainly in the enterprise. In fact, Marc and I met with a couple of CEOs yesterday who were talking to us about how they bring their companies into kind of this age of the customer and drive digital transformation. And that's becoming a regular dialogue. But this is both a mind share and a market share gain, and we strive for balance in our execution and a balance in our portfolio of business and customers. Again, from top to bottom, SMB all the way up to enterprise. So we've got great momentum. We expect that to continue. And I think we've got a terrific playbook with an incredible portfolio of products that satisfy our customers' needs."

And Jeff Bezos and I have a great meeting of the minds of the future of the cloud. I think that it's been a great relationship and partnership for us. We want to continue to grow that and expand that strategically. We are definitely exploring ways that we can use AWS more aggressively with Salesforce. Of course, you know that we run one of the largest application development capabilities in the world on AWS, which is Heroku. We also are building our new IoT Cloud on AWS. We also introduced new capabilities for our Marketing Cloud last week on AWS, and we have a lot of research development capabilities in AWS. When you look at Amazon today, there is no public cloud that is more sophisticated, more well used by enterprises and one that has more robust capabilities than Amazon. They have done a spectacular job in defining this kind of Infrastructure-as-a-Service market. They, of course, dominated. I think you know they're doing themselves more than $10 billion a year in it, and we're very happy to be so tightly aligned with Amazon and AWS. In regards to kind of the future capabilities that you're going to see with other parts of Salesforce, well as we head towards our Developer Conference and as you head towards Dreamforce, I think you'll continue to see more announcements between Salesforce and Amazon.

But we have not given up on Sales Cloud because there is so much more that we can do. And you saw that this quarter in that we have rebuilt this core with Lightning so that it works better on mobility. We have Salesforce1, which now has millions of users on it. I use it every day. It's never been faster and easier. The level of acuity with Salesforce1 is phenomenal. We have SteelBrick, which our customers love this kind of CPQ kind of capability to be able to do quotes and orders and all this incredible new stuff that SteelBrick does for us that's built natively in our Lightning platform. We have SalesforceIQ, which is an artificial intelligence front end, machine learning front end to Sales Cloud, which is incredible. We have Sales Cloud -- we have Salesforce Inbox, which is an e-mail front end of the Sales Cloud that's incredible. And we have many, many other things coming, many that you'll see at TrailheaDX, many more you're going to see at Dreamforce. We have not abandoned Sales Cloud. We have doubled. We have tripled down on Sales Cloud. And because of that, we've accelerated our growth rate and it's exciting. And our visions for Sales Cloud have not yet been fully realized. I mean, we know that there is not just a cloud -- there's not just this incredible cloud vision for Sales Cloud, not just incredible social vision -- you all know it's built on this incredible engagement platform built on our Chatter core and then extended into Salesforce1. Of course, it has incredible mobility, the best of any enterprise application in the world with more mobile users on it than any other application that I'm aware of. And we are now introducing this new AI wrapper that you can see that artificial intelligence is becoming part of Sales Cloud. You can see that already in SalesforceIQ, Salesforce Inbox. You can see that in Predictive Journeys. You're going to start to see that more aggressively. And because we are innovating so aggressively on Sales Cloud, you are going to continue to see great results because what customer does not want or need this ability to grow their top line? And that's what Sales Cloud is giving them in this tough environment. And by the way, all those same things that I just mentioned work with Service Cloud, they work with our Platform, they work with our Community.

But the third thing I would say is when you look at all the innovation Marc's talking about and you look at market share and you've probably seen the Gartner data that just came out, again, we took market share again in Sales Cloud. But even more importantly, we took market share at the CRM level, #1 again, took 150 basis points. And our key competitors are falling behind and actually losing market share.

This has been a big focus area for us over the last 3 years as part of our -- 1 of the 3 growth levers, again, expanding our partner ecosystems, speaking the language of industries and focusing our resources internationally. Obviously, we've made investments with data centers in Europe, which we're very, very excited about. Our customers are obviously excited about that, and we're just responding to our customers in that regard. But we've also invested more in terms of customer-facing assets internationally because our customers want to engage with us more deeply. They want those more strategic relationships. So we're just seeing the results of this investment that we've made over the last 3 years. As far as kind of the market trends, there's a lot of legacy on-premise providers out there, quite frankly, that are still trying to figure out if and how they can possibly transition to the cloud, which is very difficult. A lot of companies will claim that they are a cloud company. But the reality is being a cloud company is about technology. It is about a business model, and it's about a culture of driving customer success. And these companies that have had poor results or soft results, they represent the past and they do not have these 3 pillars that really were the foundation for Salesforce 17 years ago. And that's why we continue to drive success to our customers. We see great results in the marketplace. We are taking share. Quite frankly, these other companies are losing share as we gain share. So we're creating separation with them in the market. And we have the right vision. We have the right story. We have the right products. We have the right execution. We have great partners, and we have great customers. And that's why you're seeing these results."

In recent months, we have seen a lot of evidence of the major consulting firms such as Accenture and Deloitte and PWC moving pretty aggressively to build out their Salesforce practices. They've been doing it both organically and through acquisitions. And they seem to be centering their entire digital transformation strategy around Salesforce. And we've seen them converging their services with apps from multiple of your app exchange partners, and they're kind of wrapping that around Salesforce. And it seems to be resulting in part in this growth trajectory that you've got. So I am curious, does the path even beyond $10 billion and maybe to $15 billion or $20 billion in revenue seem any clearer to you as you have these consulting firms coalescing around Salesforce for their digital transformation strategies?"

Well, this is a great question, and I'm going to go to Keith pretty quickly on this. But you saw it in my February 2 presentation where we highlighted Accenture, and we've also now toured with them around the world. You've seen the videos on YouTube between Salesforce and Accenture. If you haven't, it's a great opportunity, go and check that out as well as the demos. You've heard from their CIO, from their CEO, from their President. Salesforce is their fastest and most strategic growing practice. And it is their transformation practice. It is their key cloud practice. You also see that with some of the other major SIs as well. I'm especially proud of our work with Deloitte. I'm especially proud of our work with Capgemini. And you know from the fourth quarter, PwC was just an awesome, awesome relationship that is emerging. And we are delighted with that as well. All of these players have our full attention. Now for all of them, they are kind of competing to grow to be the fastest grower with Salesforce's ecosystem because all of our customers want service capabilities because Salesforce itself provides actually only strategic services. We don't really provide these kind of core implementation services. So these large players have acquired many of the key parts of our ecosystem, and you just saw that with IBM. They just bought Bluewolf. And they are a -- company, but they've all made strategic bets on and they are trying to acquire our ecosystem as fast as possible. We're continuing to invest in these companies, into these ecosystem companies. We want to start more companies that provide service capabilities regionally, in the United States, in Europe, in Japan, in Australia and other places in the world. And these companies grow up and they get acquired by these large companies. That's a great model for us. Of course, our venture firm has made an incredible return on that strategy over the last 10 years. Now on top of that, I will tell you that I don't think that there is a strategic systems integrator who isn't making massive investments in Salesforce right now. And a lot of that has been led by Keith. I'm going to turn it over to him. He's really given us a partner focus like we did have before, and Keith, can you kind of tell us how you doubled down on that and how you provided such great leadership around the systems integrators?"

And Marc mentioned a lot of the large and significant players. I mean, these are firms that have deep relationships in the boardroom, companies of all shapes and sizes all over the world. I mean, Deloitte has rebranded to Deloitte Digital. And really when you look at the centerpiece of everything that Deloitte brings to the table in terms of digital transformation, it starts with Salesforce. They've done a terrific job there. I just -- last week, I addressed the Global Partners Forum at Accenture in Munich and talked about digital transformation and how Accenture and Salesforce are doing so well together. And just to give you an example of Accenture, we just don't have a go-to-market relationship with them, which is terrific, and they can continue to build their practice. They're also a very large customer of ours. So they are leveraging the Lightning platform. They're rolling it out very aggressively. They're getting all the benefits of it, and they are building products on top of our platform. So we have a beautiful 360-degree relationship with Accenture, that has really served as a model for all of these great systems integrators. I'm going to be with Capgemini next week to explore how we accelerate going to market with Capgemini. We collaborate with them very regularly about how to drive the market together. I was with the Vice Chairman of PwC a couple of weeks ago, talking about our growth strategies together. And our job is really to work very closely with these very trusted advisers to listen to them, to help feed and drive the ecosystem because this is just a huge part of our strategy."

Number one, this -- honestly, this has been 17 years in the making. I mean, this is an incredible company with incredible people, and an incredible set of core products and customers that I alluded to earlier. And we've been able to gain incredible market share and momentum starting with Marc's vision for cloud computing 17 years ago. So we've been able to capitalize on that. So that's kind of point number one. Point number two is that we find ourselves in a world where there's this convergence of cloud and mobile and social and data science and IoT all coming together, and we kind of lit the match again with Marc's vision 17 years ago. And we've been able to reinforce that vision by driving success for our customers. And then over the last -- the third point is over the last 3 years, as successful as the company has always been, we have put a particular emphasis on the enterprise and a focus on expansion in our international markets, becoming trusted advisers by speaking the language of the customer around the industries and building out our ecosystem, kind of how I answered the question about our SI partners before. So all of these things are coming together. We are built to last. That's been part of the strategy from 17 years back.

Thank you very much, and thank you to everyone joining us on today's call.

So revenue, as you see, has grown 25% in dollars and 26% year-over-year in constant currency to more than $2 billion. And just congratulations to everyone at Salesforce. This is our first $2 billion quarter and also no other enterprise of our company of our size and scale is delivering this kind of growth rate. Congratulations to everyone.
Deferred revenue was $3.8 billion, up 26% in dollars and 27% in constant currency. The dollar value of booked business on and off the balance sheet is now $11.8 billion, which is up 28% from a year ago. We're raising our fiscal 2017 revenue guidance to $8.325 billion at the high end of a range of 25%, and we're delivering on the strong base of top line growth even as we continue to improve on our non-GAAP operating margin.
Salesforce continues to be the fastest-growing top 10 software company in the world. And last week, Forbes ranked us as one of the most innovative companies in the world for the sixth year in a row and has named Salesforce ""The innovator of the decade."" Thank you, Forbes. And that's a great tribute to our amazing employees, especially our technology and product teams.
Dreamforce is coming up, and you're going to see an incredible level of new innovation when we introduced Salesforce Einstein, the world's first comprehensive artificial intelligence platform for CRM. Salesforce Einstein is AI for everyone. It's going to democratize artificial intelligence. It's going to make every company and every employee smarter, faster and more productive. We are going to deliver the world's smartest CRM.
And as you know, over the last few years, we've acquired a number of AI companies, incredible companies like Relate IQ, MetaMind, Implicit, Prediction IM, Tempo, AI and more with amazing, amazing people and technology. We've been able to stitch all this together into this incredible AI platform, and this focus on AI and on the critical aspects of AI is the next wave of our industry has resulted in a machine learning team of more than 175 data scientists who have built this amazing Einstein platform. And that's really why I'm so excited and why everyone at Salesforce is so excited. And when you come to Dreamforce, you're going to see how this fits together and how we're delivering Salesforce Einstein. And we're going to have some great new products like Sales Cloud Einstein, Service Cloud Einstein, Marketing Cloud Einstein. We're going to have our Analytics Cloud Einstein and many other artificial intelligence capabilities in all of our clouds, and our customers will be able to build their own AI capabilities using Einstein extensions and Heroku. This is going to be a huge differentiator and growth driver going forward and puts us well ahead of our CRM competition once again.
Salesforce Einstein is also a perfect example of how we've been able to combine organic innovation with some amazing acquisitions. We came into this year with a lot of excitement and energy around the investments we made in our own technology. Earlier this year, as you know, market conditions did change. My leadership, the board and I were presenting with some incredible opportunities that we just never thought would be available to us. We took a look at these amazing acquisitions, and our strategy was simple. We will acquire one-of-a-kind companies with unique technologies, amazing engineering teams and of course, visionary leaders that fit with our mission and our strategic plan to help our customers connect with their customers in new ways. And some of these acquisitions are helping us know that our CRM today, others are laying out the foundation for our future. 
A great example is Demandware, a company we've had a great relationship with and have admired and there's no company like Demandware. It's the clear leader in the multibillion dollar cloud e-commerce marketplace, a natural extension of our platform. It expands our CRM offering, our capabilities, our customers have been asking for. And when we talk to our customers like Louis Vuitton or [indiscernible] or [indiscernible] or even Adidas, they talk about Demandware as the critical part of their e-commerce cloud, and that's how it became Salesforce's e-commerce cloud. It's the solution that our customers domestic, and we are absolutely thrilled with this great the family of e-commerce product at Salesforce.
We also take advantage of opportunities to invest in our future with incredible companies like Quip. And everyone knows, he's the great leader of Quip, [indiscernible] Taylor, creator of Google Maps and the former CTO Facebook, who has created this next generation technology and wide documents bringing in new levels of content, communication and collaboration riding to our platform. And with all of this, we're clearing the world's smartest CRM through sales, service, marketing, community, analytics, e-commerce and IOT. 
We have never been better positioned for the future. You're going to see that at Dreamforce. It is going to be a rush of innovation. There's never been more new products and more capabilities released at Dreamforce, and you're never going to see a better place to see how all this amazing innovation and products comes together. This is our biggest customer event of the year coming very, very soon, October 4 through 7. We've got more than 2,300 customer speakers inspiring, motivating, empowering, educating our amazing community of customer trailblazers. We also have an amazing lineup of speakers, including Melinda Gates and General Motors' Mary Bar, Congressman John Lewis, many, many more. And you're not going to want to miss YouTube performing at our Dreamforce UCSF benefit concert to raise $10 million for children's hospitals. It's going to be an unforgettable event.
Dreamforce is already sold out, so talk to John to get registered and I'm going to look forward to seeing everybody there. Now let's turn it over to Keith and talk about our customer highlights for the quarter. Keith?"

We continued to close some of the biggest and most strategic transactions in the industry. In fact, we closed another 9-figure transaction in Q2 with a Fortune 50 customer. For those of you who are counting, this is now the third quarter in a row where we've established these very strategic 9-figure relationships. 
On the international front. Over the last few years, we have been steadily increasing our distribution capacity, expanding our partner ecosystem, investing in offices and infrastructure and opening new data centers. And all of these investments are clearly paying off. Europe was our fastest growing region powered by some great strategic wins with Selcom [ph] and Post Nord and TNT, AXA and Nestlé, great brands. Asia PAC had some great wins prince Shinxe Bank [ph], [indiscernible], Samsung and Telstra. And in Latin America, we expanded our relationship with the largest private bank in Brazil, Itau.
In every region, our partners, which is so critical to our strategy, have been a huge part of our success. Our ecosystem continues to expand with incredible ISDs and global and regional SIs. In fact, partner certifications reached 38,000 in the quarter, up 25% from a year ago, which is proof positive that our partner strategy is working and adding to our additional overall capacity. We continue to gain traction from our vertical focus, which furthers our momentum in each of our major industries, and I'd like to share with you those stories.
In healthcare, United Health Group significantly expanded with us to help build its next-generation of patient and customer engagement for more than 125 million people. This is incredible vision to make health care more cost effective, efficient, productive and intelligent. 
In retail, one of the world's largest brand expanded with us to consolidate their entire guest experience to turn the billions of messages based on the customers and one-to-one journeys that are seamless, intelligent and predictive. 
Macy's is another great example of how our retailer can transform with this. They started with Heroku for just portions of their mobile and e-commerce websites. Now they are bringing Salesforce to 185,000 employees and 1,000-plus HR call center agents. And the momentum in retail is only going to get supercharged with Demandware, our Salesforce commerce cloud.
In financial services ,we expanded with State Farm and nationwide and farmers and the Advisory Group, one of the largest networks of independent broker dealers in the country. And they are rolling out the Salesforce financial services Cloud to thousands of affiliated advisers. As you know, this is a product we launched just last quarter, and the early interest has been remarkable. These are all incredible stories. I can go on and on. And at Dreamforce, you're going to hear even more from our customers and how they are transforming their business with Salesforce.
Before I close, I'd like to thank the team and the computer for their hard work and their efforts driving customer success in the quarter and of course, to our customers and partners for their trust in us, and I look forward to a strong second half.
And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Mark to talk about our financial performance in the quarter"
122917,378369792,1040464,"salesforce.com, inc., Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Aug 31, 2016",2016-08-31,"Earnings Calls","Salesforce, Inc.","Executives","Great. Thanks, Keith. Total revenue for the second quarter was up 25% in dollars and 26% in constant currency, excluding a year-over-year FX headwind of $25 million. Demandware contributed $9 million to revenue in the second quarter, which was near the hi",701,"Great. Thanks, Keith. Total revenue for the second quarter was up 25% in dollars and 26% in constant currency, excluding a year-over-year FX headwind of $25 million. Demandware contributed $9 million to revenue in the second quarter, which was near the high end of the guidance we provided in June. Our dollar attrition for the second quarter, which excludes Marketing Cloud, remains below 9%, supporting top line revenue growth. 
Looking at revenue by cloud. Sales cloud grew 13% year-over-year in dollars; service cloud grew 29%; app cloud and other grew 43%; Marketing Cloud grew 28%, which now includes a subscription and support revenue from Demandware. While many enterprise companies are aspiring to achieve $1 billion run rate in one product, we already have 3 products with revenue run rate of more than $1 billion today with a Marketing Cloud soon to become our fourth. This gives us multiple levers of growth and provides additional business diversification.
This is another quarter of consistent year-over-year constant currency revenue growth in our regions with EMEA growing 32% and Asia Pac growing 29%. During the second quarter, FX drove more revenue pressure than expense relief. So I'm very pleased that we're able to still deliver 25 basis points of non-GAAP operating margin improvement year-over-year. Our ninth consecutive quarter of expansion, and we achieved this even while we began integrating Demandware and other recent acquisitions. 
I've already discussed how FX impacted our P&L, but a more meaningful impact was to the cash flow statement and balance sheet. Cash flow in the quarter was $251 million, down 18% over last year. Operating cash flow was principally impacted by FX headwinds as well as continued deepening [ph] of the seasonality of invoicing and onetime costs associated with the acquisition of Demandware. However, I'm very pleased with our cash generation in the first half of the year of $1.3 billion, which is up 25% over the first half of last year. Deferred revenue ended the quarter at more than $3.8 billion, which includes approximately $23 million related to our acquisition of Demandware. This was up 26% in dollars and 27% in constant currency when excluding a year-over-year FX headwind of $35 million. Sequentially, deferred revenue have an FX headwind of $41 million. This was the larger sequential deferred revenue headwind we have ever seen and highlights the dramatic effect that currency had at the end of Q2. In the quarter, approximately 78% of all subscription and support related invoices were issued with annual terms. Q2 benefited deferred revenue from the change in billing frequency was less than 1 percentage point of growth.
Moving on to guidance. Just as FX had a significant impact on our Q2 results, we now expect FX pressures to persist for the remainder of the year with a full year revenue headwind of approximately $100 million to $150 million. In this context, I'm pleased to raise our full year revenue guidance to $8.275 billion to $8.325 billion. At the same time, we're making minor adjustments to our operating model to absorb and integrate recent acquisitions in order to deliver the profitability we committed to. As such, we continue to expect non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.93 to $0.95, which implies approximately 70 basis points of non-GAAP operating margin improvement.
Finally, with FX volatility we've discussed, we are updating our full year operating cash flow guidance to a year-over-year growth rate of 20% to 21%, which allows us to remain on track for our first $2 billion cash flow year. For Q3, we're initiating guidance for the revenue of $2.11 billion to $2.12 billion, non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.20 to $0.21 and year-over-year deferred revenue growth of approximately 20%.
To close, we delivered solid results in the second quarter, and I'm very pleased to be raising our top line guidance while maintaining bottom line guidance for the year. As Keith said, with our strong pipeline of new business and with Dreamforce in October, we have a great set up as we move to the back half of the year. And I look forward to welcoming many of you at our Analyst Day at Dreamforce in October.
And with that, we'll open up the call for questions. Operator?"

We did have some weakness and some softness, if you will, in parts of our business in the United States. As I mentioned in my earlier comments, we conducted a very, very detailed operational review, which is by the way, part of our normal cadence. It's what we normally do. But we took a deeper look given that we had some softness in parts of the U.S. And look, at the end of the day, what I would boil this down to is just a bit of blocking and tackling. And we've taken a look at. It, we've made our adjustments. We've looked at our playbooks. We've tightened up on a few things. But in these quarters, things push out, things pull in. And that's happened in every single quarter that I've ever been involved with, and I think many of you know that I've been in this business for over 30 years. So as I said, we've taken a look at the operational aspects of the business. I feel very, very positive about the second half. Our pipeline is strong. Our win rates were very strong in the quarter. Our level of engagement has never been stronger. In fact, over the last 2 weeks, I have spent time with 3 of the CEO and COOs of the top 10 U.S. banks in the United States, and all of them are talking to us about transformation and raising their levels of engagement with customers, and they view us as a trust adviser and they want to know how we can help them. They're talking to us. They're talking to Salesforce. They're not talking to other customers. So when I look at the leadership team that we have in place, which has been a very high-performing team historically, when I look at our second half pipeline, when I look at our levels of engagement, which is unprecedented, I feel very, very strongly about the second half of the quarter -- of the fiscal year."

Let me just talk about our DR, deferred revenue. Obviously, we have some impact for the foreign exchange. We talked about having such a impact in Q2. It's the biggest sequential change that we've seen ever in the history of Salesforce. So it has to be factored in appropriately. The other thing that I know you'll get, Keith, also is if and when seasonality and the compounding effect that talked about at Demandware last year, which showed all the map and the multiyear trend that's happening there. Of course, we would look at that as well, but I'd label it up basically and say that we think it's appropriate. And when we look at the overall top line demand of revenue growth as described, I'm just pleased to be able to have. This is the third time this year that we've raised our annual guidance for revenue for the year. And we're doing that predicated on all the things Keith talked about, the second half pipeline. We're looking things like our market share. We continue to gain momentum based on the most recent market share data that was release, win ratios. But at the end of the day, what I'm most pleased about doing is doing that for the third time in the face of $100 million to $150 million in FX headwinds at the top line and yet, we're still doing the third race. So I think we have a good set up, as Keith describe, and obviously, we have factored in all the things he covered. That's my point of view. Hope that helps."

Specifically to the M&A question, we came into this year, we didn't really have M&A on our forecast, and the reason why is because when we look at doing M&A, we look for really strategic great companies that are one-of-a-kind and also that we're going to get a great price then we have a tremendous process in our company that includes our Board of Directors, M&A community as well as an internal corporate development group. And when we look out, we didn't see that happening, but then there were some pretty big changes that happened in the market. And the first one I know you covered, which was LinkedIn, did not have a great quarter and their stock dropped by 50%. And when that happened, it really triggered our process because all of a sudden, they're a great company that is unique asset, that's strategic, was available at a great price. And so we made a bid for LinkedIn and another company. As you know, Microsoft made a bid, and Microsoft outbid us and that happened for a lot of different reasons, but we thought that, that was a great asset at a great price. Then as the market has continues to evolve, we had an incredible situation that occur, which very similar, which is a company that we coveted for many years, Demandware was all of a sudden approached by another company, and they had tried to acquire Demandware. And when it came to our attention, we want to buy them and we put in a bid for Demandware because again, it's a great company, it was a great price, tremendously strategic fit for our company and our future, e-commerce platform. And I had just come back from a trip to LVMH who uses salesforce for CRM, and that's also standardized on Demandware. And they said those 2 solutions combined, that's all they needed to manage all their customer information. That was an enough to me to go to the board and say, ""Look, we've been approached to buy Demandware. This is a one-of-a-kind opportunity. There's no other leader in that cloud e-commerce. Our customers like LVMH like others I could go through are using Demandware. We should acquire this."" And we were successful in that bid. Now as the summer kind of rolled on, I did not expect to get a call from someone who I have incredible respect for, Brent Taylor, who's the CEO of Quip. You've followed his career for many years. I tried to have dinner with him once a month. Everyone know the incredible work he did with Google Maps. Everyone knows he was the CTO of Facebook, and he had accepted an investment from Salesforce to this company. And we were talking about the possibility of Salesforce acquiring his company and him joining our team as one of our top technical leaders. And that's a dream that this company have had for several years. Everyone here and many people in the industry as well covered and loved Brett. And when we had that opportunity, we took that. And so our -- beginning of our fiscal year plan not to acquire any companies all of a sudden turned into we acquired 2 very important companies with Demandware and also Quip, and we've also found a couple of other great companies as well. And this M&A window, I talked about that I think on the last call and openly in the press had the same step open for the year. I think it will probably close probably at the end of this calendar year, but it's been incredible time for us to acquire some phenomenal assets and I've never been more excited about Salesforce and our product line and coming into Dreamforce like I said is just awesome. And specifically on the goal. Well, I'm not giving forward guidance, of course, but yes, we are -- you're right? You can do the math and so can I. We're about to get very close to being able to start talking about our $10 billion year. We're not doing that on this call. And you can see it in our core numbers is that when we pass through that we're taking a very aggressive goal to double the company. I'm very committed to top line growth, as you know. I'm also very committed to bottom line growth. I will not grow the company without also growing the bottom line and we've proven that, and you can see that on the press release that's in front of you that the top and bottom line is going really well this quarter, and we'll continue to do that and we'll continue to do that while being able to participate in this M&A environment because as you can see, not only did we buy the companies but we beat our numbers, so we will continue to execute that. I hope that answers your questions."

Or could there be some broader macroeconomic forces at work that have a bit of a property? I just want to get your feel for that. And also secondly, more strategically, what could be the impact of Einstein? Could there be a replacement cycle within your base? Or new come ups where they could be open to Salesforce that were previously not available?"

I mean, we've been -- Keith and I have had a lot of conversations about this because Keith and I have both been in the enterprise software business for 25 years or more, 30 years, and I think we both started at Oracle in '86. And we've -- you do get a quarter now and then with some specific geography. In this case, the United States had some softness, and it's just the nature of enterprise software and that's where we are. I don't attribute it to any other factors to match and that's just what it is, what it is and you move on to the third quarter and assess your pipelines, and ours are full and rich. And you assess your competitive position. Our win rates are strong. And you look at where your innovation cycle less, and we've never had a bigger new product cycle as your question indicates, which is at when we roll into Dreamforce, we are going to have incredible release of Einstein. You're going to see dramatic enhancements to our Salesforce Lightning platform, new mobile capabilities and enhancements with Salesforce1. Of course, of productivity tools available through Quip, which is remarkable wide documents. So if everyone has downloaded and started using Quip, whether it's on your phone or your iPad or on your laptop, I mean, it's just a remarkable piece of technology. And then we, of course, have some of these incredible new platforms that we did not have a year ago like e-commerce cloud. So all of that together provides for a very exciting Dreamforce. And in regards to how we price it, you've seen that Sales Cloud continues to do really well even though it's a monster in terms of revenue. And one of the reasons that growth continues is because we have these amazing auctions available with the Sales Cloud like [indiscernible]. We all know that, which is an incredible product that we picked up with -- when we bought ExactTarget 3 [ph] years ago. We also have another amazing option on Sales Cloud, which is CPQ or SteelBrick, which is another amazing option that we picked up last year. And there will be another amazing option with Einstein for Sales Cloud to give you this incredible intelligence so you're going to see some awesome capabilities. You can also have those kind of options available with for example Analytics Cloud will have the Einstein option as well to make machine intelligence part of your analytics journey. So there's a lot of exciting things coming for Dreamforce, and nobody likes to see softness in any particular region. This did seem quite isolated in my opinion to the U.S. Like I said, we really saw some great growth and our deal flow in the United States, but we did get a bit of softness at the very end of the quarter and then we had a great performance in Europe. We had great performance in Asia Pacific. We had great -- I mean, we at Japan had a record quarter and  record's month in July. So it's an incredible part of the enterprise industry and it's something that you did not only just manage through just have to make a company stronger and stronger and stronger, which is exactly what we did the last time we saw that, which was in the quarter that you talked about."

Last week, I was with them and had -- was with a lot of customers CEOs, CEO of Unilever and ABB and Coca-Cola and Price Waterhouse Coopers and the CEO of Bank of America. And in each and every case, those customers are not only absorbing more and more of our technology than ever before, but they're getting more aggressive about their digital transformation. I mean, today ABB, which is an incredible manufacturing company based in Switzerland, they deployed now more than 20,000 users and are connecting all of their machines and building an incredible customer network using Salesforce. When I look at the work that Brian is doing at BFA, again it's a huge fundamental transformation of the business to be customer first and to be digital and to be integrated in. And both of those companies and the other companies I have mentioned have chosen Salesforce as their CRM platform to do that work. And I could go through dozens and dozens and dozens of others that I think at that pace, not just digital transformation though and I would say it's customer transformation creating a customer-first environment that is intelligent and mobile and one that allows their companies to build this one-on-one relationships with either their B2B customers or B2C customers as well. This is a pace of change that I've never seen, and I don't think that there's a company that's -- that we're working with today who is reducing their digital transformations of anything. I think almost every single one that I met with this quarter and I have even spent a couple of weeks in Japan this quarter are accelerating."

Clearly, when you think about the trigger points of that framework, it's growth rates and we think about those 3 categories. And what that brings to mind for me for this quarter and this information that we're sharing with you, we have a guide that's in the 25-ish percent revenue growth rate for the year, again as we said the third [indiscernible] of the year, that's what that number looks like. And then of course, what we haven't talked about as much is the $11.8 billion of building unbilled deferred revenue that grew that big number at 28% in aggregate. So we think about growth a lot. We think about profitability a lot. We think about the revenue framework that's very much intact. You've heard from Mark, you heard from me.

I'll tell you that you're absolutely right, and it's obviously one of the reasons that we have invested so significantly in artificial intelligence.

I'll tell you that you're absolutely right, and it's obviously one of the reasons that we have invested so significantly in artificial intelligence. We strongly believe them when we look at the future of Salesforce, when we look at the future of our industry, of course, we've seen the evolution from the cloud. We talked about that on many calls. We talked about social. We talked about mobile. I think we're really now evolved into kind of 4 key areas, and my employees and executives all know that I feel very strongly around this, but of course, the absolute first one is intelligence. That is companies demand that your software is going to be intelligence smart, that you're going to have machine learning and deep learning and machine intelligence built in, that it's going to be excellent that, that machine intelligence is going to be declared as well as problematic, that you're not going to leave no customers behind. If a customer is a programmer, they can use it. If a customer is nonprogrammatic or what we call declarative, they're going to be able to use it. This is a very important going forward, and I really believe we're going to have the best artificial intelligence platform in the industry. We have phenomenal executives, phenomenal minds. The progress so far has been incredible. And I think when you see Einstein, you'll see that it is on par and capable of any other AI platform hat you've seen like Watson and others. But with Einstein, it has these capabilities like non-programmatic capabilities as well as programmatic capabilities that is built into our applications as well as the independent. And I think that will be very powerful to platform. I think everybody knows and I strongly believe you can't just build a platform today. I can't just build an application, you have to build platforms. And these platforms also have to be declarative as well as programmatic. And I -- of course, I'm biased but I believe that our Lightning platform is the best in enterprise software. You can build applications that run on any device, whether it's any phone or any tablet or any PC or any type of IoT capability. And I believe that Lightning will be an incredible capability for us going forward. And three is mobility. That is Salesforce now has millions of users on its mobile platforms. I know many people on this call use Salesforce1 everyday. We have many other key mobile technologies like Salesforce inbox and others available as well. And mobility remains a huge focus for Salesforce. And when you come to Dreamforce, you're going to see more and more capable -- capabilities on mobility as billions of users around the world go online on their phone. They want to be able to do that with Salesforce around their business from their phone, and Salesforce1 remains, I believe, the absolute most popular application deployment vehicle for a mobile. And finally, productivity. We have to have productivity built in. All of our applications need to have core productivity applications, whether it is e-mail or type of salesforce inbox or spreadsheets or work processes like Quip, live documents. All of that has to be an integral, an integrated part of what we're doing. We believe that strongly. We've obviously done a lot of great work with Microsoft as well with their product. We have now our own product in this category, and this is going to be really important for us going forward  and it's 3 [ph] [indiscernible] we bought Quip it's because we believe productivity is the fourth leg of stool. And that when you look at artificial intelligence, platform, mobility and productivity and when you look on top of that, our core applications in sales, service, marketing, communicating, analytics apps, IoT and e-commerce and you could even break productivity out of its own application category, I think all of you know productivity itself has a huge TAM, $26 billion a year TAM, those 9 applications differentiated by these 4 capabilities. That's how I look at where our product line is going and what I have to be able to articulate that in a much simpler, much easier to understand way when we get to Dreamforce for our customers."

But a couple of the charters coming on board here was obvious to continue the outstanding operational excellence of our broader market, our SMB business, but really to accelerate into the enterprise and I think we've made excellent progress there. But as you continue this SMB business and accelerate into the enterprise, of course you're going to be balancing out the portfolio. And by definition, the nature of enterprise typically has back ended in the second half of years. So I think it's natural to expect that, that will drive some degree of seasonality through the second half of the year, but we run a balanced portfolio of business and that's what we strive to every single day."

Essentially all of the major services firms experienced problems recently and that included cognizant an emphasis and jampacked and whole bunch for this. And I do believe several of them mentioned softness in digital projects in the month of July. I think some of that was attributed to the big banks that we're counting on a midyear interest rate increase, which did not happen partially as a result of the Brexit vote. I'm just curious, do you look at all of that as purely coincidental relative to what you mentioned at the end of the quarter in the U.S.?

It still is a huge part of the enterprise software industry, and we're just still getting going in Japan. We're at the beginning of our Japan journey and yet we have these incredible relationships with some of the most -- Japan's most important companies and government agencies, and that's how I look at it would I have listened to what everyone told me about Japan in the last 18 years, we wouldn't be even doing business there.

Part of the strategic weapon if you will of this company is a focus -- our relentless focus on what we referred to as enablement, which is training our people.

Now, enablement there, I will tell you, for a company like us, there's no end of job, okay? So I think we all, as leaders in the company, no matter what line of business we're responsible for, we wake up every day and think about what's the best way for us to onboard our employees, what's the best way to continue to educate them on new product releases, what's the base way to make sure they were prepared that they deliver value to our customers. And that's why enablement is so important to us as a company and that's why we focus of much of our attention about it."

So revenue, as you see, has grown 25% in dollars and 26% year-over-year in constant currency to more than $2 billion. And just congratulations to everyone at Salesforce. This is our first $2 billion quarter, and also no other enterprise software company of our size and scale is delivering this kind of growth rate. Congratulations to everyone.
Deferred revenue was $3.8 billion, up 26% in dollars and 27% in constant currency. The dollar value of booked business on and off the balance sheet is now $11.8 billion, which is up 28% from a year ago. We're raising our fiscal 2017 revenue guidance to $8.325 billion at the high end of a range of 25%, and we're delivering on the strong base of top line growth even as we continue to improve on our non-GAAP operating margin.
Salesforce continues to be the fastest-growing top 10 software company in the world. And last week, Forbes ranked us as one of the most innovative companies in the world for the sixth year in a row and has named Salesforce ""the innovator of the decade."" Thank you, Forbes. And that's a great tribute to our amazing employees, especially our technology and product teams.
Dreamforce is coming up, and you're going to see an incredible level of new innovation when we introduce Salesforce Einstein, the world's first comprehensive artificial intelligence platform for CRM. Salesforce Einstein is AI for everyone. It's going to democratize artificial intelligence. It's going to make every company and every employee smarter, faster and more productive. We are going to deliver the world's smartest CRM.
And as you know, over the last few years we've acquired a number of AI companies, incredible companies like RelateIQ, MetaMind, Implisit, PredictionIO, Tempo AI and more with amazing, amazing people and technology. We've been able to stitch all this together into this incredible AI platform, and this focus on AI and on the critical aspects of AI as the next wave of our industry has resulted in a machine learning team of more than 175 data scientists who have built this amazing Einstein platform. And that's really why I'm so excited and why everyone at Salesforce is so excited, and when you come to Dreamforce, you're going to see how this fits together and how we're delivering Salesforce Einstein. And we're going to have some great new products like Sales Cloud Einstein and Service Cloud Einstein, Marketing Cloud Einstein. We're going to have our Analytics Cloud Einstein and many other artificial intelligence capabilities in all of our clouds, and our customers will be able to build their own AI capabilities using Einstein extensions and Heroku. This is going to be a huge differentiator and growth driver going forward and puts us well ahead of our CRM competition once again.
Salesforce Einstein is also a perfect example of how we've been able to combine organic innovation with some amazing acquisitions. We came into this year with a lot of excitement and energy around the investments we made in our own technology. Earlier this year, as you know, market conditions did change. My leadership, the board and I were presented with some incredible opportunities that we just never thought would be available to us. We took a look at these amazing acquisitions, and our strategy was simple. We will acquire one-of-a-kind companies with unique technologies, amazing engineering teams and of course, visionary leaders that fit with our mission and our strategic plan to help our customers connect with their customers in new ways. And some of these acquisitions are helping us build out our CRM today; others are laying out the foundation for our future.
A great example is Demandware, a company we've had a great relationship with and have admired, and there's no company like Demandware. It's the clear leader in the multibillion-dollar cloud e-commerce marketplace, a natural extension of our platform. It expands our CRM offering with capabilities our customers have been asking for. And when we've talked to customers like Louis Vuitton or Brunello Cucinelli or See’s Candies or even Adidas, they talk about Demandware as the critical part of their e-commerce cloud, and that's how it became Salesforce's e-commerce cloud. It's the solution that our customers drove us to, and we are absolutely thrilled with this great new family of e-commerce products at Salesforce.
We also take advantage of opportunities to invest in our future with incredible companies like Quip. And everyone knows he's -- the great leader of Quip, Bret Taylor, creator of Google Maps and also the former CTO of Facebook, who has created this next-generation technology of live documents, bringing a new level of content, communication and collaboration right into our platform. And with all of this, we're creating the world's smartest CRM through sales, service, marketing, community, analytics, e-commerce and IoT. 
We have never been better positioned for the future. You're going to see that at Dreamforce. It is going to be a rush of innovation. There's never been more new products and more capabilities released at Dreamforce, and you're never going to see a better place to see how all this amazing innovation and products come together. This is our biggest customer event of the year coming very, very soon, October 4 through 7. We've got more than 2,300 customer speakers inspiring, motivating, empowering, educating our amazing community of customer trailblazers. We also have an amazing lineup of speakers, including Melinda Gates and General Motors' Mary Barra, Congressman John Lewis, many, many more. And you're not going to want to miss U2 performing at our Dreamfest UCSF benefit concert to raise $10 million for children's hospitals. It's going to be an unforgettable event.
Dreamforce is already sold out, so talk to John to get registered and I'm going to look forward seeing everybody there. Now let's turn it over to Keith and talk about our customer highlights for the quarter. Keith?"

Overall, we delivered a solid second quarter.

Overall, we delivered a solid second quarter. Our results reflect our continued focus on becoming more strategic with the enterprise, expanding internationally, investing in our partner ecosystem and broadening our penetration in our target industries.
In each of these areas, we made good progress in Q2. Now at the same time, we saw some softness at the end of the quarter primarily in the United States. And after a thorough operational review of the United States business, from sales to products to marketing, really all aspects of our business, I am confident at our plan for the year. We have a proven and tenured sales leadership team. We have industry-leading products. We have continued high win rates, and our second half pipeline is very strong. We also are seeing very high levels of customer engagement. So let me take you through some of the highlights of the quarter.
We continued to close some of the biggest and most strategic transactions in the industry. In fact, we closed another 9-figure transaction in Q2 with a Fortune 50 customer. For those of you who are counting, this is now the third quarter in a row where we've established these very strategic 9-figure relationships.
On the international front, over the last few years we have been steadily increasing our distribution capacity, expanding our partner ecosystem, investing in offices and infrastructure and opening new data centers, and all of these investments are clearly paying off. Europe was our fastest growing region powered by some great strategic wins with Selcom and PostNord and TNT, AXA and Nestlé, great brands. Asia Pac had some great wins with Shinsei Bank, Meiji Yasuda, Samsung and Telstra. And in Latin America, we expanded our relationship with the largest private bank in Brazil, Itaú.
And in every region, our partners, which is so critical to our strategy, have been a huge part of our success. Our ecosystem continues to expand with incredible ISVs and global and regional SIs. In fact, partner certifications reached 38,000 in the quarter, up 25% from a year ago, which is proof positive that our partner strategy is working and adding to our additional overall capacity. We continue to gain traction from our vertical focus, which furthers our momentum in each of our major industries, and I'd like to share a few of those stories.
In health care, UnitedHealth Group significantly expanded with us to help build its next-generation of patient and customer engagement for more than 125 million people. This is an incredible vision to make health care more cost effective, efficient, predictive and intelligent.
In retail, one of the world's largest brand expanded with us to consolidate their entire guest experience to turn the billions of messages they send to customers and one-to-one journeys that are seamless, intelligent and predictive. Macy's is another great example of how a retailer can transform with us. They started with Heroku for just portions of their mobile and e-commerce websites. Now they are bringing Salesforce to 185,000 employees and 1,000-plus HR call center agents. And the momentum in retail is only going to get supercharged with Demandware, our Salesforce commerce cloud.
In financial services ,we expanded with State Farm and Nationwide and Farmers and the Advisory Group, one of the largest networks of independent broker-dealers in the country. And they are rolling out the Salesforce Financial Services Cloud to thousands of affiliated advisers. As you know, this is a product we launched just last quarter, and the early interest has been remarkable. These are all incredible stories. I can go on and on. And at Dreamforce, you're going to hear even more from our customers and how they are transforming their business with Salesforce.
Before I close, I'd like to thank the team and the company for their hard work and their efforts driving customer success in the quarter and of course, to our customers and partners for their trust in us and I look forward to a strong second half.
And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Mark to talk about our financial performance in the quarter."
122917,378369792,1040488,"salesforce.com, inc., Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Aug 31, 2016",2016-08-31,"Earnings Calls","Salesforce, Inc.","Executives","Great. Thanks, Keith. Total revenue for the second quarter was up 25% in dollars and 26% in constant currency, excluding a year-over-year FX headwind of $25 million. Demandware contributed $9 million to revenue in the second quarter, which was near the hi",704,"Great. Thanks, Keith. Total revenue for the second quarter was up 25% in dollars and 26% in constant currency, excluding a year-over-year FX headwind of $25 million. Demandware contributed $9 million to revenue in the second quarter, which was near the high end of the guidance we provided in June. Our dollar attrition for the second quarter, which excludes Marketing Cloud, remains below 9%, supporting top line revenue growth.
Looking at revenue by cloud. Sales Cloud grew 13% year-over-year in dollars; Service Cloud grew 29%; App Cloud and Other grew 43%; Marketing Cloud grew 28%, which now includes the subscription and support revenue from Demandware. While many enterprise software companies are aspiring to achieve $1 billion run rate in one product, we already have 3 products with revenue run rates of more than $1 billion today with the Marketing Cloud soon to become our fourth. This gives us multiple levers of growth and provides additional business diversification.
This was another quarter of consistent year-over-year constant currency revenue growth in our regions with EMEA growing 32% and Asia Pac growing 29%. During the second quarter, FX drove more revenue pressure than expense relief [ph]. So I'm very pleased that we were able to still deliver 25 basis points of non-GAAP operating margin improvement year-over-year, our ninth consecutive quarter of expansion, and we achieved this even while we began integrating Demandware and other recent acquisitions.
I've already discussed how FX impacted our P&L, but a more meaningful impact was to the cash flow statement and balance sheet. Cash flow in the quarter was $251 million, down 18% over last year. Operating cash flow was principally impacted by FX headwinds as well as continued deepening of the seasonality of invoicing and onetime costs associated with the acquisition of Demandware. However, I'm very pleased with our cash generation in the first half of the year of $1.3 billion, which is up 25% over the first half of last year.
Deferred revenue ended the quarter at more than $3.8 billion, which includes approximately $23 million related to our acquisition of Demandware. This was up 26% in dollars and 27% in constant currency when excluding a year-over-year FX headwind of $35 million. Sequentially, deferred revenue had an FX headwind of $41 million. This was the largest sequential deferred revenue headwind we have ever seen and highlights the dramatic effect that currency had at the end of Q2. In the quarter, approximately 78% of all subscription and support-related invoices were issued with annual terms. Q2 benefit to deferred revenue from the change in billing frequency was less than 1 percentage point of growth.
Moving on to guidance. Just as FX had a significant impact on our Q2 results, we now expect FX pressures to persist for the remainder of the year with a full year revenue headwind of approximately $100 million to $150 million. In this context, I'm pleased to raise our full year revenue guidance to $8.275 billion to $8.325 billion. At the same time, we're making minor adjustments to our operating model to absorb and integrate recent acquisitions in order to deliver the profitability we committed to. As such, we continue to expect non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.93 to $0.95, which implies approximately 70 basis points of non-GAAP operating margin improvement.
Finally, with FX volatility we've discussed, we are updating our full year operating cash flow guidance to a year-over-year growth rate of 20% to 21%, which allows us to remain on track for our first $2 billion cash flow year. For Q3 we're initiating guidance for the revenue of $2.11 billion to $2.12 billion, non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.20 to $0.21 and year-over-year deferred revenue growth of approximately 20%.
To close, we delivered a solid result in the second quarter, and I'm very pleased to be raising our top line guidance while maintaining bottom line guidance for the year. As Keith said, with our strong pipeline of new business and with Dreamforce in October, we have a great set up as we move to the back half of the year. And I look forward to welcoming many of you at our Analyst Day at Dreamforce in October.
And with that, we'll open up the call for questions. Operator?"

So listen, we're -- we had a solid quarter. Our results were good, and we did have some weakness and some softness, if you will, in parts of our business in the United States. As I mentioned in my earlier comment",354,"Yes. Okay. Keith, thanks for the question. So listen, we're -- we had a solid quarter. Our results were good, and we did have some weakness and some softness, if you will, in parts of our business in the United States. As I mentioned in my earlier comments, we conducted a very, very detailed operational review, which is by the way part of our normal cadence. It's what we normally do, but we took a deeper look given that we had some softness in parts of the U.S. And look, at the end of the day, what I would boil this down to is just a bit of blocking and tackling. And we've taken a look at it. We've made the adjustments. We've looked at our playbooks. We've tightened up on a few things. But in these quarters, things push out, things pull in, and that's happened in every single quarter that I've ever been involved with. And I think many of you know that I've been in this business for over 30 years. So as I said, we've taken a look at the operational aspects of the business. I feel very, very positive about the second half. Our pipeline is strong. Our win rates were very strong in the quarter. Our level of engagement has never been stronger. In fact, over the last 2 weeks I have spent time with 3 of the CEO and COOs of the top 10 U.S. banks in the United States, and all of them are talking to us about transformation and raising their level of engagement with customers. And they view us as a trusted adviser, and they want to know how we can help them. They're talking to us. They're talking to Salesforce. They're not talking to other customers. So when I look at the leadership team that we have in place, which has been a very high-performing team historically, when I look at our second half pipeline, when I look at our level of engagement, which is unprecedented, I feel very, very strongly about the second half of the quarter -- of the fiscal year."

Let me just talk about our DR, deferred revenue. Obviously we have some impact for the foreign exchange. We talked about having such a impact in Q2. It's the biggest sequential change that we have seen ever in the history of Salesforce. So it has to be factored in appropriately. The other thing that I know you'll get, Keith, also is if and when [ph] seasonality and compounding effect that we talked about at Dreamforce last year. We showed all the map and the multiyear trend that's happening there. Of course, we would look at that as well. But I'd level it up basically and say that we think it's appropriate. And when we look at the overall top line demand of revenue growth as described, I'm just pleased to be able to have -- this is the third time this year that we've raised our annual guidance for revenue for the year. And we're doing that predicated on all the things Keith talked about, the second half pipeline. We're looking at things like our market share. We continue to gain momentum based on the most recent market share data that was released; win ratios. But at the end of the day, what I'm most pleased about doing is doing that for the third time in the face of $100 million to $150 million in FX headwinds at the top line and yet we're still doing a third raise. So I think we have a good set up, as Keith described, and obviously we have factored in all the things he covered. That's my point of view. Hope that helps."

Specifically to the M&A question, when we came into this year, we didn't really have M&A on our forecast. And the reason why is because when we look at doing M&A, we look for really strategic, great companies that are one-of-a-kind and also that we're going to get a great price, then we have a tremendous process in our company that includes our Board of Directors, M&A committee as well as our internal corporate development group. And when we look out, we didn't see that happening. But then there were some pretty big changes that happened in the market and the first one, I know you covered, which was LinkedIn did not have a great quarter and their stock dropped by 50%. And when that happened, it really triggered our process because all of a sudden they -- a great company that is unique, asset that's strategic was available at a great price. And so we made a bid for LinkedIn. And another company, as you know, Microsoft made a bid and Microsoft outbid us and that happened for a lot of different reasons, but we thought that, that was a great asset at a great price. Then as the market continues to evolve, we had an incredible situation that occur, which is very similar, which is a company that we coveted for many years, Demandware was all of a sudden approached by another company and they had tried to acquire Demandware. And when it came to our attention, we want to buy them and we put in a bid for Demandware because, again, it's a great company. It's a great price, tremendously strategic fit for our company and our future e-commerce platform. And I had just come back from a trip to LVMH who uses salesforce for CRM and is also standardized on Demandware, and they said those 2 solutions combined, that's all they needed to manage all their customer information. That was enough to me to go to the board and say, ""Look, we've been approached to buy Demandware. This is a one-of-a-kind opportunity. There's no other leader in cloud e-commerce. Our customers like LVMH, like others I could go through, are using Demandware. We should acquire this."" And we were successful in that bid. Now as the summer kind of rolled on, I did not expect to get a call from someone who I have incredible respect for, Bret Taylor, who's the CEO of Quip, followed his career for many years. I try to have dinner with him once a month. Everyone knows the incredible work he did with Google Maps. Everyone knows he was the CTO of Facebook, and he had accepted an investment from Salesforce to his company. And we were talking about the possibility of Salesforce acquiring his company and him joining our team as one of our top technical leaders, and that's a dream that this company has had for several years. Everyone here, and many people in the industry as well, covet and love Bret. And when we had that opportunity, we took that. And so our beginning of our fiscal year plan not to acquire any companies all of a sudden turned into we acquired 2 very important companies with Demandware and also Quip, and we've also found a couple of other great companies as well. And this M&A window, I talked about that, I think, on the last call and openly in the press [indiscernible] open for the year. I think it will probably close probably at the end of this calendar year. But it's been incredible time for us to acquire some phenomenal assets, and I've never been more excited about Salesforce and our product line and coming into Dreamforce, like I said, is just awesome. And specifically on the goal, well, I'm not giving forward guidance, of course. But yes, we are -- you're right. You can do the math and so can I. We're about to get very close to being able to start talking about our $10 billion year. We're not doing that on this call. And you can see it in our core numbers that when we pass through that, we are going to be taking a very aggressive goal to double the company. I'm very committed to top line growth, as you know. I'm also very committed to bottom line growth. I will not grow the company without also growing the bottom line, and we've proven that and you can see that on the press release that's in front of you that the top and bottom lines have grown really well this quarter.

And what gives me so much confidence about the second half is not just the pipeline, but it is also, as I mentioned earlier, the level of engagement that we are seeing. I mentioned the 3 executives that I recently spent time with. I'll tell you a very quick story about the gentleman named Stephen Hemsley, who is the CEO of UnitedHealth Group, who spent hours with me talking about his vision for health care and his industry and why he was committed to working with us, hence, signed an agreement with the quarter. But there are dozens and dozens of those conversations that are taking place. Marc recently came back from Europe where he was surrounded with other CEOs that he may want to comment on, talking about the opportunity to drive transformation and customer engagement in their businesses. So I think the level of engagement is very strong. The pipeline feels very, very good.

And we've -- you do get a quarter now and then with some specific geography. In this case, the United States had some softness. And it's just the nature of enterprise software, and that's where we are. I don't attribute it to any other factor than that, and that's just what it is, what it is. And you move on to the third quarter and assess your pipelines, and ours are full and rich. And you assess your competitive position, and our win rates are strong. And you look at where your innovation cycle is, and we've never had a bigger new product cycle as your question indicates, which is at -- when we roll into Dreamforce, we are going to have an incredible release of Einstein. You're going to see dramatic enhancements to our Salesforce Lightning platform, new mobile capabilities and enhancements with Salesforce1. Of course, the productivity tools available through Quip, which is remarkable live document. So if everyone has a -- downloaded and started using Quip, whether it's on your phone or your iPad or on your laptop, I mean, it's just a remarkable piece of technology. And then we, of course, have some of these incredible new platforms that we did not have a year ago like e-commerce cloud. So all of that together provides for a very exciting Dreamforce. And in regards to how we price it, you've seen that Sales Cloud continues to do really well even though it's a monster in terms of revenue, and one of the reasons that growth continues is because we have these amazing options available with Sales Cloud like, of course, Pardot. We all know that, which is an incredible product that we picked up with -- when we bought ExactTarget 3 years ago. We also have another amazing option on Sales Cloud, which is CPQ or SteelBrick, which is another amazing option that we picked up last year. And there will be another amazing option with Einstein for Sales Cloud to give you this incredible intelligence, so you're going to see some awesome capabilities. You can also have those kind of options available with it like, for example, Analytics Cloud will have the Einstein option as well to make machine intelligence part of your analytics journey. So there's a lot of exciting things coming for Dreamforce. And nobody likes to see softness in any particular region. This did seem quite isolated, in my opinion, to the U.S. Like I said, we really saw some great growth and deal flow in the United States, but we did get a bit of softness at the very end of the quarter. And then we had a great performance in Europe. We had great performance in Asia Pacific. We had great -- I mean, we're at -- Japan had a record quarter and a record month in July. So it's just -- it's an incredible part of the enterprise industry, and it's something that you learn to not only just manage through but use to make your company stronger and stronger and stronger, which is exactly what we did the last time that we saw that, which was in the quarter that you talked about."

Last week, I was with them and had -- was with a lot of customers, CEOs, so CEO of Unilever and ABB and Coca-Cola and PricewaterhouseCoopers and the CEO of Bank of America. And in each and every case, those customers are not only absorbing more and more of our technology than ever before, but they're getting more aggressive about their digital transformation. I mean, today, ABB, which is an incredible manufacturing company based in Switzerland, they deployed now more than 20,000 users and are connecting all of their machines and building an incredible customer network using Salesforce. When I look at the work that Brian is doing at BofA, again, it's a huge fundamental transformation of this business to be customer first and to be digital and to be integrated in. And both of those companies and the other companies I had mentioned have chosen Salesforce as their CRM platform to do that work. And I could go through dozens and dozens and dozens of others that I think at that pace, not just digital transformation but what I would say is customer transformation, creating a customer-first environment that is intelligent and mobile and one that allows their companies to build these one-on-one relationships with either their B2B customers or B2C customers as well. This is a pace of change that I've never seen, and I don't think that there's a company that's -- that we're working with today who is reducing their digital transformations of anything. I think almost every single one that I met with this quarter and I have even spent a couple of weeks in Japan this quarter are accelerating it."

Alex, thank you for the note on the full revenue operating framework and how do we think about profitability and triggers and such. As Marc said, we think about that a lot. Growth is #1. And as he showed and as we showed this quarter, would it be at the bottom line as we're showing for the year with our guide? Operating margin expansion's important to us as well, very consistent with our framework. Clearly, when you think about the trigger points of that framework, it's growth rates, and we think about those 3 categories. And what that brings to mind for me for this quarter and this information that we're sharing with you, we have a guide that's in the 25-ish percent revenue growth rate for the year, again, as we said, the third raise of the year. And that's what that number looks like. And then, of course, what we haven't talked about as much is the $11.8 billion of build in unbilled deferred revenue that grew that big number at 28% in aggregate. So we think about growth a lot. We think about profitability a lot. We think about the revenue framework that's very much intact.

Well, I'll tell you that you're absolutely right, and it's obviously one of the reasons that we have invested so significantly in artificial intelligence.

Well, I'll tell you that you're absolutely right, and it's obviously one of the reasons that we have invested so significantly in artificial intelligence. We strongly believe that when we look at the future of Salesforce, when we look at the future of our industry, of course, we've seen the evolution from the cloud. We talked about that on many calls. We talked about social. We've talked about mobile. I think we're really now evolved into kind of 4 key areas, and my employees and executives all know that I feel very strongly around this. But of course, the absolute first one is intelligence. That is companies demand that your software is going to be intelligent, smart, that you're going to have machine learning and deep learning and machine intelligence built in, that it's going to be excellent, that, that machine intelligence is going to be declarative as well as programmatic that you're not going to leave no customer behind. If a customer is a programmer, they can use it. If a customer is nonprogrammatic or what we call declarative, they're going to be able to use it. This is very important going forward, and I really believe we're going to have the best artificial intelligence platform in the industry. We have phenomenal executives, phenomenal minds. The progress so far has been incredible. And I think when you see Einstein, you'll see that it is on par and capable of any other AI platform that you've seen like Watson and others, but with Einstein, it has these capabilities like non-programmatic capabilities as well as programmatic capabilities that is built into our applications as well as being independent. And I think that'll be very powerful. Two, platform, I think everybody knows that I strongly believe you can't just build a platform today -- I can't just build an application. You have to build platforms, and these platforms also have to be declarative as well as programmatic. And I -- of course, I'm biased, but I believe that our Lightning platform is the best in enterprise software. You can build applications that run on any device, whether it's any phone or any tablet or any PC or any type of IoT capability. And I believe that Lightning will be an incredible capability for us going forward. And three is mobility. That is Salesforce now has millions of users on its mobile platforms. I know many people on this call use Salesforce1 everyday. We have many other key mobile technologies like Salesforce Inbox and others available as well. And mobility remains a huge focus for Salesforce. And when you come to Dreamforce, you're going to see more and more capable -- capabilities on mobility. As billions of users around the world go online on their phones, they want to be able to do that with Salesforce, run their business from their phone, and Salesforce1 remains, I believe, the absolute most popular application development deployment vehicle for mobile. And finally, productivity. We have to have productivity built in. All of our applications need to have core productivity applications, whether it is e-mail or like with Salesforce Inbox or spreadsheets or word processers like Quip, live documents. All of that has to be an integral -- an integrated part of what we're doing. We believe that strongly. We've obviously done a lot of great work with Microsoft as well with their product. We have now our own product in this category, and this is going to be really important for us going forward. And it's the reason that [ph] we bought Quip. It's because we believe productivity is the fourth leg of the stool and that when you look at artificial intelligence, platform, mobility and productivity and then you look on top of that our core applications in sales, service, marketing, community analytics apps, IoT and e-commerce and you could even break productivity out of its own application category, I think all of you know productivity itself has a huge TAM, $26 billion a year TAM, those 9 applications differentiated by these 4 capabilities. That's how I look at where our product line is going and what I hope to be able to articulate that in a much simpler, much easier to understand way when we get to Dreamforce for our customers."

As you know, over 3 years ago, Marc asked -- Marc and I had many, many conversations of both coming onto Salesforce, which I was super excited about, and I continue to be super excited about being here. But a couple of the charters coming onboard here was obviously to continue the outstanding operational excellence of our broader market, our SMB business, but really to accelerate into the enterprise, and I think we've made excellent progress there. But as you continue this SMB business and accelerate into the enterprise, of course, you're going to be balancing out the portfolio. And by definition, the nature of enterprise typically is back ended in the second half of years, so I think it's natural to expect that, that will drive some degree of seasonality through the second half of the year. But we run a balanced portfolio of business, and that's what we strive to every single day."

So essentially all of the major services firms experienced problems recently, and that included Cognizant and Infosys and Genpact and a whole bunch of others. And I do believe several of them mentioned softness in digital projects in the month of July. I think some of that was attributed to the big banks that we're counting on a mid-year interest rate increase, which did not happen partially as a result of the Brexit vote. I'm just curious. Do you look at all of that as purely coincidental relative to what you mentioned at the end of the quarter in the U.S.? Or is it possible that there was a bit of a brief pause, maybe a little macro induced that just potentially may have pushed some number of transactions out of Q2 and perhaps is leading into a bigger second half of the year?"

If I always went to kind of these macroeconomic views and well, well, it's a low growth rate environment or it's a low interest rate environment or it's this or it's that, you're not able to really just focus on and work on your own business. And as an example of that is Japan this quarter. I spent 2 weeks in Japan. Japan is a very exciting IT environment. It still is a huge part of the enterprise software industry, and we're just still getting going in Japan. We're at the beginning of our Japan journey, and yet, we have these incredible relationships with some of the most -- Japan's most important companies and government agencies.

Number one, I'm a big believer of innovation, and it is at the core of this company. It's part of our DNA, and we are blessed to be -- all of us to be working in a company that drives innovation. And all these products that you mentioned, whether it's IQ or SteelBrick or our IoT Cloud, these are things that our customers are very, very excited about. And by the way, the reason why we build these products or acquire these companies is because not only do we have a great strategy, but part of that strategy is because we listen to our customers and we think about what's important to their future. So we have a whole portfolio of solutions. We will continue to enrich that portfolio of solutions. Part of the strategic weapon, if you will, of this company is a focus -- a relentless focus on what we referred to as enablement, which is just training our people. We have an incredible platform for that called Trailhead, which you'll continue to hear the company talk more and more and more about because it's an exciting way to enable employees, and we use it on ourselves. And all of our people are subject to building trails and taking advantage of the incredible training and content. And I think we do that as well as any company that I've ever seen, and I think that's one of the things that really separates us from the rest. So again, when I talk about our optimism around the second half and our pipelines for the second half, it is because we have such a rich portfolio. It's because we have a high performing organization, and it's because we know how to enable these people. Now enablement, there -- I will tell you, for a company like us, there's no end of job, okay? So I think we all, as leaders in the company, no matter what line of business we're responsible for, we wake up every day and think about what's the best way for us to onboard our employees, what's the best way to continue to educate them on new product releases, what's the best way to make sure they work prepared that they deliver value to our customers. And that's why enablement is so important to us as a company, and that's why we focus so much of our attention on it."

So revenue, as you see, has grown 25% in dollars and 26% year-over-year in constant currency to more than $2 billion. And just congratulations to everyone at Salesforce. This is our first $2 billion quarter, and also no other enterprise software company of our size and scale is delivering this kind of growth rate. Congratulations to everyone.
Deferred revenue was $3.8 billion, up 26% in dollars and 27% in constant currency. The dollar value of booked business on and off the balance sheet is now $11.8 billion, which is up 28% from a year ago. We're raising our fiscal 2017 revenue guidance to $8.325 billion at the high end of our range, up 25%, and we're delivering on this strong base of top line growth even as we continue to improve on our non-GAAP operating margin.
Salesforce continues to be the fastest-growing top 10 software company in the world. And last week, Forbes ranked us as one of the most innovative companies in the world for the sixth year in a row and has named Salesforce ""the innovator of the decade."" Thank you, Forbes. And that's a great tribute to our amazing employees, especially our technology and product teams.
Dreamforce is coming up, and you're going to see an incredible level of new innovation when we introduce Salesforce Einstein, the world's first comprehensive artificial intelligence platform for CRM. Salesforce Einstein is AI for everyone. It's going to democratize artificial intelligence. It's going to make every company and every employee smarter, faster and more productive. We are going to deliver the world's smartest CRM.
And as you know, over the last few years, we've acquired a number of AI companies, incredible companies like RelateIQ, MetaMind, Implisit, PredictionIO, Tempo AI and more with amazing, amazing people and technology. We've been able to stitch all this together into this incredible AI platform, and this focus on AI and on the critical aspects of AI as the next wave of our industry has resulted in a machine learning team of more than 175 data scientists who have built this amazing Einstein platform. 
And that's really why I'm so excited and why everyone at Salesforce is so excited, and when you come to Dreamforce, you're going to see how this fits together and how we're delivering Salesforce Einstein. And we're going to have some great new products like Sales Cloud Einstein and Service Cloud Einstein, Marketing Cloud Einstein. We're going to have our Analytics Cloud Einstein and many other artificial intelligence capabilities in all of our clouds, and our customers will be able to build their own AI capabilities using Einstein extensions and Heroku. This is going to be a huge differentiator and growth driver going forward, and it puts us well ahead of our CRM competition once again.
Salesforce Einstein is also a perfect example of how we've been able to combine organic innovation with some amazing acquisitions. We came into this year with a lot of excitement and energy around the investments we made in our own technology. Earlier this year, as you know, market conditions did change. In my leadership, the board and I were presented with some incredible opportunities that we just never thought would be available to us. We took a look at these amazing acquisitions, and our strategy was simple. We will acquire one-of-a-kind companies with unique technologies, amazing engineering teams and, of course, visionary leaders that fit with our mission and our strategic plan to help our customers connect with their customers in new ways. And some of these acquisitions are helping us build out our CRM today; others are laying out the foundation for our future.
A great example is Demandware, a company we've had a great relationship with and have admired, and there's no company like Demandware. It's the clear leader in the multibillion-dollar cloud e-commerce marketplace, a natural extension of our platform. It expands our CRM offering with capabilities our customers have been asking for. And when we've talked to customers like Louis Vuitton or Brunello Cucinelli or See's Candies or even Adidas, they talk about Demandware as the critical part of their e-commerce cloud, and that's how it became Salesforce's e-commerce cloud. It's the solution that our customers drove us to, and we are absolutely thrilled with this great new family of e-commerce products at Salesforce.
We also take advantage of opportunities to invest in our future with incredible companies like Quip. And everyone knows he's -- the great leader of Quip, Bret Taylor, creator of Google Maps and also the former CTO of Facebook, who has created this next-generation technology of live documents, bringing a new level of content and communication and collaboration right into our platform. And with all of this, we're creating the world's smartest CRM through sales, service, marketing, community, analytics, e-commerce and IoT. 
We have never been better positioned for the future. You're going to see that at Dreamforce. It is going to be a rush of innovation. There's never been more new products and more capabilities released at Dreamforce, and you're never going to see a better place to see how all this amazing innovation and products comes together. This is our biggest customer event of the year coming very, very soon, October 4 through 7. We've got more than 2,300 customer speakers inspiring, motivating, empowering, educating our amazing community of customer trailblazers. We also have an amazing lineup of speakers, including Melinda Gates and General Motors' Mary Barra, Congressman John Lewis, many, many more. And you're not going to want to miss U2 performing at our Dreamfest UCSF benefit concert to raise $10 million for children's hospitals. It's going to be an unforgettable event.
Dreamforce is already sold out, so talk to John to get registered, and I'm going to look forward to seeing everybody there. Now let's turn it over to Keith and talk about our customer highlights for the quarter. Keith?"

Overall, we delivered a solid second quarter. Our results reflect our continued focus on becoming more strategic with the enterprise, expanding internationally, investing in our partner ecosystem and broadening our penetration in our target industries.
In each of these areas, we made good progress in Q2. Now at the same time, we saw some softness at the end of the quarter primarily in the United States. And after a thorough operational review of the United States business, from sales to products to marketing, really all aspects of our business, I am confident in our plan for the year. We have a proven and tenured sales leadership team. We have industry-leading products. We have continued high win rates, and our second half pipeline is very strong. We also are seeing very high levels of customer engagement. 
So let me take you through some of the highlights of the quarter. We continued to close some of the biggest and most strategic transactions in the industry. In fact, we closed another 9-figure transaction in Q2 with a Fortune 50 customer. For those of you who are counting, this is now the third quarter in a row where we've established these very strategic 9-figure relationships.
On the international front, over the last few years we have been steadily increasing our distribution capacity, expanding our partner ecosystem, investing in offices and infrastructure, and opening new data centers. And all of these investments are clearly paying off. Europe was our fastest growing region powered by some great strategic wins with Selcom and PostNord and TNT, AXA and Nestlé. Great brands. Asia Pac had some great wins with Shinsei Bank, Meiji Yasuda, Samsung and Telstra. And in Latin America, we expanded our relationship with the largest private bank in Brazil, Itaú.
And in every region, our partners, which is so critical to our strategy, have been a huge part of our success. Our ecosystem continues to expand with incredible ISVs and global and regional SIs. In fact, partner certifications reached 38,000 in the quarter, up 25% from a year ago, which is proof positive that our partner strategy is working and adding to our additional overall capacity. We continue to gain traction from our vertical focus, which furthers our momentum in each of our major industries, and I'd like to share a few of those stories.
In health care, UnitedHealth Group significantly expanded with us to help build its next-generation of patient and customer engagement for more than 125 million people. This is an incredible vision to make health care more cost effective, efficient, predictive and intelligent.
In retail, one of the world's largest brand expanded with us to consolidate their entire guest experience to turn the billions of messages they send to customers in one-to-one journeys that are seamless, intelligent and predictive. 
Macy's is another great example of how a retailer can transform with us. They started with Heroku for just portions of their mobile and e-commerce websites. Now they are bringing Salesforce to 185,000 employees and 1,000-plus HR call center agents. And our momentum in retail is only going to get supercharged with Demandware, our Salesforce commerce cloud.
In financial services, we expanded with State Farm and Nationwide and Farmers and the Advisor Group, one of the largest networks of independent broker-dealers in the country. And they are rolling out the Salesforce Financial Services Cloud to thousands of affiliated advisers. As you know, this is a product we launched just last quarter, and the early interest has been remarkable. These are all incredible stories. I could go on and on. And at Dreamforce, you're going to hear even more from our customers and how they are transforming their business with Salesforce.
Before I close, I'd like to thank the team and the company for their hard work and their efforts driving customer success in the quarter and, of course, to our customers and partners for their trust in us, and I look forward to a strong second half.
And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Mark to talk about our financial performance in the quarter."

Total revenue for the second quarter was up 25% in dollars and 26% in constant currency, excluding a year-over-year FX headwind of $25 million. Demandware contributed $9 million to revenue in the second quarter, which was near the hi",702,"Great. Thanks, Keith. Total revenue for the second quarter was up 25% in dollars and 26% in constant currency, excluding a year-over-year FX headwind of $25 million. Demandware contributed $9 million to revenue in the second quarter, which was near the high end of the guidance we provided in June. Our dollar attrition for the second quarter, which excludes Marketing Cloud, remains below 9%, supporting top line revenue growth.
Looking at revenue by cloud. Sales Cloud grew 13% year-over-year in dollars; Service Cloud grew 29%; App Cloud and Other grew 43%; Marketing Cloud grew 28%, which now includes the subscription and support revenue from Demandware. While many enterprise software companies are aspiring to achieve $1 billion run rate in one product, we already have 3 products with revenue run rates of more than $1 billion today with the Marketing Cloud soon to become our fourth. This gives us multiple levers of growth and provides additional business diversification.
This was another quarter of consistent year-over-year constant-currency revenue growth in our regions with EMEA growing 32% and Asia Pac growing 29%. During the second quarter, FX drove more revenue pressure than expense relief. So very pleased that we were able to still deliver 25 basis points of non-GAAP operating margin improvement year-over-year, our ninth consecutive quarter of expansion, and we achieved this even while we began integrating Demandware and other recent acquisitions.
I've already discussed how FX impacted our P&L, but the more meaningful impact was to the cash flow statement and balance sheet. Cash flow in the quarter was $251 million, down 18% over last year. Operating cash flow was principally impacted by FX headwinds as well as continued deepening of the seasonality of invoicing and onetime costs associated with the acquisition of Demandware. However, I'm very pleased with our cash generation in the first half of the year of $1.3 billion, which is up 25% over the first half of last year.
Deferred revenue ended the quarter at more than 8 -- or $3.8 billion, which includes approximately $23 million related to our acquisition of Demandware. This was up 26% in dollars and 27% in constant currency when excluding a year-over-year FX headwind of $35 million. Sequentially, deferred revenue had an FX headwind of $41 million. This was the largest sequential deferred revenue headwind we have ever seen and highlights the dramatic effect that currency had at the end of Q2. In the quarter, approximately 78% of all subscription and support-related invoices were issued with annual terms. Q2 benefits of deferred revenue from the change in billing frequency was less than 1 percentage point of growth.
Moving on to guidance. Just as FX had a significant impact on our Q2 results, we now expect FX pressures to persist for the remainder of the year with a full year revenue headwind of approximately $100 million to $150 million. In this context, I'm pleased to raise our full year revenue guidance to $8.275 billion to $8.325 billion. At the same time, we're making minor adjustments to our operating model to absorb and integrate recent acquisitions in order to deliver the profitability we committed to. As such, we continue to expect non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.93 to $0.95, which implies approximately 70 basis points of non-GAAP operating margin improvement.
Finally, with FX volatility we've discussed, we're updating our full year operating cash flow guidance to a year-over-year growth rate of 20% to 21%, which allows us to remain on track for our first $2 billion cash flow year. For Q3 we're initiating guidance for the revenue of $2.11 billion to $2.12 billion, non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.20 to $0.21 and year-over-year deferred revenue growth of approximately 20%.
To close, we delivered a solid result in the second quarter, and I'm very pleased to be raising our top line guidance while maintaining bottom line guidance for the year. As Keith said, with our strong pipeline of new business and with Dreamforce in October, we have a great setup as we move to the back half of the year. And I look forward to welcoming many of you at our Analyst Day at Dreamforce in October.

So listen, we're -- we had a solid quarter. Our results were good. We did have some weakness and some softness, if you will, in parts of our business in the United States. As I had mentioned in my earlier comment",354,"Yes. Okay. Keith, thanks for the question. So listen, we're -- we had a solid quarter. Our results were good. We did have some weakness and some softness, if you will, in parts of our business in the United States. As I had mentioned in my earlier comments, we conducted a very, very detailed operational review, which is, by the way, part of our normal cadence. It's what we normally do. But we took a deeper look given that we had some softness in parts of the U.S. And look, at the end of the day, what I would boil this down to is just a bit of blocking and tackling. And we've taken a look at it. We've made the adjustments. We've looked at our playbooks. We've tightened up on a few things. But in these quarters, things push out. Things pull in. And that's happened in every single quarter that I've ever been involved with. And I think many of you know that I've been in this business for over 30 years. So as I said, we've taken a look at the operational aspects of the business. I feel very, very positive about the second half. Our pipeline is strong. Our win rates were very strong in the quarter. Our level of engagement has never been stronger. In fact, over the last 2 weeks, I have spent time with 3 of the CEO and COOs of the top 10 U.S. banks in the United States, and all of them are talking to us about transformation and raising their levels of engagement with customers. And they view us as a trusted adviser, and they want to know how we can help them. They're talking to us. They're talking to Salesforce. They're not talking to other customers. So when I look at the leadership team that we have in place, which has been a very high-performing team historically, when I look at our second half pipeline, when I look at our level of engagement, which is unprecedented, I feel very, very strongly about the second half of the quarter -- of the fiscal year."

Let me just talk about our DR, deferred revenue. Obviously, we have some impact for the foreign exchange. We talked about having such a impact in Q2. It's the biggest sequential change that we have seen ever in the history of Salesforce. So it has to be factored in appropriately. The other thing that I know you'll get, Keith, also is [indiscernible] seasonality and the compounding effect that we talked about at Dreamforce last year. We showed all the map and the multiyear trend that's happening there. Of course, we would look at that as well. But I'd level it up basically and say that we think it's appropriate. And when we look at the overall top line demand of revenue growth as described, I'm just pleased to be able to have -- this is the third time this year that we've raised our annual guidance for revenue for the year. And we're doing that predicated on all the things Keith talked about, the second half pipeline. We're looking at things like our market share. We continue to gain momentum based on the most recent market share data that was released; win ratios. But at the end of the day, what I'm most pleased about doing is doing that for the third time in the face of $100 million to $150 million in FX headwinds at the top line and yet we're still doing a third raise. So I think we have a good setup, as Keith described, and obviously, we have to factor in all the things he covered. That's my point of view. Hope that helps."

Specifically to the M&A question, when we came into this year, we didn't really have M&A on our forecast. And the reason why is because when we look at doing M&A, we look for really strategic, great companies that are one of a kind and also that we're going to get a great price, then we have a tremendous process in our company that includes our Board of Directors, M&A committee as well as our internal corporate development group. And when we looked out, we didn't see that happening. But then there were some pretty big changes that happened in the market, and the first one, I know you covered, which was that LinkedIn did not have a great quarter and their stock dropped by 50%. And when that happened, it really triggered our process because, all of a sudden they -- a great company that is a unique, asset that's strategic was available at a great price. And so we made a bid for LinkedIn. And another company, as you know, Microsoft made a bid and Microsoft outbid us, and that happened for a lot of different reasons, but we thought that, that was a great asset at a great price. Then as the market continues to evolve, we had an incredible situation occur, which is very similar, which is a company that we coveted for many years, Demandware, was all of a sudden approached by another company, and they tried to acquire Demandware. And when it came to our attention, we want to buy them and we put in a bid for Demandware because, again, it's a great company. It was a great price, tremendously strategic fit for our company and our future e-commerce platform. And I had just come back from a trip to LVMH, who uses salesforce for CRM and is also standardized on Demandware, and they said those 2 solutions combined, that's all they needed to manage all their customer information. That was enough to me to go to the board and say, ""Look, we've been approached to buy Demandware. This is a one-of-a-kind opportunity. There's no other leader in cloud e-commerce. Our customers, like LVMH, like others I could go through, are using Demandware. We should acquire this."" And we were successful in that bid. Now as the summer kind of rolled on, I did not expect to get a call from someone who I have incredible respect for, Bret Taylor, who's the CEO of Quip, followed his career for many years. I try to have dinner with him once a month. Everyone knows the incredible work he did with Google Maps. Everyone knows he was a CTO of Facebook, and he had accepted an investment from Salesforce in his company. And we were talking about the possibility of Salesforce acquiring his company and him joining our team as one of our top technical leaders, and that's a dream that this company has had for several years. Everyone here, and many people in the industry as well, covet and love Bret. And when we had that opportunity, we took that. And so our beginning of our fiscal year plan not to acquire any companies all of a sudden turned into we acquired 2 very important companies with Demandware and also Quip, and we've also found a couple of other great companies as well. And this M&A window, I talked about that, I think, on the last call and openly in the press, I think same staff [ph] open for the year. I think it will probably close probably at the end of this calendar year. But it's been a incredible time for us to acquire some phenomenal assets, and I've never been more excited about Salesforce and our product line, and coming into Dreamforce, like I said, is just awesome. And specifically on the goal, well, I'm not giving forward guidance, of course. But yes, we are -- you're right. You can do the math and so can I. We're about to get very close to being able to start talking about our $10 billion year. We're not doing that on this call. And you can see it in our core numbers that when we pass through that, we are going to be taking a very aggressive goal to double the company. I'm very committed to top line growth, as you know. I'm also very committed to bottom line growth. I will not grow the company without also growing the bottom line, and we've proven that, and you can see that on the press release that's in front of you that the top and bottom line have grown really well this quarter. And we'll continue to do that, and we'll continue to do that while being able to participate in this M&A environment because, as you can see, not only did we buy the companies, but we also beat our numbers. So we will continue to execute that. I hope that answers your questions."

And we get an incredible turnout from our customers and our partners, but we feel very, very strongly about that pipeline.

I mentioned the 3 executives that I recently spent time with.

But there are dozens and dozens of those conversations that are taking place.

And it's just the nature of enterprise software, and that's where we are. I don't attribute it to any other factor than that, and that's just what it is, what it is. And you move on to the third quarter and assess your pipelines, and ours are full and rich. And you assess your competitive position, and our win rates are strong. And you look at where your innovation cycle is, and we've never had a bigger new product cycle as your question indicates, which is at -- when we roll into Dreamforce, we are going to have an incredible release of Einstein. You're going to see dramatic enhancements to our Salesforce Lightning platform, new mobile capabilities and enhancements with Salesforce1. Of course, the productivity tools available through Quip, which is a remarkable live document. So if everyone hasn't downloaded and started using Quip, whether it's on your phone or your iPad or on your laptop, I mean, it's just a remarkable piece of technology. And then we, of course, have some of these incredible new platforms that we did not have a year ago like e-commerce cloud. So all of that together provides for a very exciting Dreamforce. And in regards to how we price it, you've seen that Sales Cloud continues to do really well even though it's a monster in terms of revenue, and one of the reasons that growth continues is because we have these amazing options available with Sales Cloud like, of course, Pardot. We all know that, which is an incredible product that we picked up with -- when we bought ExactTarget 3 years ago. We also have another amazing option on Sales Cloud, which is CPQ or SteelBrick, which is another amazing option that we picked up last year. And there'll be another amazing option with Einstein for Sales Cloud to give you this incredible intelligence, so you're going to see some awesome capabilities. You can also have those kind of options available with it like, for example, Analytics Cloud will have the Einstein option as well to make machine intelligence part of your analytics journey. So there's a lot of exciting things coming for Dreamforce. And nobody likes to see softness in any particular region. This did seem quite isolated, in my opinion, to the U.S. Like I said, we really saw some great growth and deal flow in the United States, but we did get a bit of softness at the very end of the quarter. And then we had a great performance in Europe. We had great performance in Asia Pacific. We had great -- I mean, we're at -- Japan had a record quarter and a record month in July. So it's just -- it's an incredible part of the enterprise industry, and it's something that you learn to not only just manage through but use to make your company stronger and stronger and stronger, which is exactly what we did the last time that we saw that, which was in the quarter that you talked about."

And in each and every case, those customers are not only absorbing more and more of our technology than ever before, but they're getting more aggressive about their digital transformation. I mean, today, ABB, which is an incredible manufacturing company based in Switzerland, they deploy now more than 20,000 users and are connecting all of their machines and building an incredible customer network using Salesforce. When I look at the work that Brian is doing at BofA, again, it's a huge fundamental transformation of this business to the customer first and to be digital and to be integrated in. And both of those companies and the other companies I'd mentioned have chosen Salesforce as their CRM platform to do that work. And I could go through dozens and dozens and dozens of others that I think at that pace, not just digital transformation but what I would say is customer transformation, creating a customer-first environment that is intelligent and mobile and one that allows their companies to build these one-on-one relationships with either their B2B customers or B2C customers as well. This is a pace of change that I've never seen, and I don't think that there's a company that's -- that we're working with today who is reducing their digital transformations.

Alex, thank you for the note on the full revenue operating margin framework and how do we think about profitability and triggers and such. As Marc said, we think about that a lot. Growth is #1. And as he showed and as we showed this quarter, would it be at the bottom line as we're showing for the year with our guide? Operating margin expansion's important to us as well, very consistent with our framework. Clearly, when you think about the trigger points of that framework, it's growth rates, and we think about those 3 categories. And what that brings to mind for me for this quarter and this information that we're sharing with you, we have a guide that's in the 25-ish percent revenue growth rate for the year, again, as we said, the third raise of the year. And that's what that number looks like. And then, of course, what we haven't talked about as much is the $11.8 billion of build and unbilled deferred revenue that grew that big number at 28% in aggregate. So we think about growth a lot. We think about profitability a lot. We think about the revenue framework that's very much intact. You've heard from Marc and heard from me, but clearly, it's keeping growth #1 and -- but also delivering the profitability consistent with that framework. But clearly, growth is the trigger."

122917,378369792,1040510,"salesforce.com, inc., Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Aug 31, 2016",2016-08-31,"Earnings Calls","Salesforce, Inc.","Executives","Yes. Well, I'll tell you that you're absolutely right, and it's obviously one of the reasons that we have invested so significantly in artificial intelligence. We strongly believe that when we look at the future of Salesforce, when we look at the future o",719,"Yes. Well, I'll tell you that you're absolutely right, and it's obviously one of the reasons that we have invested so significantly in artificial intelligence. We strongly believe that when we look at the future of Salesforce, when we look at the future of our industry, of course, we've seen the evolution from the cloud. We talked about that on many calls. We talked about social. We've talked about mobile. I think we're really now evolved into kind of 4 key areas, and my employees and executives all know that I feel very strongly around this. But of course, the absolute first one is intelligence. That is companies demand that your software is going to be intelligent, smart, that you're going to have machine learning and deep learning and machine intelligence built in, that it's going to be excellent, that, that machine intelligence is going to be declarative as well as programmatic that you're not going to leave no customer behind. If a customer is a programmer, they can use it. If a customer is nonprogrammatic or what we call declarative, they're going to be able to use it. But this is very important going forward, and I really believe we're going to have the best artificial intelligence platform in the industry. We have phenomenal executives, phenomenal minds. The progress so far has been incredible. And I think when you see Einstein, you'll see that it is on par and capable with any other AI platform that you've seen like Watson and others, but with Einstein, it has these capabilities like nonprogrammatic capabilities as well as programmatic capabilities that is built into our applications as well as being independent. And I think that'll be very powerful. Two, platform, I think everybody knows that I strongly believe you can't just build a platform today -- can't just build an application. You have to build platforms, and these platforms also have to be declarative as well as programmatic. And I -- of course, I'm biased, but I believe that our Lightning platform is the best in enterprise software. You can build applications that run on any device, whether it's any phone or any tablet or any PC or any type of IoT capability. And I believe that Lightning will be an incredible capability for us going forward. And three is mobility. That is Salesforce now has millions of users on its mobile platforms. I know many people on this call use Salesforce1 every day. We have many other key mobile technologies like Salesforce Inbox and others available as well. And mobility remains a huge focus for Salesforce. And when you come to Dreamforce, you're going to see more and more capable -- capabilities on mobility. As billions of users around the world go online on their phones, they want to be able to do that with Salesforce, run their business from their phone, and Salesforce1 remains, I believe, the absolute most popular application development and deployment vehicle for mobile. And finally, productivity. We have to have productivity built in. All of our applications need to have core productivity applications, whether it is e-mail or like with Salesforce Inbox or spreadsheets or word processers like Quip, live documents. All of that has to be an integral -- an integrated part of what we're doing. We believe that strongly. We've obviously done a lot of great work with Microsoft as well with their product. We have now our own product in this category, and this is going to be really important for us going forward. And it's reason [ph] that we bought Quip is because we believed productivity is the fourth leg of the stool, and that when you look at artificial intelligence, platform, mobility and productivity and then you look on top of that our core applications in sales, service, marketing, community analytics apps, IoT and e-commerce, and you could even break productivity out as its own application category, I think all of you know productivity itself has a huge TAM, $26 billion a year TAM, those 9 applications differentiated by these 4 capabilities. That's how I look at where our product line is going and what I hope to be able to articulate that in a much simpler, much easier to understand way when we get to Dreamforce for our customers."

As you know, over 3 years ago, Marc asked -- Marc and I had many, many conversations of both coming onto Salesforce, which I was super excited about and I continue to be super excited about being here. But a couple of the charters coming onboard here was obviously to continue the outstanding operational excellence of our broader market, our SMB business but really to accelerate into the enterprise, and I think we've made excellent progress there. But as you continue this SMB business and accelerate into the enterprise, of course, you're going to be balancing out the portfolio. And by definition, the nature of enterprise typically is back ended in the second half of years, so I think it's natural to expect that, that will drive some degree of seasonality got the second half of the year. But we run a balanced portfolio of business, and that's what we strive to every single day."

So essentially all of the major services firms experienced problems recently, and that included Cognizant and Infosys and Genpact and a whole bunch of others. And I do believe several of them mentioned softness in digital projects in the month of July. I think some of that was attributed to the big banks that were counting on a midyear interest rate increase, which did not happen partially as a result of the Brexit vote. I'm just curious. Do you look at all of that as purely coincidental relative to what you mentioned at the end of the quarter in the U.S.? Or is it possible that there was a bit of a brief pause, maybe a little macro induced that just potentially may have pushed some number of transactions out of Q2 and perhaps is leading into a bigger second half of the year?"

If I always went to kind of these macroeconomic views and well, well, it's a low growth rate environment or it's a low interest rate environment or it's this or it's that, you're not able to really just focus on and work on your own business. And as an example of that is Japan this quarter. I spent 2 weeks in Japan. Japan is a very exciting IT environment. It still is a huge part of the enterprise software industry, and we're just still getting going in Japan. We're at the beginning of our Japan journey, and yet, we have these incredible relationships with some of the most -- Japan's most important companies and government agencies. And that's how I look at it. What if I had listened to what everyone told me about Japan in the last 18 years, we wouldn't even be doing business there. I just don't believe in that stuff. I believe that you get what you focus on, and you have to answer the question what do you want. And then you focus on that and achieve it and keep it positive.

And all these products that you mentioned, whether it's IQ or SteelBrick or our IoT Cloud, these are things that our customers are very, very excited about. And by the way, the reason why we build these products or acquire these companies is because not only do we have a great strategy, but part of that strategy is because we listen to our customers and we think about what's important to their future. So we have a whole portfolio of solutions. We'll continue to enrich that portfolio of solutions. Part of the strategic weapon, if you will, of this company is a focus -- a relentless focus on what we referred to as enablement, which is training our people. We have an incredible platform for that called Trailhead, which you'll continue to hear the company talk more and more and more about because it's an exciting way to enable employees, and we use it on ourselves. And all of our people are subject to building trails and taking advantage of the incredible training and content. And I think we do that as well as any company that I've ever seen, and I think that's one of the things that really separates us from the pack. So again, when I talk about our optimism around the second half and our pipelines for the second half, it is because we have such a rich portfolio. It's because we have a high-performing organization. And it's because we know how to enable these people. Now enablement, there -- I will tell you, for a company like us, there's no end of job, okay. So I think we all as leaders in the company, no matter what line of business we're responsible for, we wake up every day and think about what's the best way for us to onboard our employees, what's the best way to continue to educate them on new product releases, what's the best way to make sure that we're prepared -- that they deliver value to our customers.

So revenue, as you see, has grown 25% in dollars and 26% year-over-year in constant currency to more than $2 billion. And just congratulations to everyone at Salesforce. This is our first $2 billion quarter, and also no other enterprise software company of our size and scale is delivering this kind of growth rate. Congratulations to everyone.

Salesforce continues to be the fastest-growing top 10 software company in the world. And last week, Forbes ranked us as one of the most innovative companies in the world for the sixth year in a row and has named Salesforce ""the innovator of the decade."" Thank you, Forbes. And that's a great tribute to our amazing employees, especially our technology and product teams.
Dreamforce is coming up, and you're going to see an incredible level of new innovation when we introduce Salesforce Einstein, the world's first comprehensive artificial intelligence platform for CRM. Salesforce Einstein is AI for everyone. It's going to democratize artificial intelligence. It's going to make every company and every employee smarter, faster and more productive. We are going to deliver the world's smartest CRM.
And as you know, over the last few years, we've acquired a number of AI companies, incredible companies like RelateIQ, MetaMind, Implisit, PredictionIO, Tempo AI and more with amazing, amazing people and technology. We've been able to stitch all this together into this incredible AI platform, and this focus on AI and on the critical aspects of AI as the next wave of our industry has resulted in a machine learning team of more than 175 data scientists who have built this amazing Einstein platform. 
And that's really why I'm so excited and why everyone at Salesforce is so excited, and when you come to Dreamforce, you're going to see how this fits together and how we're delivering Salesforce Einstein. And we're going to have some great new products like Sales Cloud Einstein and Service Cloud Einstein, Marketing Cloud Einstein. We're going to have our Analytics Cloud Einstein and many other artificial intelligence capabilities in all of our clouds, and our customers will be able to build their own AI capabilities using Einstein extensions and Heroku. This is going to be a huge differentiator and growth driver going forward, and it puts us well ahead of our CRM competition once again.
Salesforce Einstein is also a perfect example of how we've been able to combine organic innovation with some amazing acquisitions. We came into this year with a lot of excitement and energy around the investments we made in our own technology. Earlier this year, as you know, market conditions did change. In my leadership, the board and I were presented with some incredible opportunities that we just never thought would be available to us. We took a look at these amazing acquisitions, and our strategy was simple. We will acquire one-of-a-kind companies with unique technologies, amazing engineering teams and, of course, visionary leaders that fit with our mission and our strategic plan to help our customers connect with their customers in new ways. And some of these acquisitions are helping us build out our CRM today; others are laying out the foundation for our future.
A great example is Demandware, a company we've had a great relationship with and have admired, and there's no company like Demandware. It's the clear leader in the multibillion-dollar cloud e-commerce marketplace, a natural extension of our platform. It expands our CRM offering with capabilities our customers have been asking for. And when we've talked to customers like Louis Vuitton or Brunello Cucinelli or See's Candies or even Adidas, they talk about Demandware as the critical part of their e-commerce cloud, and that's how it became Salesforce's e-commerce cloud. It's the solution that our customers drove us to, and we are absolutely thrilled with this great new family of e-commerce products at Salesforce.
We also take advantage of opportunities to invest in our future with incredible companies like Quip. And everyone knows he's -- the great leader of Quip, Bret Taylor, creator of Google Maps and also the former CTO of Facebook, who has created this next-generation technology of live documents, bringing a new level of content and communication and collaboration right into our platform. And with all of this, we're creating the world's smartest CRM through sales, service, marketing, community, analytics, e-commerce and IoT. 
We have never been better positioned for the future. You're going to see that at Dreamforce. It is going to be a rush of innovation. There's never been more new products and more capabilities released at Dreamforce, and you're never going to see a better place to see how all this amazing innovation and products comes together. This is our biggest customer event of the year coming very, very soon, October 4 through 7. We've got more than 2,300 customer speakers inspiring, motivating, empowering, educating our amazing community of customer trailblazers. We also have an amazing lineup of speakers, including Melinda Gates and General Motors' Mary Barra, Congressman John Lewis, many, many more. And you're not going to want to miss U2 performing at our Dreamfest UCSF benefit concert to raise $10 million for children's hospitals. It's going to be an unforgettable event.
Dreamforce is already sold out, so talk to John to get registered, and I'm going to look forward to seeing everybody there. Now let's turn it over to Keith and talk about our customer highlights for the quarter. Keith?"

Overall, we delivered a solid second quarter.

Overall, we delivered a solid second quarter. Our results reflect our continued focus on becoming more strategic with the enterprise, expanding internationally, investing in our partner ecosystem and broadening our penetration in our target industries.
In each of these areas, we made good progress in Q2. Now at the same time, we saw some softness at the end of the quarter primarily in the United States. And after a thorough operational review of the United States business, from sales to products to marketing, really all aspects of our business, I am confident in our plan for the year. We have a proven and tenured sales leadership team. We have industry-leading products. We have continued high win rates, and our second half pipeline is very strong. We also are seeing very high levels of customer engagement. 
So let me take you through some of the highlights of the quarter. We continued to close some of the biggest and most strategic transactions in the industry. In fact, we closed another 9-figure transaction in Q2 with a Fortune 50 customer. For those of you who are counting, this is now the third quarter in a row where we've established these very strategic 9-figure relationships.
On the international front, over the last few years we have been steadily increasing our distribution capacity, expanding our partner ecosystem, investing in offices and infrastructure, and opening new data centers. And all of these investments are clearly paying off. Europe was our fastest growing region powered by some great strategic wins with Selcom and PostNord and TNT, AXA and Nestlé. Great brands. Asia Pac had some great wins with Shinsei Bank, Meiji Yasuda, Samsung and Telstra. And in Latin America, we expanded our relationship with the largest private bank in Brazil, Itaú.
And in every region, our partners, which is so critical to our strategy, have been a huge part of our success. Our ecosystem continues to expand with incredible ISVs and global and regional SIs. In fact, partner certifications reached 38,000 in the quarter, up 25% from a year ago, which is proof positive that our partner strategy is working and adding to our additional overall capacity. We continue to gain traction from our vertical focus, which furthers our momentum in each of our major industries, and I'd like to share a few of those stories.
In health care, UnitedHealth Group significantly expanded with us to help build its next-generation of patient and customer engagement for more than 125 million people. This is an incredible vision to make health care more cost effective, efficient, predictive and intelligent.
In retail, one of the world's largest brand expanded with us to consolidate their entire guest experience to turn the billions of messages they send to customers in one-to-one journeys that are seamless, intelligent and predictive. 
Macy's is another great example of how a retailer can transform with us. They started with Heroku for just portions of their mobile and e-commerce websites. Now they are bringing Salesforce to 185,000 employees and 1,000-plus HR call center agents. And our momentum in retail is only going to get supercharged with Demandware, our Salesforce commerce cloud.
In financial services, we expanded with State Farm and Nationwide and Farmers and the Advisor Group, one of the largest networks of independent broker-dealers in the country. And they are rolling out the Salesforce Financial Services Cloud to thousands of affiliated advisers. As you know, this is a product we launched just last quarter, and the early interest has been remarkable. These are all incredible stories. I could go on and on. And at Dreamforce, you're going to hear even more from our customers and how they are transforming their business with Salesforce.
Before I close, I'd like to thank the team and the company for their hard work and their efforts driving customer success in the quarter and, of course, to our customers and partners for their trust in us, and I look forward to a strong second half.
And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Mark to talk about our financial performance in the quarter."
122917,378369792,1040643,"salesforce.com, inc., Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Aug 31, 2016",2016-08-31,"Earnings Calls","Salesforce, Inc.","Executives","Great. Thanks, Keith. Total revenue for the second quarter was up 25% in dollars and 26% in constant currency, excluding a year-over-year FX headwind of $25 million. Demandware contributed $9 million to revenue in the second quarter, which was near the hi",703,"Great. Thanks, Keith. Total revenue for the second quarter was up 25% in dollars and 26% in constant currency, excluding a year-over-year FX headwind of $25 million. Demandware contributed $9 million to revenue in the second quarter, which was near the high end of the guidance we provided in June. Our dollar attrition for the second quarter, which excludes Marketing Cloud, remains below 9%, supporting top line revenue growth.
Looking at revenue by cloud. Sales Cloud grew 13% year-over-year in dollars; Service Cloud grew 29%; App Cloud and Other grew 43%; Marketing Cloud grew 28%, which now includes the subscription and support revenue from Demandware. While many enterprise software companies are aspiring to achieve $1 billion run rate in one product, we already have 3 products with revenue run rates of more than $1 billion today with the Marketing Cloud soon to become our fourth. This gives us multiple levers of growth and provides additional business diversification.
This was another quarter of consistent year-over-year constant currency revenue growth in our regions with EMEA growing 32% and Asia Pac growing 29%. During the second quarter, FX drove more revenue pressure than expense relief. So very pleased that we were able to still deliver 25 basis points of non-GAAP operating margin improvement year-over-year, our ninth consecutive quarter of expansion, and we achieved this even while we began integrating Demandware and other recent acquisitions.
I've already discussed how FX impacted our P&L, but the more meaningful impact was to the cash flow statement and balance sheet. Cash flow in the quarter was $251 million, down 18% over last year. Operating cash flow was principally impacted by FX headwinds as well as continued deepening of the seasonality of invoicing and onetime costs associated with the acquisition of Demandware. However, I'm very pleased with our cash generation in the first half of the year of $1.3 billion, which is up 25% over the first half of last year.
Deferred revenue ended the quarter at more than 8 -- or $3.8 billion, which includes approximately $23 million related to our acquisition of Demandware. This was up 26% in dollars and 27% in constant currency when excluding a year-over-year FX headwind of $35 million. Sequentially, deferred revenue had an FX headwind of $41 million. This was the largest sequential deferred revenue headwind we have ever seen and highlights the dramatic effect that currency had at the end of Q2. In the quarter, approximately 78% of all subscription and support-related invoices were issued with annual terms. Q2 benefits of deferred revenue from the change in billing frequency was less than 1 percentage point of growth.
Moving on to guidance. Just as FX had a significant impact on our Q2 results, we now expect FX pressures to persist for the remainder of the year with a full year revenue headwind of approximately $100 million to $150 million. In this context, I'm pleased to raise our full year revenue guidance to $8.275 billion to $8.325 billion. At the same time, we're making minor adjustments to our operating model to absorb and integrate recent acquisitions in order to deliver the profitability we committed to. As such, we continue to expect non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.93 to $0.95, which implies approximately 70 basis points of non-GAAP operating margin improvement.
Finally, with FX volatility we've discussed, we're updating our full year operating cash flow guidance to a year-over-year growth rate of 20% to 21%, which allows us to remain on track for our first $2 billion cash flow year. For Q3 we're initiating guidance for the revenue of $2.11 billion to $2.12 billion, non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.20 to $0.21 and year-over-year deferred revenue growth of approximately 20%.
To close, we delivered a solid result in the second quarter, and I'm very pleased to be raising our top line guidance while maintaining bottom line guidance for the year. As Keith said, with our strong pipeline of new business and with Dreamforce in October, we have a great setup as we move to the back half of the year. And I look forward to welcoming many of you at our Analyst Day at Dreamforce in October.
And with that, we'll open up the call for questions. Operator?"

So listen, we're -- we had a solid quarter. Our results were good. We did have some weakness and some softness, if you will, in parts of our business in the United States. As I had mentioned in my earlier comment",354,"Yes. Okay. Keith, thanks for the question. So listen, we're -- we had a solid quarter. Our results were good. We did have some weakness and some softness, if you will, in parts of our business in the United States. As I had mentioned in my earlier comments, we conducted a very, very detailed operational review, which is, by the way, part of our normal cadence. It's what we normally do. But we took a deeper look given that we had some softness in parts of the U.S. And look, at the end of the day, what I would boil this down to is just a bit of blocking and tackling. And we've taken a look at it. We've made the adjustments. We've looked at our playbooks. We've tightened up on a few things. But in these quarters, things push out. Things pull in. And that's happened in every single quarter that I've ever been involved with. And I think many of you know that I've been in this business for over 30 years. So as I said, we've taken a look at the operational aspects of the business. I feel very, very positive about the second half. Our pipeline is strong. Our win rates were very strong in the quarter. Our level of engagement has never been stronger. In fact, over the last 2 weeks, I have spent time with 3 of the CEO and COOs of the top 10 U.S. banks in the United States, and all of them are talking to us about transformation and raising their levels of engagement with customers. And they view us as a trusted adviser, and they want to know how we can help them. They're talking to us. They're talking to Salesforce. They're not talking to other customers. So when I look at the leadership team that we have in place, which has been a very high-performing team historically, when I look at our second half pipeline, when I look at our level of engagement, which is unprecedented, I feel very, very strongly about the second half of the quarter -- of the fiscal year."

We talked about having such a impact",289,"Yes, let me pick up on the second point, Keith, the question you asked around DR, and you asked about billings. Let me just talk about our DR, deferred revenue. Obviously, we have some impact for the foreign exchange. We talked about having such a impact in Q2. It's the biggest sequential change that we have seen ever in the history of Salesforce. So it has to be factored in appropriately. The other thing that I know you'll get, Keith, also is [indiscernible] seasonality and the compounding effect that we talked about at Dreamforce last year. We showed all the map and the multiyear trend that's happening there. Of course, we would look at that as well. But I'd level it up basically and say that we think it's appropriate. And when we look at the overall top line demand of revenue growth as described, I'm just pleased to be able to have -- this is the third time this year that we've raised our annual guidance for revenue for the year. And we're doing that predicated on all the things Keith talked about, the second half pipeline. We're looking at things like our market share. We continue to gain momentum based on the most recent market share data that was released; win ratios. But at the end of the day, what I'm most pleased about doing is doing that for the third time in the face of $100 million to $150 million in FX headwinds at the top line and yet we're still doing a third raise. So I think we have a good setup, as Keith described, and obviously, we have to factor in all the things he covered. That's my point of view. Hope that helps."

Specifically to the M&A question, when we came into this year, we didn't really have M&A on our forecast. And the reason why is because when we look at doing M&A, we look for really strategic, great companies that are one of a kind and also that we're going to get a great price, then we have a tremendous process in our company that includes our Board of Directors, M&A committee as well as our internal corporate development group. And when we looked out, we didn't see that happening. But then there were some pretty big changes that happened in the market, and the first one, I know you covered, which was that LinkedIn did not have a great quarter and their stock dropped by 50%. And when that happened, it really triggered our process because, all of a sudden they -- a great company that is a unique, asset that's strategic was available at a great price. And so we made a bid for LinkedIn. And another company, as you know, Microsoft made a bid and Microsoft outbid us, and that happened for a lot of different reasons, but we thought that, that was a great asset at a great price. Then as the market continues to evolve, we had an incredible situation occur, which is very similar, which is a company that we coveted for many years, Demandware, was all of a sudden approached by another company, and they tried to acquire Demandware. And when it came to our attention, we want to buy them and we put in a bid for Demandware because, again, it's a great company. It was a great price, tremendously strategic fit for our company and our future e-commerce platform. And I had just come back from a trip to LVMH, who uses salesforce for CRM and is also standardized on Demandware, and they said those 2 solutions combined, that's all they needed to manage all their customer information. That was enough to me to go to the board and say, ""Look, we've been approached to buy Demandware. This is a one-of-a-kind opportunity. There's no other leader in cloud e-commerce. Our customers, like LVMH, like others I could go through, are using Demandware. We should acquire this."" And we were successful in that bid. Now as the summer kind of rolled on, I did not expect to get a call from someone who I have incredible respect for, Bret Taylor, who's the CEO of Quip, followed his career for many years. I try to have dinner with him once a month. Everyone knows the incredible work he did with Google Maps. Everyone knows he was a CTO of Facebook, and he had accepted an investment from Salesforce in his company. And we were talking about the possibility of Salesforce acquiring his company and him joining our team as one of our top technical leaders, and that's a dream that this company has had for several years. Everyone here, and many people in the industry as well, covet and love Bret. And when we had that opportunity, we took that. And so our beginning of our fiscal year plan not to acquire any companies all of a sudden turned into we acquired 2 very important companies with Demandware and also Quip, and we've also found a couple of other great companies as well. And this M&A window, I talked about that, I think, on the last call and openly in the press, I think same staff [ph] open for the year. I think it will probably close probably at the end of this calendar year. But it's been a incredible time for us to acquire some phenomenal assets, and I've never been more excited about Salesforce and our product line, and coming into Dreamforce, like I said, is just awesome. And specifically on the goal, well, I'm not giving forward guidance, of course. But yes, we are -- you're right. You can do the math and so can I. We're about to get very close to being able to start talking about our $10 billion year. We're not doing that on this call. And you can see it in our core numbers that when we pass through that, we are going to be taking a very aggressive goal to double the company. I'm very committed to top line growth, as you know. I'm also very committed to bottom line growth. I will not grow the company without also growing the bottom line, and we've proven that, and you can see that on the press release that's in front of you that the top and bottom line have grown really well this quarter. And we'll continue to do that, and we'll continue to do that while being able to participate in this M&A environment because, as you can see, not only did we buy the companies, but we also beat our numbers. So we will continue to execute that. I hope that answers your questions."

And we've -- you do get a quarter now and then with some specific geography. In this case, the United States has some softness. And it's just the nature of enterprise software, and that's where we are. I don't attribute it to any other factor than that, and that's just what it is, what it is. And you move on to the third quarter and assess your pipelines, and ours are full and rich. And you assess your competitive position, and our win rates are strong. And you look at where your innovation cycle is, and we've never had a bigger new product cycle as your question indicates, which is at -- when we roll into Dreamforce, we are going to have an incredible release of Einstein. You're going to see dramatic enhancements to our Salesforce Lightning platform, new mobile capabilities and enhancements with Salesforce1. Of course, the productivity tools available through Quip, which is a remarkable live document. So if everyone hasn't downloaded and started using Quip, whether it's on your phone or your iPad or on your laptop, I mean, it's just a remarkable piece of technology. And then we, of course, have some of these incredible new platforms that we did not have a year ago like e-commerce cloud. So all of that together provides for a very exciting Dreamforce. And in regards to how we price it, you've seen that Sales Cloud continues to do really well even though it's a monster in terms of revenue, and one of the reasons that growth continues is because we have these amazing options available with Sales Cloud like, of course, Pardot. We all know that, which is an incredible product that we picked up with -- when we bought ExactTarget 3 years ago. We also have another amazing option on Sales Cloud, which is CPQ or SteelBrick, which is another amazing option that we picked up last year. And there'll be another amazing option with Einstein for Sales Cloud to give you this incredible intelligence, so you're going to see some awesome capabilities. You can also have those kind of options available with it like, for example, Analytics Cloud will have the Einstein option as well to make machine intelligence part of your analytics journey. So there's a lot of exciting things coming for Dreamforce. And nobody likes to see softness in any particular region. This did seem quite isolated, in my opinion, to the U.S. Like I said, we really saw some great growth and deal flow in the United States, but we did get a bit of softness at the very end of the quarter. And then we had a great performance in Europe. We had great performance in Asia Pacific. We had great -- I mean, we're at -- Japan had a record quarter and a record month in July. So it's just -- it's an incredible part of the enterprise industry, and it's something that you learn to not only just manage through but use to make your company stronger and stronger and stronger, which is exactly what we did the last time that we saw that, which was in the quarter that you talked about."

Last week, I was with them and had -- was with a lot of customers, CEOs, so CEO of Unilever and ABB and Coca-Cola and PricewaterhouseCoopers and the CEO of Bank of America. And in each and every case, those customers are not only absorbing more and more of our technology than ever before, but they're getting more aggressive about their digital transformation. I mean, today, ABB, which is an incredible manufacturing company based in Switzerland, they deploy now more than 20,000 users and are connecting all of their machines and building an incredible customer network using Salesforce. When I look at the work that Brian is doing at BofA, again, it's a huge fundamental transformation of this business to the customer first and to be digital and to be integrated in. And both of those companies and the other companies I'd mentioned have chosen Salesforce as their CRM platform to do that work. And I could go through dozens and dozens and dozens of others that I think at that pace, not just digital transformation but what I would say is customer transformation, creating a customer-first environment that is intelligent and mobile and one that allows their companies to build these one-on-one relationships with either their B2B customers or B2C customers as well. This is a pace of change that I've never seen, and I don't think that there's a company that's -- that we're working with today who is reducing their digital transformations. If anything, I think almost every single one that I met with this quarter and I have even spent a couple weeks in Japan this quarter are accelerating it."

Alex, thank you for the note on the full revenue operating margin framework and how do we think about profitability and triggers and such. As Marc said, we think about that a lot. Growth is #1. And as he showed and as we showed this quarter, would it be at the bottom line as we're showing for the year with our guide? Operating margin expansion's important to us as well, very consistent with our framework. Clearly, when you think about the trigger points of that framework, it's growth rates, and we think about those 3 categories. And what that brings to mind for me for this quarter and this information that we're sharing with you, we have a guide that's in the 25-ish percent revenue growth rate for the year, again, as we said, the third raise of the year. And that's what that number looks like. And then, of course, what we haven't talked about as much is the $11.8 billion of build and unbilled deferred revenue that grew that big number at 28% in aggregate. So we think about growth a lot. We think about profitability a lot. We think about the revenue framework that's very much intact. You've heard from Marc and heard from me, but clearly, it's keeping growth #1 and -- but also delivering the profitability consistent with that framework. But clearly, growth is the trigger."

Well, I'll tell you that you're absolutely right, and it's obviously one of the reasons that we have invested so significantly in artificial intelligence.

Well, I'll tell you that you're absolutely right, and it's obviously one of the reasons that we have invested so significantly in artificial intelligence. We strongly believe that when we look at the future of Salesforce, when we look at the future of our industry, of course, we've seen the evolution from the cloud. We talked about that on many calls. We talked about social. We've talked about mobile. I think we're really now evolved into kind of 4 key areas, and my employees and executives all know that I feel very strongly around this. But of course, the absolute first one is intelligence. That is companies demand that your software is going to be intelligent, smart, that you're going to have machine learning and deep learning and machine intelligence built in, that it's going to be excellent, that, that machine intelligence is going to be declarative as well as programmatic that you're not going to leave no customer behind. If a customer is a programmer, they can use it. If a customer is nonprogrammatic or what we call declarative, they're going to be able to use it. But this is very important going forward, and I really believe we're going to have the best artificial intelligence platform in the industry. We have phenomenal executives, phenomenal minds. The progress so far has been incredible. And I think when you see Einstein, you'll see that it is on par and capable with any other AI platform that you've seen like Watson and others, but with Einstein, it has these capabilities like nonprogrammatic capabilities as well as programmatic capabilities that is built into our applications as well as being independent. And I think that'll be very powerful. Two, platform, I think everybody knows that I strongly believe you can't just build a platform today -- can't just build an application. You have to build platforms, and these platforms also have to be declarative as well as programmatic. And I -- of course, I'm biased, but I believe that our Lightning platform is the best in enterprise software. You can build applications that run on any device, whether it's any phone or any tablet or any PC or any type of IoT capability. And I believe that Lightning will be an incredible capability for us going forward. And three is mobility. That is Salesforce now has millions of users on its mobile platforms. I know many people on this call use Salesforce1 every day. We have many other key mobile technologies like Salesforce Inbox and others available as well. And mobility remains a huge focus for Salesforce. And when you come to Dreamforce, you're going to see more and more capable -- capabilities on mobility. As billions of users around the world go online on their phones, they want to be able to do that with Salesforce, run their business from their phone, and Salesforce1 remains, I believe, the absolute most popular application development and deployment vehicle for mobile. And finally, productivity. We have to have productivity built in. All of our applications need to have core productivity applications, whether it is e-mail or like with Salesforce Inbox or spreadsheets or word processers like Quip, live documents. All of that has to be an integral -- an integrated part of what we're doing. We believe that strongly. We've obviously done a lot of great work with Microsoft as well with their product. We have now our own product in this category, and this is going to be really important for us going forward. And it's reason [ph] that we bought Quip is because we believed productivity is the fourth leg of the stool, and that when you look at artificial intelligence, platform, mobility and productivity and then you look on top of that our core applications in sales, service, marketing, community analytics apps, IoT and e-commerce, and you could even break productivity out as its own application category, I think all of you know productivity itself has a huge TAM, $26 billion a year TAM, those 9 applications differentiated by these 4 capabilities. That's how I look at where our product line is going and what I hope to be able to articulate that in a much simpler, much easier to understand way when we get to Dreamforce for our customers."

As you know, over 3 years ago, Marc asked -- Marc and I had many, many conversations of both coming onto Salesforce, which I was super excited about and I continue to be super excited about being here. But a couple of the charters coming onboard here was obviously to continue the outstanding operational excellence of our broader market, our SMB business but really to accelerate into the enterprise, and I think we've made excellent progress there. But as you continue this SMB business and accelerate into the enterprise, of course, you're going to be balancing out the portfolio. And by definition, the nature of enterprise typically is back ended in the second half of years, so I think it's natural to expect that, that will drive some degree of seasonality got the second half of the year.

So essentially all of the major services firms experienced problems recently, and that included Cognizant and Infosys and Genpact and a whole bunch of others. And I do believe several of them mentioned softness in digital projects in the month of July. I think some of that was attributed to the big banks that were counting on a midyear interest rate increase, which did not happen partially as a result of the Brexit vote. I'm just curious. Do you look at all of that as purely coincidental relative to what you mentioned at the end of the quarter in the U.S.? Or is it possible that there was a bit of a brief pause, maybe a little macro induced that just potentially may have pushed some number of transactions out of Q2 and perhaps is leading into a bigger second half of the year?"

If I always went to kind of these macroeconomic views and well, well, it's a low growth rate environment or it's a low interest rate environment or it's this or it's that, you're not able to really just focus on and work on your own business. And as an example of that is Japan this quarter. I spent 2 weeks in Japan. Japan is a very exciting IT environment. It still is a huge part of the enterprise software industry, and we're just still getting going in Japan. We're at the beginning of our Japan journey, and yet, we have these incredible relationships with some of the most -- Japan's most important companies and government agencies.

That's what we called out when we set that guide. And so that's something you should think about as you think about billings from that standpoint. By the way, I just want to call out, we're super pleased to have Demandware. It's just an exciting added functionality and a unique asset, as Marc called out, that we are super happy to have. So I hope that dimensionalizes and helps you to think about how to factor that into billings."

And I imagine kind of bringing all these products out, go to market varies by product, but you've got to do things like train the sales force, train the channel, maybe create new dedicated teams. Maybe there's new ELA type of engagements now coming into play. So I'm curious, do you think that all these product releases may have laid on near-term sales productivity, your sales cycles? And then what's your strategy over the next 6 to 12 months to help push greater adoption of these newer products?"

Here's the way I would look at this. Number one, I'm a big believer of innovation, and it is at the core of this company. It's part of our DNA, and we are blessed to be -- all of us, to be working in a company",417,"Okay, great. So that's an excellent question. Here's the way I would look at this. Number one, I'm a big believer of innovation, and it is at the core of this company. It's part of our DNA, and we are blessed to be -- all of us, to be working in a company that drives innovation. And all these products that you mentioned, whether it's IQ or SteelBrick or our IoT Cloud, these are things that our customers are very, very excited about. And by the way, the reason why we build these products or acquire these companies is because not only do we have a great strategy, but part of that strategy is because we listen to our customers and we think about what's important to their future. So we have a whole portfolio of solutions. We'll continue to enrich that portfolio of solutions. Part of the strategic weapon, if you will, of this company is a focus -- a relentless focus on what we referred to as enablement, which is training our people. We have an incredible platform for that called Trailhead, which you'll continue to hear the company talk more and more and more about because it's an exciting way to enable employees, and we use it on ourselves. And all of our people are subject to building trails and taking advantage of the incredible training and content. And I think we do that as well as any company that I've ever seen, and I think that's one of the things that really separates us from the pack. So again, when I talk about our optimism around the second half and our pipelines for the second half, it is because we have such a rich portfolio. It's because we have a high-performing organization. And it's because we know how to enable these people. Now enablement, there -- I will tell you, for a company like us, there's no end of job, okay. So I think we all as leaders in the company, no matter what line of business we're responsible for, we wake up every day and think about what's the best way for us to onboard our employees, what's the best way to continue to educate them on new product releases, what's the best way to make sure that we're prepared -- that they deliver value to our customers. And that's why enablement is so important to us as a company, and that's why we focus so much of our attention on it."

We're coming live to you from New Jersey, where we have the whole team, and we spent the whole week here in New York and having a great time. And it's been great to be here. We just opened our new Salesforce Tower, which is the former MetLife Building at Bryant Park, really cool, great new space for customers, partners, employees. Love to invite all of you there to see what we're going to do with this incredible new building in New York. And Salesforce Tower New York is open and all the signage is going to be going up over the next 6 months. We're really thrilled, and we're in the first floor. It's really -- I couldn't be more excited to be here.  Hey, we're looking forward to having you all visit us there. 
And okay, let's get right to it. You can see from our results, we had an exceptional third quarter. Revenue rose to more than $2.1 billion, up 27% in constant currency from a year ago. You know already there is no other top 10 software company delivering that 27% number.
And what I'm really excited about is we expect to deliver, well, more than $10 billion in revenue in fiscal 2018. I think we initiated guidance at $10.15 billion at the high end of our range, and now we're setting our sights on our next goal, $20 billion. Look, no other software company -- no enterprise software company is delivering this kind of growth at this scale, size.
And we're already off to a great start. Deferred revenue of third quarter grew to $3.5 billion, up 25% in constant currency from a year ago. Dollar value of booked business on, off the balance sheet, more than $12 billion, up 27% year-over-year. That's a great predictor for next year on why we're so aggressive about giving this incredible $10.1 billion to $10.15 billion number now because we have that $12 billion on the balance sheet that's in the deferred.
So let's talk about this. We're really well positioned for the future. Everyone at Dreamforce saw that. We are having an incredible, incredible year. We're growing in this mid- to high 20s range, and we've scaled from $4 billion 3 years ago to $8 billion this year. We see tremendous, tremendous opportunity ahead.
Now today, we're trusted by a global community with 1 billion customers, consumers, citizens, partners and employees, and that's a huge responsibility on our shoulders. What we're excited about is serving all these incredible people all over the world with our services. And just look at our new commerce cloud, supporting 300 million unique shoppers a month. And you saw Adidas, and I love this story, 10,000 pairs of YEEZY shoes. Kanye West, you did a great job on the shoe, in a single hour through the Salesforce Commerce Cloud. Thank you, Kanye. Thank you, Adidas. That's amazing.
In our Marketing Cloud, processing 600 million social posts and more than 1 billion messages a day, really, really exciting and 400 million consumers using that service. So you just look at customer facing apps built with Salesforce Heroku, companies like Macy's, Toyota. We're operating in an incredible scale and now an incredible level of momentum as well.
Over the past several months, I've been spending a lot of time on the road with our customers. I love being with our customers, and this week, of course, was no exception. I'll tell you what I continue to see is this incredible community that surrounds us, and it's been awesome to experience that. I just went through that. I just did the Dreamforce keynote again yesterday here in New York and just having all of these customers so excited about our future, understanding this amazing platform that we've built the future and [ph] B2B and B2C CRM. And you saw this come to life at our sold-out Dreamforce Conference at September, which was way beyond our expectations. I know a lot of the conferences this year have not delivered their results but Dreamforce did. That was awesome. And you saw not just the 170,000 people registered. And everyone was there. I'm sure you saw us packed. But more than 15 million people joining online, that was a huge surprise for us.
And at Dreamforce, you also saw how we're continuing to innovate with Lightning, with Einstein. It's been really, really, really awesome. Of course, probably the most exciting announcement at Dreamforce for a lot of our customers has been Salesforce Einstein. We've extended our Salesforce platform not just with this incredible UI with Lightning, not just with this incredible BI layer with Wave, but now we've extended our Salesforce platform once again with an AI layer with Einstein. And it's really the world's easiest, easiest AI. That is all of these partners, all of these customers are able to easily inherit all of the most state-of-the-art artificial intelligence, whether it's machine learning, machine intelligence, deep learning right inside the Salesforce platform through Einstein. And we're extending that Salesforce platform with amazing new capabilities, with new technologies, new talent, new platform, functionality, and you saw that again this quarter, where we have acquired this incredible DMP, Krux, extending our Marketing Cloud. 
And of course, everybody knows, if you'd been around me at all, you'd see how our whole company now has 20,000 users on Quip. And of course, Facebook has thousands of users on Quip, and other incredible companies like Electronic Arts and many others have thousands of users now on Quip. And if you don't have Quip on your phone yet and you haven't experienced Quip, you should just go to the App Store right now and download Quip, Q-U-I-P. It'll change your life.
I'll tell you, you can really experience next-generation productivity with live, collaborate documents and spreadsheets on our platform, integrated media. It is really cool. And Bret Taylor, former CTO of Facebook, is now at Salesforce and of course, the former legendary Product Manager at Google, who did Google Maps. He just -- he and Kevin Gibbs, his co-Founder, did just a beautiful job on that.
Well, anyway, I could go on and on and on about our products and technology and how exciting this quarter was, but let me turn it over to Keith. And Keith, thanks for coming down from Boston and being here out for the call."
122917,407617374,1089093,"salesforce.com, inc., Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Nov 17, 2016",2016-11-17,"Earnings Calls","Salesforce, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Marc. Thanks, everybody, for joining the call. Listen, Q3 was an outstanding quarter. We had excellent execution from the entire team in all of our key geographies and industries. We're really, really thrilled with the results.We also delivered",761,"Thanks, Marc. Thanks, everybody, for joining the call. Listen, Q3 was an outstanding quarter. We had excellent execution from the entire team in all of our key geographies and industries. We're really, really thrilled with the results.
We also delivered very strong performance in large deals this quarter. Not only did we close a record number of 7-figure-plus transactions in Q3, but the value of those transactions grew significantly. We continue to spend a lot of time with CEOs, and at Dreamforce, our CEO Summit brought together some amazing thought leaders, and they're all looking to drive a new level of innovation in their industries around customer engagement.
And they recognized, is they need an intelligent customer engagement platform that will help them stay ahead of rapidly changing customer expectations. Now this level of dialogue and engagement with these CEOs of some of the most incredible companies in the world, they have put their trust in us, and that has been reflected in our results.
So for example, this quarter, we saw huge strength in financial services, where we signed strategic agreements with 7 of the premier financial services institutions in the United States, including Citi and PNC Bank. And we're very, very excited about these stories, so let me tell you a little bit about PNC. This is a new relationship for Salesforce, and we're helping them streamline operations across all their primary lines of business so that they can reimagine the banking experience for nearly 11 million customers. All their retail call centers and branches will now be powered by Salesforce, and that will help them respond to customers faster. And they'll also use Salesforce to mobilize their corporate and institutional banking team, giving them access to customer information on the go.
Salesforce also signed a strategic agreement with Citi in the quarter. And this is Citi's global consumer bank that will utilize Salesforce for all client facing personnel in their U.S. retail bank, enabling Citi to better serve clients while lowering costs and improving analytics and efficiency. It really is an incredible vision to transform their global consumer bank with a very highly differentiated customer experience.
We had a landmark win with one of the world's largest consumer packaged good companies who needed a complete CRM and e-commerce platform to help them transform from B2B to a B2C business. Now I am having a lot of conversations with customers about this particular type of transformation, and this relationship was the result of excellent collaboration between Salesforce and the Commerce Cloud, which grew its comparable customer gross merchandise value by 22% in constant currency from a year ago. This is an early sign of the power of our combined businesses, and it is creating unmatched value.
Other commerce wins in the quarter included GNC and Shiseido [ph] . Amazon is a great win in the quarter as well. We formed a strategic relationship in Q1 as you all know, and in Q3, that relationship has expanded. And they added even more services throughout the company.
International continues to be an important cornerstone of our growth strategy. In Europe, we had a great win with KONE, one of the world's largest elevator companies. And just last week, I spoke with KONE's CEO, Henrik Ehrnrooth, and his team about our partnership to transform the multi-billion-dollar field service industry together. Very exciting. Their vision is excellent, and they're using Salesforce to mobilize more than 20,000 service technicians. With real-time customer information and service data from connected equipment, they will be able to provide more proactive service and respond to service requests faster than ever.
Telecom Argentina, also new to the Salesforce family. They selected Salesforce to power all their call centers and upgrade the in-store and online experience for more than 25 million customers. We partner very closely with Vlocity to show them an integrated solution in their industry, and it is the testimony of the power of our industry strategy coupled with Salesforce's ecosystem and our ability to work effectively with our partners.
It has also proved positive that our ecosystem is absolutely blossoming. So it's pretty clear that our enterprise strategy, coupled with our continued operational focus, is working. Our investments in key industries, our partner ecosystem and our top international regions are paying off, and we are very well positioned for a strong fiscal -- the remainder of fiscal 2017.
So at this point, I'd like to hand the call over to Mark Hawkins, and he can share some more detail around the financial highlights for the quarter. Mark?"
122917,407617374,1089093,"salesforce.com, inc., Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Nov 17, 2016",2016-11-17,"Earnings Calls","Salesforce, Inc.","Executives","Yes. Thanks, Keith. And I'm very pleased with our financial results for the third quarter. Let me just say that. Total revenue for the quarter was up 25% in dollars and 27% in constant currency, excluding a year-over-year FX headwind of $32 million.The",630,"Yes. Thanks, Keith. And I'm very pleased with our financial results for the third quarter. Let me just say that. Total revenue for the quarter was up 25% in dollars and 27% in constant currency, excluding a year-over-year FX headwind of $32 million.
The Commerce Cloud is off to a great start and had an excellent quarter, contributing $49 million to total revenue after adjusting for purchasing accounting. Our dollar attrition for the third quarter, which excludes Marketing Cloud and other acquired businesses, remained below 9%.
Looking at revenue cloud. Sales -- looking at revenue by cloud. Sales Cloud grew 13% year-over-year. Service Cloud grew 26%. App Cloud and Other grew 38%. Marketing Cloud grew 46%, but then if you exclude approximately $42 million of subscription and support revenue related to Demandware, Marketing Cloud grew 21%. In our region, we delivered another strong quarter of year-over-year constant currency revenue growth in EMEA by growing 27% and Asia Pac by growing 29%.
Now before I move on to cash flow and deferred revenue, I want to remind you that invoicing seasonality is affecting both of these metrics. As we discussed at the last 2 Analyst Days, we continue to see an increase in the seasonality of invoicing, primarily as a result of compounding and to a lesser extent, contract co-terming and a shift toward annual invoicing in Q4.
In that context, third quarter cash flow was $154 million, down 5% over last year. Deferred revenue ended the quarter at $3.5 billion, up 23%. Deferred revenue includes approximately $30 million related to our acquisition of Demandware, up from $23 million in Q2. On a constant currency basis, deferred revenue was up 25% when excluding a year-over-year FX headwind of about $49 million. On a sequential basis, deferred revenue had an FX headwind of $33 million.
In the quarter, approximately 80% of all subscription and support-related invoices were issued with annual terms, excluding Demandware. The Q3 benefit to deferred revenue from the change in billing frequency was less than 1 percentage point of growth.
Now moving on to guidance. I'm pleased to be raising our full year revenue guidance to $8.365 billion to $8.375 billion despite absorbing approximately $100 million to $150 million of FX headwind this year. This implies year-over-year growth for FY '17 of approximately 25%. We expect Demandware and other acquired assets to contribute about 1% to 2 percentage points of growth year-over-year.
We're also raising our full year non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance by $0.03 to $0.97 and $0.98. This raise includes 1% [ph] from operational outperformance and $0.01 from an investment gain in Q3 and $0.01 from an anticipated investment gain in Q4. This guide continues to imply approximately 70 basis points of full year non-GAAP operating margin improvement. We continue to anticipate full year operating cash flow growth of 20% to 21% year-over-year.
For Q4, we're initiating revenue guidance of $2.267 billion to $2.277 billion, non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.24 to $0.25 and a year-over-year deferred revenue growth of 22% to 23%. And as you heard from Marc, we're excited to deliver our first $10 billion revenue milestone next year as we're initiating fiscal 2018 revenue guidance of $10.1 billion to $10.15 billion. This implies year-over-year growth of approximately 21%. We plan to provide additional details about our outlook for FY '18 on our fourth quarter call in February.
To close, we had a strong third quarter, and we are well positioned for a great finish to FY '17. And this sets us up for another strong 20%-plus growth year in FY '18. At this time, I'd like to thank all of our nearly 24,000 employees for their dedication to customer success and driving these outstanding results. And with that, we'll open up the call for questions.

It's been a very high-performing team for a number of years and they responded in kind. As far as deals, in any given quarter, deals ebb and -- there's an ebb and flow, some come in, some come out. But I'm very, very pleased with the execution in the quarter, particularly around these large 7-figure-plus transactions. Again, these brands are absolutely fantastic. You talk about a company like PNC Bank or Citigroup and Amazon in the quarter, KONE, Telecom Argentina. Many of these brands are world-class brands. And our performance was strong globally across all theaters, all markets, segments, all industries. So again, I think it is a quarter of execution and very, very proud of how the team responded."

And obviously, based on these results, our customers are super excited as well. And they serve as the inspiration and motivation for a lot of the vision, along with, of course, Marc and the rest of the team comes up with here. But I will tell you that we're very pleased with our Sales Cloud execution. We're very pleased with our Service Cloud execution and proof positive around Service Cloud is an example I gave on KONE. This is a best-in-class service-oriented company even though they're an industrial manufacturer. And they looked to us to help them transform their business around field service because this is a way for them to differentiate their products. Service is very strategic to the future, and it's just one example of how companies are looking at Service Cloud. Our Platform continues, our ISV strategy is very, very strong. Our execution around ISVs has been very strong, which speaks to how strong the Platform is. We look at Marketing Cloud as a very strong product. We look at some of these acquisitions that we've made, the Commerce Cloud. We had a very large global CPG company, a very, very recognizable brand. And that deal happened because Commerce Cloud onto itself was very compelling, but when combined with our core products, made us even more compelling to obtain a vision for that particular company. So we love our product strategy. We love our vision. Our customers obviously love our vision. This is only reinforce that Dreamforce, which was just an incredible event this year, and we said it every year but it was just an incredible event. And then when you start adding things like Einstein into the mix, which really is about the future, it just becomes more and more compelling. So we definitely have the winds at our back and in our sails. And we're super excited about the execution and our vision for our customers."

And we have a really balanced portfolio and what's great about that is that, of course, we've talked about having a balanced portfolio geographically. We have a balanced portfolio in regard to our small and medium business as well as our enterprise business. We also have a balanced portfolio when it comes to our products. And you can see that in the numbers. Of course, Sales Cloud is one of the largest products in our industry, not just CRM but in the software industry. And to see it growing at 13%, I mean, I just think that is incredible to see that re-acceleration and it's pretty awesome. And I'm really excited about that. Again, we saw Service at 29%. We saw App Cloud and Other at 43%. Marketing, 28%. But what I really focus on is that we have a balanced portfolio of offerings. It's because as the Salesforce kind of gets -- have different levels of comfort and by geography and by market segment, we see that shift quarter-to-quarter. But like a portfolio manager, in a big institution, big financial institution and they're keeping a balanced portfolio and so are we. And through that balanced portfolio, that's how we are achieving these high-performance results."

Customer service, sales, marketing, this thing -- it's going to have an incredible shift. And that is really what is just surprising to me. I don't think -- when we look back, we started this company 17, 18 years ago, and where we are now, I mean, this was unexpected. And from a technical perspective and I went through some of those things but whether it's our UI. The demos that I did with customers today were entirely on my phone. That was -- CEOs of Fortune 100 companies, ""Hey, I run my whole business on my phone."" That surprises a lot of people. And to see the amount of information and insights that you can get from that is just incredible. And not just the UI but Business Intelligence as well. I have way of running on my phone. Mark Hawkins has of running. We both gave a Fortune 10 -- we both gave a Fortune 10 CEO a demo on our phones and they just couldn't believe that. And then I'll tell you that it's now -- AI, our visual intelligence everything is getting smarter, and it's helping all these users to actually point the direction of success. They know where to go. That is what is so cool. And of course, we're complementing that with the speed of our Platform, with this unbelievable mobility, with this productivity from Quip. I think I talked about that earlier. But that's a huge game changer for our customers. This is really awesome and to see it as integrated platform that our company -- our customers can execute against is very motivating for them. And I think that, that's really cool. And of course, Einstein is a huge part of it. And you're going to see Einstein, of course, deeply integrated in everything that we do. And customers get that Einstein is different than other AI solutions. Some -- I've met with all the tech CEOs, of course, the cloud CEOs and they all have AI. It's table stakes AI is table stakes, you all know that. Everybody's got it programmatically. We've got the best AI. No, we've got the best AI. We've got -- okay, fine, but we are -- have it declaratively through our platform because we need to bring it to millions of people, not just a few -- there's only 15 million programmers in the world. We're much bigger than that. We have to bring this to people who aren't -- who don't code or low coders or citizen developers need to have the power of artificial intelligence, they need the power of mobility. They -- that's why Salesforce Platform is so exciting and that our core at cloud like sales and service are built on it, that is a huge differentiator for us. And it's -- you can see it just in our win rates and also our competitive position has never been stronger."

And if I look at our field organization and the value proposition and the solutions that they can put in front of a customer, whether it's a line of business executive or whether it's from an industry perspective, it is incredibly compelling and that is really manifesting itself in these results. So I would echo Marc's sentiment about what people have to carry in their bag and what they can put in front of customers. I also want to go back to part of the question around the Platform and why we're seeing some great results in the Platform. There's a bunch of reasons for this. And let me start with systems integrator. I think everybody knows, we have really emphasized the importance of having an incredible partner ecosystem, particularly over the last 3.5 years and that has just paid dividends, whether you're talking about the largest SIs or the boutiques, and we still have work to do there. But the team has really done a fantastic job there. But those SIs are really recognizing the value of the platform and what it can bring to their clients. So that's 1 point I would raise. The second point that I would raise is that initially, when we sell or position our products to a customer like Sales Cloud or Service Cloud, customers are overwhelmed by how incredible it is, but then they realize that the power of the platform extending sales and extending service, and that's just lend itself to more usage and adoption and utilization of the platform product. And then finally, back to my partner comment, we have had a huge emphasis on ISVs and the growth of the ISVs and making sure that we reinvigorate our AppExchange. But particularly around our industry ISVs, we've seen tremendous success and why is that? Well, number one, they love our platform. They see all the capabilities, they see all the potential and they want to build mission-critical applications on top of that platform. So we do have a lot of great products in the portfolio that our sales team can deliver and our service teams can provide service to and our partners can deploy. But we also have an incredible platform and that is a lot of the secret sauce that we have in the company."

But these big SIs go into these other conferences and they say, ""Where's the vibe? Where's the energy? Where's the momentum? Where's the growth? Where's the innovation?"" And they're pivoting back to us. And that's exciting to us because we can bring a large systems integrator, and we've talked -- and by the way, standardized on us internally, companies like Accenture and Deloitte, so many others who are building these incredible fast-growing practices.

And that -- because I think we built it right, of course, we've also bought some great things that are outside of our core that we're integrating into our core like our Marketing Cloud, like our Commerce Cloud, like Quip, okay? But with Lightning, that's an incredible UI layer that no one has ever seen anything like this component application development UI layer. It's almost like a visual ETL. That is these customers are now integrating this stuff together at the UI layer, and of course, at the data layer, but that is what I think is going to really drive us forward. I think it's going to be our platform. And I think that when you look out and obviously, we have short-term goals around that $20 billion number. I mean, Heather, I'm sure you have your own model of when you think we're going to hit it. But I think that for us, we want -- I mean, we want to make sure that I don't know exactly when we're going to double the company by. But my dream certainly is to double this -- I would just tell you, my dream is to double this company within the next 3 to 4 years for sure. That's really important to me. who works directly for me as my General Counsel and she doesn't want me to go any -- Amy, do you want to comment on that?"

So listen, we live in a world where, and Marc talked about this, speed and mobility and productivity and innovation intelligence are paramount. This has become table stakes. If you want to be part of the next Wave great companies and if it become a kind of the classic business problem that any consumer packaged goods company has right now is they have to have a connection with that end consumer. Many times, and they go through a retail or a distributors or whether it's a classic industrial company or whether it's a consumer packaged goods company like a Unilever, they want that direct connection to the consumer. So moving that shift, keeping the B2B relationships but also establishing a new model of B2C is very critical to their future. I mean, think about we live in this world we call the age of the customer. And think about what mobile social, data, IoT, analytics and artificial intelligence all coming together. New companies are born overnight. Barriers to entry into markets are being brought down. And if you're not thinking about the future and how you're going to gauge with your customer B2B company or B2C customer, you're going to be in trouble. So this is becoming a regular dialogue and even more meaningful for us at Salesforce because of the commerce cloud. So this is another part of our portfolio that really helps to complete the package a row these transformations. So it is becoming a regular part of the conversation and that particular win that I mentioned earlier, this is one of the world's greatest CPG companies in many regards. And it's exactly about moving from B2B to B2C."

And then at the very tail end of the second quarter as we discussed, we saw a little bit of weakness. And to Keith's credit and he said this but I think it's very subtle, so I think it's worth amplifying, he made a number of changes. We made a number of changes, I think, that really led to us perform well in the third quarter because we did see the market shift a little bit in the second quarter. We told everybody that. And we -- it's not the first time that we've seen that in our careers. Keith and I have been through -- have been in this rodeo before and the selling motion had to change. I think in companies that you've seen before in the last month or so kind of saw or seen that kind of market shift, they also will change in the coming quarters, and their selling motion because the selling motion has had to change in fiscal year '17. We changed, you can see the results, incredible, even with this foreign exchange headwind. So that's number one. Number two, in regards specifically to our fourth quarter, we don't talk about this specifically, but one of the reasons that we do have confidence around the fourth quarter is a certain percentage of that revenue is kind of contracts we've already signed that as we know we're going to get bookings in the fourth quarter because we have signed these agreements. And so that is coming in. So that gives us a leg up. And then Keith had an incredible focus through the sales organization, which is, as you know, essentially half our company is in sales, customer-facing. And that part -- that customer-facing organization, which is I think the best in the world, all wants to have a great fourth quarter. And they're focused, and we have made these cool adjustments. So do you want to just amplify any of that or augment or highlight any of that because I actually think there's a lot to learn in and you and I have been coaching CEOs on how to kind of survive some of these ebb and flow because I think that we both have a lot of confidence that we're going to see more -- a lot of exciting things happen."

It's going to position us in the guidance you heard for next year is going to be $10.15 billion at the high end. So that's another really big milestone. But Marc, this guidance for the year with the confidence that you had talked about also implies 2 other milestones we have never hit in the history of the company. One is that in this FY '17, our guidance implies $1 billion-plus operating margin non-GAAP milestone. This is something we have aspired to, and that's can achieve with this particular guidance for this year, Marc.

In this particular quarter, we're seeing something in Q3 around financial services we're again 7 of these premier financial services institutions decided to go with Salesforce us as they think about the transformation. One of these deals premier wealth management company. And they are going with financial services cloud, which is one of our first vertical products that we've ever had in the company, and it's only been [indiscernible] March but this firm is going wall-to-wall. And that's because we are targeting a specific problem area in a specific industry. I mean, you think about the Telecom Argentina solution that we partnered just part of our ecosystem company like Vlocity and this is transformational for the telecommunications industry it's a huge win for both of us. And this is probably not the same sort of outcome that we would have gone if he would have not something that was industry specific. So whether it's PNC story or Citigroup story or the wealth management store that I referenced of the Telecom Argentina, we are in very early days here, whether it's organically with our products, with financial services cloud or the health cloud or rather with a partner ecosystem but this is really hand in glove strategy with our partners, our SIs, our ISVs, the way that we organize our field teams are ongoing to market and at the end of the day, all comes back to the platform because everything is built on that platform and leverages of the strength of the platform. So again, I think that is the secret sauce. But this vertical industry strategy is it any playing off in terms of the level that we call on the account of these are all very much CEO level sales. The manager and market share and wallets you that we're getting as a result of speaking the language of the customer. So we've got some momentum here, and we're excited about it."

We're coming live to you from New Jersey, where we have the whole team, and we spent the whole week here in New York and having a great time. And it's been great to be here. We j",1079,"Hey, thanks, John, and thanks to everybody for joining us on the call today. We're coming live to you from New Jersey, where we have the whole team, and we spent the whole week here in New York and having a great time. And it's been great to be here. We just opened our new Salesforce Tower, which is the former MetLife Building at Bryant Park, really cool, great new space for customers, partners, employees. Love to invite all of you there to see what we're going to do with this incredible new building in New York. And Salesforce Tower New York is open and all the signage is going to be going up over the next 6 months. We're really thrilled, and we're in the first floor. It's really -- I couldn't be more excited to be here.  Hey, we're looking forward to having you all visit us there. 
And okay, let's get right to it. You can see from our results, we had an exceptional third quarter. Revenue rose to more than $2.1 billion, up 27% in constant currency from a year ago. You know already there is no other top 10 software company delivering that 27% number.
And what I'm really excited about is we expect to deliver, well, more than $10 billion in revenue in fiscal 2018. I think we initiated guidance at $10.15 billion at the high end of our range, and now we're setting our sights on our next goal, $20 billion. Look, no other software company -- no enterprise software company is delivering this kind of growth at this scale, size.
And we're already off to a great start. Deferred revenue of third quarter grew to $3.5 billion, up 25% in constant currency from a year ago. Dollar value of booked business on, off the balance sheet, more than $12 billion, up 27% year-over-year. That's a great predictor for next year on why we're so aggressive about giving this incredible $10.1 billion to $10.15 billion number now because we have that $12 billion on the balance sheet that's in the deferred.
So let's talk about this. We're really well positioned for the future. Everyone at Dreamforce saw that. We are having an incredible, incredible year. We're growing in this mid- to high 20s range, and we've scaled from $4 billion 3 years ago to $8 billion this year. We see tremendous, tremendous opportunity ahead.
Now today, we're trusted by a global community with 1 billion customers, consumers, citizens, partners and employees, and that's a huge responsibility on our shoulders. What we're excited about is serving all these incredible people all over the world with our services. And just look at our new commerce cloud, supporting 300 million unique shoppers a month. And you saw Adidas, and I love this story, 10,000 pairs of YEEZY shoes. Kanye West, you did a great job on the shoe, in a single hour through the Salesforce Commerce Cloud. Thank you, Kanye. Thank you, Adidas. That's amazing.
In our Marketing Cloud, processing 600 million social posts and more than 1 billion messages a day, really, really exciting and 400 million consumers using that service. So you just look at customer facing apps built with Salesforce Heroku, companies like Macy's, Toyota. We're operating in an incredible scale and now an incredible level of momentum as well.
Over the past several months, I've been spending a lot of time on the road with our customers. I love being with our customers, and this week, of course, was no exception. I'll tell you what I continue to see is this incredible community that surrounds us, and it's been awesome to experience that. I just went through that. I just did the Dreamforce keynote again yesterday here in New York and just having all of these customers so excited about our future, understanding this amazing platform that we've built the future B2B and B2C CRM. And you saw this come to life at our sold-out Dreamforce Conference at September, which was way beyond our expectations. I know a lot of the conferences this year have not delivered their results but Dreamforce did. That was awesome. And you saw not just the 170,000 people registered. And everyone was there. I'm sure you saw us packed. But more than 15 million people joining online, that was a huge surprise for us.
And at Dreamforce, you also saw how we're continuing to innovate with Lightning, with Einstein. It's been really, really, really awesome. Of course, probably the most exciting announcement at Dreamforce for a lot of our customers has been Salesforce Einstein. We've extended our Salesforce platform not just with this incredible UI with Lightning, not just with this incredible BI layer with Wave, but now we've extended our Salesforce platform once again with an AI layer with Einstein. And it's really the world's easiest, easiest AI. That is all of these partners, all of these customers are able to easily inherit all of the most state-of-the-art artificial intelligence, whether it's machine learning, machine intelligence, deep learning right inside the Salesforce platform through Einstein. And we're extending that Salesforce platform with amazing new capabilities, with new technologies, new talent, new platform, functionality, and you saw that again this quarter, where we have acquired this incredible DMP, Krux, extending our Marketing Cloud. 
And of course, everybody knows, if you'd been around me at all, you'd see how our whole company now has 20,000 users on Quip. And of course, Facebook has thousands of users on Quip, and other incredible companies like Electronic Arts and many others have thousands of users now on Quip. And if you don't have Quip on your phone yet and you haven't experienced Quip, you should just go to the App Store right now and download Quip, Q-U-I-P. It'll change your life.
I'll tell you, you can really experience next-generation productivity with live, collaborate documents and spreadsheets on our platform, integrated media. It is really cool. And Bret Taylor, former CTO of Facebook, is now at Salesforce and of course, the former legendary Product Manager at Google, who did Google Maps. He just -- he and Kevin Gibbs, his co-Founder, did just a beautiful job on that.
Well, anyway, I could go on and on and on about our products and technology and how exciting this quarter was, but let me turn it over to Keith. And Keith, thanks for coming down from Boston and being here out for the call."
122917,407617374,1089176,"salesforce.com, inc., Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Nov 17, 2016",2016-11-17,"Earnings Calls","Salesforce, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Marc. Thanks, everybody, for joining the call. Listen, Q3 was an outstanding quarter. We had excellent execution from the entire team in all of our key geographies and industries. We're really, really thrilled with the results.We also delivered",759,"Thanks, Marc. Thanks, everybody, for joining the call. Listen, Q3 was an outstanding quarter. We had excellent execution from the entire team in all of our key geographies and industries. We're really, really thrilled with the results.
We also delivered very strong performance in large deals this quarter. Not only did we close a record number of 7-figure-plus transactions in Q3, but the value of those transactions grew significantly. We continue to spend a lot of time with CEOs, and at Dreamforce, our CEO Summit brought together some amazing thought leaders, and they're all looking to drive a new level of innovation in their industries around customer engagement.
And they recognized, is they need an intelligent customer engagement platform that will help them stay ahead of rapidly changing customer expectations. Now this level of dialogue and engagement with these CEOs of some of the most incredible companies in the world, they have put their trust in us, and that has been reflected in our results.
So for example, this quarter, we saw huge strength in financial services, where we signed strategic agreements with 7 of the premier financial services institutions in the United States, including Citi and PNC Bank. And we're very, very excited about these stories, so let me tell you a little bit about PNC. This is a new relationship for Salesforce, and we're helping them streamline operations across all their primary lines of business so that they can reimagine the banking experience for nearly 11 million customers. All their retail call centers and branches will now be powered by Salesforce, and that will help them respond to customers faster. And they'll also use Salesforce to mobilize their corporate and institutional banking team, giving them access to customer information on the go.
Salesforce also signed a strategic agreement with Citi in the quarter. And this is Citi's global consumer bank that will utilize Salesforce for all client facing personnel in their U.S. retail bank, enabling Citi to better serve clients while lowering costs and improving analytics and efficiency. It really is an incredible vision to transform their global consumer bank with a very highly differentiated customer experience.
We had a landmark win with one of the world's largest consumer packaged good companies who needed a complete CRM and e-commerce platform to help them transform from B2B to a B2C business. Now I am having a lot of conversations with customers about this particular type of transformation, and this relationship was the result of excellent collaboration between Salesforce and the Commerce Cloud, which grew its comparable customer gross merchandise value by 22% in constant currency from a year ago. This is an early sign of the power of our combined businesses, and it is creating unmatched value.
Other commerce wins in the quarter included GNC and Shiseido. Amazon is a great win in the quarter as well. We formed a strategic relationship in Q1 as you all know, and in Q3, that relationship has expanded. And they added even more services throughout the company.
International continues to be an important cornerstone of our growth strategy. In Europe, we had a great win with KONE, one of the world's largest elevator companies. And just last week, I spoke with KONE's CEO, Henrik Ehrnrooth, and his team about our partnership to transform the multi-billion-dollar field service industry together. Very exciting. Their vision is excellent, and they're using Salesforce to mobilize more than 20,000 service technicians. With real-time customer information and service data from connected equipment, they will be able to provide more proactive service and respond to service requests faster than ever.
Telecom Argentina, also new to the Salesforce family. They selected Salesforce to power all their call centers and upgrade the in-store and online experience for more than 25 million customers. We partner very closely with Vlocity to show them an integrated solution in their industry, and it is the testimony of the power of our industry strategy coupled with Salesforce's ecosystem and our ability to work effectively with our partners.
It has also proved positive that our ecosystem is absolutely blossoming. So it's pretty clear that our enterprise strategy, coupled with our continued operational focus, is working. Our investments in key industries, our partner ecosystem and our top international regions are paying off, and we are very well positioned for a strong fiscal -- the remainder of fiscal 2017.
So at this point, I'd like to hand the call over to Mark Hawkins, and he can share some more detail around the financial highlights for the quarter. Mark?"
122917,407617374,1089176,"salesforce.com, inc., Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Nov 17, 2016",2016-11-17,"Earnings Calls","Salesforce, Inc.","Executives","Yes. Thanks, Keith. And I'm very pleased with our financial results for the third quarter. Let me just say that. Total revenue for the quarter was up 25% in dollars and 27% in constant currency, excluding a year-over-year FX headwind of $32 million.The",633,"Yes. Thanks, Keith. And I'm very pleased with our financial results for the third quarter. Let me just say that. Total revenue for the quarter was up 25% in dollars and 27% in constant currency, excluding a year-over-year FX headwind of $32 million.
The Commerce Cloud is off to a great start and had an excellent quarter, contributing $49 million to total revenue after adjusting for purchasing accounting. Our dollar attrition for the third quarter, which excludes Marketing Cloud and other acquired businesses, remained below 9%.
Looking at revenue cloud. Sales -- looking at revenue by cloud. Sales Cloud grew 13% year-over-year. Service Cloud grew 26%. App Cloud and Other grew 38%. Marketing Cloud grew 46%, but then if you exclude approximately $42 million of subscription and support revenue related to Demandware, Marketing Cloud grew 21%. In our region, we delivered another strong quarter of year-over-year constant currency revenue growth in EMEA by growing 27% and Asia Pac by growing 29%.
Now before I move on to cash flow and deferred revenue, I want to remind you that invoicing seasonality is affecting both of these metrics. As we discussed at the last 2 Analyst Days, we continue to see an increase in the seasonality of invoicing, primarily as a result of compounding and to a lesser extent, contract co-terming and a shift toward annual invoicing in Q4.
In that context, third quarter cash flow was $154 million, down 5% over last year. Deferred revenue ended the quarter at $3.5 billion, up 23%. Deferred revenue includes approximately $30 million related to our acquisition of Demandware, up from $23 million in Q2. On a constant currency basis, deferred revenue was up 25% when excluding a year-over-year FX headwind of about $49 million. On a sequential basis, deferred revenue had an FX headwind of $33 million.
In the quarter, approximately 80% of all subscription and support-related invoices were issued with annual terms, excluding Demandware. The Q3 benefit to deferred revenue from the change in billing frequency was less than 1 percentage point of growth.
Now moving on to guidance. I'm pleased to be raising our full year revenue guidance to $8.365 billion to $8.375 billion despite absorbing approximately $100 million to $150 million of FX headwind this year. This implies year-over-year growth for FY '17 of approximately 25%. We expect Demandware and other acquired assets to contribute about 1% to 2 percentage points of growth year-over-year.
We're also raising our full year non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance by $0.03 to $0.97 and $0.98. This raise includes 1% sic) [ $0.01 ] from operational outperformance and $0.01 from an investment gain in Q3 and $0.01 from an anticipated investment gain in Q4. This guide continues to imply approximately 70 basis points of full year non-GAAP operating margin improvement. We continue to anticipate full year operating cash flow growth of 20% to 21% year-over-year.
For Q4, we're initiating revenue guidance of $2.267 billion to $2.277 billion, non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.24 to $0.25 and a year-over-year deferred revenue growth of 22% to 23%. And as you heard from Marc, we're excited to deliver our first $10 billion revenue milestone next year as we're initiating fiscal 2018 revenue guidance of $10.1 billion to $10.15 billion. This implies year-over-year growth of approximately 21%. We plan to provide additional details about our outlook for FY '18 on our fourth quarter call in February.
To close, we had a strong third quarter, and we are well positioned for a great finish to FY '17. And this sets us up for another strong 20%-plus growth year in FY '18.
At this time, I'd like to thank all of our nearly 24,000 employees for their dedication to customer success and driving these outstanding results. And with that, we'll open up the call for questions. Operator?"

And I'm very, very pleased with the results. This is a high performing team. It's been a very high performing team for a number of years, and they responded in kind. As far as deals, in any given quarter, deals ebb and -- there's an ebb and flow. Some come in. Some come out. But I'm very, very pleased with the execution in the quarter, particularly around these large 7-figure-plus transactions. Again, these brands are absolutely fantastic. You talk about a company like PNC Bank or Citigroup and Amazon in the quarter, KONE, Telecom Argentina. Many of these brands are world-class brands, and our performance was strong globally across all theaters, all markets, segments, all industries. So again, I think it is a quarter of execution and very, very proud of how the team responded."

And obviously, based on these results, our customers are super excited as well, and they serve as the inspiration and motivation for a lot of the vision, along with, of course, what Marc and the rest of the team comes up with here. But I will tell you that we're very pleased with our Sales Cloud execution. We're very pleased with our Service Cloud execution. And proved positive around Service Cloud is that example I gave on KONE. This is a best-in-class service-oriented company even though they're an industrial manufacturer. And they look to us to help them transform their business around field service because this is a way for them to differentiate their products. Service is very strategic to their future, and it's just one example of how companies are looking at Service Cloud. Our platform continues. Our ISV strategy is very, very strong. Our execution around ISVs has been very strong, which speaks to how strong the platform is. We look at Marketing Cloud as a very strong product. We look at some of these acquisitions that we've made, the Commerce Cloud. We had a very large global CPG company, a very, very recognizable brand, and that deal happened because Commerce Cloud onto itself was very compelling, but when combined with our core products, made us even more compelling to obtain a vision for that particular company. So we love our product strategy. We love our vision. Our customers obviously love our vision. This is only reinforced at Dreamforce, which was just an incredible event this year. And we say that every year, but it was just an incredible event. And then when you start adding things like Einstein into the mix, which really is about the future, it just becomes more and more compelling. So we definitely have the winds at our back and in our sails, and we're super excited about the execution and our vision for our customers."

We have a balanced portfolio in regard to our small and medium business as well as our enterprise business. We also have a balanced portfolio when it comes to our products. And you can see that in the numbers. Of course, Sales Cloud is one of the largest products in our industry, not just CRM but in the software industry, and to see it growing at 13%, I mean, I just think that is incredible to see that re-acceleration. And it's pretty awesome, and I'm really excited about that. Again, we saw Service at 29%. We saw App Cloud and Other at 43%; Marketing, 28%. But what I really focus on is that we have a balanced portfolio of offerings because as the Salesforce kind of gets -- have different levels of comfort and by geography and by market segment, we see that shift quarter-to-quarter. But like a portfolio manager in a big institution, as big financial institution and they're keeping a balanced portfolio, so are we. And through that balanced portfolio, that's how we're achieving these high-performance results."

Customer service, sales, marketing, this thing -- it's going to have an incredible shift. And that is really what is just surprising to me. I don't think -- we look back. We started this company 17, 18 years ago, and where we are now, I mean, this was unexpected. And from a technical perspective -- and I went through some of those things, but whether it's our UI, what -- the demos that I did with customers today were entirely on my phone. That was -- CEOs of Fortune 100 companies say, ""Hey, I run my whole business on my phone."" That surprises a lot of people. And to see the amount of information and insights that you can get from that is just incredible. And not just the UI but business intelligence as well, I have way of running on my phone. Mark Hawkins has way of running on his -- we both gave a Fortune 10 -- we both gave a Fortune 10 CEO a demo on our phones, and they just couldn't believe that. And then I'll tell you that it's now this AI, artificial intelligence, what -- everything's getting just smarter, and it's helping all these users to actually point the direction of success. They know where to go. That is what is so cool. And of course, we're complementing that with the speed of our platform, with this unbelievable mobility, with this productivity from Quip. I think I talked about that earlier. But that's a huge game changer for our customers. This is really awesome, and then to see it as this integrated platform that our company -- our customers can execute against is very motivating for them. And I think that, that's really cool. And of course, Einstein is a huge part of it, and you're going to see Einstein, of course, deeply integrated in everything that we do. And customers get that Einstein is different than other AI solutions. Some -- I've met with all the tech CEOs, of course, the cloud CEOs, and they all have AI. It's table stakes AI -- AI is table stakes. You all know that. Everybody's got it programmatically. Oh, we've got the best AI. No, we've got the best AI. We've got -- okay, fine, but we are -- have it declaratively, okay, through our platform because we need to bring it to millions of people, not just a few -- there's only 15 million programmers in the world. We're much bigger than that. We have to bring this to people who are -- don't code or low coders, weak -- or citizen developers need to have the power of artificial intelligence. They need the power of mobility. They -- that's why Salesforce platform is so exciting and that our core clouds, like sales and service are built on it, that is a huge differentiator for us, and it's -- you can see it just in our win rates and also our competitive position has never been stronger."

We are in so many amazing markets, whether it's sales, service, marketing, communities, analytics, application development like we -- like you're talk -- App Cloud, whether it's commerce, whether it's IoT, whether it's productivity with Quip. And the Salesforce is going to have that full portfolio of products, and they are going to move back and forth against those. And we've seen that.

And if I look at our field organization and the value proposition and the solutions that they can put in front of a customer,",414,"Well, look, I think the bottom line is that we have an abundance of riches, particularly as it relates to our product portfolio. And if I look at our field organization and the value proposition and the solutions that they can put in front of a customer, whether it's a line of business executive or whether it's from an industry perspective, it is incredibly compelling, and that is really manifesting itself in these results. So I would echo Marc's sentiment about what people have to carry in their bag and what they can put in front of customers. I also want to go back to part of the question around the platform and why we're seeing such great results in the platform. There's a bunch of reasons for this, and let me start with the systems integrator. I think everybody knows, we have really emphasized the importance of having an incredible partner ecosystem, particularly over the last 3.5 years, and that has just paid dividends, whether you're talking about the largest SIs or the boutiques. And we still have work to do there. But the team has really done a fantastic job there, but those SIs are really recognizing the value of the platform and what it can bring to their clients. So that's one point I would raise. The second point that I would raise is that, initially, when we sell or position our products with a customer like Sales Cloud or Service Cloud, customers are overwhelmed by how incredible it is, but then they realize that -- the power of the platform extending sales and extending service. And that just lends itself to more usage and adoption and utilization of the platform product. And then finally, back to my partner comment. We have had a huge emphasis on ISVs and the growth of the ISVs and making sure that we reinvigorate our AppExchange. But particularly around our industry ISVs, we've seen tremendous success. And why is that? Well, number one, they love our platform. They see all the capabilities. They see all the potential, and they want to build mission-critical applications on top of that platform. So we do have a lot of great products in the portfolio that our sales team and our -- can deliver and our service teams can provide service to and our partners can deploy. But we also have an incredible platform, and that is a lot of the secret sauce that we have in the company."

What's unique, Heather, about our capability, and you know this, is that we have an integrated platform. And this integrated platform is exciting because not only is it the #1 sales cloud in the world, not only is it the #1 service cloud in the world, not only is it the #1 declarative platform, okay, but it has all these other capabilities, mobility and AI and so forth, the analytics and so forth. And so I think that when I look at the most incredible things that our customers have done, it -- they -- we have these things together in smart and creative ways, build these -- they build these apps. They deploy these things internally, and they look for speed. They're looking for speed. Of course, they want productivity. Of course, they want intelligence. Of course, they want mobility. They want that core platform. And that -- because I think we built it right -- now of course, we've also bought some great things that are outside of our core that we're integrating into our core like our Marketing Cloud, like our Commerce Cloud, like Quip, okay? But with Lightning, that's an incredible UI layer that no one has ever seen anything like this component house the [ph] application development UI layer. It's almost like a visual ETL. That is these customers are now integrating this stuff together at the UI layer and of course, at the data layer, but that is what I think is going to really drive us forward. I think it's going to be our platform. And I think that when you look out -- and obviously, we have short-term goals around that $20 billion number. I mean, Heather, I'm sure you have your own model of when you think we're going to hit it. But I think that, for us, we want to -- look, I mean, we want to make sure that -- I don't know exactly when we're going to double the company by, but my dream certainly is to double this -- I would just tell you, my dream is to double this company within the next 3 to 4 years for sure.

So listen, we live in a world where, -- and Marc talked about this, where speed and mobility and productivity and innovation intelligence are paramount, okay? This has become table stakes. If you want to be part of the next wave of great companies -- and if you think about kind of the classic business problem that any consumer packaged goods company has right now is they have to have a connection with that end consumer. Many times, they go through a retailer or a distributor, or whether it's a classic industrial company or whether it's a consumer packaged good company like a Unilever, they want that direct connection to the consumer. So moving that shift, keeping the B2B relationships but also establishing a new model of B2C is very critical to their future. I mean, think about we live in this world we call the age of the customer. And think about cloud, mobile, social, data science, IoT, analytics and artificial intelligence all coming together. New companies are born overnight. Barriers to entry into markets are being brought down. And if you're not thinking about the future and how you're going to engage with your customer, whether you're a B2B company or a B2C customer, you're going to be in trouble. So this is becoming a regular dialogue and even more meaningful for us at Salesforce because of the Commerce Cloud. So this is just another part of our portfolio that really helps to complete the package around these transformations. So it is becoming a regular part of the conversation and that particular win that I mentioned earlier. This is one of the world's greatest CPG companies in many regards, and it is exactly about moving from B2B to B2C."

And to Keith's credit -- and he said this, but I think it's very subtle. So I think it's worth amplifying he made a number of changes. We made a number of changes, I think, that really let to us perform well in the third quarter because we did see the market shift a little bit in the second quarter. We told everybody that. And we -- it's not the first time that we've seen that in our careers. Keith and I have been through -- have been to this rodeo before, and the selling motion had to change. I think in companies that you've seen report in the last month or so, who kind of saw or seen that kind of market shift, they also will change in these -- in the coming quarters their selling motion because the selling motion has had to change in fiscal year '17. We changed. You can see the results, incredible, even with this foreign exchange headwind. So that's number one. Number two, in regards specifically to our fourth quarter, we don't talk about this specifically, but one of the reasons that we do have confidence around the fourth quarter is a certain percentage of that revenue is kind of contracts we've already signed that, as we know, we're going to get bookings in the fourth quarter because we have signed these agreements. And so that is coming in. And so that gives us a leg up. And then Keith had an incredible focus through the sales organization, which is, as you know, essentially half our company is in sales, customer facing. And that part -- that customer facing organization, which is, I think, the best in the world, all wants to have a great fourth quarter, and they're focused. And we have made these cool adjustments. So do you want to just amplify any of that or augment or highlight any of that? Because I actually think there's a lot to learn. And you and I have been coaching CEOs on how to kind of survive some of these ebb and flow because I think that we both have a lot of confidence that we're going to see more -- a lot of exciting things happen."

Well, one of the things that we have chatted about that I think is good to share on the call is when we exit, Keith, with Q4, we're going to exit with a $9 billion run rate in terms of revenue run rate, Marc. So we're not only achieving our plan, but we're actually going to exit with a run rate of $9 billion. It's going to position us and the guidance you heard for next year is going to be $10.15 billion at the high end. So that's another really big milestone. But Marc, this guidance for the year with the confidence you had talked about also implies 2 other milestones we have never hit in the history of the company. One is that, in this FY '17, our guidance implies $1 billion-plus operating margin non-GAAP milestone. This is something we've aspired to, and that's going to achieve with this particular guidance for this year, Marc. And the last thing we're going to achieve is another milestone we've never ever done, which is $2 billion plus on the operating cash flow. So these are things, Marc, that, I think, quantitatively are milestones that support this idea. Keith, I don't know if you want to comment there."

As you know, this is one of our core strategies that we've tried to put in place over the last 3.5 years, is really to speak the language of the customer and go to market by industry and make sure our messaging and our products -- and our entire portfolio is really, in many ways, taking this incredible platform of products and portfolio of products and reoriented them to solve a specific customer problem. In this particular quarter, we're seeing something in Q3 around financial services, where, again, 7 of these premier financial services institutions decided to go with Salesforce as they think about their transformation. One of these deals was with a premier wealth management company, and they are going wall to wall with our Financial Services Cloud, which is one of our first vertical products that we've ever had in the company. And it's only been GA-ed since March, but this firm is going wall to wall. And that's because we are targeting a specific problem area in a specific industry. I mean, you think about the Telecom Argentina solution that we partnered as part of our ecosystem with this company like Vlocity. I mean, this is transformational for the telecommunications industry. It's a huge win for both of us. And this is probably not the same sort of outcome that we would have gone if we had not had something that was industry specific. So whether it's the PNC story or the Citigroup story or the wealth management storey that I referenced to the Telecom Argentina, we are in very early days here, whether it's organically with our products, with Financial Services Cloud or the Health Cloud or whether it's with our partner ecosystem, but this is really a hand-in-glove strategy with our partners, our SIs, our ISVs, the way that we've organized our field teams around going to market. And at the end of the day, it all comes back to the platform because everything is built on that platform and leverages the strength of that platform. So again, I think that is the secret sauce. But this vertical and industry strategy is certainly playing off in terms of the level that we call on, on the accounts. These are all very much CEO-level sales. The mind share and market share and wallet share that we're getting is a result of speaking the language of the customer. So we've got some momentum here, and we're excited about it."

With me on the call today is Marc Benioff, Chairman and CEO; Keith Block, Vice Chairman, President and COO; and Mark Hawkins, CFO.
As a reminder, our commentary today will primarily be in non-GAAP terms. Reconciliations between our GAAP and non-GAAP results and guidance can be found in our earnings press release. 
Also, some of our comments today may contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Should any of these materialize or should our assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual company results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements. A description of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions and other factors that could affect our financial results are included in our SEC filings, including our most recent report on Form 10-Q.
So with that, let me turn the call over to Marc."

We're coming live to you from New Jersey, where we have the whole team, and we spent the whole week here in New York and having a great time. And it's been great to be here. We j",1078,"Hey, thanks, John, and thanks to everybody for joining us on the call today. We're coming live to you from New Jersey, where we have the whole team, and we spent the whole week here in New York and having a great time. And it's been great to be here. We just opened our new Salesforce Tower, which is the former MetLife Building at Bryant Park, really cool, great new space for customers, partners, employees. Love to invite all of you there to see what we're going to do with this incredible new building in New York. And Salesforce Tower New York is open and all the signage is going to be going up over the next 6 months. We're really thrilled, and we're in the first floor. It's really -- I couldn't be more excited to be here.  Hey, we're looking forward to having you all visit us there. 
And okay, let's get right to it. You can see from our results, we had an exceptional third quarter. Revenue rose to more than $2.1 billion, up 27% in constant currency from a year ago. You know already there is no other top 10 software company delivering that 27% number.
And what I'm really excited about is we expect to deliver, well, more than $10 billion in revenue in fiscal 2018. I think we initiated guidance at $10.15 billion at the high end of our range, and now we're setting our sights on our next goal, $20 billion. Look, no other software company -- no enterprise software company is delivering this kind of growth at this scale, size.
And we're already off to a great start. Deferred revenue third quarter grew to $3.5 billion, up 25% in constant currency from a year ago. Dollar value of booked business on, off the balance sheet, more than $12 billion, up 27% year-over-year. That's a great predictor for next year on why we're so aggressive about giving this incredible $10.1 billion to $10.15 billion number now because we have that $12 billion on the balance sheet that's in the deferred.
So let's talk about this. We're really well positioned for the future. Everyone at Dreamforce saw that. We are having an incredible, incredible year. We're growing in this mid- to high 20s range, and we've scaled from $4 billion 3 years ago to $8 billion this year. We see tremendous, tremendous opportunity ahead.
Now today, we're trusted by a global community with 1 billion customers, consumers, citizens, partners and employees, and that's a huge responsibility on our shoulders. What we're excited about is serving all these incredible people all over the world with our services. And just look at our new commerce cloud, supporting 300 million unique shoppers a month. And you saw Adidas, and I love this story, 10,000 pairs of YEEZY shoes. Kanye West, you did a great job on the shoe, in a single hour through the Salesforce Commerce Cloud. Thank you, Kanye. Thank you, Adidas. That's amazing.
In our Marketing Cloud, processing 600 million social posts and more than 1 billion messages a day, really, really exciting and 400 million consumers using that service. So you just look at customer-facing apps built with Salesforce Heroku, companies like Macy's, Toyota. We're operating at an incredible scale and now an incredible level of momentum as well.
Over the past several months, I've been spending a lot of time on the road with our customers. I love being with our customers, and this week, of course, was no exception. I'll tell you what I continue to see is this incredible community that surrounds us, and it's been awesome to experience that. I just went through that. I just did the Dreamforce keynote again yesterday here in New York and just having all of these customers so excited about our future, understanding this amazing platform that we've built the future B2B and B2C CRM. And you saw this come to life at our sold-out Dreamforce Conference at September, which was way beyond our expectations. I know a lot of the conferences this year have not delivered their results but Dreamforce did. That was awesome. And you saw not just the 170,000 people registered. And everyone was there and so you saw us packed. But more than 15 million people joining online, that was a huge surprise for us.
And at Dreamforce, you also saw how we're continuing to innovate with Lightning, with Einstein. It's been really, really, really awesome. Of course, probably the most exciting announcement at Dreamforce for a lot of our customers has been Salesforce Einstein. We've extended our Salesforce platform not just with this incredible UI with Lightning, not just with this incredible BI layer with Wave, but now we've extended our Salesforce platform once again with an AI layer with Einstein. And it's really the world's easiest, easiest AI. That is all of these partners, all of these customers are able to easily inherit all of the most awesome state-of-the-art artificial intelligence, whether it's machine learning, machine intelligence, deep learning right inside the Salesforce platform through Einstein. And we're extending that Salesforce platform with amazing new capabilities, with new technologies, new talent, new platform, functionality, and you saw that again this quarter, where we have acquired this incredible DMP, Krux, extending our Marketing Cloud. 
And of course, everybody knows, if you've been around me at all, you'd see how our whole company now has 20,000 users on Quip. And of course, Facebook has thousands of users on Quip, and other incredible companies like Electronic Arts and many others have thousands of users now on Quip. And if you don't have Quip on your phone yet and you haven't experienced Quip, you should just go to the App Store right now and download Quip, Q-U-I-P. It'll change your life.
I'll tell you, you can really experience next-generation productivity with live, collaborate documents and spreadsheets on our platform, integrated media. It is really cool. And Bret Taylor, former CTO of Facebook, is now with Salesforce and, of course, the former legendary Product Manager at Google, who did Google Maps. He just -- he and Kevin Gibbs, his co-Founder, did just a beautiful job on that.
Well, anyway, I could go on and on and on about our products and technology and how exciting this quarter was, but let me turn it over to Keith. And, Keith, thanks for coming down from Boston and being here out for the call."
122917,407617374,1089249,"salesforce.com, inc., Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Nov 17, 2016",2016-11-17,"Earnings Calls","Salesforce, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Marc. Thanks, everybody, for joining the call. Listen, Q3 was an outstanding quarter. We had excellent execution from the entire team in all of our key geographies and industries. We're really, really thrilled with the results.We also delivered",761,"Thanks, Marc. Thanks, everybody, for joining the call. Listen, Q3 was an outstanding quarter. We had excellent execution from the entire team in all of our key geographies and industries. We're really, really thrilled with the results.
We also delivered very strong performance in large deals this quarter. Not only did we close a record number of 7-figure-plus transactions in Q3, but the value of those transactions grew significantly. We continue to spend a lot of time with CEOs, and at Dreamforce, our CEO Summit brought together some amazing thought leaders, and they're all looking to drive a new level of innovation in their industries around customer engagement.
And they recognized that they need an intelligent customer engagement platform that will help them stay ahead of rapidly changing customer expectations. Now, this level of dialogue and engagement with these CEOs of some of the most incredible companies in the world, they have put their trust in us, and that has been reflected in our results.
So for example, this quarter, we saw huge strength in financial services, where we signed strategic agreements with 7 of the premier financial services institutions in the United States, including Citi and PNC Bank. And we're very, very excited about these stories, so let me tell you a little bit about PNC. This is a new relationship for Salesforce, and we're helping them streamline operations across all their primary lines of business so that they can reimagine the banking experience for nearly 11 million customers. All their retail call centers and branches will now be powered by Salesforce, and that will help them respond to customers fastest. And they'll also use Salesforce to mobilize their corporate and institutional banking team, giving them access to customer information on the go.
Salesforce also signed a strategic agreement with Citi in the quarter. And this is Citi's global consumer bank that will utilize Salesforce for all their client-facing personnel in their U.S. retail bank, enabling Citi to better serve clients while lowering costs and improving analytics and efficiency. It really is an incredible vision to transform their global consumer bank with a very highly differentiated customer experience.
We had a landmark win with one of the world's largest consumer packaged good companies who just needed a complete CRM and e-commerce platform to help them transform from B2B to a B2C business. Now I am having a lot of conversations with customers about this particular type of transformation, and this relationship was the result of excellent collaboration between Salesforce and the Commerce Cloud, which grew its comparable customer gross merchandise value by 22% in constant currency from a year ago. This is an early sign of the power of our combined businesses, and it is creating unmatched value.
Other commerce wins in the quarter included GNC and Shiseido. Now, Amazon is a great win in the quarter as well. We formed a strategic relationship in Q1 as you all know, and in Q3, that relationship has expanded. And they added even more services throughout the company.
International continues to be an important cornerstone of our growth strategy. In Europe, we had a great win with KONE, one of the world's largest elevator companies. And just last week, I spoke with KONE's CEO, Henrik Ehrnrooth, and his team about our partnership to transform the multi-billion-dollar field service industry together. Very exciting. Their vision is excellent, and they're using Salesforce to mobilize more than 20,000 service technicians. With real-time customer information and service data from connected equipment, they will be able to provide more proactive service and respond to service requests faster than ever.
Telecom Argentina, also new to the Salesforce family. They selected Salesforce to power all their call centers and upgrade the in-store and online experience for more than 25 million customers. We partner very closely with Vlocity to show them an integrated solution in their industry, and it is the testimony of the power of our industry strategy coupled with Salesforce's ecosystem and our ability to work effectively with our partners.
It has also proved positive that our ecosystem is absolutely blossoming. So it's pretty clear that our enterprise strategy, coupled with our continued operational focus, is working. Our investments in key industries, our partner ecosystem and our top international regions are paying off, and we are very well positioned for a strong fiscal -- the remainder of fiscal 2017.
So at this point, I'd like to hand the call over to Mark Hawkins, and he can share some more detail around the financial highlights for the quarter. Mark?"
122917,407617374,1089249,"salesforce.com, inc., Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Nov 17, 2016",2016-11-17,"Earnings Calls","Salesforce, Inc.","Executives","Yes. Thanks, Keith. And I'm very pleased with our financial results for the third quarter. Let me just say that. Total revenue for the quarter was up 25% in dollars and 27% in constant currency, excluding a year-over-year FX headwind of $32 million.The",629,"Yes. Thanks, Keith. And I'm very pleased with our financial results for the third quarter. Let me just say that. Total revenue for the quarter was up 25% in dollars and 27% in constant currency, excluding a year-over-year FX headwind of $32 million.
The Commerce Cloud is off to a great start and had an excellent quarter, contributing $49 million to total revenue after adjusting for purchasing accounting. Our dollar attrition for the third quarter, which excludes Marketing Cloud and other acquired businesses, remained below 9%.
Looking at revenue cloud. Sales -- looking at revenue by cloud. Sales Cloud grew 13% year-over-year. Service Cloud grew 26%. App Cloud and Other grew 38%. Marketing Cloud grew 46%, but then if you exclude approximately $42 million of subscription and support revenue related to Demandware, Marketing Cloud grew 21%. In our region, we delivered another strong quarter of year-over-year constant-currency revenue growth in EMEA by growing 27% and Asia Pac by growing 29%.
Now before I move on to cash flow and deferred revenue, I want to remind you that invoicing seasonality is affecting both of these metrics. As we discussed at the last 2 Analyst Days, we continue to see an increase in the seasonality of invoicing, primarily as a result of compounding and to a lesser extent, contract co-terming and a shift toward annual invoicing in Q4.
In that context, third quarter cash flow was $154 million, down 5% over last year. Deferred revenue ended the quarter at $3.5 billion, up 23%. Deferred revenue includes approximately $30 million related to our acquisition of Demandware, up from $23 million in Q2. On a constant-currency basis, deferred revenue was up 25% when excluding a year-over-year FX headwind of about $49 million. On a sequential basis, deferred revenue had an FX headwind of $33 million.
In the quarter, approximately 80% of all subscription and support-related invoices were issued with annual terms, excluding Demandware. The Q3 benefit to deferred revenue from the change in billing frequency was less than 1 percentage point of growth.
Now moving on to guidance. I'm pleased to be raising our full year revenue guidance to $8.365 billion to $8.375 billion despite absorbing approximately $100 million to $150 million of FX headwind this year. This implies year-over-year growth for FY '17 of approximately 25%. We expect Demandware and other acquired assets to contribute about 1% to 2 percentage points of growth year-over-year.
We're also raising our full year non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance by $0.03 to $0.97 and $0.98. This raise includes 1% (sic) [$0.01] from operational outperformance and $0.01 from an investment gain in Q3 and $0.01 from an anticipated investment gain in Q4. This guide continues to imply approximately 70 basis points of full year non-GAAP operating margin improvement. We continue to anticipate full year operating cash flow growth of 20% to 21% year-over-year.
For Q4, we're initiating revenue guidance of $2.267 billion to $2.277 billion, non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.24 to $0.25 and a year-over-year deferred revenue growth of 22% to 23%. And as you heard from Marc, we're excited to deliver our first $10 billion revenue milestone next year as we're initiating fiscal 2018 revenue guidance of $10.1 billion to $10.15 billion. This implies year-over-year growth of approximately 21%. We plan to provide additional details about our outlook for FY '18 on our fourth quarter call in February.
To close, we had a strong third quarter, and we are well positioned for a great finish to FY '17. And this sets us up for another strong 20%-plus growth year in FY '18.
At this time, I'd like to thank all of our nearly 24,000 employees for their dedication to customer success and driving these outstanding results. And with that, we'll open up the call for questions. Operator?"

So yes, we did discuss on the last call that, at the very end of Q2, we did have some weakness in the United States, and that was attributed to execution issues.

And I'm very, very pleased with the results. This is a high-performing team. It's been a very high-performing team for a number of years, and they responded in kind. As far as deals, in any given quarter, deals ebb and -- there's an ebb and flow. Some come in. Some come out. But I'm very, very pleased with the execution in the quarter, particularly around these large 7-figure-plus transactions. Again, these brands are absolutely fantastic. You talk about a company like PNC Bank or Citigroup and Amazon in the quarter, KONE, Telecom Argentina. Many of these brands are world-class brands, and our performance was strong globally across all theaters, all markets, all segments, all industries. So again, I think it is a quarter of execution and very, very proud of how the team responded."

Obviously, we're the market leader in virtually every one of these clouds and super excited about the vision that we put forth for our customers. And obviously, based on these results, our customers are super excited as well, and they serve as the inspiration and motivation for a lot of the vision, along with, of course, what Marc and the rest of the team comes up with here. But I will tell you that we're very pleased with our Sales Cloud execution. We're very pleased with our Service Cloud execution. And proof positive around Service Cloud is that example I gave on KONE. This is a best-in-class service-oriented company even though they're an industrial manufacturer. And they look to us to help them transform their business around field service because this is a way for them to differentiate their products. Service is very strategic to their future, and it's just one example of how companies are looking at Service Cloud. Our platform continues. Our ISV strategy is very, very strong. Our execution around ISVs has been very strong, which speaks to how strong the platform is. We look at Marketing Cloud as a very strong product. We look at some of these acquisitions that we've made, the Commerce Cloud. We had a very large global CPG company, a very, very recognizable brand, and that deal happened because Commerce Cloud onto itself was very compelling, but when combined with our core products, made us even more compelling to obtain a vision for that particular company. So we love our product strategy. We love our vision. Our customers obviously love our vision. This was only reinforced at Dreamforce, which was just an incredible event this year. And we say that every year, but it was just an incredible event. And then when you start adding things like Einstein into the mix, which really is about the future, it just becomes more and more compelling. So we definitely have the winds at our back and in our sails, and we're super excited about the execution and our vision for our customers."

And we have a really balanced portfolio, and what's great about that is that, of course, we've talked about having a balanced portfolio geographically. We have a balanced portfolio in regard to our small and medium business as well as our enterprise business. We also have a balanced portfolio when it comes to our products. And you can see that in the numbers. Of course, Sales Cloud is one of the largest products in our industry, not just CRM but in the software industry, and to see it growing at 13%, I mean, I just think that is incredible to see that re-acceleration. And it's pretty awesome, and I'm really excited about that. Again, we saw Service at 29%. We saw App Cloud and Other at 43%; Marketing, 28%. But what I really focus on is that we have a balanced portfolio of offerings because as the sales force kind of gets -- has different levels of comfort and by geography and by market segment, we see that shift quarter-to-quarter. But like a portfolio manager in a big institution, as big financial institution and they're keeping a balanced portfolio, so are we. And through that balanced portfolio, that's how we're achieving these high-performance results."

I mean, I think when you look at things like Einstein, you look at kind of these incredible directions, these shifts that are going on in technology, from a customer perspective, okay, and we had an opportunity to meet with all the largest banks here in New York this week. Customer service, sales, marketing, these thing -- it's going to have an incredible shift. And that is really what is just surprising to me. I don't think -- when you look back, we started this company 17, 18 years ago, and where we are now, I mean, this was unexpected. And from a technical perspective -- and I went through some of those things, but whether it's our UI, what -- the demos that I did with customers today were entirely on my phone. That was -- giving CEOs of Fortune 100 companies say, ""Hey, I run my whole business on my phone."" That surprises a lot of people. And to see the amount of information and insights that you can get from that is just incredible. And not just the UI but business intelligence as well, I have Wave running on my phone. Mark Hawkins has Wave running on his -- we both gave a Fortune 10 -- we both gave a Fortune 10 CEO a demo on our phones, and they just couldn't believe that. And then I'll tell you that it's now this AI, artificial intelligence, what -- everything's getting just smarter, and it's helping all these users to actually point the direction of success. They know where to go. That is what is so cool. And of course, we're complementing that with the speed of our platform, with this unbelievable mobility, with this productivity from Quip. I think I talked about that earlier. But that's a huge game changer for our customers. This is really awesome, and then to see it as this integrated platform that our company -- our customers can execute against is very motivating for them. And I think that, that's really cool. And of course, Einstein is a huge part of it, and you're going to see Einstein, of course, deeply integrated in everything that we do. And customers get that Einstein is different than other AI solutions. Some -- I've met with all the tech CEOs, of course, the cloud CEOs, and they all have AI. It's table stakes AI -- AI is table stakes. You all know that. Everybody's got it programmatically. Oh, we've got the best AI. No, we've got the best AI. We've got -- okay, fine, but we are -- have it declaratively, okay, through our platform because we need to bring it to millions of people, not just a few -- there's only 15 million programmers in the world. We're much bigger than that. We have to bring this to people who are -- don't code or low coders, weak -- or citizen developers need to have the power of artificial intelligence. They need the power of mobility. They -- that's why Salesforce platform is so exciting and that our core clouds, like sales and service are built on it, that is a huge differentiator for us, and it's -- you can see it just in our win rates and also our competitive position has never been stronger."

We are in so many amazing markets, whether it's sales, service, marketing, communities, analytics, application development like we -- like you're talk -- App Cloud, whether it's commerce, whether it's IoT, whether it's productivity with Quip. And the Salesforce is going to have that full portfolio of products, and they are going to move back and forth against those. And we've seen that.

And if I look at our field organization and the value proposition and the solutions that they can put in front of a customer, whether it's a line of business executive or whether it's from an industry perspective, it is incredibly compelling, and that is really manifesting itself in these results. So I would echo Marc's sentiment about what people have to carry in their bag and what they can put in front of customers. I also want to go back to part of the question around the platform and why we're seeing such great results in the platform. There's a bunch of reasons for this, and let me start with the systems integrator. I think as everybody knows, we have really emphasized the importance of having an incredible partner ecosystem, particularly over the last 3.5 years, and that has just paid dividends, whether you're talking about the largest SIs or the boutiques. And we still have work to do there. But the team has really done a fantastic job there, but those SIs are really recognizing the value of the platform and what it can bring to their clients. So that's one point I would raise. The second point that I would raise is that, initially, when we sell or position a product to a customer like Sales Cloud or Service Cloud, customers are overwhelmed by how incredible it is, but then they realize that the power of the platform extending sales and extending service. And that just lends itself to more usage and adoption and utilization of the platform product. And then finally, back to my partner comment. We have had a huge emphasis on ISVs and the growth of the ISVs and making sure that we reinvigorate our AppExchange. But particularly around our industry ISVs, we've seen tremendous success. And why is that? Well, number one, they love our platform. They see all the capabilities. They see all the potential, and they want to build mission-critical applications on top of that platform. So we do have a lot of great products in the portfolio that our sales team and our -- can deliver and our service teams can provide service to and our partners can deploy. But we also have an incredible platform, and that is a lot of the secret sauce that we have in the company."

What's unique, Heather, about our capability, and you know this, is that we have an integrated platform. And this integrated platform is exciting because not only is it the #1 sales cloud in the world, not only is it the #1 service cloud in the world, not only is it the #1 declarative platform, okay, but it has all these other capabilities, mobility and AI and so forth, the analytics and so forth. And so I think that when I look at the most incredible things that our customers have done, it -- they weave these things together in really smart and creative ways, build these -- they build these apps. They deploy these things internally, and they look for speed. They're looking for speed. Of course, they want productivity. Of course, they want intelligence. Of course, they want mobility. They want that core platform. And that -- because I think we built it right -- now of course, we've also bought some great things that are outside of our core that we're integrating into our core like our Marketing Cloud, like our Commerce Cloud, like Quip, okay. But with Lightning, that's an incredible UI layer that no one has ever seen anything like this componentized application development UI layer. It's almost like a visual ETL. That is these customers are now integrating this stuff together at the UI layer and of course, at the data layer, but that is what I think is going to really drive us forward. I think it's going to be our platform. And I think that when you look out -- and obviously, we have short-term goals around that $20 billion number. I mean, Heather, I'm sure you have your own model of when you think we're going to hit it. But I think that, for us, we want to -- look, I mean, we want to make sure that -- I don't know exactly when we're going to double the company by, but my dream certainly is to double this -- I would just tell you, my dream is to double this company within the next 3 to 4 years for sure.

So listen, we live in a world where, -- and Marc talked about this, where speed and mobility and productivity and innovation intelligence are paramount, okay. This has become table stakes if you want to be part of the next wave of great companies. And if you think about kind of the classic business problem that any consumer packaged goods company has right now is they have to have a connection with that end consumer. Many times, they go through a retailer or a distributor, or whether it's a classic industrial company or whether it's a consumer packaged good company like a Unilever, they want that direct connection to the consumer. So moving that shift, keeping the B2B relationships but also establishing a new model of B2C is very critical to their future. I mean, think about we live in this world we call it the age of the customer. And think about cloud, mobile, social, data science, IoT, analytics and artificial intelligence all coming together. New companies are born overnight. Barriers to entry into markets are being brought down. And if you're not thinking about the future and how you're going to engage with your customer, whether you're a B2B company or a B2C customer, you're going to be in trouble. So this is becoming a regular dialogue and even more meaningful for us at Salesforce because of the Commerce Cloud. So this is just another part of our portfolio that really helps to complete the package around these transformations. So it is becoming a regular part of the conversation. And that particular win that I mentioned earlier, this is one of the world's greatest CPG companies in many regards, and it is exactly about moving from B2B to B2C."

And to Keith's credit -- and he said this, but I think it's very subtle, so I think it's worth amplifying, he made a number of changes. We made a number of changes, I think, that really let us perform well in the third quarter because we did see the market shift a little bit in the second quarter. We told everybody that. And we -- it's not the first time that we've seen that in our careers. Keith and I have been through -- have been to this rodeo before, and the selling motion had to change. I think in companies that you've seen report in the last month or so, who kind of saw or seen that kind of market shift, they also will change in these -- in the coming quarters their selling motion because the selling motion has had to change in fiscal year '17. We changed. You can see the results, incredible, even with this foreign exchange headwind. So that's number one. Number two, in regards specifically to our fourth quarter, we don't talk about this specifically, but one of the reasons that we do have confidence around the fourth quarter is a certain percentage of that revenue is kind of contracts we've already signed that, as we know, we're going to get bookings in the fourth quarter because we have signed these agreements. And so that is coming in. And so that gives us a leg up. And then Keith had an incredible focus through the sales organization, which is, as you know, essentially half our company is in sales, customer facing. And that part -- that customer-facing organization, which is, I think, the best in the world, all wants to have a great fourth quarter, and they're focused. And we have made these cool adjustments. So do you want to just amplify any of that or augment or highlight any of that? Because I actually think there's a lot to learn. And you and I have been coaching CEOs on how to kind of survive some of these ebb and flow because I think that we both have a lot of confidence that we're going to see more -- a lot of exciting things happen."

Well, one of the things that we have chatted about that I think is good to share on the call is when we exit, Keith, with Q4, we're going to exit with a $9 billion run rate in terms of revenue run rate, Marc. So we're not only achieving our plan, but we're actually going to exit with a run rate of $9 billion. It's going to position us and the guidance you heard for next year is going to be $10.15 billion at the high end. So that's another really big milestone. But, Marc, this guidance for the year with the confidence you had talked about also implies 2 other milestones we have never hit in the history of the company. One is that in this FY '17, our guidance implies $1 billion-plus operating margin non-GAAP milestone. This is something we've aspired to, and that's going to achieve with this particular guidance for this year, Marc. And the last thing we're going to achieve is another milestone we've never ever done, which is $2 billion plus on the operating cash flow. So these are things, Marc, that, I think, quantitatively are milestones that support this idea. Keith, I don't know if you want to comment there."

As you know, this is one of our core strategies that we've tried to put in place over the last 3.5 years, is really to speak the language of the customer and go to market by industry and make sure our messaging and our products -- and our entire portfolio is really, in many ways, taking this incredible platform of products and portfolio of products and reoriented them to solve a specific customer problem. In this particular quarter, we're seeing something in Q3 around financial services, where, again, 7 of these premier financial services institutions decided to go with Salesforce as they think about their transformation. One of these deals was with a premier wealth management company, and they are going wall to wall with our Financial Services Cloud, which is one of our first vertical products that we've ever had in the company. And it's only been GA-ed since March, but this firm is going wall to wall. And that's because we are targeting a specific problem area in a specific industry. I mean, you think about the Telecom Argentina solution that we partnered as part of our ecosystem with this company like Vlocity. I mean, this is transformational for the telecommunications industry. It's a huge win for both of us. And this is probably not the same sort of outcome that we would have gone if we had not had something that was industry specific. So whether it's the PNC story or the Citigroup story or the wealth management story that I referenced to the Telecom Argentina, we are in very early days here, whether it's organically with our products, with the Financial Services Cloud or the Health Cloud or whether it's with our partner ecosystem, but this is really a hand-in-glove strategy with our partners, our SIs, our ISVs, the way that we've organized our field teams around going to market. And at the end of the day, it all comes back to the platform because everything is built on that platform and leverages the strength of that platform. So again, I think that is the secret sauce. But this vertical and industry strategy is certainly playing off in terms of the level that we call on, on the accounts. These are all very much CEO-level sales, the mind share and market share and wallet share that we're getting as a result of speaking the language of the customer. So we've got some momentum here, and we're excited about it."

We're coming live to you from New Jersey, where we have the whole team, and we spent the whole week here in New York and having a great time. And it's been great to be here. We j",1078,"Hey, thanks, John, and thanks to everybody for joining us on the call today. We're coming live to you from New Jersey, where we have the whole team, and we spent the whole week here in New York and having a great time. And it's been great to be here. We just opened our new Salesforce Tower, which is the former MetLife Building at Bryant Park, really cool, great new space for customers, partners, employees. Love to invite all of you there to see what we're going to do with this incredible new building in New York. And Salesforce Tower New York is open and all the signage is going to be going up over the next 6 months. We're really thrilled, and we're in the first floor. It's really -- I couldn't be more excited to be here.  Hey, we're looking forward to having you all visit us there. 
And okay, let's get right to it. You can see from our results, we had an exceptional third quarter. Revenue rose to more than $2.1 billion, up 27% in constant currency from a year ago. You know already there is no other top 10 software company delivering that 27% number.
And what I'm really excited about is we expect to deliver, well, more than $10 billion in revenue in fiscal 2018. I think we initiated guidance at $10.15 billion at the high end of our range, and now we're setting our sights on our next goal, $20 billion. Look, no other software company -- no enterprise software company is delivering this kind of growth at this scale, size.
And we're already off to a great start. Deferred revenue third quarter grew to $3.5 billion, up 25% in constant currency from a year ago. Dollar value of booked business on, off the balance sheet, more than $12 billion, up 27% year-over-year. That's a great predictor for next year on why we're so aggressive about giving this incredible $10.1 billion to $10.15 billion number now because we have that $12 billion on the balance sheet that's in the deferred.
So let's talk about this. We're really well positioned for the future. Everyone at Dreamforce saw that. We are having an incredible, incredible year. We're growing in this mid- to high 20s range, and we've scaled from $4 billion 3 years ago to $8 billion this year. We see tremendous, tremendous opportunity ahead.
Now today, we're trusted by a global community with 1 billion customers, consumers, citizens, partners and employees, and that's a huge responsibility on our shoulders. What we're excited about is serving all these incredible people all over the world with our services. And just look at our new commerce cloud, supporting 300 million unique shoppers a month. And you saw Adidas, and I love this story, 10,000 pairs of YEEZY shoes. Kanye West, you did a great job on the shoe, in a single hour through the Salesforce Commerce Cloud. Thank you, Kanye. Thank you, Adidas. That's amazing.
In our Marketing Cloud, processing 600 million social posts and more than 1 billion messages a day, really, really exciting and 400 million consumers using that service. So you just look at customer-facing apps built with Salesforce Heroku, companies like Macy's, Toyota. We're operating at an incredible scale and now an incredible level of momentum as well.
Over the past several months, I've been spending a lot of time on the road with our customers. I love being with our customers, and this week, of course, was no exception. I'll tell you what I continue to see is this incredible community that surrounds us, and it's been awesome to experience that. I just went through that. I just did the Dreamforce keynote again yesterday here in New York and just having all of these customers so excited about our future, understanding this amazing platform that we've built the future B2B and B2C CRM. And you saw this come to life at our sold-out Dreamforce Conference at September, which was way beyond our expectations. I know a lot of the conferences this year have not delivered their results but Dreamforce did. That was awesome. And you saw not just the 170,000 people registered. And everyone was there and so you saw us packed. But more than 15 million people joining online, that was a huge surprise for us.
And at Dreamforce, you also saw how we're continuing to innovate with Lightning, with Einstein. It's been really, really, really awesome. Of course, probably the most exciting announcement at Dreamforce for a lot of our customers has been Salesforce Einstein. We've extended our Salesforce platform not just with this incredible UI with Lightning, not just with this incredible BI layer with Wave, but now we've extended our Salesforce platform once again with an AI layer with Einstein. And it's really the world's easiest, easiest AI. That is all of these partners, all of these customers are able to easily inherit all of the most awesome state-of-the-art artificial intelligence, whether it's machine learning, machine intelligence, deep learning right inside the Salesforce platform through Einstein. And we're extending that Salesforce platform with amazing new capabilities, with new technologies, new talent, new platform, functionality, and you saw that again this quarter, where we have acquired this incredible DMP, Krux, extending our Marketing Cloud. 
And of course, everybody knows, if you've been around me at all, you'd see how our whole company now has 20,000 users on Quip. And of course, Facebook has thousands of users on Quip, and other incredible companies like Electronic Arts and many others have thousands of users now on Quip. And if you don't have Quip on your phone yet and you haven't experienced Quip, you should just go to the App Store right now and download Quip, Q-U-I-P. It'll change your life.
I'll tell you, you can really experience next-generation productivity with live, collaborate documents and spreadsheets on our platform, integrated media. It is really cool. And Bret Taylor, former CTO of Facebook, is now with Salesforce and, of course, the former legendary Product Manager at Google, who did Google Maps. He just -- he and Kevin Gibbs, his co-Founder, did just a beautiful job on that.
Well, anyway, I could go on and on and on about our products and technology and how exciting this quarter was, but let me turn it over to Keith. And, Keith, thanks for coming down from Boston and being here out for the call."
122917,407617374,1089571,"salesforce.com, inc., Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Nov 17, 2016",2016-11-17,"Earnings Calls","Salesforce, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Marc. Thanks, everybody, for joining the call. Listen, Q3 was an outstanding quarter. We had excellent execution from the entire team in all of our key geographies and industries. We're really, really thrilled with the results.We also delivered",761,"Thanks, Marc. Thanks, everybody, for joining the call. Listen, Q3 was an outstanding quarter. We had excellent execution from the entire team in all of our key geographies and industries. We're really, really thrilled with the results.
We also delivered very strong performance in large deals this quarter. Not only did we close a record number of 7-figure-plus transactions in Q3, but the value of those transactions grew significantly. We continue to spend a lot of time with CEOs, and at Dreamforce, our CEO Summit brought together some amazing thought leaders, and they're all looking to drive a new level of innovation in their industries around customer engagement.
And they recognized that they need an intelligent customer engagement platform that will help them stay ahead of rapidly changing customer expectations. Now, this level of dialogue and engagement with these CEOs of some of the most incredible companies in the world, they have put their trust in us, and that has been reflected in our results.
So for example, this quarter, we saw huge strength in financial services, where we signed strategic agreements with 7 of the premier financial services institutions in the United States, including Citi and PNC Bank. And we're very, very excited about these stories, so let me tell you a little bit about PNC. This is a new relationship for Salesforce, and we're helping them streamline operations across all their primary lines of business so that they can reimagine the banking experience for nearly 11 million customers. All their retail call centers and branches will now be powered by Salesforce, and that will help them respond to customers fastest. And they'll also use Salesforce to mobilize their corporate and institutional banking team, giving them access to customer information on the go.
Salesforce also signed a strategic agreement with Citi in the quarter. And this is Citi's global consumer bank that will utilize Salesforce for all their client-facing personnel in their U.S. retail bank, enabling Citi to better serve clients while lowering costs and improving analytics and efficiency. It really is an incredible vision to transform their global consumer bank with a very highly differentiated customer experience.
We had a landmark win with one of the world's largest consumer packaged good companies who just needed a complete CRM and e-commerce platform to help them transform from B2B to a B2C business. Now I am having a lot of conversations with customers about this particular type of transformation, and this relationship was the result of excellent collaboration between Salesforce and the Commerce Cloud, which grew its comparable customer gross merchandise value by 22% in constant currency from a year ago. This is an early sign of the power of our combined businesses, and it is creating unmatched value.
Other commerce wins in the quarter included GNC and Shiseido. Now, Amazon is a great win in the quarter as well. We formed a strategic relationship in Q1 as you all know, and in Q3, that relationship has expanded. And they added even more services throughout the company.
International continues to be an important cornerstone of our growth strategy. In Europe, we had a great win with KONE, one of the world's largest elevator companies. And just last week, I spoke with KONE's CEO, Henrik Ehrnrooth, and his team about our partnership to transform the multi-billion-dollar field service industry together. Very exciting. Their vision is excellent, and they're using Salesforce to mobilize more than 20,000 service technicians. With real-time customer information and service data from connected equipment, they will be able to provide more proactive service and respond to service requests faster than ever.
Telecom Argentina, also new to the Salesforce family. They selected Salesforce to power all their call centers and upgrade the in-store and online experience for more than 25 million customers. We partner very closely with Vlocity to show them an integrated solution in their industry, and it is the testimony of the power of our industry strategy coupled with Salesforce's ecosystem and our ability to work effectively with our partners.
It has also proved positive that our ecosystem is absolutely blossoming. So it's pretty clear that our enterprise strategy, coupled with our continued operational focus, is working. Our investments in key industries, our partner ecosystem and our top international regions are paying off, and we are very well positioned for a strong fiscal -- the remainder of fiscal 2017.
So at this point, I'd like to hand the call over to Mark Hawkins, and he can share some more detail around the financial highlights for the quarter. Mark?"
122917,407617374,1089571,"salesforce.com, inc., Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Nov 17, 2016",2016-11-17,"Earnings Calls","Salesforce, Inc.","Executives","Yes. Thanks, Keith. And I'm very pleased with our financial results for the third quarter. Let me just say that. Total revenue for the quarter was up 25% in dollars and 27% in constant currency, excluding a year-over-year FX headwind of $32 million.The",629,"Yes. Thanks, Keith. And I'm very pleased with our financial results for the third quarter. Let me just say that. Total revenue for the quarter was up 25% in dollars and 27% in constant currency, excluding a year-over-year FX headwind of $32 million.
The Commerce Cloud is off to a great start and had an excellent quarter, contributing $49 million to total revenue after adjusting for purchasing accounting. Our dollar attrition for the third quarter, which excludes Marketing Cloud and other acquired businesses, remained below 9%.
Looking at revenue cloud. Sales -- looking at revenue by cloud. Sales Cloud grew 13% year-over-year. Service Cloud grew 26%. App Cloud and Other grew 38%. Marketing Cloud grew 46%, but then if you exclude approximately $42 million of subscription and support revenue related to Demandware, Marketing Cloud grew 21%. In our region, we delivered another strong quarter of year-over-year constant-currency revenue growth in EMEA by growing 27% and Asia Pac by growing 29%.
Now before I move on to cash flow and deferred revenue, I want to remind you that invoicing seasonality is affecting both of these metrics. As we discussed at the last 2 Analyst Days, we continue to see an increase in the seasonality of invoicing, primarily as a result of compounding and to a lesser extent, contract co-terming and a shift toward annual invoicing in Q4.
In that context, third quarter cash flow was $154 million, down 5% over last year. Deferred revenue ended the quarter at $3.5 billion, up 23%. Deferred revenue includes approximately $30 million related to our acquisition of Demandware, up from $23 million in Q2. On a constant-currency basis, deferred revenue was up 25% when excluding a year-over-year FX headwind of about $49 million. On a sequential basis, deferred revenue had an FX headwind of $33 million.
In the quarter, approximately 80% of all subscription and support-related invoices were issued with annual terms, excluding Demandware. The Q3 benefit to deferred revenue from the change in billing frequency was less than 1 percentage point of growth.
Now moving on to guidance. I'm pleased to be raising our full year revenue guidance to $8.365 billion to $8.375 billion despite absorbing approximately $100 million to $150 million of FX headwind this year. This implies year-over-year growth for FY '17 of approximately 25%. We expect Demandware and other acquired assets to contribute about 1% to 2 percentage points of growth year-over-year.
We're also raising our full year non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance by $0.03 to $0.97 and $0.98. This raise includes 1% (sic) [$0.01] from operational outperformance and $0.01 from an investment gain in Q3 and $0.01 from an anticipated investment gain in Q4. This guide continues to imply approximately 70 basis points of full year non-GAAP operating margin improvement. We continue to anticipate full year operating cash flow growth of 20% to 21% year-over-year.
For Q4, we're initiating revenue guidance of $2.267 billion to $2.277 billion, non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.24 to $0.25 and a year-over-year deferred revenue growth of 22% to 23%. And as you heard from Marc, we're excited to deliver our first $10 billion revenue milestone next year as we're initiating fiscal 2018 revenue guidance of $10.1 billion to $10.15 billion. This implies year-over-year growth of approximately 21%. We plan to provide additional details about our outlook for FY '18 on our fourth quarter call in February.
To close, we had a strong third quarter, and we are well positioned for a great finish to FY '17. And this sets us up for another strong 20%-plus growth year in FY '18.
At this time, I'd like to thank all of our nearly 24,000 employees for their dedication to customer success and driving these outstanding results. And with that, we'll open up the call for questions. Operator?"

And I'm very, very pleased with the results. This is a high-performing team. It's been a very high-performing team for a number of years, and they responded in kind. As far as deals, in any given quarter, deals ebb and -- there's an ebb and flow. Some come in. Some come out. But I'm very, very pleased with the execution in the quarter, particularly around these large 7-figure-plus transactions. Again, these brands are absolutely fantastic. You talk about a company like PNC Bank or Citigroup and Amazon in the quarter, KONE, Telecom Argentina. Many of these brands are world-class brands, and our performance was strong globally across all theaters, all markets, all segments, all industries. So again, I think it is a quarter of execution and very, very proud of how the team responded."

And obviously, based on these results, our customers are super excited as well, and they serve as the inspiration and motivation for a lot of the vision, along with, of course, what Marc and the rest of the team comes up with here. But I will tell you that we're very pleased with our Sales Cloud execution. We're very pleased with our Service Cloud execution. And proof positive around Service Cloud is that example I gave on KONE. This is a best-in-class service-oriented company even though they're an industrial manufacturer. And they look to us to help them transform their business around field service because this is a way for them to differentiate their products. Service is very strategic to their future, and it's just one example of how companies are looking at Service Cloud. Our platform continues. Our ISV strategy is very, very strong. Our execution around ISVs has been very strong, which speaks to how strong the platform is. We look at Marketing Cloud as a very strong product. We look at some of these acquisitions that we've made, the Commerce Cloud. We had a very large global CPG company, a very, very recognizable brand, and that deal happened because Commerce Cloud onto itself was very compelling, but when combined with our core products, made us even more compelling to obtain a vision for that particular company. So we love our product strategy. We love our vision. Our customers obviously love our vision. This was only reinforced at Dreamforce, which was just an incredible event this year. And we say that every year, but it was just an incredible event. And then when you start adding things like Einstein into the mix, which really is about the future, it just becomes more and more compelling. So we definitely have the winds at our back and in our sails, and we're super excited about the execution and our vision for our customers."

We have a balanced portfolio in regard to our small and medium business as well as our enterprise business. We also have a balanced portfolio when it comes to our products. And you can see that in the numbers. Of course, Sales Cloud is one of the largest products in our industry, not just CRM but in the software industry, and to see it growing at 13%, I mean, I just think that is incredible to see that re-acceleration. And it's pretty awesome, and I'm really excited about that. Again, we saw Service at 29%. We saw App Cloud and Other at 43%; Marketing, 28%. But what I really focus on is that we have a balanced portfolio of offerings because as the sales force kind of gets -- has different levels of comfort and by geography and by market segment, we see that shift quarter-to-quarter. But like a portfolio manager in a big institution, as big financial institution and they're keeping a balanced portfolio, so are we. And through that balanced portfolio, that's how we're achieving these high-performance results."

Customer service, sales, marketing, these thing -- it's going to have an incredible shift. And that is really what is just surprising to me. I don't think -- when you look back, we started this company 17, 18 years ago, and where we are now, I mean, this was unexpected. And from a technical perspective -- and I went through some of those things, but whether it's our UI, what -- the demos that I did with customers today were entirely on my phone. That was -- giving CEOs of Fortune 100 companies say, ""Hey, I run my whole business on my phone."" That surprises a lot of people. And to see the amount of information and insights that you can get from that is just incredible. And not just the UI but business intelligence as well, I have Wave running on my phone. Mark Hawkins has Wave running on his -- we both gave a Fortune 10 -- we both gave a Fortune 10 CEO a demo on our phones, and they just couldn't believe that. And then I'll tell you that it's now this AI, artificial intelligence, what -- everything's getting just smarter, and it's helping all these users to actually point the direction of success. They know where to go. That is what is so cool. And of course, we're complementing that with the speed of our platform, with this unbelievable mobility, with this productivity from Quip. I think I talked about that earlier. But that's a huge game changer for our customers. This is really awesome, and then to see it as this integrated platform that our company -- our customers can execute against is very motivating for them. And I think that, that's really cool. And of course, Einstein is a huge part of it, and you're going to see Einstein, of course, deeply integrated in everything that we do. And customers get that Einstein is different than other AI solutions. Some -- I've met with all the tech CEOs, of course, the cloud CEOs, and they all have AI. It's table stakes AI -- AI is table stakes. You all know that. Everybody's got it programmatically. Oh, we've got the best AI. No, we've got the best AI. We've got -- okay, fine, but we are -- have it declaratively, okay, through our platform because we need to bring it to millions of people, not just a few -- there's only 15 million programmers in the world. We're much bigger than that. We have to bring this to people who are -- don't code or low coders, weak -- or citizen developers need to have the power of artificial intelligence. They need the power of mobility.

And the Salesforce is going to have that full portfolio of products, and they are going to move back and forth against those. And we've seen that.

And if I look at our field organization and the value proposition and the solutions that they can put in front of a customer, whether it's a line of business executive or whether it's from an industry perspective, it is incredibly compelling, and that is really manifesting itself in these results. So I would echo Marc's sentiment about what people have to carry in their bag and what they can put in front of customers. I also want to go back to part of the question around the platform and why we're seeing such great results in the platform. There's a bunch of reasons for this, and let me start with the systems integrator. I think as everybody knows, we have really emphasized the importance of having an incredible partner ecosystem, particularly over the last 3.5 years, and that has just paid dividends, whether you're talking about the largest SIs or the boutiques. And we still have work to do there. But the team has really done a fantastic job there, but those SIs are really recognizing the value of the platform and what it can bring to their clients. So that's one point I would raise. The second point that I would raise is that, initially, when we sell or position a product to a customer like Sales Cloud or Service Cloud, customers are overwhelmed by how incredible it is, but then they realize that the power of the platform extending sales and extending service. And that just lends itself to more usage and adoption and utilization of the platform product. And then finally, back to my partner comment. We have had a huge emphasis on ISVs and the growth of the ISVs and making sure that we reinvigorate our AppExchange. But particularly around our industry ISVs, we've seen tremendous success. And why is that? Well, number one, they love our platform. They see all the capabilities. They see all the potential, and they want to build mission-critical applications on top of that platform. So we do have a lot of great products in the portfolio that our sales team and our -- can deliver and our service teams can provide service to and our partners can deploy. But we also have an incredible platform, and that is a lot of the secret sauce that we have in the company."

What's unique, Heather, about our capability, and you know this, is that we have an integrated platform. And this integrated platform is exciting because not only is it the #1 sales cloud in the world, not only is it the #1 service cloud in the world, not only is it the #1 declarative platform, okay, but it has all these other capabilities, mobility and AI and so forth, the analytics and so forth. And so I think that when I look at the most incredible things that our customers have done, it -- they weave these things together in really smart and creative ways, build these -- they build these apps. They deploy these things internally, and they look for speed. They're looking for speed. Of course, they want productivity. Of course, they want intelligence. Of course, they want mobility. They want that core platform. And that -- because I think we built it right -- now of course, we've also bought some great things that are outside of our core that we're integrating into our core like our Marketing Cloud, like our Commerce Cloud, like Quip, okay. But with Lightning, that's an incredible UI layer that no one has ever seen anything like this componentized application development UI layer. It's almost like a visual ETL. That is these customers are now integrating this stuff together at the UI layer and of course, at the data layer, but that is what I think is going to really drive us forward. I think it's going to be our platform. And I think that when you look out -- and obviously, we have short-term goals around that $20 billion number. I mean, Heather, I'm sure you have your own model of when you think we're going to hit it. But I think that, for us, we want to -- look, I mean, we want to make sure that -- I don't know exactly when we're going to double the company by, but my dream certainly is to double this -- I would just tell you, my dream is to double this company within the next 3 to 4 years for sure.

So listen, we live in a world where, -- and Marc talked about this, where speed and mobility and productivity and innovation intelligence are paramount, okay. This has become table stakes if you want to be part of the next wave of great companies. And if you think about kind of the classic business problem that any consumer packaged goods company has right now is they have to have a connection with that end consumer. Many times, they go through a retailer or a distributor, or whether it's a classic industrial company or whether it's a consumer packaged good company like a Unilever, they want that direct connection to the consumer. So moving that shift, keeping the B2B relationships but also establishing a new model of B2C is very critical to their future. I mean, think about we live in this world we call it the age of the customer. And think about cloud, mobile, social, data science, IoT, analytics and artificial intelligence all coming together. New companies are born overnight. Barriers to entry into markets are being brought down. And if you're not thinking about the future and how you're going to engage with your customer, whether you're a B2B company or a B2C customer, you're going to be in trouble. So this is becoming a regular dialogue and even more meaningful for us at Salesforce because of the Commerce Cloud. So this is just another part of our portfolio that really helps to complete the package around these transformations. So it is becoming a regular part of the conversation. And that particular win that I mentioned earlier, this is one of the world's greatest CPG companies in many regards, and it is exactly about moving from B2B to B2C."

And to Keith's credit -- and he said this, but I think it's very subtle, so I think it's worth amplifying, he made a number of changes. We made a number of changes, I think, that really let us perform well in the third quarter because we did see the market shift a little bit in the second quarter. We told everybody that. And we -- it's not the first time that we've seen that in our careers. Keith and I have been through -- have been to this rodeo before, and the selling motion had to change. I think in companies that you've seen report in the last month or so, who kind of saw or seen that kind of market shift, they also will change in these -- in the coming quarters their selling motion because the selling motion has had to change in fiscal year '17. We changed. You can see the results, incredible, even with this foreign exchange headwind. So that's number one. Number two, in regards specifically to our fourth quarter, we don't talk about this specifically, but one of the reasons that we do have confidence around the fourth quarter is a certain percentage of that revenue is kind of contracts we've already signed that, as we know, we're going to get bookings in the fourth quarter because we have signed these agreements. And so that is coming in. And so that gives us a leg up. And then Keith had an incredible focus through the sales organization, which is, as you know, essentially half our company is in sales, customer facing. And that part -- that customer-facing organization, which is, I think, the best in the world, all wants to have a great fourth quarter, and they're focused. And we have made these cool adjustments. So do you want to just amplify any of that or augment or highlight any of that? Because I actually think there's a lot to learn. And you and I have been coaching CEOs on how to kind of survive some of these ebb and flow because I think that we both have a lot of confidence that we're going to see more -- a lot of exciting things happen."

Well, one of the things that we have chatted about that I think is good to share on the call is when we exit, Keith, with Q4, we're going to exit with a $9 billion run rate in terms of revenue run rate, Marc. So we're not only achieving our plan, but we're actually going to exit with a run rate of $9 billion. It's going to position us and the guidance you heard for next year is going to be $10.15 billion at the high end. So that's another really big milestone. But, Marc, this guidance for the year with the confidence you had talked about also implies 2 other milestones we have never hit in the history of the company. One is that in this FY '17, our guidance implies $1 billion-plus operating margin non-GAAP milestone. This is something we've aspired to, and that's going to achieve with this particular guidance for this year, Marc. And the last thing we're going to achieve is another milestone we've never ever done, which is $2 billion plus on the operating cash flow. So these are things, Marc, that, I think, quantitatively are milestones that support this idea. Keith, I don't know if you want to comment there."

As you know, this is one of our core strategies that we've tried to put in place over the last 3.5 years, is really to speak the language of the customer and go to market by industry and make sure our messaging and our products -- and our entire portfolio is really, in many ways, taking this incredible platform of products and portfolio of products and reoriented them to solve a specific customer problem. In this particular quarter, we're seeing something in Q3 around financial services, where, again, 7 of these premier financial services institutions decided to go with Salesforce as they think about their transformation. One of these deals was with a premier wealth management company, and they are going wall to wall with our Financial Services Cloud, which is one of our first vertical products that we've ever had in the company. And it's only been GA-ed since March, but this firm is going wall to wall. And that's because we are targeting a specific problem area in a specific industry. I mean, you think about the Telecom Argentina solution that we partnered as part of our ecosystem with this company like Vlocity. I mean, this is transformational for the telecommunications industry. It's a huge win for both of us. And this is probably not the same sort of outcome that we would have gone if we had not had something that was industry specific. So whether it's the PNC story or the Citigroup story or the wealth management story that I referenced to the Telecom Argentina, we are in very early days here, whether it's organically with our products, with the Financial Services Cloud or the Health Cloud or whether it's with our partner ecosystem, but this is really a hand-in-glove strategy with our partners, our SIs, our ISVs, the way that we've organized our field teams around going to market. And at the end of the day, it all comes back to the platform because everything is built on that platform and leverages the strength of that platform. So again, I think that is the secret sauce. But this vertical and industry strategy is certainly playing off in terms of the level that we call on, on the accounts. These are all very much CEO-level sales, the mind share and market share and wallet share that we're getting as a result of speaking the language of the customer. So we've got some momentum here, and we're excited about it."
