Welcome to our fourth quarter and full year 2015 conference call. Joining me today is our CFO, Christa Davies. I would note that there are slides available on our website for you to follow along with our commentary today. And consistent with previous quarters, I'd like to cover 2 areas before turning the call over to Christa for further financial review. First is our performance against key metrics we communicate to shareholders. Second is the overall organic growth performance including continued areas of strategic investment across Aon. 
On the first topic, our performance versus key metrics. Each quarter, we measure our performance against the key metrics we focus on achieving over the course of the year: grow organically, expand margins, increase earnings per share and deliver free cash flow good growth. 
Turning to Slide 3. In the fourth quarter, organic revenue growth was 5% with solid growth across all major businesses, highlighted by 6% growth in each of our Retail Brokerage businesses. Operating margin increased 110 basis points, reflecting strong operating performance in both segments. And EPS increased 20% to $2.27, reflecting strong operating performance and effective capital management. 
If we turn to the full year, organic revenue growth was 3% overall, reflecting solid growth across both risk and HR Solutions despite pricing pressure and overall economic uncertainty. Operating margin increased 50 basis points, reflecting strong operating performance and record margin results in both segments. EPS increased 8% to $6.18 overcoming substantial foreign currency headwinds. And finally, free cash flow increased 10% to a record $1.7 billion. 
Overall, our results reflect both the strong performance in the quarter and for the full year. And the year with substantial volatility to provide macroeconomic factors and industry headwinds, we continue to invest heavily in client-serving capabilities across our industry-leading platform. These investments, combined with the leadership for our colleagues around the globe, contributed to strong organic growth in both segments to close the year, record operating margin in both segments, record free cash flow and return of $1.9 billion of capital to shareholders. 
Turning to Slide 4, on the second topic of growth and investment. I want to spend the next few minutes discussing the quarter for both of our segments. In Risk Solutions, organic revenue growth was 5% compared to 3% in the prior year quarter after driven by growth across all businesses and reflecting the level of quarterly organic growth not seen since the second quarter of 2007. As we discussed previously, we're driving a set of initiatives and making strategic investments that are strengthening underlying performance and positioning our Risk Solutions segment for long-term growth and improved operating leverage, with the management of our renewal book, [indiscernible] on client promise and retention rates of more than 90% on average across Retail Brokerage. 
New business generation were more than $330 million across our retail business with record new business in U.S. Retail and 19 consecutive quarters of positive net new business in core treaty reinsurance, increased operating leverage from our investments in innovative technology and data and analytics including the Global Risk Insight Platform, which now captures over 3 million trades and $160 billion of bound premium with approximately 40 carriers utilizing the platform today; review, our reinsurer dashboard, combined with strategic consulting to help reinsurers be more effective markets for ceding company clients; and our Aon Broking initiative to better match client needs with a sure her appetite for risk and to identify structured portfolio of solutions. 
A great example of our innovation and data analytics recently was the launch of Aon client treaty, the largest ever underwritten portfolio of risk in the history of Lloyds, an undertaking of data and analytics looking at 64,000 policy transactions, 120 different classes of business in over 157 countries and territory. We've received terrific feedback from clients, found coverage in every major geography and have generated incremental new business since the launch on January 1. And finally, we're expanding our content and global footprint through tuck-in acquisitions that increase scale in emerging markets or expand capability.
Reflecting on the individual businesses within Risk Solutions. In the Americas, organic revenue growth was 6% against the strong comparable in the prior year quarter, driven by a diversified portfolio reflecting industry expertise, product and service capability. Exposures continue to be positive across the region while the impact for pricing was modestly negative, resulting in stable market impact overall. 
We saw growth across all regions: U.S. Retail, Canada and Latin America, including growth across all businesses property/casualty health and benefits an Affinity were 16 of 18 underlying product lines were delivering growth. In U.S. Retail, growth was driven by solid retention rates and record new business generation in areas such as P&C, D&O and cyber while strong management of the renewal book portfolio drove  growth in Latin America. In international, organic revenue growth was 6% compared to flat for the prior year quarter. Exposures continue to be stable and the impact from pricing was modestly negative on average driven by fragile market conditions in many countries across Europe and the continued pressure in the Pacific region. In continental Europe, we saw solid growth, driven by management of the renewal book portfolio reflecting strong leadership across the region. This positions us well to benefit from potential improvements and the macroeconomic environment.
We saw continued strength in New Zealand, while Australia showed modest growth. Results also reflect solid growth across Asia, where many markets grew double digits including Taiwan, Thailand and Singapore. In reinsurance, organic revenue growth was 2%, a strong performance against a tough comparison for the prior year quarter. Results in the quarter primarily reflect positive growth and treaty globally to provide increase in [indiscernible] demand as well as growth in new product such as U.S. mortgage and review. Across our portfolio, we saw a record level of new business generation in the quarter. While excess capital continues to place pressure in the markets, the rate of price decline continues to moderate. Against that price measure, clients are buying more and capital is being deployed to new markets. New opportunities for growth, combined with industry-leading data and analytics, is positioning our reinsurance business for return to modest growth in 2016. 
Overall, across Risk Solutions, we delivered our strongest quarterly rate of organic growth for the year, driven by record new business generation, strong retention rates and returns on our investments and industry-leading data and analytics. Despite fragile macroeconomic conditions and soft pricing in certain areas, we fully anticipate a continuation of low to mid-single-digit organic growth in 2016. 
Turning to HR Solutions. Organic revenue growth was 4%, with solid growth across both major businesses and in high demand areas where we've invested in innovative solutions and client-serving capability. These investments reflect Aon Hewitt's client leadership, an in-depth understanding and influence of market trends including as clients manage risk against pension schemes that are frozen, largely underfunded and facing regulatory changes, solutions to derisk pension plans and support for delegated investment solutions, a strong area of growth where assets under management have grown for $10 billion to roughly $75 billion in 5 years, continued investment to strengthen our industry-leading portfolio of health solutions, covering the full range of benefit strategies, client size and funding choices. Across Aon's suite of private health exchanges, we enrolled roughly 1.4 million lives across 150 clients in 2015 compared to roughly 1.2 million enrolled lives across 100 clients in 2014, reflecting solid double-digit growth. Participant satisfaction was strong as 92% of individuals on the retiree exchange were satisfied with their adviser while 88% on the active exchange like to be able to choose from multiple carriers. Our solutions for clients continue to bend the cost curve by 150 to 200 basis points on average over a multi-year period with more than 1/4 of returning clients seeing a year-over-year decrease. We feel good about the pipeline and our ability to drive greater scale and growth in 2016.
We're also investing in software as a service model at our HR BPO business, where growth in new clients and conversations with existing clients is driving strong demand as well as the expansion of our capabilities to include financial limitations. And finally, we're investing in our talent rewards business as we are seeing strong demand for data and analytics to support increasing organizational change.
Turning to the individual businesses within HR Solutions. In Consulting Services, organic revenue growth was 4%, overcoming a tough comparable in the prior year that included project work relating to the [indiscernible]. Results in the quarter reflect continued growth in retirement consulting, primarily driven by demand for delegated investment consulting solutions. We also saw continued growth in [indiscernible] consulting driven by record growth in participation for survey work as companies require benchmarking and assistance with plan designs to address retention and ways to compete more effectively with a set of strategies. 
In outsourcing, organic revenue growth was 4% as well, driven by growth across all major businesses. We saw growth and benefits administration driven primarily by increase in private-related work. Results reflect growth in HR BPO, driven by new client wins in cloud-based solutions. We saw solid growth in health care exchanges driven by an increase in the number of enrollments across the platform. 
Overall, across HR Solutions, client needs are growing in both size and complexity across retirement and health. Our results reflect a solid finish to the year with growth across all major businesses including strong growth in areas we've been investing to continue to deliver sustainable long-term growth. 
In summary, despite short-term headwinds from both a macroeconomic and industry pricing standpoint, our results for both the quarter and the year finished on a high note. We delivered solid organic growth across both segments and strengthened our operational performance driven by our industry-leading platform of client-serving capabilities and investments in data analytics. 
With that said, I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Christa for further financial review. Christa?"
119853,321700568,927819,"Aon plc, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 05, 2016",2016-02-05,"Earnings Calls","Aon plc","Executives","Thanks so much, Greg, and good morning, everyone. As Greg noted, our industry-leading franchise closed the year with a strong performance despite both macroeconomic and industry-specific headwinds. Our results in the quarter reflect solid organic growth a",1921,"Thanks so much, Greg, and good morning, everyone. As Greg noted, our industry-leading franchise closed the year with a strong performance despite both macroeconomic and industry-specific headwinds. Our results in the quarter reflect solid organic growth and record operating margin performance in risk and HR Solutions, record free cash generation and effective capital management, highlighted by the repurchase of approximately 400 million of ordinary shares in the quarter. We returned roughly $1.9 billion of capital to shareholders in 2015. 
Now let me turn to the financial results for the quarter on Page 6 of the presentation. Our core EPS performance, excluding certain items, increased 20% to $2.27 per share for the fourth quarter compared to $1.89 in the prior year quarter. Certain items that were adjusted for in core EPS performance and highlighted in the schedules on Page 12 of the press release include noncash intangible asset amortization.
Further, included in the results were the $0.10 per share unfavorable impact related to foreign currency translation due to the U.S. dollar strengthening against most major currencies. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, EPS grew 25% for the fourth quarter and 15% for the full year in line with our compounded annual growth rate of 15% for the last 10 years, another year of outstanding performance reflecting the strength of our industry-leading franchise and focus on shareholder value creation.
Going forward, if currency remains stable at today's rates, we would expect substantially less of a headwind with an estimated unfavorable impact of roughly $0.10 for 2016 compared to $0.41 of impact for 2015. We would expect the majority of this impact to be weighted towards the first half of 2016 more so in the first quarter.
Now let me talk about each of the segments on the next slide. In our Risk Solutions segment, organic revenue growth was 5%. Operating margin increased 100 basis points to 25.7% and operating income increased 2% compared to the prior year quarter. Operating income included a $27 million unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation. Excluding this impact, underlying operating income increased 7% versus the prior year quarter. Operating margin improvement of 100 basis points includes a 30 basis points unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation. Excluding the impact from foreign currency, underlying operating margin improved 70 basis points in the quarter. Our fourth quarter performance reflects solid organic growth performance and improved returns on our investments in data and analytics across our portfolio.
For 2015, Risk Solutions operating income decreased 2%, which includes a $128 million unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation. Excluding this impact, underlying operating income increased 5% versus the prior year. Operating margin increased 70 basis points to 23.6% including a 20 basis points favorable impact from foreign currency translation. Excluding the impact from foreign currency, underlying operating margin increased 50 basis points in the year.
We delivered strong operational improvement in 2015 with record operating margins despite significant headwinds from an unfavorable mark-to-market impact reinsurance and fragile macroeconomic conditions. This level of performance reflects strong EBITDA generation and increased operating leverage in the business as well as expense discipline as we optimize our global cost structure. We expect continued improvement in 2016 and are firmly on track long-term target of 26%. In addition, if short-term interest rates continue to rise, we believe we have significant leverage to improving interest rate environment as every 100 basis point rise in global interest rates should result in approximately $45 million of investment income.
Turning to the HR Solutions segment. Organic revenue growth was 4%. Operating margin increased 270 basis points to 26.2% and operating income increased 14% compared to the prior year quarter. Operating income included a $6 million unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation. In addition, there are approximately $12 million or minus 90 basis points of transaction-related and portfolio repositioning costs incurred in the quarter as we continue to drive improved return on capital. The gain related to sale of our asset management business was recorded in other income. 
Results were driven by organic growth, expense discipline and with improved returns on investment including health care exchanges, which delivered modest profitability in 2015. For the full year, operating income increased 7% including a $20 million unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation. Excluding this impact, underlying operating income increased 10% compared to the prior year and operating margins increased 100 basis points to a record 18.1%. This level of performance demonstrates strong improvement over the prior year, reflecting solid financial results in our core business as well as improved profitability in the areas we've been investing for long-term growth including delegated investment consulting, cloud-based solutions in HR BPO and health care exchanges. Looking forward, we expect continued operational improvement in 2016 towards our long-term target of 22% with quarterly [indiscernible] of operating income results in HR Solutions similar to 2015. More specifically, down in the first half also in Q1 and up in the second half most notably Q4.
Now let me discuss a few of the line items outside the operating segments on Slide 9. Unallocated expenses increased $17 million to $61 million due to the timing of certain employee incentive and employee benefit-related expenses as well as certain investments in shared services. Interest income was $4 million compared to $3 million from the prior year quarter. Interest expense was $58 million in line with quarterly guidance. Other income of $49 million primarily includes a gain on the sale of our asset management business in outsourcing and HR Solutions. The sale continues to reflect our efforts to drive improved return on capital. Going forward, we expect a run rate of approximately $45 million per quarter of unallocated expense, $3 million per quarter of interest income and $68 million of interest expense.
Turning to taxes. The adjusted effective tax rate or net income from continuing operations, excluding the applicable tax impact associated with the expenses related to legacy litigation in Q2, decreased to 17.9% compared to the prior year quarter of 19.6% due to the favorable impact of certain discrete tax adjustments. Our estimate of the underlying operating tax rate remains at 19%.
Lastly, average diluted shares outstanding decreased 5% to 279.3 million in the fourth quarter compared to 293.4 million in the prior year quarter as we effectively allocate capital and manage dilution. The company repurchased 4.3 million Class A ordinary shares for approximately $400 million in the fourth quarter. The company has $4.1 billion of remaining authorization under its share repurchase program. Actual shares outstanding on December 31 were 269.8 million, and there are approximately 6 million additional dilutive equivalents. Estimated Q1 '16 beginning dilutive share count is approximately 276 million, subject to share price movement, share issuance and share repurchase.
Now let me turn to the next slide to highlight our solid balance sheet and strong cash flow growth on Slide 10. At December 31, 2015, cash and short-term investments were $740 million. Total debt outstanding was approximately $5.7 billion and total debt-to-EBITDA on a GAAP basis was 2.3x. Cash flow from operations for the year increased 11% or $197 million to a record $2 billion, driven by a decline in pension contributions, restructuring-related payments, cash paid for taxes and working capital improvements, partially offset by $137 million in cash paid to settle legacy litigation and strong organic growth performance in the fourth quarter. Free cash flow, defined by cash flow from operations less CapEx, increased 10% or $163 million to a record $1.7 billion, reflecting strong growth in cash flow from operations, partially offset by a $34 million increase in CapEx. The increase in CapEx in 2015 was primarily related to completed investments in certain projects to optimize our global real estate portfolio. 
As we noted in our press release and related presentation today, during the quarter, for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we reclassified certain cash flows related to shares withheld to taxes from cash flow from operations to cash flow from financing. Shares withheld to taxes reflects the choice of colleagues upon vesting to choose gross or net shares to satisfy their withholding requirements. As nearly all colleagues choose to receive net shares, the company then withholds an applicable amount of shares to cover withholding amounts, in effect creating a share repurchase like transaction. We believe the reclassification of shares withheld to taxes, the cash from financing activities provides greater transparency to the cash flow production from operating results underlines more closely accounting treatment of comparable peers. While the reclassification has no actual cash impact on the cash flow statement, as a result of the reclassification, we are increasing our near-term free cash flow goal from $2.3 billion to $2.4 billion for the full year 2017. 
Turning to the next slide to discuss our significantly increasing free cash flow generation. We value the firm based on vacation and allocate capital to maximize free cash flow returns. Free cash flow of $2.4 billion is not our end goal as further long-term sustainable free cash flow will be driven by continued to operating income growth and additional working capital initiatives beyond 2017. There are 4 primary areas that are expected to contribute to our goal of delivering $2.4 billion or more for the full year 2017. The first is continued operational performance driven by organic revenue growth and margin expansion. The second is working capital improvements as we focus on closing the gap between receivables and payables. The third is declining uses of cash of pension contributions, CapEx and restructuring, which will free up more than $90 million of annual free cash flow between the end of 2015 and 2017. And fourth, lower cash tax payments reflecting a lower effective tax rate. Lastly, I would note that during 2015, we paid $137 million of cash to settle legacy litigation, which we would expect to provide a tailwind to free cash flow growth in 2016.
Turning to our pension plan. we have taken significant steps to reduce volatility and liability as we've closed plans to new entrants, frozen [indiscernible] from incurring additional benefits and continue to derisk certain plant assets. Based on 12/31/2015 actuarial assumptions, reported liabilities on a GAAP basis decreased to $1.8 billion at year-end 2015, reflecting a 94% funded basis compared to $2.1 billion at year-end 2014, reflecting a 90% funded basis. Not reflected in those amounts, however, are $1 billion of unfunded pension plans that are included in noncurrent assets to the balance sheet. Considered together, our net unfunded obligations are approximately $800 million. Overall, we expect contributions to decline by approximately $44 million in 2016 and would expect noncash pension income to be a modest benefit in 2016 versus 2015. 
Regarding our restructuring program, cash payments declined by $54 million to $28 million in 2016. As all charges related to restructuring program have been incurred we would expect cash payments to decline by $9 million to approximately $19 million in 2016 and continue to decline thereafter to an immaterial amount.
In summary, our results for both the quarter and the full year reflects solid organic growth, record operating margin performance across both Risk and HR Solutions, strong EPS growth, record free cash flow of $1.7 billion and the return of roughly $1.9 billion in capital to shareholders. Despite challenging macroeconomic and our industry-specific headwinds, our industry-leading franchise is strongly positioned to help clients manage to increasing complexity magnitude and volatility across the areas of risk, retirement and health.
With that, I would like to turn the call back over to the operator for questions."

We would say that we do not need changes to the macro environment to achieve our $2.4 billion in free cash flow in 2017. If you think about the $1.7 billion of free cash flow we delivered in 2015, you can add back $137 million of cash we spent on litigation in 2015, and then you can add about $100 million of improvement in free cash flow from decreased uses of cash between now and 2017. So you're already up to $2.2 [ph] billion of free cash flow. And then you really needed on incremental $400 million from revenue growth and margin expansion and improved working capital. And so we really believe that we have exceptionally strong free cash flow over the coming years and exceptionally strong free cash flow per share as we expect declining share count between now and 2017 too."

And listen, we saw the new business characteristics in U.S. Retail, for example, these are records, record on record, in fact, in terms of sort of what's happened over the course of the last year.

And again, we look at health solutions across the board really every category in terms of the ability to help clients with this very important challenge they've got around the health side. And we think we've got one of the strongest capabilities here, whether it's HB, whether it's global benefits across the board, and on the exchanges, retiree, active, fully, self, all across the board. And what we would say, if you think about sort of quarter-over-quarter, first, we would agree the adoption on the health active side across the board especially the [indiscernible] hasn't been as fast as expected, by the way, especially given some of the results we've seen with existing clients because it's been exceptional, reduced volatility for them, price reductions year-over-year, 25% [indiscernible] price reductions over the last year. So we're very, very positive in terms of the overall impact. The pipeline looks very, very strong. And again, even in the exchange business as it exists, we have double-digit growth and it's profitable. So for us, we love the solution of the [indiscernible] clients as part of our broader health solution.

Obviously, again, look at it in terms of the overall year, we're not happy with level of growth at Reinsurance at negative 1% for the year, but we just said already, we expect Reinsurance to return to positive organic growth in 2016. And for us, especially for our Reinsurance business maybe more than other, it's a great example of a business right now because business results don't really reflect the underlying capability and opportunity we see which is exceptional. I mean think about it, we're the largest advisory in the world in this area and we're really the #1 in treaty, #1 in fact, #1 on the alternative capital side, capital markets. 20% of the global book is linked to U.S. property cat and that's fully commission-based. Those rates have come down 15% to 25% over the last 24 months that's been reflected, although it started to flatten out a bit, the decrease is not as great. But against that, it's really been the team's ability to continue to win 19 consecutive quarters of wins on treaty reinsurance, which has been exceptional and really the ability to create net new demand, and this is really in areas like mortgage overall and what we've done at review. So they've been able to offset these headwind, which are diminishing. Those businesses that they've offset with is going to continue to grow and the opportunity to 2016 we feel very good. And I would say, by the way, just technically, the 2% in this quarter is on top of the 5% in the Q4 2014. So it was kind of on top of a very strong comparable. So we feel good about the position and we love this business. We're very excited about it. So maybe we go back to Christa on the HR Solutions side and sort of the seasonality overall."

So we're very, very much focused on investment back in the business. And M&A plays a big role on that and will continue to play a big role on that. We probably -- looking at Christa, we probably looked at more deals this year, situations this year than maybe anytime in our history and measured in the billions. We've done fewer of them because we're always going to be disciplined around return on invested capital. Christa has in place a very, very structured way to think about how we can very meticulously invest our capital, we get the highest return on capital, generate free cash flow and build wealth for our shareholders and in the context of that serve clients very, very effective way. And that's really the machine we set up. That's how the engine runs and that's what we've done. So we're going to continue to look at what the best places to place our capital, and we'll be open to acquisitions as we are, organic investments, a buyback and all the above. That's really how we're looking at it."

So one of the things that I tried [indiscernible] failed to communicate earlier was this number varies substantially by year, and the amount is a result of employee's choice, growth of net shares and the market value of our stock.

We do believe that this amount going forward is somewhere between 0 and 100. Therefore, we've increased our target by $100 million to $2.4 billion. One of the other things I would make clear is that the $2.4 billion in free cash flow in 2017 is fully deployable cash because if you look at the $1.7 billion we generated in 2015, we actually returned roughly $1.9 billion of cash to shareholders in 2015. So we have generated a huge amount of cash, which we can fully deploy on either return to shareholders, as Greg said, investing back in our business either organically or inorganically in the form of M&A. So we're very excited about the future growth potential of the firm given the huge cash flow generation that we're going to produce."

And for us, we believe it's going to be fundamental to what we do to try to get accomplished over time, Charles, really is going to be differentiated in terms of our capability versus the marketplace, and there are many examples. By the way, the Risk Insight Platform efforts really are -- actually the work is done directly with the primary insurers serving clients. So it actually touches very much the primary insurance marketplace. But let me give you one example that I have happened to be just in London yesterday with Lloyd's and Lloyd's Syndicates. We just launched something called Aon client treaty, which is a very -- it's basically built on a foundation around data analytics. So in essence, it will be, when done, the single biggest underwriting transaction likely in the history of Lloyd's today. And it really takes our book that goes into the London market to our global broking center and we actually model that book in detail to really bottom up all different aspects of what's going on, 64,000 policy transactions, 120 different classes of business, 157 countries. You get the idea. We built an incredible data room in which underwriters could come in and actually take a company level understanding and underwriting and apply it to the portfolio level. And in essence, what we're saying to our client, by the way, on Monday, we're having our property symposium, I'm talking to clients at our property symposium essentially saying, if you're going to use London capacity, you've eliminated your tail risk. So when you actually think about the set of syndicates that we're actually going to come to bear on behalf of you, the last 3 or 4 or 5 actually create risk, we've eliminated that. So we've actually preconfirmed 20% of that capacity that will follow a lead capacity going into London. That makes that capital we're bringing to bear much, much more competitive. So there's an example of hard clear data and analytics, and essentially, we've analyzed our book sort of in the [indiscernible] London marketplace. But imagine, we can look at this all over the world and we're actually providing distinctive value, unduplicated value to clients using data and analytics. So that's a bit long-winded but I hope you get the idea. That's a very powerful tool. By the way, in order to do that, you have to be able to analyze all 6,000 clients going to London in a way that, frankly, leverages off our risk insight platform. Never been done before."

Welcome to our fourth quarter and full year 2015 conference call. Joining me today is our CFO, Christa Davies.

Welcome to our fourth quarter and full year 2015 conference call. Joining me today is our CFO, Christa Davies. I would note that there are slides available on our website for you to follow along with our commentary today.
And consistent with previous quarters, I'd like to cover 2 areas before turning the call over to Christa for further financial review: first is our performance against key metrics we communicate to shareholders; second is the overall organic growth performance including continued areas of strategic investment across Aon.
On the first topic, our performance versus key metrics. Each quarter, we measure our performance against the key metrics we focus on achieving over the course of the year: grow organically, expand margins, increase earnings per share and deliver free cash flow growth.
Turning to Slide 3. In the fourth quarter, organic revenue growth was 5% with solid growth across all major businesses, highlighted by 6% growth in each of our Retail Brokerage businesses. Operating margin increased 110 basis points, reflecting strong operating performance in both segments. And EPS increased 20% to $2.27, reflecting strong operating performance and effective capital management.
If we turn to the full year, organic revenue growth was 3% overall, reflecting solid growth across both risk and HR Solutions despite pricing pressure and overall economic uncertainty. Operating margin increased 50 basis points, reflecting strong operating performance and record margin results in both segments. EPS increased 8% to $6.18, overcoming substantial foreign currency headwinds. And finally, free cash flow increased 10% to a record $1.7 billion.
Overall, our results reflect both the strong performance in the quarter and for the full year. In a year of substantial volatility driven by macroeconomic factors and industry headwinds, we continued to invest heavily in client-serving capabilities across our industry-leading platform. These investments, combined with the leadership of our colleagues around the globe, contributed to strong organic growth in both segments to close the year, record operating margin in both segments, record free cash flow and return of $1.9 billion of capital to shareholders.
Turning to Slide 4, on the second topic of growth and investment. I want to spend the next few minutes discussing the quarter for both of our segments. In Risk Solutions, organic revenue growth was 5% compared to 3% in the prior year quarter, driven by growth across all businesses and reflecting a level of quarterly organic growth not seen since the second quarter of 2007.
As we discussed previously, we're driving a set of initiatives and making strategic investments that are strengthening underlying performance and positioning our Risk Solutions segment for long-term growth and improved operating leverage, with the management of our renewal book through Aon Client Promise and retention rates of more than 90% on average across Retail Brokerage; new business generation of more than $330 million across our retail business with record new business in U.S. Retail; and 19 consecutive quarters of positive net new business in core treaty reinsurance; increased operating leverage from our investments in innovative technology and data and analytics, including the Global Risk Insight Platform, which now captures over 3 million trades and $160 billion of bound premium with approximately 40 carriers utilizing the platform today; ReView, our Reinsurer dashboard, combined with strategic consulting to help reinsurers be more effective markets for seeding company clients; and our Aon Broking initiative to better match client need with insurer appetite for risk and to identify structured portfolio of solutions.
A great example of our innovation and data analytics recently was the launch of Aon Client Treaty, the largest ever underwritten portfolio of risk in the history of Lloyd's, an undertaking of data and analytics looking at 64,000 policy transactions, 120 different classes of business in over 157 countries and territory. We've received terrific feedback from clients, found coverage in every major geography and have generated incremental new business since the launch on January 1. And finally, we're expanding our content and global footprint through tuck-in acquisitions that increase scale in emerging markets or expand capability.
Reflecting on the individual businesses within Risk Solutions. In the Americas, organic revenue growth was 6% against the strong comparable in the prior year quarter, driven by a diversified portfolio reflecting industry expertise, product and service capability. Exposures continue to be positive across the region, while the impact for pricing was modestly negative, resulting in stable market impact overall.
We saw growth across all regions: U.S. Retail, Canada and Latin America, including growth across all businesses property/casualty, health and benefits and Affinity, where 16 of 18 underlying product lines were delivering growth. In U.S. Retail, growth was driven by solid retention rates and record new business generation in areas such as P&C, D&O and cyber, while strong management of the renewal book portfolio drove growth in Latin America.
In international, organic revenue growth was 6% compared to flat in the prior year quarter. Exposures continue to be stable and the impact from pricing was modestly negative on average, driven by fragile market conditions in many countries across Europe and the continued pressure in the Pacific region. In Continental Europe, we saw solid growth, driven by management of the renewal book portfolio reflecting strong leadership across the region. This positions us well to benefit from potential improvements in the macroeconomic environment.
We saw continued strength in New Zealand, while Australia showed modest growth. Results also reflect solid growth across Asia, where many markets grew double digits including Taiwan, Thailand and Singapore. In Reinsurance, organic revenue growth was 2%, a strong performance against a tough comparison in the prior year quarter. Results in the quarter primarily reflect positive growth and treaty globally driven by an increase in seeing demand as well as growth in new products such as U.S. mortgage and ReView.
Across our portfolio, we saw a record level of new business generation in the quarter. While excess capital continues to place pressure in the market, the rate of price decline continues to moderate. Against that price measure, clients are buying more and capital is being deployed to new markets. New opportunities for growth, combined with industry-leading data and analytics, is positioning our Reinsurance business for return to modest growth in 2016.
Overall, across Risk Solutions, we delivered our strongest quarterly rate of organic growth for the year, driven by record new business generation, strong retention rates and returns on our investments in industry-leading data and analytics. Despite fragile macroeconomic conditions and soft pricing in certain areas, we fully anticipate a continuation of low to mid-single-digit organic growth in 2016.
Turning to HR Solutions. Organic revenue growth was 4%, with solid growth across both major businesses and in high demand areas, where we've invested in innovative solutions and client-serving capability. These investments reflect Aon Hewitt's client leadership and in-depth understanding and influence of market trends, including as clients manage risk against pension schemes that are frozen, largely underfunded and facing regulatory changes.
Solutions to derisk pension plans and support for delegated investment solutions, a strong area of growth for assets under management have grown for $10 billion to roughly $75 billion in 5 years. Continued investment to strengthen our industry-leading portfolio of health solutions, covering the full range of benefit strategies, client size and funding choices.
Across Aon's suite of private health exchanges, we enrolled roughly 1.4 million lives across 150 clients in 2015 compared to roughly 1.2 million enrolled lives and across 100 clients in 2014, reflecting solid double-digit growth. Participant satisfaction was strong, as 92% of individuals on the retiree exchange were satisfied with their adviser, while 88% on the active exchange like to be able to choose from multiple carriers.
Our solutions for clients continue to bend the cost curve by 150 to 200 basis points on average over a multi-year period with more than 1/4 of returning clients seeing a year-over-year decrease. We feel good about the pipeline and our ability to drive greater scale and growth in 2016.
We're also investing in software as a service model at our HR BPO business, where growth in new clients and conversations with existing clients is driving strong demand as well as the expansion of our capabilities to include financial limitations. And finally, we're investing in our talent rewards business, as we are seeing strong demand for data and analytics to support increasing organizational change.
Turning to the individual businesses within HR Solutions. In Consulting Services, organic revenue growth was 4%, overcoming a tough comparable in the prior year that included project work relating to the [indiscernible] to bill. Results in the quarter reflect continued growth in retirement consulting, primarily driven by demand for delegated investment consulting solutions. We also saw continued growth in compensation consulting, driven by record growth in participation for survey work as companies require benchmarking and assistance with plan design to address retention and ways to compete more effectively with incentive strategies.
In outsourcing, organic revenue growth was 4% as well, driven by growth across all major businesses. We saw growth in benefits administration, driven primarily by an increase in project-related work. Results reflect growth in HR BPO, driven by new client wins in cloud-based solutions. We saw solid growth in health care exchanges, driven by an increase in the number of enrollments across the platform.
Overall, across HR Solutions, client needs are growing in both size and complexity across retirement and health. Our results reflect a solid finish to the year with growth across all major businesses, including strong growth in areas we've been investing to continue to deliver sustainable long-term growth.
In summary, despite short-term headwinds from both a macroeconomic and industry pricing standpoint, our results for both the quarter and the year finished on a high note. We delivered solid organic growth across both segments and strengthened our operational performance driven by our industry-leading platform of client-serving capabilities and investments in data and analytics. 
With that said, I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Christa for further financial review. Christa?"

Now let me turn to the financial results for the quarter on Page 6 of the presentation. Our core EPS performance, excluding certain items, increased 20% to $2.27 per share for the fourth quarter compared to $1.89 in the prior year quarter. Certain items that were adjusted for in core EPS performance and highlighted in the schedules on Page 12 of the press release include noncash intangible asset amortization.
Further, included in the results was a $0.10 per share unfavorable impact related to foreign currency translation due to the U.S. dollar strengthening against most major currencies. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, EPS grew 25% for the fourth quarter and 15% for the full year, in line with our compounded annual growth rate of 15% for the last 10 years, another year of outstanding performance reflecting the strength of our industry-leading franchise and focus on shareholder value creation.
Going forward, if currency to remain stable at today's rates, we would expect substantially less of a headwind with an estimated unfavorable impact of roughly $0.10 for 2016 compared to $0.41 of impact for 2015. We would expect the majority of this impact to be weighted towards the first half of 2016 more so in the first quarter.
Now let me talk about each of the segments on the next slide. In our Risk Solutions segment, organic revenue growth was 5%, operating margin increased 100 basis points to 25.7% and operating income increased 2% compared to the prior year quarter. Operating income included a $27 million unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation. Excluding this impact, underlying operating income increased 7% versus the prior year quarter. Operating margin improvement of 100 basis points includes a 30 basis point unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation. Excluding the impact from foreign currency, underlying operating margin improved 70 basis points in the quarter. Our fourth quarter performance reflects solid organic growth performance and improved returns on our investments in data and analytics across our portfolio.
For 2015, Risk Solutions operating income decreased 2%, which includes a $128 million unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation. Excluding this impact, underlying operating income increased 5% versus the prior year. Operating margin increased 70 basis points to 23.6%, including a 20 basis points favorable impact from foreign currency translation. Excluding the impact from foreign currency, underlying operating margin increased 50 basis points in the year.
We delivered strong operational improvement in 2015 with record operating margins despite significant headwinds from an unfavorable market impact in Reinsurance and fragile macroeconomic conditions. This level of performance reflects strong new business generation and increased operating leverage in the business as well as expense discipline as we optimize our global cost structure. We expect continued improvement in 2016 and are firmly on track with our long-term target of 26%. In addition, if short-term interest rates continue to rise, we believe we have significant leverage to improving interest rate environment as every 100 basis point rise in global interest rates should result in approximately $45 million of investment income.
Turning to the HR Solutions segment. Organic revenue growth was 4%, operating margin increased 270 basis points to 26.2% and operating income increased 14% compared to the prior year quarter. Operating income included a $6 million unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation. In addition, there are approximately $12 million or minus 90 basis points of transaction-related and portfolio repositioning costs incurred in the quarter, as we continue to drive improved return on capital. The gain related to the sale of our asset management business was recorded in other income.
Results were driven by organic growth, expense discipline and improved returns on investment including health care exchanges, which delivered modest profitability in 2015. For the full year, operating income increased 7% including a $20 million unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation. Excluding this impact, underlying operating income increased 10% compared to the prior year and operating margins increased 100 basis points to a record 18.1%. This level of performance demonstrates strong improvement over the prior year, reflecting solid financial results in our core business as well as improved profitability in the areas we've been investing for long-term growth, including delegated investment consulting, cloud-based solutions in HR BPO and health care exchanges.
Looking forward, we expect continued operational improvement in 2016 towards our long-term target of 22% with quarterly patterning of operating income results in HR Solutions similar to 2015, more specifically, down in the first half, more so in Q1, and up in the second half, most notably Q4.
Now let me discuss a few of the line items outside of the operating segments on Slide 9. Unallocated expenses increased $17 million to $61 million due to the timing of certain employee incentive and employee benefit-related expenses as well as certain investments in shared services. Interest income was $4 million compared to $3 million from the prior year quarter. Interest expense was $68 million in line with quarterly guidance. Other income of $49 million primarily includes a gain on the sale of our Absence Management Business in Outsourcing in HR Solutions. The sale continues to reflect our efforts to drive improved return on capital. Going forward, we expect a run rate of approximately $45 million per quarter of unallocated expense, $3 million per quarter of interest income and $68 million of interest expense.
Turning to taxes. The adjusted effective tax rate on net income from continuing operations, excluding the applicable tax impact associated with the expenses related to legacy litigation in Q2, decreased to 17.9% compared to the prior year quarter at 19.6%, due to the favorable impact of certain discrete tax adjustments. Our estimate of the underlying operating tax rate remains at 19%.
Lastly, average diluted shares outstanding decreased 5% to 279.3 million in the fourth quarter compared to 293.4 million in the prior year quarter, as we effectively allocate capital and manage dilution. The company repurchased 4.3 million Class A ordinary shares for approximately $400 million in the fourth quarter. The company has $4.1 billion of remaining authorization under its share repurchase program. Actual shares outstanding on December 31 were 269.8 million, and there are approximately 6 million additional dilutive equivalents. Estimated Q1 '16 beginning dilutive share count is approximately 276 million, subject to share price movement, share issuance and share repurchase.
Now let me turn to the next slide to highlight our solid balance sheet and strong cash flow growth on Slide 10. At December 31, 2015, cash and short-term investments were $740 million. Total debt outstanding was approximately $5.7 billion and total debt-to-EBITDA on a GAAP basis was 2.3x. Cash flow from operations for the year increased 11% or $197 million to a record $2 billion, driven by a decline in pension contributions, restructuring-related payments, cash paid for taxes and working capital improvements, partially offset by $137 million in cash paid to settle legacy litigation and strong organic growth performance in the fourth quarter. Free cash flow, as defined by cash flow from operations less CapEx, increased 10% or $163 million to a record $1.7 billion, reflecting strong growth in cash flow from operations, partially offset by a $34 million increase in CapEx. The increase in CapEx in 2015 was primarily related to completed investments in certain projects to optimize our global real estate portfolio.
As we noted in our press release and related presentation today, during the quarter for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we reclassified certain cash flows related to shares withheld for taxes from cash flow from operations to cash flow from financing. Shares withheld for taxes reflects the choice of colleagues upon vesting to choose gross or net shares to satisfy their withholding requirements. As nearly all colleagues choose to receive net shares, the company then withholds an applicable amount of shares to cover withholding amounts, in effect creating a share repurchase like transaction. We believe the reclassification of shares withheld for taxes, the cash from financing activities provides greater transparency to the cash flow production from operating results, underlines more closely with the accounting treatment of comparable peers. While the reclassification has no actual cash impact on the cash flow statement, as a result of the reclassification, we are increasing our near-term free cash flow goal from $2.3 billion to $2.4 billion for the full year 2017.
Turning to the next slide to discuss our significantly increasing free cash flow generation. We value the firm based on free cash flow and allocate capital to maximize free cash flow returns. Free cash flow of $2.4 billion is not our end goal as further long-term sustainable free cash flow will be driven by continued operating income growth and additional working capital initiatives beyond 2017.
There are 4 primary areas that are expected to contribute to our goal of delivering $2.4 billion or more for the full year 2017: the first is continued operational performance driven by organic revenue growth and margin expansion; the second is working capital improvements, as we focus on closing the gap between receivables and payables; the third is declining uses of cash of pension contributions, CapEx and restructuring, which will free up more than $90 million of annual free cash flow between the end of 2015 and 2017; and fourth, lower cash tax payments reflecting a lower effective tax rate. Lastly, I would note that during 2015, we paid $137 million of cash to settle legacy litigation, which we would expect to provide a tailwind to free cash flow growth in 2016.
Turning to our pension plans. We have taken significant steps to reduce volatility and liability as we've closed plans to new entrants, frozen plans from incurring additional benefits and continued to derisk certain plan assets. Based on 12/31/2015 actuarial assumptions, reported liabilities on a GAAP basis decreased to $1.8 billion at year-end 2015, reflecting a 94% funded basis compared to $2.1 billion at year-end 2014, reflecting a 90% funded basis. Not reflected in those amounts, however, are $1 billion of overfunded pension plans that are included in noncurrent assets in the balance sheet. Considered together, our net unfunded obligations are approximately $800 million. Overall, we expect the contributions to decline by approximately $44 million in 2016 and would expect noncash pension income to be a modest benefit in 2016 versus 2015.
Regarding our restructuring program. Cash payments declined by $54 million to $28 million in 2015. As all charges related to restructuring program have been incurred, we would expect cash payments to decline by $9 million to approximately $19 million in 2016 and continue to decline thereafter to an immaterial amount.
In summary, our results for both the quarter and the full year reflect solid organic growth, record operating margin performance across both Risk and HR Solutions, strong EPS growth, record free cash flow of $1.7 billion and the return of roughly $1.9 billion in capital to shareholders. Despite challenging macroeconomic and our industry-specific headwinds, our industry-leading franchise is strongly positioned to help clients manage through increasing complexity, magnitude and volatility across the areas of risk, retirement and health.
With that, I would like to turn the call back over to the operator for questions."

So you're already up to $2.2 billion of free cash flow. And then, you really need an incremental $400 million from revenue growth and margin expansion and improved working capital.

We made substantial investments in areas like retirement delegating across the board and in our health solutions. And again, we look at health solutions across the board, really every category in terms of the ability to help clients with this very important challenge they've got around the health side. And we think we've got one of the strongest capabilities here, whether it's H&P, whether it's global benefits across the board, and on the exchanges, retiree, active, fully, self, all across the board. 
And what we would say, if you think about sort of quarter-over-quarter, first, we would agree the adoption on the health active side across the board especially the larger in [ph] hasn't been as fast as expected, by the way, especially given some of the results we've seen with existing clients because it's been exceptional, reduced volatility for them, price reductions year-over-year, 25%, in fact, of price reductions over the last year. So we're very, very positive in terms of the overall impact. The pipeline looks very, very strong. And again, even in the exchange business, as it exists, we had double-digit growth and it's profitable.

And for us, especially for our Reinsurance business maybe more than any other, it's a great example of a business right now as business results don't really reflect the underlying capability and opportunity we see, which is exceptional.
I mean, think about it, we're the largest advisory in the world in this area and really number one in treaty, number one in fac, number one on the alternative capital side, capital markets. 20% of the global book is linked to U.S. property cat, and that's fully commission-based. Those rates have come down 15% to 25% over the last 24 months, that's been reflected. Although those are starting to flatten out a bit, the decrease is not as great.
But against that, it's really been the team's ability to continue to win 19 consecutive quarters of wins on treaty reinsurance, which has been exceptional, and really the ability to create net new demand. And this is really in areas like mortgage overall and what we've done in review. So they've been able to offset these headwinds, which are diminishing. Those businesses that they've offset with is going to continue to grow, and the opportunity going into 2016 we feel very good.
I would say, by the way, just technically, the 2% in this quarter is on top of a 5% in the Q4 2014. So it was kind of on top of a very strong comparable. So we feel good about the position and we love this business. We're very excited about it.
So maybe we go back to Christa on the HR Solutions side and sort of the seasonality overall."

As you think about the overall HR Solutions business, we really have a very significant bias towards Q4 with annual enrollment in our benefits administration business primarily occurring in Q4 and health care exchanges primarily occurring in Q4, where you have expenses showing up in Q1, 2, 3 and 4 and revenue really coming through in Q4.

So we're very, very much focused on investment back into the business. And M&A plays a big role on that and will continue to play a big role on that.
We probably -- looking at Christa, we probably looked at more deals this year, situations this year than maybe any time in our history and measured in the billions. We've done fewer of them because we're always going to be disciplined around return on invested capital. Christa has in place a very, very structured way to think about how we can very meticulously invest our capital to get the highest return on capital, generate free cash flow and build wealth for our shareholders. And in the context of that, serve clients in a very, very effective way. And that's really the machine we set up, that's how the engine runs and that's what we've done.

We do believe that there -- this amount going forward is somewhere between $0 and $100 million. Therefore, we've increased our target by $100 million to $2.4 billion.
One of the other things I would make clear is that the $2.4 billion in free cash flow in 2017 is fully deployable cash because if you'd look at the $1.7 billion we generated in 2015, we actually returned $1.9 billion of cash to shareholders in 2015.

But is there something else in that that's truly incremental to free cash flow?"

And I think it has been a journey for us, which we've been on really for the last -- almost 5 years. And I think as we continue to improve the collection of cash from customers and we continue to manage the payment of cash to suppliers, we believe that we have improvements in cash for at least the next 5 to 8 years in terms of working capital and its structural improvements in the process around which we do this in the way in which we manage this in the overall portfolio of business we do. So I guess, what I would say, as you think about Aon, we believe we should be working capital neutral overall and we are fast in that today. So we believe the upside in terms of cash from working capital is substantial over the coming years."

And for us, we believe it's going to be fundamental to what we do to try to get accomplished over time, Charles, and really is going to be differentiating in terms of our capability versus the marketplace. And there are many examples. By the way, the Risk Insight Platform efforts really are -- actually the work is done directly with the primary insurers serving clients. So it actually touches very much the primary insurance marketplace.
But let me give you one example that -- I have happened to be just in London yesterday with Lloyd's and Lloyd's syndicates. We just launched something called Aon Client Treaty, which is a very -- it's basically built on a foundation around data and analytics. So in essence, it will be, when done, the single biggest underwriting transaction likely in the history of Lloyd's today. And it really takes our book that goes into the London market to our global broking center, and we actually model that book in detail, really bottom up, all different aspects of what's going on, 64,000 policy transactions, 120 different classes of business, 157 countries. You get the idea. We built an incredible data room in which underwriters could come in and actually take a company-level understanding and underwriting and then apply it to a portfolio level. And in essence, what we're saying to our client -- by the way, on Monday, we're having our property symposium, I'm talking to clients at our property symposium essentially saying, if you're going to use London capacity, you've eliminated your tail risk. So when you actually think about the set of syndicates that are actually going to come to bear on behalf of you, the last 3 or 4 or 5 actually create risk. We've eliminated that. So we've actually pre-confirmed 20% of that capacity that will follow a lead capacity going into London. That makes that capital we're bringing to bear much, much more competitive. So there's an example of hard clear data and analytics. And essentially, we've analyzed our book sort of -- and it happens to be in the London marketplace. But imagine, we can look at this all over the world in which we're actually providing distinctive value, unduplicated value to clients using data and analytics. So that was a bit long-winded, but I hope you get the idea. That's a very powerful tool. By the way, in order to do that, you have to be able to analyze all 6,000 clients going into London in a way that, frankly, leverages off our Risk Insight Platform. Never been done before."

          Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our fourth quarter and full year 2015 conference call. Joining me today is our CFO, Christa Davies. I would note that there are slides available on our website for you to follow along with our commentary today.
And consistent with previous quarters, I'd like to cover 2 areas before turning the call over to Christa for further financial review: first is our performance against key metrics we communicate to shareholders; second is the overall organic growth performance including continued areas of strategic investment across Aon.
On the first topic, our performance versus key metrics. Each quarter, we measure our performance against the key metrics we focus on achieving over the course of the year: grow organically, expand margins, increase earnings per share and deliver free cash flow growth.
Turning to Slide 3. In the fourth quarter, organic revenue growth was 5% with solid growth across all major businesses, highlighted by 6% growth in each of our Retail Brokerage businesses. Operating margin increased 110 basis points, reflecting strong operating performance in both segments. And EPS increased 20% to $2.27, reflecting strong operating performance and effective capital management.
If we turn to the full year, organic revenue growth was 3% overall, reflecting solid growth across both risk and HR Solutions despite pricing pressure and overall economic uncertainty. Operating margin increased 50 basis points, reflecting strong operating performance and record margin results in both segments. EPS increased 8% to $6.18, overcoming substantial foreign currency headwinds. And finally, free cash flow increased 10% to a record $1.7 billion.
Overall, our results reflect both the strong performance in the quarter and for the full year. In a year of substantial volatility driven by macroeconomic factors and industry headwinds, we continued to invest heavily in client-serving capabilities across our industry-leading platform. These investments, combined with the leadership of our colleagues around the globe, contributed to strong organic growth in both segments to close the year, record operating margin in both segments, record free cash flow and return of $1.9 billion of capital to shareholders.
Turning to Slide 4, on the second topic of growth and investment. I want to spend the next few minutes discussing the quarter for both of our segments. In Risk Solutions, organic revenue growth was 5% compared to 3% in the prior year quarter, driven by growth across all businesses and reflecting a level of quarterly organic growth not seen since the second quarter of 2007.
As we discussed previously, we're driving a set of initiatives and making strategic investments that are strengthening underlying performance and positioning our Risk Solutions segment for long-term growth and improved operating leverage, with the management of our renewal book through Aon Client Promise and retention rates of more than 90% on average across Retail Brokerage; new business generation of more than $330 million across our retail business with record new business in U.S. Retail; and 19 consecutive quarters of positive net new business in core treaty reinsurance; increased operating leverage from our investments in innovative technology and data and analytics, including the Global Risk Insight Platform, which now captures over 3 million trades and $160 billion of bound premium with approximately 40 carriers utilizing the platform today; ReView, our Reinsurer dashboard, combined with strategic consulting to help reinsurers be more effective markets for seeding company clients; and our Aon Broking initiative to better match client need with insurer appetite for risk and to identify structured portfolio of solutions.
A great example of our innovation and data analytics recently was the launch of Aon Client Treaty, the largest ever underwritten portfolio of risk in the history of Lloyd's, an undertaking of data and analytics looking at 64,000 policy transactions, 120 different classes of business in over 157 countries and territory. We've received terrific feedback from clients, found coverage in every major geography and have generated incremental new business since the launch on January 1. And finally, we're expanding our content and global footprint through tuck-in acquisitions that increase scale in emerging markets or expand capability.
Reflecting on the individual businesses within Risk Solutions. In the Americas, organic revenue growth was 6% against the strong comparables in the prior year quarter, driven by a diversified portfolio reflecting industry expertise, product and service capability. Exposures continue to be positive across the region, while the impact for pricing was modestly negative, resulting in stable market impact overall.
We saw growth across all regions: U.S. Retail, Canada and Latin America, including growth across all businesses property/casualty, health and benefits and Affinity, where 16 of 18 underlying product lines were delivering growth. In U.S. Retail, growth was driven by solid retention rates and record new business generation in areas such as P&C, D&O and cyber, while strong management of the renewal book portfolio drove growth in Latin America.
In international, organic revenue growth was 6% compared to flat in the prior year quarter. Exposures continue to be stable and the impact from pricing was modestly negative on average, driven by fragile market conditions in many countries across Europe and the continued pressure in the Pacific region. In Continental Europe, we saw solid growth, driven by management of the renewal book portfolio reflecting strong leadership across the region. This positions us well to benefit from potential improvements in the macroeconomic environment.
We saw continued strength in New Zealand, while Australia showed modest growth. Results also reflect solid growth across Asia, where many markets grew double digits including Taiwan, Thailand and Singapore. In Reinsurance, organic revenue growth was 2%, a strong performance against a tough comparison in the prior year quarter. Results in the quarter primarily reflect positive growth in treaty globally driven by an increase in seat [ph] demand as well as growth in new products such as U.S. mortgage and ReView.
Across our portfolio, we saw a record level of new business generation in the quarter. While excess capital continues to place pressure in the market, the rate of price decline continues to moderate. Against that price measure, clients are buying more and capital is being deployed to new markets. New opportunities for growth, combined with industry-leading data and analytics, is positioning our Reinsurance business for return to modest growth in 2016.
Overall, across Risk Solutions, we delivered our strongest quarterly rate of organic growth for the year, driven by record new business generation, strong retention rates and returns on our investments in industry-leading data and analytics. Despite fragile macroeconomic conditions and soft pricing in certain areas, we fully anticipate a continuation of low to mid-single-digit organic growth in 2016.
Turning to HR Solutions. Organic revenue growth was 4%, with solid growth across both major businesses and in high demand areas, where we've invested in innovative solutions and client-serving capability. These investments reflect Aon Hewitt's client leadership and in-depth understanding and influence of market trends, including as clients manage risk against pension schemes that are frozen, largely underfunded and facing regulatory changes.
Solutions to derisk pension plans and support for delegated investment solutions, a strong area of growth for assets under management have grown for $10 billion to roughly $75 billion in 5 years. Continued investment to strengthen our industry-leading portfolio of health solutions, covering the full range of benefit strategies, client size and funding choices.
Across Aon's suite of private health exchanges, we enrolled roughly 1.4 million lives across 150 clients in 2015 compared to roughly 1.2 million enrolled lives and across 100 clients in 2014, reflecting solid double-digit growth. Participant satisfaction was strong, as 92% of individuals on the retiree exchange were satisfied with their adviser, while 88% on the active exchange liked being able to choose from multiple carriers.
Our solutions for clients continue to bend the cost curve by 150 to 200 basis points on average over a multi-year period with more than 1/4 of returning clients seeing a year-over-year decrease. We feel good about the pipeline and our ability to drive greater scale and growth in 2016.
We're also investing in software as a service model at our HR BPO business, where growth in new clients and conversations with existing clients is driving strong demand as well as the expansion of our capabilities to include financial limitations. And finally, we're investing in our talent rewards business, as we are seeing strong demand for data and analytics to support increasing organizational change.
Turning to the individual businesses within HR Solutions. In Consulting Services, organic revenue growth was 4%, overcoming a tough comparable in the prior year that included project work relating to the [indiscernible] bill. Results in the quarter reflect continued growth in retirement consulting, primarily driven by demand for delegated investment consulting solutions. We also saw continued growth in compensation consulting, driven by record growth in participation for survey work as companies require benchmarking and assistance with plan design to address retention and ways to compete more effectively with incentive strategies.
In outsourcing, organic revenue growth was 4% as well, driven by growth across all major businesses. We saw growth in benefits administration, driven primarily by an increase in project-related work. Results reflect growth in HR BPO, driven by new client wins in cloud-based solutions. We saw solid growth in health care exchanges, driven by an increase in the number of enrollments across the platform.
Overall, across HR Solutions, client needs are growing in both size and complexity across retirement and health. Our results reflect a solid finish to the year with growth across all major businesses, including strong growth in areas we've been investing to continue to deliver sustainable long-term growth.
In summary, despite short-term headwinds from both a macroeconomic and industry pricing standpoint, our results for both the quarter and the year finished on a high note. We delivered solid organic growth across both segments and strengthened our operational performance driven by our industry-leading platform of client-serving capabilities and investments in data and analytics. 
With that said, I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Christa for further financial review. Christa?"
119853,321700568,928120,"Aon plc, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 05, 2016",2016-02-05,"Earnings Calls","Aon plc","Executives",":            Thanks so much, Greg, and good morning, everyone.

          Thanks so much, Greg, and good morning, everyone. As Greg noted, our industry-leading franchise closed the year with a strong performance despite both macroeconomic and industry-specific headwinds. Our results in the quarter reflect solid organic growth and record operating margin performance in Risk and HR Solutions, record free cash generation and effective capital management, highlighted by the repurchase of approximately 400 million of ordinary shares in the quarter. We returned roughly $1.9 billion of capital to shareholders in 2015.
Now let me turn to the financial results for the quarter on Page 6 of the presentation. Our core EPS performance, excluding certain items, increased 20% to $2.27 per share for the fourth quarter compared to $1.89 in the prior year quarter. Certain items that were adjusted for in core EPS performance and highlighted in the schedules on Page 12 of the press release include noncash intangible asset amortization.
Further, included in the results was a $0.10 per share unfavorable impact related to foreign currency translation due to the U.S. dollar strengthening against most major currencies. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, EPS grew 25% for the fourth quarter and 15% for the full year, in line with our compounded annual growth rate of 15% for the last 10 years, another year of outstanding performance reflecting the strength of our industry-leading franchise and focus on shareholder value creation.
Going forward, if currency to remain stable at today's rates, we would expect substantially less of a headwind with an estimated unfavorable impact of roughly $0.10 for 2016 compared to $0.41 of impact for 2015. We would expect the majority of this impact to be weighted towards the first half of 2016, more so in the first quarter.
Now let me talk about each of the segments on the next slide. In our Risk Solutions segment, organic revenue growth was 5%, operating margin increased 100 basis points to 25.7% and operating income increased 2% compared to the prior year quarter. Operating income included a $27 million unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation. Excluding this impact, underlying operating income increased 7% versus the prior year quarter. Operating margin improvement of 100 basis points includes a 30 basis point unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation. Excluding the impact from foreign currency, underlying operating margin improved 70 basis points in the quarter. Our fourth quarter performance reflects solid organic growth performance and improved returns on our investments in data and analytics across our portfolio.
For 2015, Risk Solutions operating income decreased 2%, which includes a $128 million unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation. Excluding this impact, underlying operating income increased 5% versus the prior year. Operating margin increased 70 basis points to 23.6%, including a 20 basis points favorable impact from foreign currency translation. Excluding the impact from foreign currency, underlying operating margin increased 50 basis points in the year.
We delivered strong operational improvement in 2015 with record operating margins despite significant headwinds from an unfavorable market impact in Reinsurance and fragile macroeconomic conditions. This level of performance reflects strong new business generation and increased operating leverage in the business as well as expense discipline as we optimize our global cost structure. We expect continued improvement in 2016 and are firmly on track with our long-term target of 26%. In addition, if short-term interest rates continue to rise, we believe we have significant leverage to improving interest rate environment as every 100 basis point rise in global interest rates should result in approximately $45 million of investment income.
Turning to the HR Solutions segment. Organic revenue growth was 4%, operating margin increased 270 basis points to 26.2% and operating income increased 14% compared to the prior year quarter. Operating income included a $6 million unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation. In addition, there are approximately $12 million or minus 90 basis points of transaction-related and portfolio repositioning costs incurred in the quarter, as we continue to drive improved return on capital. The gain related to the sale of our asset management business was recorded in other income.
Results were driven by organic growth, expense discipline and improved returns on investment including health care exchanges, which delivered modest profitability in 2015. For the full year, operating income increased 7% including a $20 million unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation. Excluding this impact, underlying operating income increased 10% compared to the prior year and operating margins increased 100 basis points to a record 18.1%. This level of performance demonstrates strong improvement over the prior year, reflecting solid financial results in our core business as well as improved profitability in the areas we've been investing for long-term growth, including delegated investment consulting, cloud-based solutions in HR BPO and health care exchanges.
Looking forward, we expect continued operational improvement in 2016 towards our long-term target of 22% with quarterly patterning of operating income results in HR Solutions similar to 2015. More specifically, down in the first half, more so in Q1, and up in the second half, most notably Q4.
Now let me discuss a few of the line items outside of the operating segments on Slide 9. Unallocated expenses increased $17 million to $61 million due to the timing of certain employee incentive and employee benefit-related expenses as well as certain investments in shared services. Interest income was $4 million compared to $3 million from the prior year quarter. Interest expense was $68 million in line with quarterly guidance. Other income of $49 million primarily includes a gain on the sale of our Absence Management Business in Outsourcing in HR Solutions. The sale continues to reflect our efforts to drive improved return on capital. Going forward, we expect a run rate of approximately $45 million per quarter of unallocated expense, $3 million per quarter of interest income and $68 million of interest expense.
Turning to taxes. The adjusted effective tax rate on net income from continuing operations, excluding the applicable tax impact associated with the expenses related to legacy litigation in Q2, decreased to 17.9% compared to the prior year quarter at 19.6%, due to the favorable impact of certain discrete tax adjustments. Our estimate of the underlying operating tax rate remains at 19%.
Lastly, average diluted shares outstanding decreased 5% to 279.3 million in the fourth quarter compared to 293.4 million in the prior year quarter, as we effectively allocate capital and manage dilution. The company repurchased 4.3 million Class A ordinary shares for approximately $400 million in the fourth quarter. The company has $4.1 billion of remaining authorization under its share repurchase program. Actual shares outstanding on December 31 were 269.8 million, and there are approximately 6 million additional dilutive equivalents. Estimated Q1 '16 beginning dilutive share count is approximately 276 million, subject to share price movement, share issuance and share repurchase.
Now let me turn to the next slide to highlight our solid balance sheet and strong cash flow growth on Slide 10. At December 31, 2015, cash and short-term investments were $740 million. Total debt outstanding was approximately $5.7 billion and total debt-to-EBITDA on a GAAP basis was 2.3x. Cash flow from operations for the year increased 11% or $197 million to a record $2 billion, driven by a decline in pension contributions, restructuring-related payments, cash paid for taxes and working capital improvements, partially offset by $137 million in cash paid to settle legacy litigation and strong organic growth performance in the fourth quarter. Free cash flow, as defined by cash flow from operations less CapEx, increased 10% or $163 million to a record $1.7 billion, reflecting strong growth in cash flow from operations, partially offset by a $34 million increase in CapEx. The increase in CapEx in 2015 was primarily related to completed investments in certain projects to optimize our global real estate portfolio.
As we noted in our press release and related presentation today, during the quarter for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we reclassified certain cash flows related to shares withheld for taxes from cash flow from operations to cash flow from financing. Shares withheld for taxes reflects the choice of colleagues upon vesting to choose gross or net shares to satisfy their withholding requirements. As nearly all colleagues choose to receive net shares, the company then withholds an applicable amount of shares to cover withholding amounts, in effect creating a share repurchase like transaction. We believe the reclassification of shares withheld for taxes, the cash from financing activities provides greater transparency to the cash flow production from operating results, underlines more closely with the accounting treatment of comparable peers. While the reclassification has no actual cash impact on the cash flow statement, as a result of the reclassification, we are increasing our near-term free cash flow goal from $2.3 billion to $2.4 billion for the full year 2017.
Turning to the next slide to discuss our significantly increasing free cash flow generation. We value the firm based on free cash flow and allocate capital to maximize free cash flow returns. Free cash flow of $2.4 billion is not our end goal as further long-term sustainable free cash flow will be driven by continued operating income growth and additional working capital initiatives beyond 2017.
There are 4 primary areas that are expected to contribute to our goal of delivering $2.4 billion or more for the full year 2017: the first is continued operational performance driven by organic revenue growth and margin expansion; the second is working capital improvements, as we focus on closing the gap between receivables and payables; the third is declining uses of cash of pension contributions, CapEx and restructuring, which will free up more than $90 million of annual free cash flow between the end of 2015 and 2017; and fourth, lower cash tax payments reflecting a lower effective tax rate. Lastly, I would note that during 2015, we paid $137 million of cash to settle legacy litigation, which we would expect to provide a tailwind to free cash flow growth in 2016.
Turning to our pension plans. We have taken significant steps to reduce volatility and liability as we've closed plans to new entrants, frozen plans from incurring additional benefits and continued to derisk certain plan assets. Based on 12/31/2015 actuarial assumptions, reported liabilities on a GAAP basis decreased to $1.8 billion at year-end 2015, reflecting a 94% funded basis compared to $2.1 billion at year-end 2014, reflecting a 90% funded basis. Not reflected in those amounts, however, are $1 billion of overfunded pension plans that are included in noncurrent assets in the balance sheet. Considered together, our net unfunded obligations are approximately $800 million. Overall, we expect the contributions to decline by approximately $44 million in 2016 and would expect noncash pension income to be a modest benefit in 2016 versus 2015.
Regarding our restructuring program. Cash payments declined by $54 million to $28 million in 2015. As all charges related to restructuring program have been incurred, we would expect cash payments to decline by $9 million to approximately $19 million in 2016 and continue to decline thereafter to an immaterial amount.
In summary, our results for both the quarter and the full year reflect solid organic growth, record operating margin performance across both Risk and HR Solutions, strong EPS growth, record free cash flow of $1.7 billion and the return of roughly $1.9 billion in capital to shareholders. Despite challenging macroeconomic and our industry-specific headwinds, our industry-leading franchise is strongly positioned to help clients manage through increasing complexity, magnitude and volatility across the areas of risk, retirement and health.
With that, I would like to turn the call back over to the operator for questions."

We would say that we do not need changes in the macro environment to achieve our $2.4 billion in free cash flow in 2017. If you think about the $1.7 billion of free cash flow we delivered in 2015, you can add back the $137 million of cash we spent on litigation in 2015, and then you can add about $100 million of improvement in free cash flow from decreased uses of cash between now and 2017. So you're already up to $2.2 billion of free cash flow. And then, you really need an incremental $400 million from revenue growth and margin expansion and improved working capital. And so we really believe that we have exceptionally strong free cash flow over the coming years and exceptionally strong free cash flow per share as we expect declining share count between now and 2017, too."

So for us, it's really nothing new, but a continuation of the yield on a lot of the investments we're making in the business and the progress we're making across the business overall. And listen, we saw the new business characteristics in U.S. Retail, for example, these are records, record on record in fact, in terms of sort of what's happened over the course of the last year. So for us, this is just a continuation in terms of sort of where we are.
We really -- across the business, we really like our position now, the way we finished in '15 and our position in '16 and the trajectory going into '16 overall. So for us, what you would read into this is this is just another quarter kind of a proof point of underlying capability and expect continued growth at the same levels going forward and the ability, frankly, to deal with any headwinds that are out there as we've been able to do and move the business forward."

          Well, first, take a step back, overall, HR Solutions. We -- again, we loved where we finished on the risk side. We really like where we finished on HR Solutions. And this is a business, over the course of the year, that produced 10% operating income growth, grew at 4%. We made substantial -- by the way, also achieved record margins. We made substantial investments in areas like retirement delegating across the board and in our health solutions. And again, we look at health solutions across the board, really every category in terms of the ability to help clients with this very important challenge they've got around the health side. And we think we've got one of the strongest capabilities here, whether it's H&P, whether it's global benefits across the board, and on the exchanges, retiree, active, fully, self, all across the board. 
And what we would say, if you think about sort of quarter-over-quarter, first, we would agree the adoption on the health active side across the board especially the larger end hasn't been as fast as expected, by the way, especially given some of the results we've seen with existing clients because it's been exceptional, reduced volatility for them, price reductions year-over-year, 25%, in fact, of price reductions over the last year. So we're very, very positive in terms of the overall impact. The pipeline looks very, very strong. And again, even in the exchange business, as it exists, we had double-digit growth and it's profitable. So for us, we'd love this solution of the active [ph] clients, but it's part of a broader health solution.
I would reflect, by the way, in the fourth quarter of last year, we had the single largest implementation on the retiree side sort of in the history of the world and maybe will forever be in the history of the world, and that actually inflates the results a bit, too, but we really like the business overall tremendously and we're really feeling good about our position in HR Solutions."

And then, possibly what that could mean for next year or for 4Q '16?
And then, on the HR Solutions side, your profitability in the fourth quarter basically doubles from the rest of the quarter. So can you just help us to also understand why there's so much more profitability in 4Q other than just the health care exchanges and if there's anything else that we can kind of look at that?"

And that's really for our treaty business that I'm talking about, which is about 80% to 85% of our total revenue. So 12 months revenue recognition. So what you're seeing in our Q4 results is the last 4 quarters of revenues. And so it's sort of a lagging indicator because you're getting price over that last 12 months showing up in our current year's results.
For facultative and capital markets, they are recognized in the quarter, so that's sort of 15% to 20% of our revenues."

          And so if you step back on the Reinsurance side, basically, in terms of where we finished and thinking about going into '16, again, this is consistent with the theme across the company. We feel very good about how we finished the year and what it sets the stage for in 2016.
Obviously, again, look at it in terms of the overall year, we're not happy with the level of growth at Reinsurance at negative 1% for the year, but we have said already we expect Reinsurance to return to positive organic growth in 2016. And for us, especially for our Reinsurance business maybe more than any other, it's a great example of a business right now as business results don't really reflect the underlying capability and opportunity we see, which is exceptional.
I mean, think about it, we're the largest advisory in the world in this area and really number one in treaty, number one in fac, number one on the alternative capital side, capital markets. 20% of the global book is linked to U.S. property cat, and that's fully commission-based. Those rates have come down 15% to 25% over the last 24 months, that's been reflected. Although those are starting to flatten out a bit, the decrease is not as great.
But against that, it's really been the team's ability to continue to win 19 consecutive quarters of wins on treaty reinsurance, which has been exceptional, and really the ability to create net new demand. And this is really in areas like mortgage overall and what we've done in review. So they've been able to offset these headwinds, which are diminishing. Those businesses that they've offset with is going to continue to grow, and the opportunity going into 2016 we feel very good.
I would say, by the way, just technically, the 2% in this quarter is on top of a 5% in the Q4 2014. So it was kind of on top of a very strong comparable. So we feel good about the position and we love this business. We're very excited about it.
So maybe we go back to Christa on the HR Solutions side and sort of the seasonality overall."

As you think about the overall HR Solutions business, we really have a very significant bias towards Q4 with annual enrollment in our benefits administration business primarily occurring in Q4 and health care exchanges primarily occurring in Q4, where you have expenses showing up in Q1, 2, 3 and 4 and revenue really coming through in Q4.

The fundamental capability that we've got and that these clients have around HR transformation and improvement is just exceptional. The capability we've got on the Workday front in particular is really carving out a lot of space there for us. And we're seeing the growth not only in the HR side, but we're also seeing it as clients think about beyond HR transformation and how it relates to finance transformation. And this combination has just been incredibly positive.
By the way, Aon itself has gone through the same thing. We adopted Workday on the HR side. We've now adopted Workday and implemented it on the finance side. And we see the potential and our clients see it as well.
So for us, this has been a very, very strong growth business. We really like the capabilities here and the prospects that we have for our clients."

When you add all that together, price and exposures, they're net-net stable. So the market roughly is stable. So a little up, a little down, but roughly, it's been stable. I'm literally looking at the chart right now across multiple quarters and it's, give or take, stable. Prices have come down a little bit. Exposures have come up. And we -- it's just how the market overall has performed.
From our standpoint, that's why we don't really look at market conditions as an excuse not to grow or reinforce where to grow. We're going to grow either way, have proven we could do that. '15 is another example of that. We see it in '16. And we more than offset price changes and exposure changes with net new business and net new capabilities we brought to the marketplace as well as our ability to retain our existing book of business and actually add services onto that. So for us, overall, it's been -- the market is stable, and our ability to deal with this has been quite positive."

          Yes, Kai. We actually look at both.

And underlying that, if you look back over the last 10 years, our operating income growth year-over-year has been roughly 11%. So it's something we really invested in and invested heavily in organic improvement as well, as I've described before.
The level of capabilities that we're investing in for existing clients, new clients on the data analytics side is, we believe, candidly, quite unprecedented. If you think about data analytics, went through the Risk Insight Platform, the review, to the end client treaty now at the endpoint, all the work we've done in delegated exchanges, you get the picture. So we're very, very much focused on investment back into the business. And M&A plays a big role on that and will continue to play a big role on that.
We probably -- looking at Christa, we probably looked at more deals this year, situations this year than maybe any time in our history and measured in the billions. We've done fewer of them because we're always going to be disciplined around return on invested capital. Christa has in place a very, very structured way to think about how we can very meticulously invest our capital to get the highest return on capital, generate free cash flow and build wealth for our shareholders. And in the context of that, serve clients in a very, very effective way. And that's really the machine we set up, that's how the engine runs and that's what we've done.
So we're going to continue to look at what the best place is to place our capital. And we'll be open to acquisitions as we are, organic investment, buyback, all -- and all the above. That's really how we're looking at it."

As we think about our free cash flow going forward, there is no change to our view on the underlying free cash flow growth of the firm. We do believe that there -- this amount going forward is somewhere between $0 and $100 million. Therefore, we've increased our target by $100 million to $2.4 billion.
One of the other things I would make clear is that the $2.4 billion in free cash flow in 2017 is fully deployable cash because if you'd look at the $1.7 billion we generated in 2015, we actually returned $1.9 billion of cash to shareholders in 2015. So we are generating a huge amount of cash, which we can fully deploy on either return to shareholders, as Greg said, invest it back in to our business either organically or inorganically in the form of M&A.

And I think it has been a journey for us, which we've been on really for the last -- almost 5 years. And I think as we continue to improve the collection of cash from customers and we continue to manage the payment of cash to suppliers, we believe that we have improvements in cash for at least the next 5 to 8 years in terms of working capital and its structural improvements in the process around which we do this in the way in which we manage this in the overall portfolio of business we do.

          Well, so the effort on data and analytics has really been multiyear and ongoing. And for us, we believe it's going to be fundamental to what we need to try to get accomplished over time, Charles, and really is going to be differentiating in terms of our capability versus the marketplace. And there are many examples. By the way, the Risk Insight Platform efforts really are -- actually the work is done directly with the primary insurers serving clients. So it actually touches very much the primary insurance marketplace.
But let me give you one example that -- I have happened to be just in London yesterday with Lloyd's and Lloyd's syndicates. We just launched something called Aon Client Treaty, which is a very -- it's basically built on a foundation around data and analytics. So in essence, it will be, when done, the single biggest underwriting transaction likely in the history of Lloyd's to date. And it really takes our book that goes into the London market to our global broking center, and we actually model that book in detail, really bottom up, all different aspects of what's going on, 64,000 policy transactions, 120 different classes of business, 157 countries. You get the idea. We built an incredible data room in which underwriters could come in and actually take a company-level understanding and underwriting and then apply it at a portfolio level. And in essence, what we're saying to our client -- by the way, on Monday, we're having our property symposium, I'm talking to clients at our property symposium essentially saying, if you're going to use London capacity, you've eliminated your tail risk. So when you actually think about the set of syndicates that are actually going to come to bear on behalf of you, the last 3 or 4 or 5 actually create risk. We've eliminated that. So we've actually pre-confirmed 20% of that capacity that will follow a lead capacity going into London. That makes that capital we're bringing to bear much, much more competitive. So there's an example of hard clear data and analytics. And essentially, we've analyzed our book sort of -- and it happens to be in the London marketplace. But imagine, we can look at this all over the world in which we're actually providing distinctive value, unduplicated value to clients using data and analytics. So that was a bit long-winded, but I hope you get the idea. That's a very powerful tool. By the way, in order to do that, you had to be able to analyze all 6,000 clients going into London in a way that, frankly, leverages off our Risk Insight Platform. Never been done before."

Welcome to our fourth quarter and full year 2015 conference call. Joining me today is our CFO, Christa Davies.

Welcome to our fourth quarter and full year 2015 conference call. Joining me today is our CFO, Christa Davies. I would note that there are slides available on our website for you to follow along with our commentary today.
And consistent with previous quarters, I'd like to cover 2 areas before turning the call over to Christa for further financial review: first is our performance against key metrics we communicate to shareholders; second is the overall organic growth performance including continued areas of strategic investment across Aon.
On the first topic, our performance versus key metrics. Each quarter, we measure our performance against the key metrics we focus on achieving over the course of the year: grow organically, expand margins, increase earnings per share and deliver free cash flow growth.
Turning to Slide 3. In the fourth quarter, organic revenue growth was 5% with solid growth across all major businesses, highlighted by 6% growth in each of our Retail Brokerage businesses. Operating margin increased 110 basis points, reflecting strong operating performance in both segments. And EPS increased 20% to $2.27, reflecting strong operating performance and effective capital management.
If we turn to the full year, organic revenue growth was 3% overall, reflecting solid growth across both risk and HR Solutions despite pricing pressure and overall economic uncertainty. Operating margin increased 50 basis points, reflecting strong operating performance and record margin results in both segments. EPS increased 8% to $6.18, overcoming substantial foreign currency headwinds. And finally, free cash flow increased 10% to a record $1.7 billion.
Overall, our results reflect both the strong performance in the quarter and for the full year. In a year of substantial volatility driven by macroeconomic factors and industry headwinds, we continued to invest heavily in client-serving capabilities across our industry-leading platform. These investments, combined with the leadership of our colleagues around the globe, contributed to strong organic growth in both segments to close the year, record operating margin in both segments, record free cash flow and return of $1.9 billion of capital to shareholders.
Turning to Slide 4, on the second topic of growth and investment. I want to spend the next few minutes discussing the quarter for both of our segments. In Risk Solutions, organic revenue growth was 5% compared to 3% in the prior year quarter, driven by growth across all businesses and reflecting a level of quarterly organic growth not seen since the second quarter of 2007.
As we discussed previously, we're driving a set of initiatives and making strategic investments that are strengthening underlying performance and positioning our Risk Solutions segment for long-term growth and improved operating leverage, with the management of our renewal book through Aon Client Promise and retention rates of more than 90% on average across Retail Brokerage; new business generation of more than $330 million across our retail business with record new business in U.S. Retail; and 19 consecutive quarters of positive net new business in core treaty reinsurance; increased operating leverage from our investments in innovative technology and data and analytics, including the Global Risk Insight Platform, which now captures over 3 million trades and $160 billion of bound premium with approximately 40 carriers utilizing the platform today; ReView, our Reinsurer dashboard, combined with strategic consulting to help reinsurers be more effective markets for seeding company clients; and our Aon Broking initiative to better match client need with insurer appetite for risk and to identify structured portfolio of solutions.
A great example of our innovation and data analytics recently was the launch of Aon Client Treaty, the largest ever underwritten portfolio of risk in the history of Lloyd's, an undertaking of data and analytics looking at 64,000 policy transactions, 120 different classes of business in over 157 countries and territory. We've received terrific feedback from clients, found coverage in every major geography and have generated incremental new business since the launch on January 1. And finally, we're expanding our content and global footprint through tuck-in acquisitions that increase scale in emerging markets or expand capability.
Reflecting on the individual businesses within Risk Solutions. In the Americas, organic revenue growth was 6% against the strong comparables in the prior year quarter, driven by a diversified portfolio reflecting industry expertise, product and service capability. Exposures continue to be positive across the region, while the impact for pricing was modestly negative, resulting in stable market impact overall.
We saw growth across all regions: U.S. Retail, Canada and Latin America, including growth across all businesses property/casualty, health and benefits and Affinity, where 16 of 18 underlying product lines were delivering growth. In U.S. Retail, growth was driven by solid retention rates and record new business generation in areas such as P&C, D&O and cyber, while strong management of the renewal book portfolio drove growth in Latin America.
In international, organic revenue growth was 6% compared to flat in the prior year quarter. Exposures continue to be stable and the impact from pricing was modestly negative on average, driven by fragile market conditions in many countries across Europe and the continued pressure in the Pacific region. In Continental Europe, we saw solid growth, driven by management of the renewal book portfolio reflecting strong leadership across the region. This positions us well to benefit from potential improvements in the macroeconomic environment.
We saw continued strength in New Zealand, while Australia showed modest growth. Results also reflect solid growth across Asia, where many markets grew double digits including Taiwan, Thailand and Singapore. In Reinsurance, organic revenue growth was 2%, a strong performance against a tough comparison in the prior year quarter. Results in the quarter primarily reflect positive growth in treaty globally driven by an increase in seat [ph] demand as well as growth in new products such as U.S. mortgage and ReView.
Across our portfolio, we saw a record level of new business generation in the quarter. While excess capital continues to place pressure in the market, the rate of price decline continues to moderate. Against that price measure, clients are buying more and capital is being deployed to new markets. New opportunities for growth, combined with industry-leading data and analytics, is positioning our Reinsurance business for return to modest growth in 2016.
Overall, across Risk Solutions, we delivered our strongest quarterly rate of organic growth for the year, driven by record new business generation, strong retention rates and returns on our investments in industry-leading data and analytics. Despite fragile macroeconomic conditions and soft pricing in certain areas, we fully anticipate a continuation of low to mid-single-digit organic growth in 2016.
Turning to HR Solutions. Organic revenue growth was 4%, with solid growth across both major businesses and in high demand areas, where we've invested in innovative solutions and client-serving capability. These investments reflect Aon Hewitt's client leadership and in-depth understanding and influence of market trends, including as clients manage risk against pension schemes that are frozen, largely underfunded and facing regulatory changes.
Solutions to derisk pension plans and support for delegated investment solutions, a strong area of growth for assets under management have grown for $10 billion to roughly $75 billion in 5 years. Continued investment to strengthen our industry-leading portfolio of health solutions, covering the full range of benefit strategies, client size and funding choices.
Across Aon's suite of private health exchanges, we enrolled roughly 1.4 million lives across 150 clients in 2015 compared to roughly 1.2 million enrolled lives and across 100 clients in 2014, reflecting solid double-digit growth. Participant satisfaction was strong, as 92% of individuals on the retiree exchange were satisfied with their adviser, while 88% on the active exchange liked being able to choose from multiple carriers.
Our solutions for clients continue to bend the cost curve by 150 to 200 basis points on average over a multi-year period with more than 1/4 of returning clients seeing a year-over-year decrease. We feel good about the pipeline and our ability to drive greater scale and growth in 2016.
We're also investing in software as a service model at our HR BPO business, where growth in new clients and conversations with existing clients is driving strong demand as well as the expansion of our capabilities to include financial limitations. And finally, we're investing in our talent rewards business, as we are seeing strong demand for data and analytics to support increasing organizational change.
Turning to the individual businesses within HR Solutions. In Consulting Services, organic revenue growth was 4%, overcoming a tough comparable in the prior year that included project work relating to the [indiscernible] bill. Results in the quarter reflect continued growth in retirement consulting, primarily driven by demand for delegated investment consulting solutions. We also saw continued growth in compensation consulting, driven by record growth in participation for survey work as companies require benchmarking and assistance with plan design to address retention and ways to compete more effectively with incentive strategies.
In outsourcing, organic revenue growth was 4% as well, driven by growth across all major businesses. We saw growth in benefits administration, driven primarily by an increase in project-related work. Results reflect growth in HR BPO, driven by new client wins in cloud-based solutions. We saw solid growth in health care exchanges, driven by an increase in the number of enrollments across the platform.
Overall, across HR Solutions, client needs are growing in both size and complexity across retirement and health. Our results reflect a solid finish to the year with growth across all major businesses, including strong growth in areas we've been investing to continue to deliver sustainable long-term growth.
In summary, despite short-term headwinds from both a macroeconomic and industry pricing standpoint, our results for both the quarter and the year finished on a high note. We delivered solid organic growth across both segments and strengthened our operational performance driven by our industry-leading platform of client-serving capabilities and investments in data and analytics. 
With that said, I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Christa for further financial review. Christa?"

As Greg noted, our industry-leading franchise closed the year with a strong performance despite both macroeconomic and industry-specific headwinds.

As Greg noted, our industry-leading franchise closed the year with a strong performance despite both macroeconomic and industry-specific headwinds. Our results in the quarter reflect solid organic growth and record operating margin performance in Risk and HR Solutions, record free cash generation and effective capital management, highlighted by the repurchase of approximately 400 million of ordinary shares in the quarter. We returned roughly $1.9 billion of capital to shareholders in 2015.
Now let me turn to the financial results for the quarter on Page 6 of the presentation. Our core EPS performance, excluding certain items, increased 20% to $2.27 per share for the fourth quarter compared to $1.89 in the prior year quarter. Certain items that were adjusted for in core EPS performance and highlighted in the schedules on Page 12 of the press release include noncash intangible asset amortization.
Further, included in the results was a $0.10 per share unfavorable impact related to foreign currency translation due to the U.S. dollar strengthening against most major currencies. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, EPS grew 25% for the fourth quarter and 15% for the full year, in line with our compounded annual growth rate of 15% for the last 10 years, another year of outstanding performance reflecting the strength of our industry-leading franchise and focus on shareholder value creation.
Going forward, if currency to remain stable at today's rates, we would expect substantially less of a headwind with an estimated unfavorable impact of roughly $0.10 for 2016 compared to $0.41 of impact for 2015. We would expect the majority of this impact to be weighted towards the first half of 2016, more so in the first quarter.
Now let me talk about each of the segments on the next slide. In our Risk Solutions segment, organic revenue growth was 5%, operating margin increased 100 basis points to 25.7% and operating income increased 2% compared to the prior year quarter. Operating income included a $27 million unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation. Excluding this impact, underlying operating income increased 7% versus the prior year quarter. Operating margin improvement of 100 basis points includes a 30 basis point unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation. Excluding the impact from foreign currency, underlying operating margin improved 70 basis points in the quarter. Our fourth quarter performance reflects solid organic growth performance and improved returns on our investments in data and analytics across our portfolio.
For 2015, Risk Solutions operating income decreased 2%, which includes a $128 million unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation. Excluding this impact, underlying operating income increased 5% versus the prior year. Operating margin increased 70 basis points to 23.6%, including a 20 basis points favorable impact from foreign currency translation. Excluding the impact from foreign currency, underlying operating margin increased 50 basis points in the year.
We delivered strong operational improvement in 2015 with record operating margins despite significant headwinds from an unfavorable market impact in Reinsurance and fragile macroeconomic conditions. This level of performance reflects strong new business generation and increased operating leverage in the business as well as expense discipline as we optimize our global cost structure. We expect continued improvement in 2016 and are firmly on track with our long-term target of 26%. In addition, if short-term interest rates continue to rise, we believe we have significant leverage to improving interest rate environment as every 100 basis point rise in global interest rates should result in approximately $45 million of investment income.
Turning to the HR Solutions segment. Organic revenue growth was 4%, operating margin increased 270 basis points to 26.2% and operating income increased 14% compared to the prior year quarter. Operating income included a $6 million unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation. In addition, there are approximately $12 million or minus 90 basis points of transaction-related and portfolio repositioning costs incurred in the quarter, as we continue to drive improved return on capital. The gain related to the sale of our asset management business was recorded in other income.
Results were driven by organic growth, expense discipline and improved returns on investment including health care exchanges, which delivered modest profitability in 2015. For the full year, operating income increased 7% including a $20 million unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation. Excluding this impact, underlying operating income increased 10% compared to the prior year and operating margins increased 100 basis points to a record 18.1%. This level of performance demonstrates strong improvement over the prior year, reflecting solid financial results in our core business as well as improved profitability in the areas we've been investing for long-term growth, including delegated investment consulting, cloud-based solutions in HR BPO and health care exchanges.
Looking forward, we expect continued operational improvement in 2016 towards our long-term target of 22% with quarterly patterning of operating income results in HR Solutions similar to 2015. More specifically, down in the first half, more so in Q1, and up in the second half, most notably Q4.
Now let me discuss a few of the line items outside of the operating segments on Slide 9. Unallocated expenses increased $17 million to $61 million due to the timing of certain employee incentive and employee benefit-related expenses as well as certain investments in shared services. Interest income was $4 million compared to $3 million from the prior year quarter. Interest expense was $68 million in line with quarterly guidance. Other income of $49 million primarily includes a gain on the sale of our Absence Management Business in Outsourcing in HR Solutions. The sale continues to reflect our efforts to drive improved return on capital. Going forward, we expect a run rate of approximately $45 million per quarter of unallocated expense, $3 million per quarter of interest income and $68 million of interest expense.
Turning to taxes. The adjusted effective tax rate on net income from continuing operations, excluding the applicable tax impact associated with the expenses related to legacy litigation in Q2, decreased to 17.9% compared to the prior year quarter at 19.6%, due to the favorable impact of certain discrete tax adjustments. Our estimate of the underlying operating tax rate remains at 19%.
Lastly, average diluted shares outstanding decreased 5% to 279.3 million in the fourth quarter compared to 293.4 million in the prior year quarter, as we effectively allocate capital and manage dilution. The company repurchased 4.3 million Class A ordinary shares for approximately $400 million in the fourth quarter. The company has $4.1 billion of remaining authorization under its share repurchase program. Actual shares outstanding on December 31 were 269.8 million, and there are approximately 6 million additional dilutive equivalents. Estimated Q1 '16 beginning dilutive share count is approximately 276 million, subject to share price movement, share issuance and share repurchase.
Now let me turn to the next slide to highlight our solid balance sheet and strong cash flow growth on Slide 10. At December 31, 2015, cash and short-term investments were $740 million. Total debt outstanding was approximately $5.7 billion and total debt-to-EBITDA on a GAAP basis was 2.3x. Cash flow from operations for the year increased 11% or $197 million to a record $2 billion, driven by a decline in pension contributions, restructuring-related payments, cash paid for taxes and working capital improvements, partially offset by $137 million in cash paid to settle legacy litigation and strong organic growth performance in the fourth quarter. Free cash flow, as defined by cash flow from operations less CapEx, increased 10% or $163 million to a record $1.7 billion, reflecting strong growth in cash flow from operations, partially offset by a $34 million increase in CapEx. The increase in CapEx in 2015 was primarily related to completed investments in certain projects to optimize our global real estate portfolio.
As we noted in our press release and related presentation today, during the quarter for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we reclassified certain cash flows related to shares withheld for taxes from cash flow from operations to cash flow from financing. Shares withheld for taxes reflects the choice of colleagues upon vesting to choose gross or net shares to satisfy their withholding requirements. As nearly all colleagues choose to receive net shares, the company then withholds an applicable amount of shares to cover withholding amounts, in effect creating a share repurchase like transaction. We believe the reclassification of shares withheld for taxes, the cash from financing activities provides greater transparency to the cash flow production from operating results, underlines more closely with the accounting treatment of comparable peers. While the reclassification has no actual cash impact on the cash flow statement, as a result of the reclassification, we are increasing our near-term free cash flow goal from $2.3 billion to $2.4 billion for the full year 2017.
Turning to the next slide to discuss our significantly increasing free cash flow generation. We value the firm based on free cash flow and allocate capital to maximize free cash flow returns. Free cash flow of $2.4 billion is not our end goal as further long-term sustainable free cash flow will be driven by continued operating income growth and additional working capital initiatives beyond 2017.
There are 4 primary areas that are expected to contribute to our goal of delivering $2.4 billion or more for the full year 2017: the first is continued operational performance driven by organic revenue growth and margin expansion; the second is working capital improvements, as we focus on closing the gap between receivables and payables; the third is declining uses of cash of pension contributions, CapEx and restructuring, which will free up more than $90 million of annual free cash flow between the end of 2015 and 2017; and fourth, lower cash tax payments reflecting a lower effective tax rate. Lastly, I would note that during 2015, we paid $137 million of cash to settle legacy litigation, which we would expect to provide a tailwind to free cash flow growth in 2016.
Turning to our pension plans. We have taken significant steps to reduce volatility and liability as we've closed plans to new entrants, frozen plans from incurring additional benefits and continued to derisk certain plan assets. Based on 12/31/2015 actuarial assumptions, reported liabilities on a GAAP basis decreased to $1.8 billion at year-end 2015, reflecting a 94% funded basis compared to $2.1 billion at year-end 2014, reflecting a 90% funded basis. Not reflected in those amounts, however, are $1 billion of overfunded pension plans that are included in noncurrent assets in the balance sheet. Considered together, our net unfunded obligations are approximately $800 million. Overall, we expect the contributions to decline by approximately $44 million in 2016 and would expect noncash pension income to be a modest benefit in 2016 versus 2015.
Regarding our restructuring program. Cash payments declined by $54 million to $28 million in 2015. As all charges related to restructuring program have been incurred, we would expect cash payments to decline by $9 million to approximately $19 million in 2016 and continue to decline thereafter to an immaterial amount.
In summary, our results for both the quarter and the full year reflect solid organic growth, record operating margin performance across both Risk and HR Solutions, strong EPS growth, record free cash flow of $1.7 billion and the return of roughly $1.9 billion in capital to shareholders. Despite challenging macroeconomic and our industry-specific headwinds, our industry-leading franchise is strongly positioned to help clients manage through increasing complexity, magnitude and volatility across the areas of risk, retirement and health.
With that, I would like to turn the call back over to the operator for questions."

And this is a business, over the course of the year, that produced 10% operating income growth, grew at 4%. We made substantial -- by the way, also achieved record margins. We made substantial investments in areas like retirement delegating across the board and in our health solutions. And again, we look at health solutions across the board, really every category in terms of the ability to help clients with this very important challenge they've got around the health side. And we think we've got one of the strongest capabilities here, whether it's H&P, whether it's global benefits across the board, and on the exchanges, retiree, active, fully, self, all across the board. 
And what we would say, if you think about sort of quarter-over-quarter, first, we would agree the adoption on the health active side across the board especially the larger end hasn't been as fast as expected, by the way, especially given some of the results we've seen with existing clients because it's been exceptional, reduced volatility for them, price reductions year-over-year, 25%, in fact, of price reductions over the last year. So we're very, very positive in terms of the overall impact. The pipeline looks very, very strong. And again, even in the exchange business, as it exists, we had double-digit growth and it's profitable. So for us, we'd love this solution of the active [ph] clients, but it's part of a broader health solution.
I would reflect, by the way, in the fourth quarter of last year, we had the single largest implementation on the retiree side sort of in the history of the world and maybe will forever be in the history of the world, and that actually inflates the results a bit, too, but we really like the business overall tremendously and we're really feeling good about our position in HR Solutions."

And so it's sort of a lagging indicator because you're getting price over that last 12 months showing up in our current year's results.

We feel very good about how we finished the year and what it sets the stage for in 2016.
Obviously, again, look at it in terms of the overall year, we're not happy with the level of growth at Reinsurance at negative 1% for the year, but we have said already we expect Reinsurance to return to positive organic growth in 2016. And for us, especially for our Reinsurance business maybe more than any other, it's a great example of a business right now as business results don't really reflect the underlying capability and opportunity we see, which is exceptional.
I mean, think about it, we're the largest advisory in the world in this area and really number one in treaty, number one in fac, number one on the alternative capital side, capital markets. 20% of the global book is linked to U.S. property cat, and that's fully commission-based. Those rates have come down 15% to 25% over the last 24 months, that's been reflected. Although those are starting to flatten out a bit, the decrease is not as great.
But against that, it's really been the team's ability to continue to win 19 consecutive quarters of wins on treaty reinsurance, which has been exceptional, and really the ability to create net new demand. And this is really in areas like mortgage overall and what we've done in review. So they've been able to offset these headwinds, which are diminishing. Those businesses that they've offset with is going to continue to grow, and the opportunity going into 2016 we feel very good.
I would say, by the way, just technically, the 2% in this quarter is on top of a 5% in the Q4 2014. So it was kind of on top of a very strong comparable. So we feel good about the position and we love this business. We're very excited about it.

As you think about the overall HR Solutions business, we really have a very significant bias towards Q4 with annual enrollment in our benefits administration business primarily occurring in Q4 and health care exchanges primarily occurring in Q4, where you have expenses showing up in Q1, 2, 3 and 4 and revenue really coming through in Q4.

We actually look at both. And if you look at our history over the last 10 years, we've actually been a little more leaning toward acquisitions when you look at sort of the amount of overall investments versus what the buyback has been over time. And underlying that, if you look back over the last 10 years, our operating income growth year-over-year has been roughly 11%. So it's something we really invested in and invested heavily in organic improvement as well, as I've described before.
The level of capabilities that we're investing in for existing clients, new clients on the data analytics side is, we believe, candidly, quite unprecedented. If you think about data analytics, went through the Risk Insight Platform, the review, to the end client treaty now at the endpoint, all the work we've done in delegated exchanges, you get the picture. So we're very, very much focused on investment back into the business. And M&A plays a big role on that and will continue to play a big role on that.
We probably -- looking at Christa, we probably looked at more deals this year, situations this year than maybe any time in our history and measured in the billions. We've done fewer of them because we're always going to be disciplined around return on invested capital. Christa has in place a very, very structured way to think about how we can very meticulously invest our capital to get the highest return on capital, generate free cash flow and build wealth for our shareholders. And in the context of that, serve clients in a very, very effective way. And that's really the machine we set up, that's how the engine runs and that's what we've done.
So we're going to continue to look at what the best place is to place our capital. And we'll be open to acquisitions as we are, organic investment, buyback, all -- and all the above. That's really how we're looking at it."

So one of the things that I tried and obviously failed to communicate earlier was this number varies substantially by year.

As we think about our free cash flow going forward, there is no change to our view on the underlying free cash flow growth of the firm. We do believe that there -- this amount going forward is somewhere between $0 and $100 million. Therefore, we've increased our target by $100 million to $2.4 billion.
One of the other things I would make clear is that the $2.4 billion in free cash flow in 2017 is fully deployable cash because if you'd look at the $1.7 billion we generated in 2015, we actually returned $1.9 billion of cash to shareholders in 2015. So we are generating a huge amount of cash, which we can fully deploy on either return to shareholders, as Greg said, invest it back in to our business either organically or inorganically in the form of M&A. So we're very excited about the future growth potential of the firm, given the huge cash flow generation we're going to produce."

And I think it has been a journey for us, which we've been on really for the last -- almost 5 years. And I think as we continue to improve the collection of cash from customers and we continue to manage the payment of cash to suppliers, we believe that we have improvements in cash for at least the next 5 to 8 years in terms of working capital and its structural improvements in the process around which we do this in the way in which we manage this in the overall portfolio of business we do. So I guess, what I would say, as you think about Aon, we believe we should be working capital neutral overall and we are fast in that today.

And for us, we believe it's going to be fundamental to what we need to try to get accomplished over time, Charles, and really is going to be differentiating in terms of our capability versus the marketplace. And there are many examples. By the way, the Risk Insight Platform efforts really are -- actually the work is done directly with the primary insurers serving clients. So it actually touches very much the primary insurance marketplace.
But let me give you one example that -- I have happened to be just in London yesterday with Lloyd's and Lloyd's syndicates. We just launched something called Aon Client Treaty, which is a very -- it's basically built on a foundation around data and analytics. So in essence, it will be, when done, the single biggest underwriting transaction likely in the history of Lloyd's to date. And it really takes our book that goes into the London market to our global broking center, and we actually model that book in detail, really bottom up, all different aspects of what's going on, 64,000 policy transactions, 120 different classes of business, 157 countries. You get the idea. We built an incredible data room in which underwriters could come in and actually take a company-level understanding and underwriting and then apply it at a portfolio level. And in essence, what we're saying to our client -- by the way, on Monday, we're having our property symposium, I'm talking to clients at our property symposium essentially saying, if you're going to use London capacity, you've eliminated your tail risk. So when you actually think about the set of syndicates that are actually going to come to bear on behalf of you, the last 3 or 4 or 5 actually create risk. We've eliminated that. So we've actually pre-confirmed 20% of that capacity that will follow a lead capacity going into London. That makes that capital we're bringing to bear much, much more competitive. So there's an example of hard clear data and analytics. And essentially, we've analyzed our book sort of -- and it happens to be in the London marketplace. But imagine, we can look at this all over the world in which we're actually providing distinctive value, unduplicated value to clients using data and analytics. So that was a bit long-winded, but I hope you get the idea. That's a very powerful tool. By the way, in order to do that, you had to be able to analyze all 6,000 clients going into London in a way that, frankly, leverages off our Risk Insight Platform. Never been done before."

I would note that there are slides available on our website for you to follow along with our commentary today. And consistent with previous quarters, I'd like to cover 2 areas before turning the call over to Christa for further financial review: First, is our performance against key metrics we can make it a shareholders; and second, is overall organic growth performance, including continued areas of strategic investments across Aon. 
On the first topic, our performance versus key metrics. Each quarter, we measure our performance against the key metrics we focus on achieving over the course of the year: Grow organically, expand margins, increase earnings per share and deliver free cash flow growth. Turning to Slide 3. And the first quarter, organic revenue growth was 3%, with growth across every major business, highlighted by 4% growth in each of our retail brokerage businesses and positive organic growth in Reinsurance. Operating margin increased 20 basis points, reflecting strong operating performance in resolutions. EPS decreased 1% to $1.35, including a $0.10 unfavorable impact from changes in foreign currency. And finally, free cash flow was $221 million, reflecting solid underlying performance in our seasonally weakest cash flow quarter. Overall, our first quarter results reflect the strength of our industry-leading franchise and a solid start to the year, with organic revenue growth across every major business, adjusted operating margin expansion, improve return on invested capital and effective allocation of capital, highlighted by the repurchase of $750 million of stock. 
Turning to Slide 4. On the second topic of growth and investment. I would spend the next few minutes discussing the quarter for both of our segments. In Resolutions, organic revenue growth was 3%, similar to the prior year quarter, driven by growth across all major businesses. As we've discussed previously, we're driving a set of initiatives and making strategic investments letters performance and position our Resolution segment for long-term growth and improved operating leverage. With management over renewal book to Client Promise and retention rates more than 90% on average across Retail Brokerage, highlighted by record retention levels of nearly 94% in U.S. Retail and EMEA. New business generation of $225 million across Retail brokerage, including record new business in U.S. Retail; 20 consecutive quarters of positive net new business and core treaty Reinsurance; and increased operating leverage from our significant investments and innovative technology and data and analytics, including Aon point, which captures over 3 million trades and $160 million of bound premium. Review, our reinsurer dashboard combined with strategic consulting to help reinsurers be more effective with capital markets foreseeing company clients. Under Aon Broker initiatives to better match client need with insurer appetite for risk. A great example of our innovation and data analytics was the launch of Aon client Treaty. The largest ever underwritten portfolio of risk in the history of . Since launching on January 1, we remain very excited about the positive impact of the Client Treaty for our largest and most sophisticated clients. We've had terrific success and feedback from clients around world and continue to attract new clients, with the client treaty being a major differentiator. Finally, we're spending our content and global footprint from tuck-in acquisitions that increase scale in emerging markets or expand capability. 
Reflecting on individual businesses within Risk Solutions. In the Americas, organic revenue growth was 4%, similar to the prior year quarter. Exposure has continued to be positive across the region while the impact of pricing was negative, resulting in a relatively stable market impact overall similar to the last 6 quarters. We saw double-digit growth in Latin America, driven by management of the renewal book portfolio with many regions delivering strong growth despite macroeconomic challenges facing the region. 
In U.S. Retail. Growth was driven by solid retention rates and continued record new business generation, led by a diverse portfolio of products including health, P&C and surety. Affinity also recorded solid performance, highlighted by strong growth in the consumer solutions. In international, organic revenue growth was 4% compared to 3% in the prior year quarter. Similar to the last 6 quarters, exposures continue to be stable and feedback from pricing was modestly negative on average, driven by fragile market conditions in various countries across Europe and Asia and continued pricing pressure in the Pacific region. Results reflects strong growth in Asia, including strength in health and benefits and strong benefit of the renewal book portfolio. In continental Europe, we saw solid growth, driven by both new business generation and management of renewable portfolio reflecting strong leadership across the region with the macroeconomic environment continues to stabilize. 
And in the Pacific, we saw continued strength in New Zealand while Australia showed modest growth. 
In Reinsurance, organic revenue growth was 1% compared to negative 1% in the prior year quarter, reflecting our babies guidance of an expected return to modest growth in 2016. Results in the quarter were primarily driven by growth in global facultative placements, theme demand in Treaty and from new business generation. Results were partially offset by unfavorable market impact. 
As the rate of price decline continues to moderate, capital is being deployed in new markets, including U.S. mortgage credit risk; life annuity risk; and other emergent risks, such as cyber liability. As highlighted in our prior discussions, new opportunities for growth combined with industry data analytics has positioned our Reinsurance business for a return to modest growth in 2016. 
Turning to HR Solutions. Organic revenue growth was 2% with growth across both businesses. We're seeing growth in high demand areas while we have strategically invested in innovative solution in client-facing reflecting Aon Hewitt's leadership and in-depth understanding of market trends, including as clients manage risk against pension schemes that are frozen, largely underfunded and phasing regulatory changes solutions to derisk pension plan. It support delegated investment solutions. A strong growth area where assets under management have grown from $10 billion to roughly $85 billion in 5 years. Continued investment to strengthen our industry-leading portfolio of health solutions, covering the full range of benefit strategies, client size and funding choices, including our suite of private health care changes. We're also investing in software-as-a-service models in our HR BPO business, where growth and new clients and conversion of existing clients is driving strong demand as well as the expansion of our capabilities to include financial implementations. And finally, we're investing in our talent rewards business, as we are seeing strong demand for data analytics increasing organizational change. 
Turning to the individual businesses within HR Solutions. In consulting services, organic revenue growth was 3% compared to 2% for the prior year quarter. Results in the quarter reflect continued growth in retirement consulting, primarily driven by demand for delegated investment consulting services. We also saw growth in core pension solutions where we provide clients the best combination of expertise and execution and modest growth in communications consulting. In outsourcing, organic revenue growth was 1% compared to 4% in the prior year quarter. The prior year quarter included certain out-of-cycle, follow-on enrollments on our retiree exchange related to a very large client implementation. Results excluding the follow-on enrollments in the prior year reflects strong growth in HR BPO, driven by new client wins and cloud-based solutions. 
In summary, we delivered solid organic growth across every major business and strengthened our operational performance, driven by our industry-leading platform of client serving capabilities and investments in data and analytics. With that said, I'm now pleased turn the call over to Christa for further financial review. Christa?"

As Greg noted, our first quarter results reflect a solid start of the year. We delivered organic revenue growth across both segments and delivered strong operating margin improvement in Resolutions. We imp",1585,"Thanks so much, Greg, and good morning, everyone. As Greg noted, our first quarter results reflect a solid start of the year. We delivered organic revenue growth across both segments and delivered strong operating margin improvement in Resolutions. We improve the return on invested capital through the disposition of certain businesses and effectively allocated capital, highlighted by the repurchase of $750 million of ordinary shares in the quarter. More share repurchase that we've done in any quarter since 2008. Strong share repurchase coupled with recent announcement of a 10% increase to the quarterly cash dividend reflect our long-term relief in the strengthening free cash flow of the firm. 
Now let me turn to result in the quarter on Page 6 of the presentation. Our core EPS performance, excluding certain items, decreased 1% to $1.35 per share for the first quarter compared to $1.37 in the prior year quarter. Certain items that were adjusted for in the core EPS performance and highlighted in the schedules on Page 12 of the press release include noncash intangible asset amortization.
As we noted at the beginning of the call, we evaluate performance over the course of the year, as macro factors or certain actions to strengthen underlying performance may results on a near-term basis to help with the first quarter underlying EPS in context. First, we incurred unfavorable foreign currency related impacts totaling $0.10 per share, including $0.05 per share translation for a stronger U.S. dollar and $0.05 per share for remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities and non-functional currencies, primarily resulting from the significant devaluation of the exchange rate in Venezuela. Going forward, if currency is to remain stable at today's rate, we would expect an immaterial impact for the rest of the year. Second, we took steps to further strengthen return on invested capital with the disposition of certain businesses. In HR Solutions, we incurred $0.06 per share of transaction and portfolio repositioning related costs in connection with it position. This cost were more than offset by $0.10 per share of gains recorded in other income. Lastly, the prior year quarter benefited from $0.12 per share of other income gains. 
Now let me talk about each of the segments on the next slide. In our Risk Solutions segment, organic revenue growth was 3%, operating margin increased 100 basis points to 24.2% and operating income increased 3% compared to the prior year quarter. Operating income included a $13 million unfavorable impact from FX. Excluding this impact, underlying operating income increased 6% versus the prior year quarter. Operating income margin -- operating margin improvement of 100 basis points includes a 30 basis point favorable impact from FX. Excluding the impact from FX, underlying operating margin improved 70 basis points in the quarter. Strong operating improvement in the first quarter reflects organic growth in each business, including Reinsurance, and improved return on their investments in data and analytics across the portfolio. We continue to face headwinds in the first quarter from an unfavorable market impact in Reinsurance and weaker economic conditions in a number of geographies. Despite these challenges, our performance in Risk Solutions reflect strong new business generation and increased operating leverage in the business. We expect continued growth and operational improvement throughout 2016 as we make progress towards our long-term operating margin target of 26%. In addition, if short-term interest rates continue to rise, we believe we have significant leverage to an improving interest rate environment as every 100 basis points rise in global interest rates should result in approximately $45 million of investment income. 
Turning to the HR Solutions segment. Organic revenue growth was 2%, operating margin decreased 140 basis points to 11.8% and operating income decreased 14% compared to the prior year quarter. Results were exactly in line with our previously provided guidance. Operating income included a $3 million unfavorable impact from FX. As mentioned previously, underlying results in the quarter included $20 million or minus 220 basis points of transaction and portfolio repositioning-related costs as we continue to drive improved return on capital for the firm. The gain relating to the sale of our recruitment process outsourcing business was recorded in other income. Strong underlying operating performance was driven by organic revenue growth in high-demand areas where we've been investing as well as expense discipline and return on our investments. 
Looking forward, we expect continued growth in revenue, operating income and margin in 2016 towards our long-term target of 22%, with quarterly operating income results in HR Solutions similar to 2015. More specifically, operating income will be down in the first half and up in the second half of the year, most notably in Q4.
Now let me discuss a few of the line items outside of the operating segments on Slide 9. Unallocated expenses were $46 million compared to $47 million in the prior year quarter. Interest income was $2 million compared to $3 million in the prior year quarter. Interest expense increased $4 million to $59 million due to an increase in total debt outstanding. Other income of $18 million, primarily includes gains in the sale of certain businesses, partially offset by losses through the unfavorable impact of exchange rates on the remeasurement of assets and liabilities in non-functional currencies. 
Going forward, we expect a run rate of approximately $45 million per quarter of unallocated expense and $3 million per quarter of interest income. Interest expense in the second quarter is expected to be approximately $72 million or modestly higher than the first quarter due to the overlap of $750 million of notes placed in February and $500 million of notes due in May. We currently expect interest expense to decline to $70 million per quarter thereafter. 
Turning to taxes. The effective tax rate on net income from continuing operations decreased to 18.4% compared to the prior year quarter at 19.1%. Due to the geographic distribution of net income and certain favorable discrete tax adjustments. 
Lastly, average diluted shares outstanding decreased 5% to 273.7 million in the first quarter compared to 287.1 million in the prior year quarter, as we effectively allocate capital and manage dilution. The company repurchased 7.7 million Class A ordinary shares for approximately $750 million in the first quarter. The company has $3.3 billion of remaining authorization under its share repurchase program. Actual shares outstanding on March 31 were 264.8 million, and there were approximately 5 million additional dilutive equivalents. Estimated Q2 2016 beginning diluted share count is approximately 270 million, subject to share price movement, share issuance and share repurchases. 
Now let me turn to the next slide that highlight our solid balance sheet and strong cash flow growth on Slide 10. At March 31, 2016, cash and short-term investments were $1.1 billion. We expect levels to return to our normal run rate between $600 million to $800 million in the second quarter. Total debt outstanding was approximately $6.6 billion and total debt-to-EBITDA on a GAAP basis was 2.7x. Cash flow from operations for the first 3 months decreased 8% or $25 million to $273 million. This was primarily driven by unfavorable timing of certain tax-related items that we expect to normalize by Q2, partially offset by working capital improvements and a decline in cash paid for pensions and restructuring. 
Free cash flow, as defined by cash flow from operations less CapEx, decreased 6% or $15 million to $221 million, reflecting a decline in cash flow from operations, partially offset by $10 million decrease in CapEx. 
Turning to the next slide to discuss our significant increases in free cash flow. We value the firm based on free cash flow and allocate capital to maximize free cash flow returns. Free cash flow of $2.4 billion in 2017 is not our end goal, as for the long-term sustainable free cash flow will be driven by continued operating income growth and additional working capital initiatives beyond 2017. There are 4 primary areas that are expected to contribute to our near-term goal of delivering $2.4 billion or more for the full year 2017. The first is continued operational performance, driven by organic revenue growth and margin expansion; the second is working capital improvements as we focus on closing the gap between receivables and payables; the third is declining uses of cash, of pension, CapEx and restructuring, which we expect to free up more than $90 million of annual free cash flow between the end of 2015 and 2017; and fourth, lower cash tax payments reflecting a lower effective tax rate. 
Turning to our pension plans. We've taken significant steps to reduce volatility and liability as we've closed plants new entrants, frozen plan running currently additional benefits and continue to do a risk of certain plant assets. We currently expect contributions to decline by approximately $44 million in 2016 and expect noncash pension income to be a modest benefit in 2016 versus 2015. Regarding our restructuring program. As all charges related to restructuring program have been incurred, we expect cash payments to decline by $9 million to approximately $19 million in 2016 and continue to decline thereafter to an immaterial amount. In summary, we delivered solid underlying results in the first quarter, investments in our industry-leading platform of client service capabilities across risk, retirement and health continue to position the firm for long-term revenue growth, further margin expansion and strong free cash flow generation towards our near-term goal of 2.7 -- $2.4 billion for the full year 2017. With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to the operator for questions."

But if you think about our confidence in the current environment for the coming years. By the way, not just for the business but also improve the margins truck and towards our 26% and 22% goals in Risk and HR Solutions. Listen as an example, this often gets linked back to your pricing on the insurance side. We would encourage you to separate those. And just consider -- think about from Aon standpoint, 3 sources of growth the statement on the risk side for a moment. Our ability to grow in the traditional business, property at all those pieces reflects a multiyear investment Aon Client Promise. It's usually new clients into the fray and do more with the existing clients. And as proof point for that set up rollout also across HR Solutions as well, look at new business in Q1. It was a record in U.S. Retail, it was a record worldwide. I mean, it's a record on top of a record. It was same in Q1 in 2015 with record levels of retention. So this is just a 94% U.S. retail for example  and EMEA. So this is just an example of sort of what's happening in the core business and what we're about. And I was going to say, by the away, as in a side, the market overall as we look at it is a bit, frankly, a bit more stable when you think about pricing and insured values. But that's just one aspect of Aon. Another aspect is our ability to grow outside of traditional core and think about in this regard just a couple of examples here. We've got 2 existing $1 billion revenue business we've invested in heavily. Affinity being one, $1 billion business growing exceptionally well. Health and benefits, $1 billion business plus also growing just proportionally well. So you got the traditional, you got the things outside the core I just described. And an equally exciting for us is the ability to grow in new areas where we've made some substantial investment. And just a few examples of those would be like Aon Client Treaty, I highlighted, the largest ever underwritten portfolio of risk for Lloyds. Aon Endpoint, 40-plus carriers on that platform now, Aon Review. And then finally, I would just highlight what we just did in U.S. mortgage over the last couple of years is, frankly, brought insurance capital into the mortgage market. In 2015 alone, I think it's about $3.5 billion in net new premium, $5 billion since inception. So the point being here, Sarah, this is such an important question. We believe we continue to prove the point that organic growth and margin improvement from us is not about insurance pricing or market impact. It's really about our ability to continue to invest and bring market -- bringing in the market capabilities and real products that help our clients exceed. And frankly, that engine is under our control. It's working and it's continuing to build and a lot of invested historically are just coming online. And you saw it also as we finish '15. In '15, we grew organically that record margin in risk. Record margins in HR Solutions, record free cash flow and record EPS. That momentum in '15 carries us into '16 and it release that engine that's driving it. So did that answer your question on growth?"

But there are many other factors that influence that. As a U.K. company, we operate in territorial taxes, which has different repatriation impacts than a worldwide tax system. We're growing the geographies with declining statutory tax rate such as the U.K. where we are domiciled where the tax rate is currently 20%, and it's going to decline over the coming years to 17%. And so statutory tax rates are really important part of the business for where we invest in building products and services. And we also leverage net operating losses where possible to decide where we invest and grow businesses. So I guess what I would say is, as we think about our business going forward, our overall global capital structure we feel is appropriate for our business, and therefore, we feel really comfortable with our current effective tax rate for the foreseeable future."

But we saw growth in EMEA , in Germany, in France and Italy. We -- you note the retention rates I've described before and the new businesses generation. So while the market conditions we think remain relatively stable. And again, we would say on balance. When you think about pricing and insured values. Put those 2 together and call those market impact. Oftentimes, you hear about pricing. You don't hear about market impact. Market impact has as much impact on pricing. On balance, we actually think '16 looks better than '15 for our global footprint. But you saw our growth across EMEA and the countryside is highlighted. You're seeing new business generation. This is in the core business, net new business generation in the U.S. and in EMEA that is literally record levels in Q1. And it was record on top of records. So the comps are extremely, extremely high. And record retention rates, approaching 94%, 95%. So for us, look, we're going to keep investing around how we new client leadership. How we actually bring new clients in and how we serve them and served them more comprehensively.

Obviously, you guys don't give  expected guidance on M&A and haven't done much in this space over the last few years as he had really strong cash flow growth. But if looking forward over the next couple of years, does that math change? The margins in that business have increased incredibly well. A lot of the restructuring and whatnot has been taken out, and you guys have one of the best toolboxes in the industry. Wondering -- I guess I just sort of think that the growth in that business should even be better while 4% organic is really good in this market.

To step back and think about the journey that Aon has been on as we've -- as we shape and build our firm. We would say, this is an unfinished business for us. This is -- while wv made great progress, and it's a really credit to my Aon colleagues around the world and the progress they've made over the last number of years, the platform we have and given the current state of where our clients are with unprecedented risk spacing, traditional or nontraditional. Think about global warming, pandemic, cyber, terrorism all the different pieces. The challenges on health, which are unprecedented, literally, in the U.S. and around the world; the challenges on retirement. These sets of issues for us represent, we believe, an incredible set of demands for clients, needs for clients, and our platforms are actually very, very well-positioned against these mega, really, global need from a client standpoint. But as said at the beginning to Sarah's question, the ways we're helping clients are traditional brokerage all the different pieces around that. There are areas around that that we continue to evolve and develop. By the way, that's an HR Solutions and in Risk Solutions. And in areas like data and analytics, which frankly are opening up an entire new business for us that we've invested. This is not flavor of the month for us. This has been a 7-year, 7 investments in which we're investing, $300 million, $400 million and $500 million overtime around in data analytics and insight. So for us, we see this as a tremendous opportunity, and it's not just top line. It really is around operating performance improvement, which is why, again, we look at '16, '17, '18, it's just a continuation. This is not new news. The continuation of building Aon's strength in Aon in behalf of clients and the record shows we're making progress against that with more opportunity to come."

We've done a tremendous amount of buyback. In over a 10-year period, we've improved operating income 10% per year over that period of time and grown EPS about 16% per year over that period of time. And so we're going to keep looking at these trade-offs. And we -- as we make our cash flow goal in '17 of $2.4 billion and continue to build on it, as Christa described, our capacity to invest back in the business organically, M&A, buyback, we have all these in our disposal as we build the firm.

I would note that there are slides available on our website for you to follow along with our commentary today. And consistent with previous quarters, I'd like to cover 2 areas before turning the call over to Christa for further financial review. First is our performance against key metrics we communicated to shareholders. And second is overall organic growth performance, including continued areas of strategic investment across Aon.
On the first topic, our performance versus key metrics. Each quarter, we measure our performance against the key metrics we focus on achieving over the course of the year: grow organically, expand margins, increase earnings per share and deliver free cash flow growth.
Turning to Slide 3. In the first quarter, organic revenue growth was 3% with growth across every major business, highlighted by 4% growth in each of our retail brokerage businesses and positive organic growth in Reinsurance. Operating margin increased 20 basis points, reflecting strong operating performance in Risk Solutions. EPS decreased 1% to $1.35, including a $0.10 unfavorable impact from changes in foreign currency. And finally, free cash flow was $221 million, reflecting solid underlying performance in our seasonally weakest cash flow quarter. Overall, our first quarter results reflect the strength of our industry-leading franchise and a solid start to the year with organic revenue growth across every major business, adjusted operating margin expansion, improved return on invested capital and effective allocation of capital, highlighted by the repurchase of $750 million of stock.
Turning to Slide 4, on the second topic of growth and investment. I would spend the next few minutes discussing the quarter for both of our segments. In Risk Solutions, organic revenue growth was 3%, similar to the prior year quarter, driven by growth across all major businesses. As we've discussed previously, we're driving a set of initiatives and making strategic investments that are strengthening underline performance and position our Risk Solution segment for long-term growth and improved operating leverage with management of our renewal book through Aon Client Promise and retention rates of more than 90% on average across Retail Brokerage, highlighted by record retention levels of nearly 94% in U.S. Retail and EMEA; new business generation of $225 million across retail brokerage, including record new business in U.S. Retail; 20 consecutive quarters of positive net new business and core treaty reinsurance; and increased operating leverage from our significant investments and innovative technology and data and analytics, including Aon InPoint, which captures over 3 million trades and $160 million of bound premium; ReView, our reinsurer dashboard combined with strategic consulting to help reinsurers be more effective capital markets foreseeing company clients; and our Aon Broking initiatives to better match client need with insurer appetite for risk. A great example of our innovation and data analytics was the launch of Aon Client Treaty, the largest ever underwritten portfolio of risk in the history of Lloyd's. Since launching on January 1, we remain very excited about the positive impact of the client treaty for our largest and most sophisticated clients. We've had terrific success and feedback from clients around the world and continue to attract new clients, with the client treaty being a major differentiator. Finally, we're spending our content and global footprint through tuck-in acquisitions that increase scale in emerging markets or expand capability.
Reflecting on the individual businesses within Risk Solutions. In the Americas, organic revenue growth was 4%, similar to the prior year quarter. Exposure has continued to be positive across the region, while the impact on pricing was negative, resulting in a relatively stable market impact overall, similar to the last 6 quarters. We saw double-digit growth in Latin America, driven by management of the renewal book portfolio with many regions delivering strong growth despite macroeconomic challenges facing the region.
In U.S. Retail, growth was driven by solid retention rates and continued record new business generation, led by a diverse portfolio of products, including health, P&C and surety. Affinity also recorded solid performance, highlighted by strong growth in the consumer solutions. In international, organic revenue growth was 4% compared to 3% in the prior year quarter. Similar to the last 6 quarters, exposures continue to be stable and the impact from pricing was modestly negative on average, driven by fragile market conditions in various countries across Europe and Asia and continued pricing pressure in the Pacific region. Results reflect strong growth in Asia, including strength in health and benefits and strong management of the renewal book portfolio. In continental Europe, we saw solid growth, driven by both new business generation and management of renewal book portfolio reflecting strong leadership across the region, but the macroeconomic environment continues to stabilize. And in the Pacific, we saw continued strength in New Zealand, while Australia showed modest growth.
In Reinsurance, organic revenue growth was 1% compared to negative 1% in the prior year quarter, reflecting our previous guidance of an expected return to modest growth in 2016. Results in the quarter were primarily driven by growth in global facultative placements, theme demand in treaty and from new business generation. Results were partially offset by unfavorable market impact.
As the rate of price decline continues to moderate, capital is being deployed to new markets, including U.S. mortgage credit risk, life annuity risk, and other emergent risks, such as cyber liability. And as highlighted in our prior discussions, new opportunities for growth, combined with industry data analytics, has positioned our Reinsurance business for a return to modest growth in 2016.
Turning to HR Solutions. Organic revenue growth was 2% with growth across both businesses. We're seeing growth in high demand areas, where we have strategically invested in innovative solutions and client-facing capabilities, reflecting Aon Hewitt's leadership and in-depth understanding of market trends, including as clients manage risk against pension schemes that are frozen, largely underfunded and phasing regulatory changes, solutions to derisk pension plans and support for delegated investment solutions, a strong growth area where assets under management have grown from $10 billion to roughly $85 billion in 5 years; continued investment to strengthen our industry-leading portfolio of health solutions, covering the full range of benefit strategies, client size and funding choices, including our suite of private health care changes. We're also investing in software-as-a-service models in our HR BPO business, where growth and new clients and conversion of existing clients is driving strong demand as well as the expansion of our capabilities to include financial implementations. And finally, we're investing in our talent rewards business, as we are seeing strong demand for data and analytics to support increasing organizational change.
Turning to the individual businesses within HR Solutions. In consulting services, organic revenue growth was 3% compared to 2% in the prior year quarter. Results in the quarter reflect continued growth in retirement consulting, primarily driven by demand for delegated investment consulting services. We also saw growth in core pension solutions, where we provide clients the best combination of expertise and execution, and modest growth in communications consulting. In outsourcing, organic revenue growth was 1% compared to 4% in the prior year quarter. The prior year quarter included certain out-of-cycle, follow-on enrollments on our retiree exchange related to a very large client implementation. Results, excluding the follow-on enrollments in the prior year, reflect strong growth in HR BPO, driven by new client wins and cloud-based solutions.
In summary, we delivered solid organic growth across every major business and strengthened our operational performance, driven by our industry-leading platform of client serving capabilities and investments in data and analytics.
With that said, I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Christa for further financial review. Christa?"
119853,330262696,967476,"Aon plc, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2016",2016-04-29,"Earnings Calls","Aon plc","Executives","Thanks so much, Greg, and good morning, everyone. As Greg noted, our first quarter results reflect a solid start to the year. We delivered organic revenue growth across both segments and delivered strong operating margin improvement in Risk Solutions. We",1589,"Thanks so much, Greg, and good morning, everyone. As Greg noted, our first quarter results reflect a solid start to the year. We delivered organic revenue growth across both segments and delivered strong operating margin improvement in Risk Solutions. We improved the return on invested capital through the disposition of certain businesses and effectively allocated capital, highlighted by the repurchase of $750 million of ordinary shares in the quarter, more share repurchase that we've done in any quarter since 2008. Strong share repurchase, coupled with recent announcement of a 10% increase to the quarterly cash dividend, reflect our long-term relief in the strengthening free cash flow of the firm.
Now let me turn to financial results for the quarter on Page 6 of the presentation. Our core EPS performance, excluding certain items, decreased 1% to $1.35 per share for the first quarter compared to $1.37 in the prior year quarter. Certain items that were adjusted for in the core EPS performance and highlighted in the schedules on Page 12 of the press release include noncash intangible asset amortization.
As we noted at the beginning of the call, we evaluate performance over the course of the year as macro factors or certain actions to strengthen underlying performance may distort results on a near-term basis.
To help with the first quarter underlying EPS in context. First, we incurred unfavorable foreign currency-related impacts totaling $0.10 per share, including $0.05 per share of translation for a stronger U.S. dollar and $0.05 per share for remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities and non-functional currencies, primarily resulting from significant devaluation of the exchange rate in Venezuela. Going forward, if currency is to remain stable at today's rate, we would expect an immaterial impact for the rest of the year. Second, we took steps to further strengthen return on invested capital with the disposition of certain businesses. In HR Solutions, we incurred $0.06 per share of transaction and portfolio repositioning-related costs in connection with dispositions. These costs were more than offset by $0.10 per share of gains recorded in other income. Lastly, the prior year quarter benefited from $0.12 per share of other income gains.
Now let me talk about each of the segments on the next slide. In our Risk Solutions segment, organic revenue growth was 3%, operating margin increased 100 basis points to 24.2% and operating income increased 3% compared to the prior year quarter. Operating income included a $13 million unfavorable impact from FX. Excluding this impact, underlying operating income increased 6% versus the prior year quarter. Operating income margin -- operating margin improvement of 100 basis points includes a 30 basis point favorable impact from FX. Excluding the impact from FX, underlying operating margin improved 70 basis points in the quarter. Strong operating improvement in the first quarter reflects organic growth in each business, including Reinsurance, and improved return on their investments in data and analytics across the portfolio. We continue to face certain headwinds in the first quarter from an unfavorable market impact in Reinsurance and weaker economic conditions in a number of geographies. Despite these challenges, our performance in Risk Solutions reflects strong new business generation and increased operating leverage in the business. We expect continued growth and operational improvement throughout 2016 as we make progress towards our long-term operating margin target of 26%. In addition, if short-term interest rates continue to rise, we believe we have significant leverage to an improving interest rate environment as every 100 basis points rise in global interest rates should result in approximately $45 million of investment income.
Turning to the HR Solutions segment. Organic revenue growth was 2%. Operating margin decreased 140 basis points to 11.8% and operating income decreased 14% compared to the prior year quarter. Results were exactly in line with our previously provided guidance. Operating income included a $3 million unfavorable impact from FX. As mentioned previously, underlying results in the quarter included $20 million or minus 220 basis points of transaction and portfolio repositioning-related costs as we continue to drive improved return on capital for the firm. The gain relating to the sale of our recruitment process outsourcing business was recorded in other income. Strong underlying operating performance was driven by organic revenue growth in high-demand areas where we've been investing as well as expense discipline and return on our investments.
Looking forward, we expect continued growth in revenue, operating income and margin in 2016 towards our long-term target of 22% with quarterly patterning of operating income results in HR Solutions, similar to 2015. More specifically, operating income will be down in the first half and up in the second half of the year, most notably in Q4.
Now let me discuss a few of the line items outside of the operating segments on Slide 9. Unallocated expenses were $46 million compared to $47 million in the prior year quarter. Interest income was $2 million compared to $3 million in the prior year quarter. Interest expense increased $4 million to $69 million due to an increase in total debt outstanding. Other income of $18 million primarily includes gains from the sale of certain businesses, partially offset by losses through the unfavorable impact of exchange rates on the remeasurement of assets and liabilities in non-functional currencies.
Going forward, we expect a run rate of approximately $45 million per quarter of unallocated expense and $3 million per quarter of interest income. Interest expense in the second quarter is expected to be approximately $72 million or modestly higher than the first quarter due to the overlap of $750 million of notes placed in February and $500 million of notes due in May. We currently expect interest expense to decline to $70 million per quarter thereafter.
Turning to taxes. The effective tax rate on net income from continuing operations decreased to 18.4% compared to the prior year quarter at 19.1%, due to the geographic distribution of income and certain favorable discrete tax adjustments.
Lastly, average diluted shares outstanding decreased 5% to 273.7 million in the first quarter compared to 287.1 million in the prior year quarter as we effectively allocate capital and manage dilution. The company repurchased 7.7 million Class A ordinary shares for approximately $750 million in the first quarter. The company has $3.3 billion of remaining authorization under its share repurchase program. Actual shares outstanding on March 31 were 264.8 million, and there are approximately 5 million additional dilutive equivalents. Estimated Q2 2016 beginning diluted share count is approximately 270 million, subject to share price movement, share issuance and share repurchase.
Now let me turn to the next slide to highlight our solid balance sheet and strong cash flow growth on Slide 10. At March 31, 2016, cash and short-term investments were $1.1 billion. We expect levels to return to our normal run rate between $600 million to $800 million in the second quarter. Total debt outstanding was approximately $6.6 billion and total debt-to-EBITDA on a GAAP basis was 2.7x. Cash flow from operations for the first 3 months decreased 8% or $25 million to $273 million. This was primarily driven by unfavorable timing of certain tax-related items that we expect to normalize by Q2, partially offset by working capital improvements and a decline in cash paid for pensions and restructuring.
Free cash flow, as defined by cash flow from operations less CapEx, decreased 6% or $15 million to $221 million, reflecting a decline in cash flow from operations, partially offset by a $10 million decrease in CapEx.
Turning to the next slide to discuss our significant increases in free cash flow. We value the firm based on free cash flow and allocate capital to maximize free cash flow returns. Free cash flow of $2.4 billion in 2017 is not our end goal, as further long-term sustainable free cash flow will be driven by continued operating income growth and additional working capital initiatives beyond 2017. There are 4 primary areas that are expected to contribute to our near-term goal of delivering $2.4 billion or more for the full year 2017. The first is continued operational performance, driven by organic revenue growth and margin expansion; the second is working capital improvements as we focus on closing the gap between receivables and payables; the third is declining uses of cash, of pension, CapEx and restructuring, which we expect to free up more than $90 million of annual free cash flow between the end of 2015 and 2017; and fourth, lower cash tax payments reflecting a lower effective tax rate.
Turning to our pension plans. We've taken significant steps to reduce volatility and liability as we've closed plant to new entrants, frozen plan from incurring additional benefits and continued to do a risk of certain plan assets. We currently expect contributions to decline by approximately $44 million in 2016 and expect noncash pension income to be a modest benefit in 2016 versus 2015.
Regarding our restructuring program. As all charges related to the restructuring program have been incurred, we expect cash payments to decline by $9 million to approximately $19 million in 2016 and continue to decline thereafter to an immaterial amount.
In summary, we delivered solid underlying results in the first quarter. Investments in our industry-leading platform of client service capabilities across risk, retirement and health continue to position the firm for long-term revenue growth, further margin expansion and strong free cash flow generation towards our near-term goal of 2.7 -- $2.4 billion for the full year 2017.
With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to the operator for questions."

You saw it and you've seen this grow in each of the last number of years. But if you think about our confidence both in the current environment for the coming years, by the way, not just grow the business, but also improve the margins tracking toward our 26% and 22% goals in Risk and in HR Solutions. and I would just say -- listen, just as an example, this often gets linked back in the pricing on the insurance side, and we would encourage you to separate those. And just consider -- think about it from Aon standpoint, 3 sources of growth, and just taking on the risk side for a moment. Our ability to grow in the traditional business, property, casualty, D&O, all those pieces reflects a multiyear investment in something we call Aon Client Promise. It's usually helping us bring more new clients into the fray and do more with the existing clients. And as proof point for that set up, that rollout -- by the way, that's also across HR Solutions as well, look at new business in Q1. It was a record in U.S. Retail, it was a record worldwide. By the way, that's a record on top of a record. It was same in Q1 in 2015 with record levels of retention. So this is just a 94% U.S. Retail, for example, in EMEA. So these are just examples of sort of what's happening in the core business and what we're about. And we will say, by the way, as in a side, the market overall, as we look at it, is a bit -- frankly, more -- bit more stable when you think about pricing and insured values. But that's just one aspect of Aon. Another aspect is our ability to grow outside of traditional core and think about -- in this regard, just a couple of examples here. We've got 2 existing $1 billion revenue business we've invested in heavily. Affinity being one $1 billion business growing exceptionally well. Health and benefits, $1 billion business plus, also growing just proportionally well. So you've got the traditional, you've got the things outside the core I just described. And then equally exciting for us is the ability to grow in new areas where we've made some substantial investment. And just a few examples of those would be like Aon Client Treaty, I highlighted, the largest ever underwritten portfolio of risk for Lloyds; Aon Endpoint, 40-plus carriers on that platform now; Aon Review. And then finally, I would just highlight what we just did in U.S. mortgage over the last couple of years is, frankly, brought insurance capital into the mortgage market. In 2015 alone, I think that's about $3.5 billion in net new premium, $5 billion since inception. So the point being here, Sarah, this is such an important question. We believe we continue to prove the point that organic growth and margin improvement from us is not about insurance pricing or market impact, it's really about our ability to continue to invest and bring market -- bringing in the market capabilities and real products that help our clients succeed. And frankly, that engine is under our control. It's working, and it's continuing to build and a lot of the things we've invested in historically are just coming online. And you saw it also in [indiscernible] as we finished '15. In '15, we grew organically that record margins in risk, record margins in HR Solutions, record free cash flow and record EPS. That momentum in '15 carries us into '16, and it really is that engine that's driving it. So that answer your question on growth?"

But there are many other factors that influence that. As a U.K. company, we operate in territorial tax system, which has different repatriation impacts than a worldwide tax system. We're growing the geographies with declining statutory tax rates, such as the U.K., where we are domiciled, where the tax rate is currently 20%, and it's going to decline over the coming years to 17%. And so statutory tax rates are a really important part of the business decision for where we invest in building products and services. And we also leverage net operating losses where possible to decide where we invest and grow businesses. So I guess what I would say is as we think about our business going forward, our overall global capital structure, we feel, is appropriate for our business, and therefore, we feel really comfortable with our current effective tax rate for the foreseeable future."

Essentially, say, look -- and I described 3 areas around the traditional sort of areas outside the traditional and then areas related to some of the data and analytics efforts we've made around investments, and we're seeing growth in all 3 areas. Frankly, we saw growth -- and we're in all the countries. So we're 120 countries around the world. It's the most comprehensive platform out there. But we saw growth in EMEA, in Germany, in France and Italy. We -- you note the retention rates I've described before and the new business generation. So while the market conditions, we think, remain relatively stable, and again, we would say on balance, when you think about pricing and insured values, put those 2 together and call those market impact. Oftentimes, you hear about pricing. You don't hear about market impact. Market impact has as much impact as pricing. On balance, we actually think '16 looks better than '15 for our global footprint. But you saw growth across EMEA and the countries I just highlighted. You're seeing new business generation. This is in the core business, net new business generation in the U.S. and in EMEA that is literally record levels in Q1, and it was record on top of records. So the comps are extremely, extremely high. And record retention rates approaching 94%, 95%. So for us, look, we're going to keep investing around how we -- new client leadership, how we actually bring new clients in and how we serve them and serve them more comprehensively. And that's the engine we have control over, and that's the engine that's working both on the traditional side -- very much on the additional side as well as the areas like Affinity and health and benefits as well as in net new areas we're investing in beyond that."

I would note that there are slides available on our website for you to follow along with our commentary today. And consistent with previous quarters, I'd like to cover 2 areas before turning the call over to Christa for further financial review. First is our performance against key metrics we communicated to shareholders. And second is overall organic growth performance, including continued areas of strategic investment across Aon.
On the first topic, our performance versus key metrics. Each quarter, we measure our performance against the key metrics we focus on achieving over the course of the year: grow organically, expand margins, increase earnings per share and deliver free cash flow growth.
Turning to Slide 3. In the first quarter, organic revenue growth was 3% with growth across every major business, highlighted by 4% growth in each of our retail brokerage businesses and positive organic growth in Reinsurance. Operating margin increased 20 basis points, reflecting strong operating performance in Risk Solutions. EPS decreased 1% to $1.35, including a $0.10 unfavorable impact from changes in foreign currency. And finally, free cash flow was $221 million, reflecting solid underlying performance in our seasonally weakest cash flow quarter. Overall, our first quarter results reflect the strength of our industry-leading franchise and a solid start to the year with organic revenue growth across every major business, adjusted operating margin expansion, improved return on invested capital and effective allocation of capital, highlighted by the repurchase of $750 million of stock.
Turning to Slide 4, on the second topic of growth and investment. I want to spend the next few minutes discussing the quarter for both of our segments. In Risk Solutions, organic revenue growth was 3%, similar to the prior year quarter, driven by growth across all major businesses. As we've discussed previously, we're driving a set of initiatives and making strategic investments that are strengthening underlying performance and position our Risk Solution segment for long-term growth and improved operating leverage with management of our renewal book through Aon Client Promise and retention rates of more than 90% on average across Retail Brokerage, highlighted by record retention levels of nearly 94% in U.S. Retail and EMEA; new business generation of $225 million across retail brokerage, including record new business in U.S. Retail; 20 consecutive quarters of positive net new business and core treaty reinsurance; and increased operating leverage from our significant investments in innovative technology and data and analytics, including Aon InPoint, which captures over 3 million trades and $160 million of bound premium; ReView, our reinsurer dashboard combined with strategic consulting to help reinsurers be more effective capital markets for seeding company clients; and our Aon Broking initiatives to better match client need with insurer appetite for risk. A great example of our innovation in data analytics was the launch of Aon Client Treaty, the largest ever underwritten portfolio of risk in the history of Lloyd's. Since launching on January 1, we remain very excited about the positive impact of the client treaty for our largest and most sophisticated clients. We've had terrific success and feedback from clients around the world and continue to attract new clients, with the client treaty being a major differentiator. Finally, we're expanding our content and global footprint through tuck-in acquisitions that increase scale in emerging markets or expand capability.
Reflecting on the individual businesses within Risk Solutions. In the Americas, organic revenue growth was 4%, similar to the prior year quarter. Exposure has continued to be positive across the region, while the impact on pricing was negative, resulting in a relatively stable market impact overall, similar to the last 6 quarters. We saw double-digit growth in Latin America, driven by management of the renewal book portfolio with many regions delivering strong growth despite macroeconomic challenges facing the region.
In U.S. Retail, growth was driven by solid retention rates and continued record new business generation, led by a diverse portfolio of products, including health, P&C and surety. Affinity also recorded solid performance, highlighted by strong growth in the consumer solutions. In international, organic revenue growth was 4% compared to 3% in the prior year quarter. Similar to the last 6 quarters, exposures continue to be stable and the impact from pricing was modestly negative on average, driven by fragile market conditions in various countries across Europe and Asia and continued pricing pressure in the Pacific region. Results reflect strong growth in Asia, including strength in health and benefits and strong management of the renewal book portfolio. In continental Europe, we saw solid growth, driven by both new business generation and management of renewal book portfolio reflecting strong leadership across the region as the macroeconomic environment continues to stabilize. And in the Pacific, we saw continued strength in New Zealand, while Australia showed modest growth.
In Reinsurance, organic revenue growth was 1% compared to negative 1% in the prior year quarter, reflecting our previous guidance of an expected return to modest growth in 2016. Results in the quarter were primarily driven by growth in global facultative placements, heated demand in treaty and from new business generation. Results were partially offset by unfavorable market impact.
As the rate of price decline continues to moderate, capital is being deployed to new markets, including U.S. mortgage credit risk, life and annuity risk, and other emergent risks, such as cyber liability. And as highlighted in our prior discussions, new opportunities for growth, combined with industry leading data and analytics, has positioned our Reinsurance business for a return to modest growth in 2016.
Turning to HR Solutions. Organic revenue growth was 2% with growth across both businesses. We're seeing growth in high demand areas, where we have strategically invested in innovative solutions and client-serving capabilities, reflecting Aon Hewitt's leadership and in-depth understanding of market trends, including as clients manage risk against pension schemes that are frozen, largely underfunded and facing regulatory changes, solutions to derisk pension plans and support for delegated investment solutions, a strong growth area where assets under management have grown from $10 billion to roughly $85 billion in 5 years; continued investment to strengthen our industry-leading portfolio of health solutions, covering the full range of benefit strategies, client size and funding choices, including our suite of private health care exchanges. We're also investing in software-as-a-service models in our HR BPO business, where growth in new clients and conversion of existing clients is driving strong demand as well as the expansion of our capabilities to include financial implementations. And finally, we're investing in our talent rewards business, as we are seeing strong demand for data and analytics to support increasing organizational change.
Turning to the individual businesses within HR Solutions. In consulting services, organic revenue growth was 3% compared to 2% in the prior year quarter. Results in the quarter reflect continued growth in retirement consulting, primarily driven by demand for delegated investment consulting services. We also saw growth in core pension solutions, where we provide clients the best combination of expertise and execution, and modest growth in communications consulting. In outsourcing, organic revenue growth was 1% compared to 4% in the prior year quarter. The prior year quarter included certain out-of-cycle, follow-on enrollments on our retiree exchange related to a very large client implementation. Results, excluding the follow-on enrollments in the prior year, reflect strong growth in HR BPO, driven by new client wins in cloud-based solutions.
In summary, we delivered solid organic growth across every major business and strengthened our operational performance, driven by our industry-leading platform of client serving capabilities and investments in data and analytics.
With that said, I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Christa for further financial review. Christa?"
119853,330262696,967787,"Aon plc, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2016",2016-04-29,"Earnings Calls","Aon plc","Executives","Thanks so much, Greg, and good morning, everyone. As Greg noted, our first quarter results reflect a solid start to the year. We delivered organic revenue growth across both segments and delivered strong operating margin improvement in Risk Solutions. We",1587,"Thanks so much, Greg, and good morning, everyone. As Greg noted, our first quarter results reflect a solid start to the year. We delivered organic revenue growth across both segments and delivered strong operating margin improvement in Risk Solutions. We improved the return on invested capital through the disposition of certain businesses and effectively allocated capital, highlighted by the repurchase of $750 million of ordinary shares in the quarter, more share repurchase than we've done in any quarter since 2008. Strong share repurchase, coupled with recent announcement of a 10% increase to the quarterly cash dividend, reflect our long-term belief in the strengthening free cash flow of the firm.
Now let me turn to financial results for the quarter on Page 6 of the presentation. Our core EPS performance, excluding certain items, decreased 1% to $1.35 per share for the first quarter compared to $1.37 in the prior year quarter. Certain items that were adjusted for in the core EPS performance and highlighted in the schedules on Page 12 of the press release include noncash intangible asset amortization.
As we noted at the beginning of the call, we evaluate performance over the course of the year as macro factors or certain actions to strengthen underlying performance may distort results on a near-term basis.
To put the first quarter underlying EPS in context. First, we incurred unfavorable foreign currency-related impacts totaling $0.10 per share, including $0.05 per share of translation for a stronger U.S. dollar and $0.05 per share for remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities in non-functional currencies, primarily resulting from significant devaluation of the exchange rate in Venezuela. Going forward, if currency is to remain stable at today's rate, we would expect an immaterial impact for the rest of the year. Second, we took steps to further strengthen return on invested capital with the disposition of certain businesses. In HR Solutions, we incurred $0.06 per share of transaction and portfolio repositioning-related costs in connection with dispositions. These costs were more than offset by $0.10 per share of gains recorded in other income. Lastly, the prior year quarter benefited from $0.12 per share of other income gains.
Now let me talk about each of the segments on the next slide. In our Risk Solutions segment, organic revenue growth was 3%, operating margin increased 100 basis points to 24.2% and operating income increased 3% compared to the prior year quarter. Operating income included a $13 million unfavorable impact from FX. Excluding this impact, underlying operating income increased 6% versus the prior year quarter. Operating income margin -- operating margin improvement of 100 basis points includes a 30 basis point favorable impact from FX. Excluding the impact from FX, underlying operating margin improved 70 basis points in the quarter. Strong operating improvement in the first quarter reflects organic growth in each business, including Reinsurance, and improved return on their investments in data and analytics across the portfolio. We continue to face certain headwinds in the first quarter from an unfavorable market impact in Reinsurance and weaker economic conditions in a number of geographies. Despite these challenges, our performance in Risk Solutions reflects strong new business generation and increased operating leverage in the business. We expect continued growth and operational improvement throughout 2016 as we make progress towards our long-term operating margin target of 26%. In addition, if short-term interest rates continue to rise, we believe we have significant leverage to an improving interest rate environment as every 100 basis points rise in global interest rates should result in approximately $45 million of investment income.
Turning to the HR Solutions segment. Organic revenue growth was 2%. Operating margin decreased 140 basis points to 11.8% and operating income decreased 14% compared to the prior year quarter. Results were exactly in line with our previously provided guidance. Operating income included a $3 million unfavorable impact from FX. As mentioned previously, underlying results in the quarter included $20 million or minus 220 basis points of transaction and portfolio repositioning-related costs as we continue to drive improved return on capital for the firm. The gain relating to the sale of our recruitment process outsourcing business was recorded in other income. Strong underlying operating performance was driven by organic revenue growth in high-demand areas where we've been investing, as well as expense discipline and return on our investments.
Looking forward, we expect continued growth in revenue, operating income and margin in 2016 towards our long-term target of 22% with quarterly patterning of operating income results in HR Solutions, similar to 2015. More specifically, operating income will be down in the first half and up in the second half of the year, most notably in Q4.
Now let me discuss a few of the line items outside of the operating segments on Slide 9. Unallocated expenses were $46 million compared to $47 million in the prior year quarter. Interest income was $2 million compared to $3 million in the prior year quarter. Interest expense increased $4 million to $69 million due to an increase in total debt outstanding. Other income of $18 million primarily includes gains from the sale of certain businesses, partially offset by losses due to the unfavorable impact of exchange rates on the remeasurement of assets and liabilities in non-functional currencies.
Going forward, we expect a run rate of approximately $45 million per quarter of unallocated expense and $3 million per quarter of interest income. Interest expense in the second quarter is expected to be approximately $72 million or modestly higher than the first quarter due to the overlap of $750 million of notes placed in February and $500 million of notes due in May. We currently expect interest expense to decline to $70 million per quarter thereafter.
Turning to taxes. The effective tax rate on net income from continuing operations decreased to 18.4% compared to the prior year quarter at 19.1%, due to the geographic distribution of income and certain favorable discrete tax adjustments.
Lastly, average diluted shares outstanding decreased 5% to 273.7 million in the first quarter compared to 287.1 million in the prior year quarter as we effectively allocate capital and manage dilution. The company repurchased 7.7 million Class A ordinary shares for approximately $750 million in the first quarter. The company has $3.3 billion of remaining authorization under its share repurchase program. Actual shares outstanding on March 31 were 264.8 million, and there are approximately 5 million additional dilutive equivalents. Estimated Q2 2016 beginning diluted share count is approximately 270 million, subject to share price movement, share issuance and share repurchase.
Now let me turn to the next slide to highlight our solid balance sheet and strong cash flow growth on Slide 10. At March 31, 2016, cash and short-term investments were $1.1 billion. We expect levels to return to our normal run rate between $600 million to $800 million in the second quarter. Total debt outstanding was approximately $6.6 billion and total debt-to-EBITDA on a GAAP basis was 2.7x. Cash flow from operations for the first 3 months decreased 8% or $25 million to $273 million. This was primarily driven by unfavorable timing of certain tax-related items that we expect to normalize by Q2, partially offset by working capital improvements and a decline in cash paid for pensions and restructuring.
Free cash flow, as defined by cash flow from operations less CapEx, decreased 6% or $15 million to $221 million, reflecting a decline in cash flow from operations, partially offset by a $10 million decrease in CapEx.
Turning to the next slide to discuss our significant increases in free cash flow. We value the firm based on free cash flow and allocate capital to maximize free cash flow returns. Free cash flow of $2.4 billion in 2017 is not our end goal, as further long-term sustainable free cash flow will be driven by continued operating income growth and additional working capital initiatives beyond 2017. There are 4 primary areas that are expected to contribute to our near-term goal of delivering $2.4 billion or more for the full year 2017. The first is continued operational performance, driven by organic revenue growth and margin expansion; the second is working capital improvements as we focus on closing the gap between receivables and payables; the third is declining uses of cash, of pension, CapEx and restructuring, which we expect to free up more than $90 million of annual free cash flow between the end of 2015 and 2017; and fourth, lower cash tax payments reflecting a lower effective tax rate.
Turning to our pension plans. We've taken significant steps to reduce volatility and liability as we've closed plans to new entrants, frozen plan from incurring additional benefits and continued to derisk of certain plan assets. We currently expect contributions to decline by approximately $44 million in 2016 and expect noncash pension income to be a modest benefit in 2016 versus 2015.
Regarding our restructuring program. As all charges related to the restructuring program have been incurred, we expect cash payments to decline by $9 million to approximately $19 million in 2016 and continue to decline thereafter to an immaterial amount.
In summary, we delivered solid underlying results in the first quarter. Investments in our industry-leading platform of client service capabilities across risk, retirement and health continue to position the firm for long-term revenue growth, further margin expansion and strong free cash flow generation towards our near-term goal of 2.7 -- $2.4 billion for the full year 2017.
With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to the operator for questions."

You saw it and you've seen this grow in each of the last number of years. But if you think about our confidence both in the current environment for the coming years, by the way, not just grow the business, but also improve the margins tracking toward our 26% and 22% goals in Risk and in HR Solutions. and I would just say -- listen, just as an example, this often gets linked back in the pricing on the insurance side, and we would encourage you to separate those. And just consider -- think about it from Aon standpoint, 3 sources of growth, and just taking on the risk side for a moment. Our ability to grow in the traditional business, property, casualty, D&O, all those pieces reflects a multiyear investment in something we call Aon Client Promise. It's usually helping us bring more new clients into the fray and do more with the existing clients. And as proof point for that set up, that rollout -- by the way, that's also across HR Solutions as well, look at new business in Q1. It was a record in U.S. Retail, it was a record worldwide. By the way, that's a record on top of a record. It was same in Q1 in 2015 with record levels of retention. So this is just a 94% U.S. Retail, for example, in EMEA. So these are just examples of sort of what's happening in the core business and what we're about. And we will say, by the way, as in aside, the market overall, as we look at it, is a bit -- frankly, more -- bit more stable when you think about pricing and insured values. But that's just one aspect of Aon. Another aspect is our ability to grow outside of traditional core and think about -- in this regard, just a couple of examples here. We've got 2 existing $1 billion revenue business we've invested in heavily. Affinity being one $1 billion business growing exceptionally well. Health and benefits, $1 billion business plus, also growing disproportionally well. So you've got the traditional, you've got the things outside the core I just described. And then equally exciting for us is the ability to grow in new areas where we've made some substantial investment. And just a few examples of those would be like Aon Client Treaty, I highlighted, the largest ever underwritten portfolio of risk for Lloyds; Aon Endpoint, 40-plus carriers on that platform now; Aon Review. And then finally, I would just highlight what we just did in U.S. mortgage over the last couple of years is, frankly, brought insurance capital into the mortgage market. In 2015 alone, I think that's about $3.5 billion in net new premium, $5 billion since inception. So the point being here, Sarah, this is such an important question. We believe we continue to prove the point that organic growth and margin improvement from us is not about insurance pricing or market impact, it's really about our ability to continue to invest and bring market -- bringing in the market capabilities and real products that help our clients succeed. And frankly, that engine is under our control. It's working, and it's continuing to build and a lot of the things we've invested in historically are just coming online. And you saw it also in the momentum as we finished '15. In '15, we grew organically that record margins in risk, record margins in HR Solutions, record free cash flow and record EPS. That momentum in '15 carries us into '16, and it really is that engine that's driving it. So that answer your question on growth?"

We're growing the geographies with declining statutory tax rates, such as the U.K., where we are domiciled, where the tax rate is currently 20%, and it's going to decline over the coming years to 17%. And so statutory tax rates are a really important part of the business decision for where we invest and building new products and services. And we also leverage net operating losses where possible to decide where we invest and grow businesses. So I guess what I would say is as we think about our business going forward, our overall global capital structure, we feel, is appropriate for our business, and therefore, we feel really comfortable with our current effective tax rate for the foreseeable future."

We'd step back, David.

Frankly, we saw growth -- and we're in all the countries. So we're 120 countries around the world. It's the most comprehensive platform out there. But we saw growth in EMEA, in Germany, in France and Italy. We -- you note the retention rates I've described before and the new business generation. So while the market conditions, we think, remain relatively stable, and again, we would say on balance, when you think about pricing and insured values, put those 2 together and call those market impact. Oftentimes, you hear about pricing. You don't hear about market impact. Market impact has as much impact as pricing. On balance, we actually think '16 looks better than '15 for our global footprint. But you saw growth across EMEA in the countries I just highlighted. You're seeing new business generation. This is in the core business, net new business generation in the U.S. and in EMEA that is literally record levels in Q1, and it was record on top of records. So the comps are extremely, extremely high. And record new retention rates approaching 94%, 95%.

And that's the engine we have control over, and that's the engine that's working both on the traditional side -- very much on the traditional side as well as the areas like Affinity and health and benefits as well as in net new areas we're investing in beyond that."

First, we would say our first quarter performance in outsourcing is exactly consistent with when we left the year within '15. And our expectations for '16 are exactly in line with what we had expected them to be. So there has really not been changes. There's a bit of noise in the quarter, which we are going to describe it, it's exactly the same. By the way, if we just think about outsourcing growth overall and go back to '13, '14, and '15, '13 is 1%, '14 is 1%, '15 is 4%, '16 is back to 1%. It's 4% in '15 because we were very fortunate to support a very, very, very large client on a retiree exchange opportunity, and that actually skewed 2015. Absent that, the trajectory looks exactly the same. And from a growth standpoint for the year, we feel very, very good about what we're able to do, in particular, some of the things we're doing with cloud-based applications, which has been exceptionally strong underlying growth and a stronger pipeline. So top line growth, we feel very good about where we are, how we started the quarter, and no change in expectations for '16."

And we did exit the recruitment process outsourcing business, and you can see the gain of $0.10 in the other income line and then transaction and deal-related costs in the HR operating income line of $0.06, so $20 million. And that really had a minus 220 basis point impact on margin in the quarter. X that, you could see that the HR Solutions margin in the quarter would've been 14%.

The challenges on health, which are unprecedented, literally, in the U.S. and around the world, the challenges on retirement.

And as I said at the beginning to Sarah's question, the ways we're helping clients are traditional brokerage, all the different pieces around that. There are areas that are outside that as we continue to evolve and develop. By the way, that's in HR Solutions and in Risk Solutions and in areas like data and analytics, which, frankly, are opening up an entire new vista for us that we've invested in. This is not flavor of the month for us. This has been a 7-year, set of investments in which we're investing, $300 million, $400 million, $500 million over time around in data analytics and insight. So for us, we see this as a tremendous opportunity, and it's not just top line, it really is around operating performance improvement, which is why, again, we look at '16, '17, '18, it's just a continuation.

Joining me here today is our CFO, Christa Davies. I would note that there are slides available on our website for you to follow along with our commentary today.",1538,"Thank you, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter 2016 conference call. Joining me here today is our CFO, Christa Davies. I would note that there are slides available on our website for you to follow along with our commentary today. Consistent with previous quarters, I'd like to cover 2 areas before turning the call over to Christa for further financial review. First is our performance against key metrics we communicated to shareholders. Second is overall organic growth performance including continued areas of strategic investments across Aon. 
On the first topic, our performance versus key metrics. Each quarter, we measure our performance against the key metrics we focus on achieving over the course of the year, grow organically, expand margins, increase earnings per share and deliver free cash flow growth. 
Turning to Slide 3. In the second quarter, organic revenue growth was 3% highlighted by 4% growth in Retail Brokerage, with 6% growth in the international brokerage business. Operating margin increased 30 basis points reflecting strong operating performance in Risk Solutions. EPS increased 6% to $1.39, reflecting operational improvement and effective capital management. And finally, free cash flow for the 6 months increased $224 million to $660 million, driven by a 32% increase in cash flow from operations and a decline in capital expenditures. Overall, results continue to affect the strength of our industry-leading platforms in a volatile macroeconomic environment with positive performance across each of our key metrics for both the second quarter and the first 6 months of 2016. 
Turning to Slide 4, on the second topic of growth and investment. I want to spend the next few minutes discussing the quarter for both of our segments. In Risk Solutions, organic revenue growth was 3% compared to 2% in the prior year quarter, driven by growth across all major businesses. As we've discussed previously we're driving a set of initiatives making strategic investments that are strengthening underlying performance and position our Risk Solutions segment for long-term growth and improved operating leverage, with management of our renewable book portfolio for our proactive client partnership we called Aon Client Promise, which is driving retention rates of more than 90% on average across Retail Brokerage; new business generation of roughly $280 million across Retail Brokerage including double-digit growth in Asia and EMEA and another quarter of record new business in U.S. Retail; 21 consecutive quarters of positive net new business in core treaty reinsurance, an increased operating leverage from our significant investments in innovative technology and data and analytics including Aon InPoint, where we empower carriers to become more competitive, effective and operationally efficient by integrating our market-leading data and analytics with strategic consulting and access to Aon's unmatched expertise. This includes the risk Insight Platform, which now captures 3.2 million trades and more than $160 billion of bound premium; and Review, our reinsurer dashboard. 
Another example is our Aon Broking initiative to better match client need with insurer appetite for risk and to identify structured portfolio of solutions. A great example of client impact in this area was the launch of Aon Client Treaty, the largest ever underwritten portfolio of risk in the history of Lloyd's, enabling our clients to access 20% of pre-secured unique coinsurance capacity. And finally, we're expanding our content in global footprints through tuck-in acquisitions that increase scale in emerging markets and expand capability. For example, in the second quarter, we completed the acquisition of Univers, an elected benefits enrollment and communications firm, strengthening our ability to serve clients as a leading provider of comprehensive benefit solutions. 
Reflecting on our individual business within Risk Solutions. In the Americas, organic revenue growth was 2%. Exposures continue to be positive across the region while the impact from pricing was negative resulting in relatively stable market impact overall. We saw double-digit growth in Affinity, driven by growth across all product lines. In U.S. Retail, we saw a modest growth, driven by record new business generation and strong retention. Results also reflect modest growth in Latin America, driven by new business generation despite macroeconomic challenges facing the region. In international, organic revenue growth was 6% compared to 2% in the prior year quarter. The impact from pricing remains negative on average, driven by fragile market conditions in various countries across Europe and Asia and continued pricing pressure in the Pacific region while exposures are modestly improving. 
Results reflect solid growth across every major regions including EMEA, Asia and the Pacific, driven by strength in both new business generation and management of renewal book portfolio. In Continental Europe, we delivered the highest organic revenue growth in over 6 years, with growth across all product lines including health and benefits, Affinity and Retail, reflecting Aon's strength in client leadership across the region despite macroeconomic environment that remains challenged in many countries. 
In Reinsurance, organic revenue growth was 1% compared to a negative 1% in the prior year quarter. This marks the third consecutive quarter of positive growth in Reinsurance, further reflecting our previous guidance of an expected return to modest growth in 2016. Results in the quarter were primarily driven by growth in global facultative placements, [indiscernible] demand in treaty and from new business generation. Results were partially offset by an unfavorable market impact internationally. 
As the rate of price declines continue to moderate, capital is being deployed to new markets including U.S. mortgage credit risk, life and annuity risk and other emerging risks such as cyber liability. And as highlighted in our prior discussions, new business opportunities for growth, combined with industry-leading data and analytics, has positioned our Reinsurance business for return to modest growth in 2016. 
Turning to HR Solutions. Organic revenue growth was 1% overall as growth across high-demand areas where we continue to invest was partially offset by a modest decline in benefits administration and unfavorable timing. We continue to strengthen our industry-leading platform with investments in innovative solutions and client-serving capabilities that reflect Aon Hewitt's leadership and in-depth understanding of market trends including solutions to help plan sponsors both manage expansion risk and drive better retirement outcomes for their employees. A strong area of growth has been delegated in investment consulting, where assets under management have grown from $10 billion to roughly $85 billion in 5 years. We expect continued global growth in this area our sponsors are faced with regulatory changes and increasingly complex global markets. 
Continued investments to strengthen our industry-leading position of health solutions, covering the full range of benefit strategies, client size and funding choices including our suite of private health care exchanges. We continue to see strong and steady growth across our entire suite of exchange solutions for companies of all sizes and industries. Starbucks recently joined a growing list of employers on our active health care exchange. We feel proud to help Starbucks introduce a new health solution that enables Starbucks U.S. employees to have greater choice, opportunities for cost savings and personalized support to select and get the most out of their health insurance coverage. Starbucks decision's to adopt a consumer-driven approach to help benefits underscores the sustainability of our exchange model and proven results that our exchange has achieved on behalf of clients over the past several years. 
We also continue to invest in software-as-a-service models in our HR BPO business where growth in new clients and conversion of existing clients is driving strong demand as well as the expansion of our capabilities to include financial implementations. And finally, we're investing in data and analytics in our health and talent and rewards businesses to provide superior advice to drive better outcomes for our clients and our clients' employees. 
Turning to the individual businesses within HR Solutions. In Consulting Services, organic revenue growth was 1%. Results reflect growth in core pension solutions where we provide clients an in-depth approach to pension risk management and the best solutions to take advantage of the market shift from defined benefit to defined contribution. We also saw continued growth in retirement consulting, primarily driven by demand for delegating investment Consulting Services as increasing number of clients find significant value in Aon's ability to provide advice and manage the retirement assets. Results in the quarter were partially offset by unfavorable timing of revenue and our competition consulting practice. 
In outsourcing, organic revenue growth was flat versus the prior year quarter. We saw strong growth continue in HR BPO, driven by new client wins in cloud-based solutions. Results in the quarter offset by a modest decline in benefits administration as well as a decline in project-related work around lump sum Windows for pension plans that created and unfavorable comparison in the prior year quarter. 
Overall, in HR Solutions, we expect to deliver improved organic growth in the second half of the year, driven primarily by growth in high demand areas where we've been investing, a modest benefit from revenue timing that impacted this quarter and seasonal strength in the fourth quarter. 
In summary, for both the second quarter and the first 6 months, we delivered solid organic revenue growth against the volatile macroeconomic environment, improved operational performance and generated substantial free cash flow. 
With that said, I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Christa for further financial review. Christa?"

As Greg noted, against the continued volatility in the macroeconomic environment, our industry-leading platform delivered solid progress in the first half of the year, with positive performance across each of our 4 key metrics. Results reflect organic growth in both segments, strong operating margin expansion to Risk Solutions and substantial free cash flow generation. 
Now let me turn to financial results for the quarter on Page 6 of the presentation. Our core EPS performance excluding certain items increased 6% to $1.39 per share for the second quarter compared to $1.31 in the prior year quarter. Certain items that were adjusted for in the core EPS performance and highlighted in the schedules on Page 12 of the press release include noncash intangible asset amortization and noncash expenses related to certain pension settlements. 
There was no material impact on earnings per share related to foreign currency translation in the second quarter. If currency would remain stable at today's rate, we would expect foreign currency translation to have no material impact going forward. 
Now let me talk about each of the segments on the next slide. In our Risk Solutions segment, organic revenue growth was 3%. Operating margin increased 70 basis points to 24.9% and operating income increased 3% compared to the prior year quarter. Operating margin improvement of 70 basis points includes a 50 basis point favorable impact from foreign currency translation. Excluding the impact from foreign currency, underlying operating margin improved 20 basis points in the quarter. Operating improvement in the second quarter reflects organic growth in each business including Reinsurance and improved returns on our investments in data and analytics across the portfolio. For the first 6 months, operating margin improved 80 basis points including a 40 basis point favorable impact from foreign currency translation. Our performance in the first half firmly positions Risk Solutions segment for further margin expansions with our long-term target of 26%. With normal seasonal weakness in Q3 and seasonal strength in Q4, we expect the strongest second half of the year for Risk Solutions. Included in our expectation are 2 underlying adjustments. We expect certain kind revenue to shift from Q3 into Q4 and we expect to shift in certain underlying compensation expense from Q4 into Q3. As a result, we expect normal quarterly tightening [ph] to be more pronounced this year, with modest operating income growth in Q3, significant operating income growth in Q4 and no change to the full year expected performance. 
Turning to the HR Solutions segment. Organic revenue growth was 1%. Operating margin decreased 40 basis points to 12.8% and operating income decreased 8% compared to the prior year quarter. For the first 6 months, operating margin decreased 90 basis points and operating income decreased 11%. Reported results are in line with our previous guidance of flat to down in the first half. Performance was primarily driven by investments for our future growth, timing of certain revenues in our compensation consulting business and an anticipated reduction in operating income reflecting the disposal of 2 businesses in previous quarters. While we continue to reduce certain expenses that supported those noncore businesses, the monetization of those businesses in previous quarters generate other income gains and cash proceeds that will ultimately be deployed to higher return on invested capital opportunities. Looking forward, in line with our previous guidance for HR Solutions, we expect a strong second half of the year. This expectation reflects normal seasonality in Q4 -- sorry, of Q3 of relatively flat operating income growth and normal seasonal strength in Q4 of significant operating income growth, with full year results continuing to deliver solid organic revenue growth further margin expansion towards our long-term operating margin target of 22% and increased operating income for the full year. 
Now let me discuss a few of the line items outside of the operating segments on Slide 9. Unallocated expenses were $43 million compared to $41 million in the prior year quarter. Interest income was $3 million compared to $4 million in the prior year quarter. Interest expense increased $5 million to $73 million due to an overlap of long-term debt placed in the first quarter with debt that matured in the second quarter. Other income was immaterial as the losses on certain long-term investments and foreign exchange hedging programs were offset by the sale of a certain business. Going forward, we expect a run rate of approximately $45 million per quarter of unallocated expense, $3 million per quarter of interest income and $71 million per quarter of interest expense. 
Turning to taxes. The adjusted effective tax rate on that income from continuing operations, excluding the applicable tax impact associated with noncash pension settlements, decreased to 17.4% compared to 18% in the prior year quarter. This was driven by changes in the geographic distribution of income and certain favorable discrete tax adjustments. The prior year quarter adjusted effective tax rate excluded the applicable tax impact associated with expenses related to legacy litigation. Lastly, average diluted shares outstanding decreased 6% to 269.8 [ph] million in the second quarter compared to 286.7 million in the prior year quarter driven by share repurchase in previous quarters. The company did not repurchase shares in the second quarter. Strong cash flow generation was used in the near term for $500 million of debt that matured in the quarter and an attractive acquisition in the quarter in the elective benefits space. We expect to return deploying capital to share repurchases in the second half of the year, reflecting our highest return on invested capital. The company has $3.3 billion remaining authorization under its share repurchase program. Actual sales outstanding on June 30 was 265.8 million and there are approximately 5 million additional dilution [ph] equivalents. Estimated Q3 2016 beginning diluted share count is approximately 271 million, subject to share price movement, share issuance and share repurchase. 
Now let me turn to the next slide to highlight our solid balance sheet and strong cash flow growth on Slide 10. At June 30, 2016, cash and short-term investments were $689 million. Total debt outstanding declined to approximately $6.2 billion and a total debt-to-EBITDA on a GAAP basis declined to 2.4x reflecting the extinguishment of $500 million of debt that came due in the quarter. Cash flow from operations for the first 6 months increased 32% or $186 million with $764 million, driven by an increase in net income, a decrease in cash tax payments, a decline in cash paid to pension contributions and underlying working capital improvements. Strong progress in the first 6 months of the year. Free cash flow is defined by cash flow from operations less CapEx, increased 51% or $224 million to $660 million reflecting strong growth in cash flow from operations and a $38 million decrease in CapEx. Looking forward, we expect to deliver double-digit free cash flow growth for the full year 2016 and are firmly on track to deliver against our near-term goal of $2.4 billion of free cash flow for the full year 2017. 
Turning to the next slide to discuss our significant increases in free cash flow. We value the firm based on free cash flow and allocate capital to maximize of free cash flow returns. Free cash flow of $2.4 billion in 2017 is not our end goal as further long-term sustainable free cash flow will be driven by continued operating income growth and additional working capital initiatives beyond 2017. There are 4 primary areas that are expected to contribute to our near-term goal of delivering $2.4 billion or more for the full year 2017. The first is continued operational performance driven by organic revenue growth and margin expansion. The second is working capital improvement as we focus on closing the gap between receivables and payables. We've made substantial progress in this area over the last 5 years with further opportunity to increase free cash flow by over $500 million. Third is declining uses of cash for pension contributions, CapEx and restructuring which, we expect to free up more than $90 million of annual free cash flow between the end of 2015 and 2017. And fourth, lower cash tax payments reflecting a lower effective tax rate. 
Turning to our pension plans. We continue to take significant steps to reduce volatility and liability. In the first half of 2016, we completed 2 transactions to materially derisk our pension liabilities in the U.K. The first was a buy-in completed with assets in the trough to reduce the size of our largest risk within certain U.K. pension scheme. And secondly, for a lump sum offering, Aon was able to reduce interest rate investment and longevity risk associated with certain U.K. pension liabilities. These transactions resulted in $62 million of noncash settlement charges and related advisory fees which were adjusted for in our second quarter results. Both of these transactions were completed prior to the Brexit vote as a continuation of our derisking efforts. As a result, our U.K. pension scheme funding spaces remain relatively flat through the Brexit results, [indiscernible] recent forward in the U.K. interest rates and market volatility. Further, we expect pension contributions to decline by approximately $44 million in 2016 and expect noncash pension income excluding the expenses related to the described transactions to be a modest benefit in 2016 versus 2015. 
In summary, we delivered solid results for the second quarter and the first 6 months of 2016 and continue to take certain steps to strengthen the return on invested capital and free cash flow. Against continued volatility in the macroeconomic environment, we expect improved organic revenue growth and operational performance in the second half of 2016, primarily driven by seasonal strength in Q4. Our industry-leading platform and innovative investments across data and analytics continue to position the firm for long-term growth. Increased operational leverage and substantial free cash flow generation was our near-term goal of $2.4 billion for the full year 2017. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call back to the operator for questions."

We've also talked about some of the other areas in investment outside of the traditional areas and we highlighted a couple on the last call. There are $1 billion-plus businesses in Affinity and health care benefits that are growing substantially. And then Aon InPoint is another example really outside the core in which we made substantial investment, and Aon InPoint really is bringing together what is a very unique and the single biggest repository of insurance information that exist in the world today and pulling this together on behalf of our clients. In this case, they have to be insurance carriers. We got 45-plus carious who are involved right now and we're helping them think about how they improve their business, grow their business overall. We haven't talked about the size. But what I would say is, this has been very positive for us in terms of supporting carriers, strengthening the overall position. It is another example of how we use data and analytics as a core and cornerstone piece of what we do. So for us, it's just another example of where we're investing to grow the business. By the way, not only do we have Aon InPoint, now we also have something called Aon Review, which is doing the same thing on the reinsurance inside. We've actually taken the data and analytics approach that really underpins Aon InPoint and use it as part of our U.S. mortgage effort that's by the way reached $5 billion-plus in premium since its inception, which is a great accomplishment and things like try Aon Client Treaty.

And what you can see if you divide receivables by revenue on our balance sheet is that day sales outstanding has come down substantially and so it's taking off less time to collect cash from customers and so we are getting more in line with what we think our professional services firm should be, which is working capital neutral. And today, if you look at our days payables and our days sales outstanding, there is a 15-day negative gap, and we believe that should be neutral. And the difference between that is the extra $500 million of free cash flow I mentioned.

Joining me here today is our CFO, Christa Davies. I would note that there are slides available on our website for you to follow along with our commentary today.",1541,"Thank you, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter 2016 conference call. Joining me here today is our CFO, Christa Davies. I would note that there are slides available on our website for you to follow along with our commentary today. Consistent with previous quarters, I'd like to cover 2 areas before turning the call over to Christa for further financial review. First is our performance against key metrics we communicate to shareholders. Second is overall organic growth performance, including continued areas of strategic investment across Aon. 
On the first topic, our performance versus key metrics. Each quarter, we measure our performance against the key metrics we focus on achieving over the course of the year: grow organically, expand margins, increase earnings per share and deliver free cash flow growth. 
Turning to Slide 3. In the second quarter, organic revenue growth was 3% highlighted by 4% growth in Retail Brokerage, with 6% growth in the international brokerage business. Operating margin increased 30 basis points, reflecting strong operating performance in Risk Solutions. EPS increased 6% to $1.39, reflecting operational improvement and effective capital management. And finally, free cash flow for the 6 months increased $224 million to $660 million, driven by a 32% increase in cash flow from operations and a decline in capital expenditures. Overall, results continue to reflect the strength of our industry-leading platform in a volatile macroeconomic environment with positive performance across each of our key metrics for both the second quarter and the first 6 months of 2016. 
Turning to Slide 4, on the second topic of growth and investment. I want to spend the next few minutes discussing the quarter for both of our segments. In Risk Solutions, organic revenue growth was 3% compared to 2% in the prior year quarter, driven by growth across all major businesses. As we've discussed previously, we're driving a set of initiatives and making strategic investments that are strengthening underlying performance and position our Risk Solutions segment for long-term growth and improved operating leverage, with management of our renewable book portfolio for our proactive client partnership we call Aon Client Promise, which is driving retention rates of more than 90% on average across Retail Brokerage; new business generation of roughly $280 million across Retail Brokerage including double-digit growth in Asia and EMEA and another quarter of record new business in U.S. Retail; 21 consecutive quarters of positive net new business in core treaty reinsurance; and increased operating leverage from our significant investments in innovative technology and data and analytics, including Aon InPoint, where we empower carriers to become more competitive, effective and operationally efficient by integrating our market-leading data and analytics with strategic consulting and access to Aon's unmatched expertise. This includes the risk Insight Platform, which now captures 3.2 million trades and more than $160 billion of bound premium; and Review, our reinsurer dashboard. 
Another example is our Aon Broking initiative to better match client need with insurer appetite for risk and to identify structured portfolio of solutions. A great example of client impact in this area was the launch of Aon Client Treaty, the largest ever underwritten portfolio of risk in the history of Lloyd's, enabling our clients to access 20% of pre-secured unique coinsurance capacity. And finally, we're expanding our content in global footprints through tuck-in acquisitions that increase scale in emerging markets and expand capability. For example, in the second quarter, we completed the acquisition of Univers, an elected-benefits enrollment and communications firm, strengthening our ability to serve clients as a leading provider of comprehensive benefit solutions. 
Reflecting on our individual business within Risk Solutions. In the Americas, organic revenue growth was 2%. Exposures continue to be positive across the region, while the impact from pricing was negative, resulting in relatively stable market impact overall. We saw double-digit growth in Affinity, driven by growth across all product lines. 
In U.S. Retail, we saw a modest growth, driven by record new business generation and strong retention. Results also reflect modest growth in Latin America, driven by new business generation despite macroeconomic challenges facing the region. In international, organic revenue growth was 6% compared to 2% in the prior year quarter. The impact from pricing remains negative on average, driven by fragile market conditions in various countries across Europe and Asia and continued pricing pressure in the Pacific region while exposures are modestly improving. 
Results reflect solid growth across every major region including EMEA, Asia and the Pacific, driven by strength in both new business generation and management of renewal book portfolio. In Continental Europe, we delivered the highest organic revenue growth in over 6 years, with growth across all product lines, including health and benefits, Affinity and Retail, reflecting Aon's strength in client leadership across the region despite macroeconomic environment that remains challenged in many countries. 
In Reinsurance, organic revenue growth was 1% compared to a negative 1% in the prior year quarter. This marks the third consecutive quarter of positive growth in Reinsurance, further reflecting our previous guidance of an expected return to modest growth in 2016. Results in the quarter were primarily driven by growth in global facultative placements, keen demand in treaty and from new business generation. Results were partially offset by an unfavorable market impact internationally. 
As the rate of price declines continue to moderate, capital is being deployed to new markets, including U.S. mortgage credit risk, life and annuity risk and other emerging risks, such as cyber liability. And as highlighted in our prior discussions, new business opportunities for growth, combined with industry-leading data and analytics, has positioned our Reinsurance business for return to modest growth in 2016. 
Turning to HR Solutions. Organic revenue growth was 1% overall as growth across high-demand areas where we continue to invest was partially offset by a modest decline in benefits administration and unfavorable timing. We continue to strengthen our industry-leading platform with investments in innovative solutions and client-serving capabilities that reflect Aon Hewitt's leadership and in-depth understanding of market trends including solutions to help plan sponsors both manage pension risk and drive better retirement outcomes for their employees. A strong area of growth has been delegated in investment consulting, where assets under management have grown from $10 billion to roughly $85 billion in 5 years. We expect continued global growth in this area as sponsors are faced with regulatory changes and increasingly complex global markets. 
Continued investments to strengthen our industry-leading position of health solutions, covering the full range of benefit strategies, client size and funding choices, including our suite of private health care exchanges. We continue to see strong and steady growth across our entire suite of exchange solutions for companies of all sizes and industries. Starbucks recently joined a growing list of employers on our active health care exchange. We are proud to help Starbucks introduce a new health solution that enables Starbucks U.S. employees to have greater choice, opportunities for cost savings and personalized support to select and get the most out of their health insurance coverage. Starbucks decision's to adopt a consumer-driven approach to help benefits underscore the sustainability of our exchange model and proven results that our exchange has achieved on behalf of clients over the past several years. 
We also continue to invest in software-as-a-service models in our HR BPO business, where growth in new clients and conversion of existing clients is driving strong demand as well as the expansion of our capabilities to include financial implementations. And finally, we're investing in data and analytics in our health and talent and rewards businesses to provide superior advice to drive better outcomes for our clients and our clients' employees. 
Turning to the individual businesses within HR Solutions. In Consulting Services, organic revenue growth was 1%. Results reflect growth in core pension solutions where we provide clients an in-depth approach to pension risk management and the best solutions to take advantage of the market shift from defined benefit to defined contribution. We also saw a continued growth in retirement consulting, primarily driven by demand for delegating investment Consulting Services as an increasing number of clients find significant value in Aon's ability to provide advice and manage the retirement assets. Results in the quarter were partially offset by unfavorable timing of revenue and our competition consulting practice. 
In outsourcing, organic revenue growth was flat versus the prior year quarter. We saw strong growth continue in HR BPO, driven by new client wins in cloud-based solutions. Results in the quarter were offset by a modest decline in benefits administration as well as a decline in project-related work around lump sum Windows for pension plans that created an unfavorable comparison in the prior year quarter. 
Overall, in HR Solutions, we expect to deliver improved organic growth in the second half of the year, driven primarily by growth in high demand areas where we've been investing, a modest benefit from revenue timing that impacted this quarter and seasonal strength in the fourth quarter. 
In summary, for both the second quarter and the first 6 months, we delivered solid organic revenue growth against a volatile macroeconomic environment, improved operational performance and generated substantial free cash flow. 
With that said, I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Christa for further financial review. Christa?"

As Greg noted, against the continued volatility in the macroeconomic environment, our industry-leading platform delivered solid progress in the first half of the year, with positive performance across",1667,"Thank you very much, Greg, and good morning, everyone. As Greg noted, against the continued volatility in the macroeconomic environment, our industry-leading platform delivered solid progress in the first half of the year, with positive performance across each of our 4 key metrics. Results reflect organic growth in both segments, strong operating margin expansion in Risk Solutions and substantial free cash flow generation. 
Now let me turn to the financial results for the quarter on Page 6 of the presentation. Our core EPS performance, excluding certain items, increased 6% to $1.39 per share for the second quarter compared to $1.31 in the prior year quarter. Certain items that were adjusted for in the core EPS performance and highlighted in the schedules on Page 12 of the press release include noncash intangible asset amortization and noncash expenses related to certain pension settlements.  There was no material impact on earnings per share related to foreign currency translation in the second quarter. If currency would remain stable at today's rate, we would expect foreign currency translation to have no material impact going forward. 
Now let me talk about each of the segments on the next slide. In our Risk Solutions segment, organic revenue growth was 3%. Operating margin increased 70 basis points to 24.9%, and operating income increased 3% compared to the prior year quarter. Operating margin improvement of 70 basis points includes a 50 basis point favorable impact from foreign currency translation. Excluding the impact from foreign currency, underlying operating margin improved 20 basis points in the quarter. Operating improvement in the second quarter reflect organic growth in each business, including Reinsurance, and improved returns on our investments in data and analytics across the portfolio. For the first 6 months, operating margin improved 80 basis points, including a 40 basis point favorable impact from foreign currency translation. Our performance in the first half firmly positions Risk Solutions segment for further margin expansions with our long-term target of 26%. With normal seasonal weakness in Q3 and seasonal strength in Q4, we expect the strongest second half of the year for Risk Solutions. Included in our expectation are 2 underlying adjustments. We expect certain client revenue to shift from Q3 into Q4, and we expect to shift in certain underlying compensation expense from Q4 into Q3. As a result, we expect normal quarterly [indiscernible] to be more pronounced this year, with modest operating income growth in Q3, significant operating income growth in Q4 and no change to the full year expected performance. 
Turning to the HR Solutions segment. Organic revenue growth was 1%. Operating margin decreased 40 basis points to 12.8%, and operating income decreased 8% compared to the prior year quarter. For the first 6 months, operating margin decreased 90 basis points and operating income decreased 11%. Reported results are in line with our previous guidance of flat to down in the first half. Performance was primarily driven by investments for future growth, timing of certain revenue in our compensation consulting business and an anticipated reduction in operating income reflecting the disposal of 2 businesses in previous quarters. While we continue to reduce certain expenses that supported those noncore businesses, the monetization of those businesses in previous quarters generated other income gains and cash proceeds that will ultimately be deployed for higher return on invested capital opportunity. Looking forward, in line with our previous guidance for HR Solutions, we expect a strong second half of the year. This expectation reflects normal seasonality in Q4 -- sorry, of Q3, of relatively flat operating income growth and normal seasonal strength in Q4 of significant operating income growth, with full year results continuing to deliver solid organic revenue growth, further margin expansion towards our long-term operating margin target of 22% and increased operating income for the full year. 
Now let me discuss a few of the line items outside of the operating segments on Slide 9. Unallocated expenses were $43 million compared to $41 million in the prior year quarter. Interest income was $3 million compared to $4 million in the prior year quarter. Interest expense increased $5 million to $73 million due to an overlap of long-term debt placed in the first quarter with debt that matured in the second quarter. Other income was immaterial, as the losses on certain long-term investments and foreign exchange hedging programs were offset by the sale of a certain business. Going forward, we expect a run rate of approximately $45 million per quarter of unallocated expense, $3 million per quarter of interest income and $71 million per quarter of interest expense. 
Turning to taxes. The adjusted effective tax rate on that income from continuing operations, excluding the applicable tax impact associated with noncash pension settlements, decreased to 17.4% compared to 18% in the prior year quarter. This was driven by changes in the geographic distribution of income and certain favorable discrete tax adjustments. The prior year quarter adjusted effective tax rate excluded the applicable tax impact associated with expenses related to legacy litigation. Lastly, average diluted shares outstanding decreased 6%, 269.8 million in the second quarter compared to 286.7 million in the prior year quarter driven by share repurchase in previous quarters. The company did not repurchase shares in the second quarter. Strong cash flow generation was used in the near term for $500 million of debt that matured in the quarter and an attractive acquisition in the quarter in the elective benefits space. We expect to return to deploying capital to share repurchases in the second half of the year, reflecting our highest return on invested capital. The company has $3.3 billion remaining authorization under its share repurchase program. Actual shares outstanding on June 30 was 265.8 million, and there are approximately 5 million additional dilutive equivalents. Estimated Q3 2016 beginning diluted share count is approximately 271 million, subject to share price movement, share issuance and share repurchase. 
Now let me turn to the next slide to highlight our solid balance sheet and strong cash flow growth on Slide 10. At June 30, 2016, cash and short-term investments were $689 million. Total debt outstanding declined to approximately $6.2 billion and a total debt-to-EBITDA on a GAAP basis declined 2.4x reflecting the extinguishment of $500 million of debt that came during the quarter. Cash flow from operations for the first 6 months increased 32% or $186 million with $764 million, driven by an increase in net income, a decrease in cash tax payments, a decline in cash paid to pension contributions and underlying working capital improvements. Strong progress in the first 6 months of the year. Free cash flow is defined by cash flow from operations less CapEx, increased 51% or $224 million to $660 million reflecting strong growth in cash flow from operations and a $38 million decrease in CapEx. Looking forward, we expect to deliver double-digit free cash flow growth for the full year 2016 and are firmly on track to deliver against our near-term goal of $2.4 billion of free cash flow for the full year 2017. 
Turning to the next slide to discuss our significant increases in free cash flow. We value the firm based on free cash flow and allocate capital to maximize free cash flow returns. Free cash flow of $2.4 billion in 2017 is not our end goal, as further long-term sustainable free cash flow will be driven by continued operating income growth and additional working capital initiatives beyond 2017. There are 4 primary areas that are expected to contribute to our near-term goal of delivering $2.4 billion or more for the full year 2017. The first is continued operational performance driven by organic revenue growth and margin expansion. The second is working capital improvement as we focus on closing the gap between receivables and payables. We've made substantial progress in this area over the last 5 years with further opportunity to increase free cash flow by over $500 million. Third is declining uses of cash for pension contributions, CapEx and restructuring, which we expect to free up more than $90 million of annual free cash flow between the end of 2015 and 2017. And fourth, lower cash tax payments reflecting a lower effective tax rate. 
Turning to our pension plans. We continue to take significant steps to reduce volatility and liability. In the first half of 2016, we completed 2 transactions to materially derisk our pension liabilities in the U.K. The first was a buy-in completed with assets in the trough to reduce the size of our largest risk within certain U.K. pension schemes. And secondly, for a lump sum offering, Aon was able to reduce interest rate investment and longevity risk associated with certain U.K. pension liabilities. These transactions resulted in $62 million of noncash settlement charges and related advisory fees which were adjusted for in our second quarter results. Both of these transactions were completed prior to the Brexit vote as a continuation of our derisking efforts. As a result, our U.K. pension scheme funding spaces remained relatively flat through the Brexit results, despite the recent fall in the U.K. interest rates and market volatility. Further, we expect pension contributions to decline by approximately $44 million in 2016 and expect noncash pension income, excluding the expenses related to the described transactions, to be a modest benefit in 2016 versus 2015. 
In summary, we delivered solid results for the second quarter and the first 6 months of 2016 and continue to take certain steps to strengthen the return on invested capital and free cash flow. Against continued volatility in the macroeconomic environment, we expect improved organic revenue growth and operational performance in the second half of 2016, primarily driven by seasonal strength in Q4. Our industry-leading platform and innovative investments across data and analytics continue to position the firm for long-term growth. Increased operational leverage and substantial free cash flow generation was our near-term goal of $2.4 billion for the full year 2017. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call back to the operator for questions."

So that's really what you're seeing trending here. That's amplified a little bit by some timing that Christa highlighted, but this is just for us a natural evolution. The real piece here is our expectation of -- the year stays exactly the same. There's absolutely no change in terms of sort of what we are thinking about, and have been thinking about, for the first 6 months, and in fact, feel good about the trends against that. We see what the pipeline looks like. We see how it's going to evolve. And as I said before, it's really just -- if you think about some of the work we've done on HR BPO and in Cloud, it's just more of a fourth quarter business than it is -- than we've seen historically. And then on the risk side, same piece. We expect a stronger second half than that we saw in the first half and continued growth in the overall business. So no change for the year."

And then, can you help us try and dilute a little bit on HR Solutions? I know the portfolio of repositioning changed a little bit of, perhaps, the base. And so margin's down 30 basis points year-over-year, but I think last quarter, there was -- you guys started to give us some facts and figures about how much the portfolio repositioning changed the underlying margin base.

And therefore, we expect in Risk Solutions, strong organic revenue growth, margin expansion, operating income growth for the full year 2016. In terms of HR Solutions, I would note, as you said, there is an impact, if you look at the first half of the year in terms of the divestitures, and that's having an impact of about $6 million in terms of lost operating income in the first half of the year. And obviously, there's some stranded costs associated with those divestitures, which is really why we originally gave guidance in HR Solutions, which is down in the first half, up in the second half. And what you're really seeing in the second half is, we're working through exiting those stranded costs in Q3 and that's why Q4 will be stronger than Q3."

We look through everything out in the world through the lens of our clients. And obviously, there is a lot of uncertainty. Our clients are going through a lot of questions, both in the region but also globally in terms of what the impact is going to be, and we are very vigilant. We spend a great deal of time with our clients on the trade-offs and issues in areas that they're trying to address in the context of it. And you've watched that evolve as like we do, and we think that there will continue to be uncertainty. As it relates to Aon, the second part. For us, Brexit is, like all things that involve client uncertainty is, an opportunity to help clients understand the situation and take actions to improve their positions. And Brexit's proven to be just that for us, both on the HR Solutions side as well as on the risk side. So from a financial impact or from our standpoint, this is really an opportunity to help and support clients. And as I've said before, they're facing a lot of uncertainty. We want to help them address that."

There's an offsetting impact in the consulting business that is negative, but net-net, it's a benefit. And the only other impact I think I did previously address was interest rates. I think we've had a number of questions from people on interest rates and the impact of that on our pensions, and as I said, it's immaterial."

We've also talked about some of the other areas in investment outside of the traditional areas, and we highlighted a couple on the last call. There are $1 billion-plus businesses in Affinity and health and benefits that are growing substantially. And then Aon InPoint is another example really outside the core in which we made substantial investment, and Aon InPoint really is bringing together what is a very unique and the single biggest repository of insurance information that exists in the world today and pulling this together on behalf of our clients. In this case, they happen to be insurance carriers. We've got 45-plus carriers who are involved right now and we're helping them think about how they improve their business, grow their business overall. We haven't talked about the size.

And what you can see if you divide receivables by revenue on our balance sheet is that days sales outstanding has come down substantially, and so it's taking us less time to collect cash from customers, and so we are getting more in line with what we think our professional services firm should be, which is working capital neutral. And today, if you looked at our days payables and our days sales outstanding, there is a 15-day negative gap, and we believe that should be neutral.

Joining me here today is our CFO, Christa Davies. I would note that there are slides available on our website for you to follow along with our commentary today.",1542,"Thank you, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter 2016 conference call. Joining me here today is our CFO, Christa Davies. I would note that there are slides available on our website for you to follow along with our commentary today. Consistent with previous quarters, I'd like to cover 2 areas before turning the call over to Christa for further financial review. First is our performance against key metrics we communicate to shareholders. Second is overall organic growth performance, including continued areas of strategic investment across Aon. 
On the first topic, our performance versus key metrics. Each quarter, we measure our performance against the key metrics we focus on achieving over the course of the year: grow organically, expand margins, increase earnings per share and deliver free cash flow growth. 
Turning to Slide 3. In the second quarter, organic revenue growth was 3% highlighted by 4% growth in Retail Brokerage, with 6% growth in the International brokerage business. Operating margin increased 30 basis points, reflecting strong operating performance in Risk Solutions. EPS increased 6% to $1.39, reflecting operational improvement and effective capital management. And finally, free cash flow for the 6 months increased $224 million to $660 million, driven by a 32% increase in cash flow from operations and a decline in capital expenditures. Overall, results continue to reflect the strength of our industry-leading platform in a volatile macroeconomic environment with positive performance across each of our key metrics for both the second quarter and the first 6 months of 2016. 
Turning to Slide 4, on the second topic of growth and investment. I want to spend the next few minutes discussing the quarter for both of our segments. In Risk Solutions, organic revenue growth was 3% compared to 2% in the prior year quarter, driven by growth across all major businesses. As we've discussed previously, we're driving a set of initiatives and making strategic investments that are strengthening underlying performance and position our Risk Solutions segment for long-term growth and improved operating leverage, with management of our renewable book portfolio through our proactive client partnership we call Aon Client Promise, which is driving retention rates of more than 90% on average across Retail Brokerage. New business generation of roughly $280 million across Retail Brokerage including double-digit growth in Asia and EMEA and another quarter of record new business in U.S. Retail. 21 consecutive quarters of positive net new business in core treaty reinsurance, and increased operating leverage from our significant investments in innovative technology and data and analytics, including Aon InPoint, where we empower carriers to become more competitive, effective and operationally efficient by integrating our market-leading data and analytics with strategic consulting and access to Aon's unmatched expertise. This includes the risk Insight Platform, which now captures 3.2 million trades and more than $160 billion of bound premium, and Review, our reinsurer dashboard. 
Another example is our Aon Broking initiative to better match client need with insurer appetite for risk and to identify a structured portfolio of solutions. A great example of client impact in this area was the launch of Aon Client Treaty, the largest ever underwritten portfolio of risk in the history of Lloyd's, enabling our clients to access 20% of pre-secured unique coinsurance capacity. And finally, we're expanding our content in global footprints through tuck-in acquisitions that increase scale in emerging markets and expand capability. For example, in the second quarter, we completed the acquisition of Univers, an elected-benefits enrollment and communications firm, strengthening our ability to serve clients as a leading provider of comprehensive benefit solutions. 
Reflecting on our individual businesses within Risk Solutions. In the Americas, organic revenue growth was 2%. Exposures continue to be positive across the region, while the impact from pricing was negative, resulting in relatively stable market impact overall. We saw double-digit growth in Affinity, driven by growth across all product lines. 
In U.S. Retail, we saw a modest growth, driven by record new business generation and strong retention. Results also reflect modest growth in Latin America, driven by new business generation despite macroeconomic challenges facing the region. In International, organic revenue growth was 6% compared to 2% in the prior year quarter. The impact from pricing remains negative on average, driven by fragile market conditions in various countries across Europe and Asia and continued pricing pressure in the Pacific region while exposures are modestly improving. 
Results reflect solid growth across every major region including EMEA, Asia and the Pacific, driven by strength in both new business generation and management of the renewal book portfolio. In Continental Europe, we delivered the highest organic revenue growth in over 6 years, with growth across all product lines, including Health and Benefits, Affinity and Retail, reflecting Aon's strength in client leadership across the region despite macroeconomic environment that remains challenged in many countries. 
In Reinsurance, organic revenue growth was 1% compared to a negative 1% in the prior year quarter. This marks the third consecutive quarter of positive growth in Reinsurance, further reflecting our previous guidance of an expected return to modest growth in 2016. Results in the quarter were primarily driven by growth in global facultative placements, cedent demand in treaty and from new business generation. Results were partially offset by an unfavorable market impact internationally. 
As the rate of price declines continue to moderate, capital is being deployed to new markets, including U.S. mortgage credit risk, life and annuity risk and other emerging risks, such as cyber liability. And as highlighted in our prior discussions, new business opportunities for growth, combined with industry-leading data and analytics, has positioned our Reinsurance business for return to modest growth in 2016. 
Turning to HR Solutions. Organic revenue growth was 1% overall as growth across high-demand areas where we continue to invest was partially offset by a modest decline in benefits administration and unfavorable timing. We continue to strengthen our industry-leading platform with investments in innovative solutions and client-serving capabilities that reflect Aon Hewitt's leadership and in-depth understanding of market trends including solutions to help plan sponsors both manage pension risk and drive better retirement outcomes for their employees. A strong area of growth has been delegated in investment consulting, where assets under management have grown from $10 billion to roughly $85 billion in 5 years. We expect continued global growth in this area as sponsors are faced with regulatory changes and increasingly complex global markets. 
Continued investments to strengthen our industry-leading position of health solutions, covering the full range of benefit strategies, client size and funding choices, including our suite of private health care exchanges. We continue to see strong and steady growth across our entire suite of exchange solutions for companies of all sizes and industries. Starbucks recently joined a growing list of employers on our active health care exchange. We are proud to help Starbucks introduce a new health solution that enables Starbucks U.S. employees to have greater choice, opportunities for cost savings and personalized support to select and get the most out of their health insurance coverage. Starbucks’ decision to adopt a consumer-driven approach to help benefits underscores the sustainability of our exchange model and proven results that our exchange has achieved on behalf of clients over the past several years. 
We also continue to invest in Software-as-a-Service models in our HR BPO business, where growth in new clients and conversion of existing clients is driving strong demand as well as the expansion of our capabilities to include financial implementations. And finally, we're investing in data and analytics in our Health and Talent & Rewards businesses to provide superior advice to drive better outcomes for our clients and our clients' employees. 
Turning to the individual businesses within HR Solutions. In Consulting Services, organic revenue growth was 1%. Results reflect growth in core pension solutions where we provide clients an in-depth approach to pension risk management and the best solutions to take advantage of the market shift from defined benefit to defined contribution. We also saw a continued growth in retirement consulting, primarily driven by demand for delegating investment Consulting Services as an increasing number of clients find significant value in Aon's ability to provide advice and manage their retirement assets. Results in the quarter were partially offset by unfavorable timing of revenue and our compensation consulting practice. 
In outsourcing, organic revenue growth was flat versus the prior year quarter. We saw strong growth continue in HR BPO, driven by new client wins in cloud-based solutions. Results in the quarter were offset by a modest decline in benefits administration as well as a decline in project-related work around lump-sum windows for pension plans that created an unfavorable comparison in the prior year quarter. 
Overall, in HR Solutions, we expect to deliver improved organic growth in the second half of the year, driven primarily by growth in high demand areas where we've been investing, a modest benefit from revenue timing that impacted this quarter and seasonal strength in the fourth quarter. 
In summary, for both the second quarter and the first 6 months, we delivered solid organic revenue growth against a volatile macroeconomic environment, improved operational performance and generated substantial free cash flow. 
With that said, I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Christa for further financial review. Christa?"
119853,372951117,1017638,"Aon plc, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 29, 2016",2016-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Aon plc","Executives","Thank you very much, Greg, and good morning, everyone. As Greg noted, against the continued volatility in the macroeconomic environment, our industry-leading platform delivered solid progress in the first half of the year, with positive performance across",1666,"Thank you very much, Greg, and good morning, everyone. As Greg noted, against the continued volatility in the macroeconomic environment, our industry-leading platform delivered solid progress in the first half of the year, with positive performance across each of our 4 key metrics. Results reflect organic growth in both segments, strong operating margin expansion in Risk Solutions and substantial free cash flow generation. 
Now let me turn to the financial results for the quarter on Page 6 of the presentation. Our core EPS performance, excluding certain items, increased 6% to $1.39 per share for the second quarter compared to $1.31 in the prior year quarter. Certain items that were adjusted for in the core EPS performance and highlighted in the schedules on Page 12 of the press release include noncash intangible asset amortization and noncash expenses related to certain pension settlements. There was no material impact on earnings per share related to foreign currency translation in the second quarter. If currency would remain stable at today's rate, we would expect foreign currency translation to have no material impact going forward. 
Now let me talk about each of the segments on the next slide. In our Risk Solutions segment, organic revenue growth was 3%. Operating margin increased 70 basis points to 24.9%, and operating income increased 3% compared to the prior year quarter. Operating margin improvement of 70 basis points includes a 50 basis point favorable impact from foreign currency translation. Excluding the impact from foreign currency, underlying operating margin improved 20 basis points in the quarter. Operating improvement in the second quarter reflect organic growth in each business, including Reinsurance, and improved returns on our investments in data and analytics across the portfolio. For the first 6 months, operating margin improved 80 basis points, including a 40 basis point favorable impact from foreign currency translation. Our performance in the first half firmly positions Risk Solutions segment for further margin expansions with our long-term target of 26%. With normal seasonal weakness in Q3 and seasonal strength in Q4, we expect the strongest second half of the year for Risk Solutions. Included in our expectation are 2 underlying adjustments. We expect certain client revenue to shift from Q3 into Q4, and we expect a shift in certain underlying compensation expense from Q4 into Q3. As a result, we expect normal quarterly patterning to be more pronounced this year, with modest operating income growth in Q3, significant operating income growth in Q4 and no change to the full year expected performance. 
Turning to the HR Solutions segment. Organic revenue growth was 1%. Operating margin decreased 40 basis points to 12.8%, and operating income decreased 8% compared to the prior year quarter. For the first 6 months, operating margin decreased 90 basis points and operating income decreased 11%. Reported results are in line with our previous guidance of flat to down in the first half. Performance was primarily driven by investments for future growth, timing of certain revenue in our compensation consulting business and an anticipated reduction in operating income reflecting the disposal of 2 businesses in previous quarters. While we continue to reduce certain expenses that supported those noncore businesses, the monetization of those businesses in previous quarters generated other income gains and cash proceeds that will ultimately be deployed for higher return on invested capital opportunity. Looking forward, in line with our previous guidance for HR Solutions, we expect a strong second half of the year. This expectation reflects normal seasonality in Q4 -- sorry, of Q3, of relatively flat operating income growth and normal seasonal strength in Q4 of significant operating income growth, with full year results continuing to deliver solid organic revenue growth, further margin expansion towards our long-term operating margin target of 22% and increased operating income for the full year. 
Now let me discuss a few of the line items outside of the operating segments on Slide 9. Unallocated expenses were $43 million compared to $41 million in the prior year quarter. Interest income was $3 million compared to $4 million in the prior year quarter. Interest expense increased $5 million to $73 million due to an overlap of long-term debt placed in the first quarter with debt that matured in the second quarter. Other income was immaterial, as the losses on certain long-term investments and foreign exchange hedging programs were offset by the sale of a certain business. Going forward, we expect a run rate of approximately $45 million per quarter of unallocated expense, $3 million per quarter of interest income and $71 million per quarter of interest expense. 
Turning to taxes. The adjusted effective tax rate on net income from continuing operations, excluding the applicable tax impact associated with noncash pension settlements, decreased to 17.4% compared to 18% in the prior year quarter. This was driven by changes in the geographic distribution of income and certain favorable discrete tax adjustments. The prior year quarter adjusted effective tax rate excluded the applicable tax impact associated with expenses related to legacy litigation. Lastly, average diluted shares outstanding decreased 6%, 269.8 million in the second quarter compared to 286.7 million in the prior year quarter driven by share repurchase in previous quarters. The company did not repurchase shares in the second quarter. Strong cash flow generation was used in the near term for $500 million of debt that matured in the quarter and an attractive acquisition in the quarter in the elective benefits space. We expect to return to deploying capital to share repurchases in the second half of the year, reflecting our highest return on invested capital. The company has $3.3 billion of remaining authorization under its share repurchase program. Actual shares outstanding on June 30 were 265.8 million, and there are approximately 5 million additional dilutive equivalents. Estimated Q3 2016 beginning dilutive share count is approximately 271 million, subject to share price movement, share issuance and share repurchase. 
Now let me turn to the next slide to highlight our solid balance sheet and strong cash flow growth on Slide 10. At June 30, 2016, cash and short-term investments were $689 million. Total debt outstanding declined to approximately $6.2 billion and total debt-to-EBITDA on a GAAP basis declined 2.4x reflecting the extinguishment of $500 million of debt that came during the quarter. Cash flow from operations for the first 6 months increased 32% or $186 million to $764 million, driven by an increase in net income, a decrease in cash tax payments, a decline in cash paid to pension contributions and underlying working capital improvements. Strong progress in the first 6 months of the year. Free cash flow is defined by cash flow from operations less CapEx, increased 51% or $224 million to $660 million reflecting strong growth in cash flow from operations and a $38 million decrease in CapEx. Looking forward, we expect to deliver double-digit free cash flow growth for the full year 2016 and are firmly on track to deliver against our near-term goal of $2.4 billion of free cash flow for the full year 2017. 
Turning to the next slide to discuss our significant increases in free cash flow. We value the firm based on free cash flow and allocate capital to maximize free cash flow returns. Free cash flow of $2.4 billion in 2017 is not our end goal, as further long-term sustainable free cash flow will be driven by continued operating income growth and additional working capital initiatives beyond 2017. There are 4 primary areas that are expected to contribute to our near-term goal of delivering $2.4 billion or more for the full year 2017. The first is continued operational performance driven by organic revenue growth and margin expansion. The second is working capital improvement as we focus on closing the gap between receivables and payables. We've made substantial progress in this area over the last 5 years with further opportunity to increase free cash flow by over $500 million. Third is declining uses of cash for pension contributions, CapEx and restructuring, which we expect to free up more than $90 million of annual free cash flow between the end of 2015 and 2017. And fourth, lower cash tax payments reflecting a lower effective tax rate. 
Turning to our pension plans. We continue to take significant steps to reduce volatility and liability. In the first half of 2016, we completed 2 transactions to materially derisk our pension liabilities in the U.K. The first was a buy-in completed with assets in the trough to reduce the size of our largest risk within certain U.K. pension schemes. And secondly, through a lump-sum offering, Aon was able to reduce interest rate investment and longevity risk associated with certain U.K. pension liabilities. These transactions resulted in $62 million of noncash settlement charges and related advisory fees, which were adjusted for in our second quarter results. Both of these transactions were completed prior to the Brexit vote as a continuation of our derisking efforts. As a result, our U.K. pension scheme funding spaces remained relatively flat through the Brexit results, despite the recent fall in the U.K. interest rates and market volatility. Further, we expect pension contributions to decline by approximately $44 million in 2016 and expect noncash pension income, excluding the expenses related to the described transactions, to be a modest benefit in 2016 versus 2015. 
In summary, we delivered solid results for the second quarter and the first 6 months of 2016 and continue to take certain steps to strengthen the return on invested capital and free cash flow. Against continued volatility in the macroeconomic environment, we expect improved organic revenue growth and operational performance in the second half of 2016, primarily driven by seasonal strength in Q4. Our industry-leading platform and innovative investments across data and analytics continue to position the firm for long-term growth. Increased operational leverage and substantial free cash flow generation was our near-term goal of $2.4 billion for the full year 2017. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call back to the operator for questions."

The real piece here is our expectation of -- the year stays exactly the same. There's absolutely no change in terms of sort of what we were thinking about, and have been thinking about, for the first 6 months, and in fact, feel good about the trends against that. We see what the pipeline looks like. We see how it's going to evolve. And as I said before, it's really just -- if you think about some of the work we've done on HR BPO and in Cloud, it's just more of a fourth quarter business than it is -- than we've seen historically.

And so margin's down 30 basis points year-over-year, but I think last quarter, there was -- you guys started to give us some facts and figures about how much the portfolio repositioning changed the underlying margin base.

And therefore, we expect in Risk Solutions, strong organic revenue growth, margin expansion, operating income growth for the full year 2016. In terms of HR Solutions, I would note, as you said, there is an impact, if you look at the first half of the year in terms of the divestitures, and that's having an impact of about $6 million in terms of lost operating income in the first half of the year. And obviously, there's some stranded costs associated with those divestitures, which is really why we originally gave guidance in HR Solutions, which is down in the first half, up in the second half. And what you're really seeing in the second half is, we're working through exiting those stranded costs in Q3 and that's why Q4 will be stronger than Q3."

For us, Brexit is, like all things that involve client uncertainty is, an opportunity to help clients understand the situation and take actions to improve their positions.

There are $1 billion-plus businesses in Affinity and health and benefits that are growing substantially. And then Aon InPoint is another example really outside the core in which we’ve made substantial investment, and Aon InPoint really is bringing together what is a very unique and the single biggest repository of insurance information that exists in the world today and pulling this together on behalf of our clients. In this case, they happen to be insurance carriers. We've got 45-plus carriers who are involved right now and we're helping them think about how they improve their business, grow their business overall. We haven't talked about the size.

And if we get the 100 days, for argument's sake, down to 50 days, then you've halved the amount of cash that you're tying up on your balance sheet in the form of receivables. And what you can see if you divide receivables by revenue on our balance sheet is that days sales outstanding has come down substantially, and so it's taking us less time to collect cash from customers, and so we are getting more in line with what we think a professional services firm should be, which is working capital neutral. And today, if you looked at our days payables and our days sales outstanding, there is a 15-day negative gap, and we believe that should be neutral. And the difference between that is the extra $500 million of free cash flow I mentioned.

Joining me here today is our CFO, Christa Davies. I would note that there are slides available on our website for you to follow along with our commentary today. Consistent with previous quarters, I'd like to cover 2 areas before turning the call over to Christa for further financial review. First is our performance against key metrics we communicate to shareholders. Second is overall organic growth performance, including continued areas of strategic investment across Aon. 
On the first topic, our performance versus key metrics. Each quarter, we measure our performance against the key metrics we focus on achieving over the course of the year: grow organically, expand margins, increase earnings per share and deliver free cash flow growth. 
Turning to Slide 3. In the second quarter, organic revenue growth was 3% highlighted by 4% growth in Retail Brokerage, with 6% growth in the International brokerage business. Operating margin increased 30 basis points, reflecting strong operating performance in Risk Solutions. EPS increased 6% to $1.39, reflecting operational improvement and effective capital management. And finally, free cash flow for the 6 months increased $224 million to $660 million, driven by a 32% increase in cash flow from operations and a decline in capital expenditures. Overall, results continue to reflect the strength of our industry-leading platform in a volatile macroeconomic environment with positive performance across each of our key metrics for both the second quarter and the first 6 months of 2016. 
Turning to Slide 4, on the second topic of growth and investment. I want to spend the next few minutes discussing the quarter for both of our segments. In Risk Solutions, organic revenue growth was 3% compared to 2% in the prior year quarter, driven by growth across all major businesses. As we've discussed previously, we're driving a set of initiatives and making strategic investments that are strengthening underlying performance and position our Risk Solutions segment for long-term growth and improved operating leverage, with management of our renewable book portfolio through our proactive client partnership we call Aon Client Promise, which is driving retention rates of more than 90% on average across Retail Brokerage. New business generation of roughly $280 million across Retail Brokerage including double-digit growth in Asia and EMEA and another quarter of record new business in U.S. Retail. 21 consecutive quarters of positive net new business in core treaty reinsurance, and increased operating leverage from our significant investments in innovative technology and data and analytics, including Aon InPoint, where we empower carriers to become more competitive, effective and operationally efficient by integrating our market-leading data and analytics with strategic consulting and access to Aon's unmatched expertise. This includes the risk Insight Platform, which now captures 3.2 million trades and more than $160 billion of bound premium, and Review, our reinsurer dashboard. 
Another example is our Aon Broking initiative to better match client need with insurer appetite for risk and to identify a structured portfolio of solutions. A great example of client impact in this area was the launch of Aon Client Treaty, the largest ever underwritten portfolio of risk in the history of Lloyd's, enabling our clients to access 20% of pre-secured unique coinsurance capacity. And finally, we're expanding our content in global footprints through tuck-in acquisitions that increase scale in emerging markets and expand capability. For example, in the second quarter, we completed the acquisition of Univers, an elected-benefits enrollment and communications firm, strengthening our ability to serve clients as a leading provider of comprehensive benefit solutions. 
Reflecting on our individual businesses within Risk Solutions. In the Americas, organic revenue growth was 2%. Exposures continue to be positive across the region, while the impact from pricing was negative, resulting in relatively stable market impact overall. We saw double-digit growth in Affinity, driven by growth across all product lines. 
In U.S. Retail, we saw a modest growth, driven by record new business generation and strong retention. Results also reflect modest growth in Latin America, driven by new business generation despite macroeconomic challenges facing the region. In International, organic revenue growth was 6% compared to 2% in the prior year quarter. The impact from pricing remains negative on average, driven by fragile market conditions in various countries across Europe and Asia and continued pricing pressure in the Pacific region while exposures are modestly improving. 
Results reflect solid growth across every major region including EMEA, Asia and the Pacific, driven by strength in both new business generation and management of the renewal book portfolio. In Continental Europe, we delivered the highest organic revenue growth in over 6 years, with growth across all product lines, including Health and Benefits, Affinity and Retail, reflecting Aon's strength in client leadership across the region despite macroeconomic environment that remains challenged in many countries. 
In Reinsurance, organic revenue growth was 1% compared to a negative 1% in the prior year quarter. This marks the third consecutive quarter of positive growth in Reinsurance, further reflecting our previous guidance of an expected return to modest growth in 2016. Results in the quarter were primarily driven by growth in global facultative placements, cedent demand in treaty and from new business generation. Results were partially offset by an unfavorable market impact internationally. 
As the rate of price declines continue to moderate, capital is being deployed to new markets, including U.S. mortgage credit risk, life and annuity risk and other emerging risks, such as cyber liability. And as highlighted in our prior discussions, new business opportunities for growth, combined with industry-leading data and analytics, has positioned our Reinsurance business for return to modest growth in 2016. 
Turning to HR Solutions. Organic revenue growth was 1% overall as growth across high-demand areas where we continue to invest was partially offset by a modest decline in benefits administration and unfavorable timing. We continue to strengthen our industry-leading platform with investments in innovative solutions and client-serving capabilities that reflect Aon Hewitt's leadership and in-depth understanding of market trends including solutions to help plan sponsors both manage pension risk and drive better retirement outcomes for their employees. A strong area of growth has been delegated in investment consulting, where assets under management have grown from $10 billion to roughly $85 billion in 5 years. We expect continued global growth in this area as sponsors are faced with regulatory changes and increasingly complex global markets. 
Continued investments to strengthen our industry-leading position of health solutions, covering the full range of benefit strategies, client size and funding choices, including our suite of private health care exchanges. We continue to see strong and steady growth across our entire suite of exchange solutions for companies of all sizes and industries. Starbucks recently joined a growing list of employers on our active health care exchange. We are proud to help Starbucks introduce a new health solution that enables Starbucks U.S. employees to have greater choice, opportunities for cost savings and personalized support to select and get the most out of their health insurance coverage. Starbucks’ decision to adopt a consumer-driven approach to health benefits underscores the sustainability of our exchange model and proven results that our exchange has achieved on behalf of clients over the past several years. 
We also continue to invest in Software-as-a-Service models in our HR BPO business, where growth in new clients and conversion of existing clients is driving strong demand as well as the expansion of our capabilities to include financial implementations. And finally, we're investing in data and analytics in our Health and Talent & Rewards businesses to provide superior advice to drive better outcomes for our clients and our clients' employees. 
Turning to the individual businesses within HR Solutions. In Consulting Services, organic revenue growth was 1%. Results reflect growth in core pension solutions where we provide clients an in-depth approach to pension risk management and the best solutions to take advantage of the market shift from defined benefit to defined contribution. We also saw a continued growth in retirement consulting, primarily driven by demand for delegating investment Consulting Services as an increasing number of clients find significant value in Aon's ability to provide advice and manage their retirement assets. Results in the quarter were partially offset by unfavorable timing of revenue and our compensation consulting practice. 
In outsourcing, organic revenue growth was flat versus the prior year quarter. We saw strong growth continue in HR BPO, driven by new client wins in cloud-based solutions. Results in the quarter were offset by a modest decline in benefits administration as well as a decline in project-related work around lump-sum windows for pension plans that created an unfavorable comparison in the prior year quarter. 
Overall, in HR Solutions, we expect to deliver improved organic growth in the second half of the year, driven primarily by growth in high demand areas where we've been investing, a modest benefit from revenue timing that impacted this quarter and seasonal strength in the fourth quarter. 
In summary, for both the second quarter and the first 6 months, we delivered solid organic revenue growth against a volatile macroeconomic environment, improved operational performance and generated substantial free cash flow. 
With that said, I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Christa for further financial review. Christa?"

As Greg noted, against the continued volatility in the macroeconomic environment, our industry-leading platform delivered solid progress in the first half of the year, with positive performance across",1666,"Thank you very much, Greg, and good morning, everyone. As Greg noted, against the continued volatility in the macroeconomic environment, our industry-leading platform delivered solid progress in the first half of the year, with positive performance across each of our 4 key metrics. Results reflect organic growth in both segments, strong operating margin expansion in Risk Solutions and substantial free cash flow generation. 
Now let me turn to the financial results for the quarter on Page 6 of the presentation. Our core EPS performance, excluding certain items, increased 6% to $1.39 per share for the second quarter compared to $1.31 in the prior year quarter. Certain items that were adjusted for in the core EPS performance and highlighted in the schedules on Page 12 of the press release include noncash intangible asset amortization and noncash expenses related to certain pension settlements. There was no material impact on earnings per share related to foreign currency translation in the second quarter. If currency would remain stable at today's rate, we would expect foreign currency translation to have no material impact going forward. 
Now let me talk about each of the segments on the next slide. In our Risk Solutions segment, organic revenue growth was 3%. Operating margin increased 70 basis points to 24.9%, and operating income increased 3% compared to the prior year quarter. Operating margin improvement of 70 basis points includes a 50 basis point favorable impact from foreign currency translation. Excluding the impact from foreign currency, underlying operating margin improved 20 basis points in the quarter. Operating improvement in the second quarter reflect organic growth in each business, including Reinsurance, and improved returns on our investments in data and analytics across the portfolio. For the first 6 months, operating margin improved 80 basis points, including a 40 basis point favorable impact from foreign currency translation. Our performance in the first half firmly positions Risk Solutions segment for further margin expansions with our long-term target of 26%. With normal seasonal weakness in Q3 and seasonal strength in Q4, we expect the strongest second half of the year for Risk Solutions. Included in our expectation are 2 underlying adjustments. We expect certain client revenue to shift from Q3 into Q4, and we expect a shift in certain underlying compensation expense from Q4 into Q3. As a result, we expect normal quarterly patterning to be more pronounced this year, with modest operating income growth in Q3, significant operating income growth in Q4 and no change to the full year expected performance. 
Turning to the HR Solutions segment. Organic revenue growth was 1%. Operating margin decreased 40 basis points to 12.8%, and operating income decreased 8% compared to the prior year quarter. For the first 6 months, operating margin decreased 90 basis points and operating income decreased 11%. Reported results are in line with our previous guidance of flat to down in the first half. Performance was primarily driven by investments for future growth, timing of certain revenue in our compensation consulting business and an anticipated reduction in operating income reflecting the disposal of 2 businesses in previous quarters. While we continue to reduce certain expenses that supported those noncore businesses, the monetization of those businesses in previous quarters generated other income gains and cash proceeds that will ultimately be deployed for higher return on invested capital opportunity. Looking forward, in line with our previous guidance for HR Solutions, we expect a strong second half of the year. This expectation reflects normal seasonality in Q4 -- sorry, of Q3, of relatively flat operating income growth and normal seasonal strength in Q4 of significant operating income growth, with full year results continuing to deliver solid organic revenue growth, further margin expansion towards our long-term operating margin target of 22% and increased operating income for the full year. 
Now let me discuss a few of the line items outside of the operating segments on Slide 9. Unallocated expenses were $43 million compared to $41 million in the prior year quarter. Interest income was $3 million compared to $4 million in the prior year quarter. Interest expense increased $5 million to $73 million due to an overlap of long-term debt placed in the first quarter with debt that matured in the second quarter. Other income was immaterial, as the losses on certain long-term investments and foreign exchange hedging programs were offset by the sale of a certain business. Going forward, we expect a run rate of approximately $45 million per quarter of unallocated expense, $3 million per quarter of interest income and $71 million per quarter of interest expense. 
Turning to taxes. The adjusted effective tax rate on net income from continuing operations, excluding the applicable tax impact associated with noncash pension settlements, decreased to 17.4% compared to 18% in the prior year quarter. This was driven by changes in the geographic distribution of income and certain favorable discrete tax adjustments. The prior year quarter adjusted effective tax rate excluded the applicable tax impact associated with expenses related to legacy litigation. Lastly, average diluted shares outstanding decreased 6%, 269.8 million in the second quarter compared to 286.7 million in the prior year quarter driven by share repurchase in previous quarters. The company did not repurchase shares in the second quarter. Strong cash flow generation was used in the near term for $500 million of debt that matured in the quarter and an attractive acquisition in the quarter in the elective benefits space. We expect to return to deploying capital to share repurchases in the second half of the year, reflecting our highest return on invested capital. The company has $3.3 billion of remaining authorization under its share repurchase program. Actual shares outstanding on June 30 were 265.8 million, and there are approximately 5 million additional dilutive equivalents. Estimated Q3 2016 beginning dilutive share count is approximately 271 million, subject to share price movement, share issuance and share repurchase. 
Now let me turn to the next slide to highlight our solid balance sheet and strong cash flow growth on Slide 10. At June 30, 2016, cash and short-term investments were $689 million. Total debt outstanding declined to approximately $6.2 billion and total debt-to-EBITDA on a GAAP basis declined 2.4x reflecting the extinguishment of $500 million of debt that came during the quarter. Cash flow from operations for the first 6 months increased 32% or $186 million to $764 million, driven by an increase in net income, a decrease in cash tax payments, a decline in cash paid to pension contributions and underlying working capital improvements. Strong progress in the first 6 months of the year. Free cash flow is defined by cash flow from operations less CapEx, increased 51% or $224 million to $660 million reflecting strong growth in cash flow from operations and a $38 million decrease in CapEx. Looking forward, we expect to deliver double-digit free cash flow growth for the full year 2016 and are firmly on track to deliver against our near-term goal of $2.4 billion of free cash flow for the full year 2017. 
Turning to the next slide to discuss our significant increases in free cash flow. We value the firm based on free cash flow and allocate capital to maximize free cash flow returns. Free cash flow of $2.4 billion in 2017 is not our end goal, as further long-term sustainable free cash flow will be driven by continued operating income growth and additional working capital initiatives beyond 2017. There are 4 primary areas that are expected to contribute to our near-term goal of delivering $2.4 billion or more for the full year 2017. The first is continued operational performance driven by organic revenue growth and margin expansion. The second is working capital improvement as we focus on closing the gap between receivables and payables. We've made substantial progress in this area over the last 5 years with further opportunity to increase free cash flow by over $500 million. Third is declining uses of cash for pension contributions, CapEx and restructuring, which we expect to free up more than $90 million of annual free cash flow between the end of 2015 and 2017. And fourth, lower cash tax payments reflecting a lower effective tax rate. 
Turning to our pension plans. We continue to take significant steps to reduce volatility and liability. In the first half of 2016, we completed 2 transactions to materially derisk our pension liabilities in the U.K. The first was a buy-in completed with assets in the trough to reduce the size of our largest risk within certain U.K. pension schemes. And secondly, through a lump-sum offering, Aon was able to reduce interest rate investment and longevity risk associated with certain U.K. pension liabilities. These transactions resulted in $62 million of noncash settlement charges and related advisory fees, which were adjusted for in our second quarter results. Both of these transactions were completed prior to the Brexit vote as a continuation of our derisking efforts. As a result, our U.K. pension scheme funding spaces remained relatively flat through the Brexit results, despite the recent fall in the U.K. interest rates and market volatility. Further, we expect pension contributions to decline by approximately $44 million in 2016 and expect noncash pension income, excluding the expenses related to the described transactions, to be a modest benefit in 2016 versus 2015. 
In summary, we delivered solid results for the second quarter and the first 6 months of 2016 and continue to take certain steps to strengthen the return on invested capital and free cash flow. Against continued volatility in the macroeconomic environment, we expect improved organic revenue growth and operational performance in the second half of 2016, primarily driven by seasonal strength in Q4. Our industry-leading platform and innovative investments across data and analytics continue to position the firm for long-term growth. Increased operational leverage and substantial free cash flow generation was our near-term goal of $2.4 billion for the full year 2017. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call back to the operator for questions."

So that's really what you're seeing trending here. That's amplified a little bit by some timing that Christa highlighted, but this is just for us a natural evolution. The real piece here is our expectation of -- the year stays exactly the same. There's absolutely no change in terms of sort of what we were thinking about, and have been thinking about, for the first 6 months, and in fact, feel good about the trends against that. We see what the pipeline looks like. We see how it's going to evolve. And as I said before, it's really just -- if you think about some of the work we've done on HR BPO and in Cloud, it's just more of a fourth quarter business than it is -- than we've seen historically. And then on the risk side, same piece. We expect a stronger second half than we saw in the first half and continued growth in the overall business. So no change for the year."

And so margin's down 30 basis points year-over-year, but I think last quarter, there was -- you guys started to give us some facts and figures about how much the portfolio repositioning changed the underlying margin base.

And therefore, we expect in Risk Solutions, strong organic revenue growth, margin expansion, operating income growth for the full year 2016. In terms of HR Solutions, I would note, as you said, there is an impact, if you look at the first half of the year in terms of the divestitures, and that's having an impact of about $6 million in terms of lost operating income in the first half of the year. And obviously, there's some stranded costs associated with those divestitures, which is really why we originally gave guidance in HR Solutions, which is down in the first half, up in the second half. And what you're really seeing in the second half is, we're working through exiting those stranded costs in Q3 and that's why Q4 will be stronger than Q3."

And what you can see if you divide receivables by revenue on our balance sheet is that days sales outstanding has come down substantially, and so it's taking us less time to collect cash from customers, and so we are getting more in line with what we think a professional services firm should be, which is working capital neutral. And today, if you looked at our days payables and our days sales outstanding, there is a 15-day negative gap, and we believe that should be neutral.

Joining me here today is our CFO, Christa Davies.

Joining me here today is our CFO, Christa Davies. I would note that there are slides available on our website for you to follow along with our commentary today. Consistent with previous quarters, I'd like to cover 2 areas before turning the call over to Christa for further financial review. First is our performance against key metrics we communicate to shareholders. Second is overall organic growth performance, including continued areas of strategic investment across Aon. 
On the first topic, our performance versus key metrics. Each quarter, we measure our performance against the key metrics we focus on achieving over the course of the year: grow organically, expand margins, increase earnings per share and deliver free cash flow growth. 
Turning to Slide 3. In the second quarter, organic revenue growth was 3% highlighted by 4% growth in Retail Brokerage, with 6% growth in the International brokerage business. Operating margin increased 30 basis points, reflecting strong operating performance in Risk Solutions. EPS increased 6% to $1.39, reflecting operational improvement and effective capital management. And finally, free cash flow for the 6 months increased $224 million to $660 million, driven by a 32% increase in cash flow from operations and a decline in capital expenditures. Overall, results continue to reflect the strength of our industry-leading platform in a volatile macroeconomic environment with positive performance across each of our key metrics for both the second quarter and the first 6 months of 2016. 
Turning to Slide 4, on the second topic of growth and investment. I want to spend the next few minutes discussing the quarter for both of our segments. In Risk Solutions, organic revenue growth was 3% compared to 2% in the prior year quarter, driven by growth across all major businesses. As we've discussed previously, we're driving a set of initiatives and making strategic investments that are strengthening underlying performance and position our Risk Solutions segment for long-term growth and improved operating leverage, with management of our renewable book portfolio through our proactive client partnership we call Aon Client Promise, which is driving retention rates of more than 90% on average across Retail Brokerage. New business generation of roughly $280 million across Retail Brokerage including double-digit growth in Asia and EMEA and another quarter of record new business in U.S. Retail. 21 consecutive quarters of positive net new business in core treaty reinsurance, and increased operating leverage from our significant investments in innovative technology and data and analytics, including Aon InPoint, where we empower carriers to become more competitive, effective and operationally efficient by integrating our market-leading data and analytics with strategic consulting and access to Aon's unmatched expertise. This includes the risk Insight Platform, which now captures 3.2 million trades and more than $160 billion of bound premium, and Review, our reinsurer dashboard. 
Another example is our Aon Broking initiative to better match client need with insurer appetite for risk and to identify a structured portfolio of solutions. A great example of client impact in this area was the launch of Aon Client Treaty, the largest ever underwritten portfolio of risk in the history of Lloyd's, enabling our clients to access 20% of pre-secured unique coinsurance capacity. And finally, we're expanding our content in global footprints through tuck-in acquisitions that increase scale in emerging markets and expand capability. For example, in the second quarter, we completed the acquisition of Univers, an elected-benefits enrollment and communications firm, strengthening our ability to serve clients as a leading provider of comprehensive benefit solutions. 
Reflecting on our individual businesses within Risk Solutions. In the Americas, organic revenue growth was 2%. Exposures continue to be positive across the region, while the impact from pricing was negative, resulting in relatively stable market impact overall. We saw double-digit growth in Affinity, driven by growth across all product lines. 
In U.S. Retail, we saw a modest growth, driven by record new business generation and strong retention. Results also reflect modest growth in Latin America, driven by new business generation despite macroeconomic challenges facing the region. In International, organic revenue growth was 6% compared to 2% in the prior year quarter. The impact from pricing remains negative on average, driven by fragile market conditions in various countries across Europe and Asia and continued pricing pressure in the Pacific region while exposures are modestly improving. 
Results reflect solid growth across every major region including EMEA, Asia and the Pacific, driven by strength in both new business generation and management of the renewal book portfolio. In Continental Europe, we delivered the highest organic revenue growth in over 6 years, with growth across all product lines, including Health and Benefits, Affinity and Retail, reflecting Aon's strength in client leadership across the region despite macroeconomic environment that remains challenged in many countries. 
In Reinsurance, organic revenue growth was 1% compared to a negative 1% in the prior year quarter. This marks the third consecutive quarter of positive growth in Reinsurance, further reflecting our previous guidance of an expected return to modest growth in 2016. Results in the quarter were primarily driven by growth in global facultative placements, cedent demand in treaty and from new business generation. Results were partially offset by an unfavorable market impact internationally. 
As the rate of price declines continue to moderate, capital is being deployed to new markets, including U.S. mortgage credit risk, life and annuity risk and other emerging risks, such as cyber liability. And as highlighted in our prior discussions, new business opportunities for growth, combined with industry-leading data and analytics, has positioned our Reinsurance business for return to modest growth in 2016. 
Turning to HR Solutions. Organic revenue growth was 1% overall as growth across high-demand areas where we continue to invest was partially offset by a modest decline in benefits administration and unfavorable timing. We continue to strengthen our industry-leading platform with investments in innovative solutions and client-serving capabilities that reflect Aon Hewitt's leadership and in-depth understanding of market trends including solutions to help plan sponsors both manage pension risk and drive better retirement outcomes for their employees. A strong area of growth has been delegated in investment consulting, where assets under management have grown from $10 billion to roughly $85 billion in 5 years. We expect continued global growth in this area as sponsors are faced with regulatory changes and increasingly complex global markets. 
Continued investments to strengthen our industry-leading position of health solutions, covering the full range of benefit strategies, client size and funding choices, including our suite of private health care exchanges. We continue to see strong and steady growth across our entire suite of exchange solutions for companies of all sizes and industries. Starbucks recently joined a growing list of employers on our active health care exchange. We are proud to help Starbucks introduce a new health solution that enables Starbucks U.S. employees to have greater choice, opportunities for cost savings and personalized support to select and get the most out of their health insurance coverage. Starbucks’ decision to adopt a consumer-driven approach to health benefits underscores the sustainability of our exchange model and proven results that our exchange has achieved on behalf of clients over the past several years. 
We also continue to invest in Software-as-a-Service models in our HR BPO business, where growth in new clients and conversion of existing clients is driving strong demand as well as the expansion of our capabilities to include financial implementations. And finally, we're investing in data and analytics in our Health and Talent & Rewards businesses to provide superior advice to drive better outcomes for our clients and our clients' employees. 
Turning to the individual businesses within HR Solutions. In Consulting Services, organic revenue growth was 1%. Results reflect growth in core pension solutions where we provide clients an in-depth approach to pension risk management and the best solutions to take advantage of the market shift from defined benefit to defined contribution. We also saw a continued growth in retirement consulting, primarily driven by demand for delegating investment Consulting Services as an increasing number of clients find significant value in Aon's ability to provide advice and manage their retirement assets. Results in the quarter were partially offset by unfavorable timing of revenue and our compensation consulting practice. 
In outsourcing, organic revenue growth was flat versus the prior year quarter. We saw strong growth continue in HR BPO, driven by new client wins in cloud-based solutions. Results in the quarter were offset by a modest decline in benefits administration as well as a decline in project-related work around lump-sum windows for pension plans that created an unfavorable comparison in the prior year quarter. 
Overall, in HR Solutions, we expect to deliver improved organic growth in the second half of the year, driven primarily by growth in high demand areas where we've been investing, a modest benefit from revenue timing that impacted this quarter and seasonal strength in the fourth quarter. 
In summary, for both the second quarter and the first 6 months, we delivered solid organic revenue growth against a volatile macroeconomic environment, improved operational performance and generated substantial free cash flow. 
With that said, I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Christa for further financial review. Christa?"
119853,372951117,1018468,"Aon plc, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 29, 2016",2016-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Aon plc","Executives","Thank you very much, Greg, and good morning, everyone. As Greg noted, against the continued volatility in the macroeconomic environment, our industry-leading platform delivered solid progress in the first half of the year, with positive performance across",1666,"Thank you very much, Greg, and good morning, everyone. As Greg noted, against the continued volatility in the macroeconomic environment, our industry-leading platform delivered solid progress in the first half of the year, with positive performance across each of our 4 key metrics. Results reflect organic growth in both segments, strong operating margin expansion in Risk Solutions and substantial free cash flow generation. 
Now let me turn to the financial results for the quarter on Page 6 of the presentation. Our core EPS performance, excluding certain items, increased 6% to $1.39 per share for the second quarter compared to $1.31 in the prior year quarter. Certain items that were adjusted for in the core EPS performance and highlighted in the schedules on Page 12 of the press release include noncash intangible asset amortization and noncash expenses related to certain pension settlements. There was no material impact on earnings per share related to foreign currency translation in the second quarter. If currency would remain stable at today's rate, we would expect foreign currency translation to have no material impact going forward. 
Now let me talk about each of the segments on the next slide. In our Risk Solutions segment, organic revenue growth was 3%. Operating margin increased 70 basis points to 24.9%, and operating income increased 3% compared to the prior year quarter. Operating margin improvement of 70 basis points includes a 50 basis point favorable impact from foreign currency translation. Excluding the impact from foreign currency, underlying operating margin improved 20 basis points in the quarter. Operating improvement in the second quarter reflect organic growth in each business, including Reinsurance, and improved returns on our investments in data and analytics across the portfolio. For the first 6 months, operating margin improved 80 basis points, including a 40 basis point favorable impact from foreign currency translation. Our performance in the first half firmly positions Risk Solutions segment for further margin expansions with our long-term target of 26%. With normal seasonal weakness in Q3 and seasonal strength in Q4, we expect the strongest second half of the year for Risk Solutions. Included in our expectation are 2 underlying adjustments. We expect certain client revenue to shift from Q3 into Q4, and we expect a shift in certain underlying compensation expense from Q4 into Q3. As a result, we expect normal quarterly patterning to be more pronounced this year, with modest operating income growth in Q3, significant operating income growth in Q4 and no change to the full year expected performance. 
Turning to the HR Solutions segment. Organic revenue growth was 1%. Operating margin decreased 40 basis points to 12.8%, and operating income decreased 8% compared to the prior year quarter. For the first 6 months, operating margin decreased 90 basis points and operating income decreased 11%. Reported results are in line with our previous guidance of flat to down in the first half. Performance was primarily driven by investments for future growth, timing of certain revenue in our compensation consulting business and an anticipated reduction in operating income reflecting the disposal of 2 businesses in previous quarters. While we continue to reduce certain expenses that supported those noncore businesses, the monetization of those businesses in previous quarters generated other income gains and cash proceeds that will ultimately be deployed for higher return on invested capital opportunity. Looking forward, in line with our previous guidance for HR Solutions, we expect a strong second half of the year. This expectation reflects normal seasonality in Q4 -- sorry, of Q3, of relatively flat operating income growth and normal seasonal strength in Q4 of significant operating income growth, with full year results continuing to deliver solid organic revenue growth, further margin expansion towards our long-term operating margin target of 22% and increased operating income for the full year. 
Now let me discuss a few of the line items outside of the operating segments on Slide 9. Unallocated expenses were $43 million compared to $41 million in the prior year quarter. Interest income was $3 million compared to $4 million in the prior year quarter. Interest expense increased $5 million to $73 million due to an overlap of long-term debt placed in the first quarter with debt that matured in the second quarter. Other income was immaterial, as the losses on certain long-term investments and foreign exchange hedging programs were offset by the sale of a certain business. Going forward, we expect a run rate of approximately $45 million per quarter of unallocated expense, $3 million per quarter of interest income and $71 million per quarter of interest expense. 
Turning to taxes. The adjusted effective tax rate on net income from continuing operations, excluding the applicable tax impact associated with noncash pension settlements, decreased to 17.4% compared to 18% in the prior year quarter. This was driven by changes in the geographic distribution of income and certain favorable discrete tax adjustments. The prior year quarter adjusted effective tax rate excluded the applicable tax impact associated with expenses related to legacy litigation. Lastly, average diluted shares outstanding decreased 6%, 269.8 million in the second quarter compared to 286.7 million in the prior year quarter driven by share repurchase in previous quarters. The company did not repurchase shares in the second quarter. Strong cash flow generation was used in the near term for $500 million of debt that matured in the quarter and an attractive acquisition in the quarter in the elective benefits space. We expect to return to deploying capital to share repurchases in the second half of the year, reflecting our highest return on invested capital. The company has $3.3 billion of remaining authorization under its share repurchase program. Actual shares outstanding on June 30 were 265.8 million, and there are approximately 5 million additional dilutive equivalents. Estimated Q3 2016 beginning dilutive share count is approximately 271 million, subject to share price movement, share issuance and share repurchase. 
Now let me turn to the next slide to highlight our solid balance sheet and strong cash flow growth on Slide 10. At June 30, 2016, cash and short-term investments were $689 million. Total debt outstanding declined to approximately $6.2 billion and total debt-to-EBITDA on a GAAP basis declined 2.4x reflecting the extinguishment of $500 million of debt that came during the quarter. Cash flow from operations for the first 6 months increased 32% or $186 million to $764 million, driven by an increase in net income, a decrease in cash tax payments, a decline in cash paid to pension contributions and underlying working capital improvements. Strong progress in the first 6 months of the year. Free cash flow is defined by cash flow from operations less CapEx, increased 51% or $224 million to $660 million reflecting strong growth in cash flow from operations and a $38 million decrease in CapEx. Looking forward, we expect to deliver double-digit free cash flow growth for the full year 2016 and are firmly on track to deliver against our near-term goal of $2.4 billion of free cash flow for the full year 2017. 
Turning to the next slide to discuss our significant increases in free cash flow. We value the firm based on free cash flow and allocate capital to maximize free cash flow returns. Free cash flow of $2.4 billion in 2017 is not our end goal, as further long-term sustainable free cash flow will be driven by continued operating income growth and additional working capital initiatives beyond 2017. There are 4 primary areas that are expected to contribute to our near-term goal of delivering $2.4 billion or more for the full year 2017. The first is continued operational performance driven by organic revenue growth and margin expansion. The second is working capital improvement as we focus on closing the gap between receivables and payables. We've made substantial progress in this area over the last 5 years with further opportunity to increase free cash flow by over $500 million. Third is declining uses of cash for pension contributions, CapEx and restructuring, which we expect to free up more than $90 million of annual free cash flow between the end of 2015 and 2017. And fourth, lower cash tax payments reflecting a lower effective tax rate. 
Turning to our pension plans. We continue to take significant steps to reduce volatility and liability. In the first half of 2016, we completed 2 transactions to materially derisk our pension liabilities in the U.K. The first was a buy-in completed with assets in the trough to reduce the size of our largest risk within certain U.K. pension schemes. And secondly, through a lump-sum offering, Aon was able to reduce interest rate investment and longevity risk associated with certain U.K. pension liabilities. These transactions resulted in $62 million of noncash settlement charges and related advisory fees, which were adjusted for in our second quarter results. Both of these transactions were completed prior to the Brexit vote as a continuation of our derisking efforts. As a result, our U.K. pension scheme funding spaces remained relatively flat through the Brexit results, despite the recent fall in the U.K. interest rates and market volatility. Further, we expect pension contributions to decline by approximately $44 million in 2016 and expect noncash pension income, excluding the expenses related to the described transactions, to be a modest benefit in 2016 versus 2015. 
In summary, we delivered solid results for the second quarter and the first 6 months of 2016 and continue to take certain steps to strengthen the return on invested capital and free cash flow. Against continued volatility in the macroeconomic environment, we expect improved organic revenue growth and operational performance in the second half of 2016, primarily driven by seasonal strength in Q4. Our industry-leading platform and innovative investments across data and analytics continue to position the firm for long-term growth. Increased operational leverage and substantial free cash flow generation was our near-term goal of $2.4 billion for the full year 2017. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call back to the operator for questions."

We see what the pipeline looks like. We see how it's going to evolve.

We do expect a stronger second half to the year in both Risk Solutions and HR Solutions, as Greg said, as we are becoming a more Q4-orientated company just in terms of the patterning of our revenue and operating income. And therefore, we expect in Risk Solutions, strong organic revenue growth, margin expansion, operating income growth for the full year 2016. In terms of HR Solutions, I would note, as you said, there is an impact, if you look at the first half of the year in terms of the divestitures, and that's having an impact of about $6 million in terms of lost operating income in the first half of the year.

And what you can see if you divide receivables by revenue on our balance sheet is that days sales outstanding has come down substantially, and so it's taking us less time to collect cash from customers, and so we are getting more in line with what we think a professional services firm should be, which is working capital neutral. And today, if you looked at our days payables and our days sales outstanding, there is a 15-day negative gap, and we believe that should be neutral.

Welcome to our third quarter 2016 conference call. Joining me here today is our CFO, Christa Davies.
I would note that there are slides available on our website for you to follow along with our commentary today, and consistent with previous quarters, I'd like to cover 2 areas before turning the call over to Christa for further financial review. First is our performance against key metrics we communicate to shareholders. And second is overall organic growth performance, including continued areas of strategic investment across Aon.
On the first topic, our performance versus key metrics. Each quarter, we measure our performance against the key metrics we focus on achieving over the course of the year: grow organically, expand margins, increase earnings per share and deliver free cash flow growth.
Turning to Slide 3. In the third quarter, organic revenue growth was 4%, including growth across every major business, highlighted by 5% growth in both the Americas Retail Brokerage and Outsourcing businesses. Operating margin increased 10 basis points, reflecting modest improvement in Risk Solutions. EPS increased 4% to $1.29, primarily reflecting the effective capital management and underlying operational improvements. And finally, free cash flow for the 9 months is up 24%, reflecting strong cash flow from operations and a decline in capital expenditures.
Overall, we continue to strengthen the firm with positive performance across each of our key metrics for both the third quarter and the first 9 months of 2016, highlighted by solid organic revenue growth across both Risk Solutions and HR Solutions and strong double-digit growth in free cash flow.
Turning to Slide 4, on the second topic of growth and investment. I'm going to spend the next few minutes discussing the quarter for both of our segments. In Risk Solutions, organic revenue growth was 3% compared to 1% in the prior year quarter, driven by improved growth across all major businesses. As we've discussed previously, we're driving a set of initiatives to maximize return on invested capital and making strategic investments that are strengthening underlying performance and positioning our Risk Solutions segment for long-term growth and improved operating leverage, with management of our renewal book portfolio through our proactive partnership we call Aon Client Promise, which is driving retention rates of more than 90% on average across Retail Brokerage, including record retention rates of 94% in the U.S. and EMEA; new business generation of roughly $265 million in the third quarter across Retail Brokerage, including double-digit growth in Latin America, Affinity and EMEA; and another consecutive quarter of record new business in U.S. Retail; 22 consecutive quarters of positive net new business in core treaty reinsurance; increased operating leverage from our significant investments in innovative technology and data and analytics, including Aon InPoint, a growing business where we help carriers become more competitive, effective and operationally efficient by integrating our market-leading data and analytics with strategic consulting and access to Aon's unmatched expertise. This includes the Risk Insight Platform which now captures 3.3 million trades and nearly $165 billion of bound premium as well as our reinsurer dashboard, Review.
Another example is our Aon Broking initiative to better match client need with insurer appetite for risk. And finally, we're expanding our content in global footprint through tuck-in acquisitions that increase scale in emerging markets and expand capability. For example, we recently announced the addition of Stroz Friedberg, a global leader in cyber security, bringing together 2 of the world's most highly skilled teams focused on cyber risk mitigation. This investment extends Aon's leading position in cyber risk brokerage and creates a comprehensive cyber advisory group, allowing Aon's clients to have access to the most advanced thinking and solutions in the industry.
Reflecting on our individual businesses within Risk Solutions. In the Americas, organic revenue growth was 5% compared to 4% in the prior year quarter. Exposures continue to be positive across the region while the impact from pricing was negative, resulting in relatively stable market impact overall. We saw solid growth across all regions, U.S. Retail, Latin America and Canada, including growth across all businesses, property casualty, health and benefits and Affinity. Results were highlighted by double-digit growth in Affinity's consumer solutions group and strong growth in U.S. Retail, driven by record new business generation and retention.
In international, organic revenue growth was 2% compared to 1% in the prior year quarter. The impact from pricing remains modestly negative on average, driven by fragile market conditions in various countries across Europe and Asia and continued pricing pressure in the Pacific region, while exposures are modestly improving. Similar to the Americas, we saw growth across every major region, including EMEA, Asia and the Pacific. Results were highlighted by continued strength in New Zealand, record retention in EMEA and solid growth in Asia. In Continental Europe, we continue to see signs of improving growth, reflecting Aon's strength in client leadership across the region despite a macroeconomic environment that remains challenged in various countries.
In Reinsurance, organic revenue growth was 1% compared to minus 4% in the prior year quarter. This marks the fourth consecutive quarter of positive growth in Reinsurance, further validating our previous guidance of an expected return to modest growth in 2016.
Results in the quarter were primarily driven by continued net new business generation in treaty and growth in facultative placements. Results were partially offset by an unfavorable market impact globally.
As highlighted on our prior discussions, pricing continues to moderate, cedent demand continues to increase and capital is being deployed to new markets including U.S. mortgage credit risk, life and annuity risk and other emerging risks such as cyber liability. We believe new opportunities for growth, combined with Aon's industry-leading data and analytics and integrated capital solutions, have positioned our Reinsurance business for long-term growth.
Turning to HR Solutions. Organic revenue growth was 4% overall, with solid growth across high-demand areas where we continue to invest in innovative solutions and client-serving capabilities. These investments reflect Aon Hewitt's leadership and in-depth understanding of market threats, including solutions to help plan sponsors both manage pension risk and drive better retirement outcomes for their employees. A strong area of growth has been delegated in investment consulting, where assets under management have grown from $10 billion to almost $90 billion in 5 years. We expect continued global growth in this area as sponsors are faced with regulatory changes and increasingly complex global markets, continuing investments to strengthen our industry-leading portfolio of health solutions covering the full range of benefit strategies, client size and funding choices, including our suite of private health care exchanges.
We view health as a substantial long-term opportunity. We are the industry leader in managing unique company or employee population needs today, and our superior advisory capabilities allows to have clients evolve when their needs change and priorities shift and as the health care landscape continues to evolve.
We also continue to invest in Software-as-a-Service models in our HR BPO business, where growth of new clients and conversion of existing clients is driving strong demands as well as the expansion of our capabilities to include financial implementations.
And finally, we're investing in data and analytics in our health, retirement, investment and Talent & Rewards businesses to provide superior advice to drive better outcomes for our clients and our clients' employees.
Turning to the individual businesses within HR Solutions. In Consulting Services, organic revenue growth was 3%, similar to the prior year quarter. Results primarily reflect continued growth in retirement consulting, driven by demand for delegated investment consulting services as an increasing amount of clients find significant value in Aon's ability to provide advice and manage their retirement assets.
We saw growth in communications consulting, where clients proactively preparing their employees in advance of annual enrollment season as well as certain project-related work. Results in the quarter also include solid growth in our compensation consulting practice.
In Outsourcing, organic revenue growth was 5%, similar to the prior year quarter. Results reflect strong growth in HR BPO, driven by new client wins in cloud-based solutions. And we saw strong growth in our health exchange business for off-cycle enrollments and certain project-related work. Results in the quarter were partially offset by an anticipated modest decline in benefits administration.
Overall, in HR Solutions, we are firmly on track for improved organic revenue growth in both businesses for the second half of the year, driven by continued growth in high demand areas where we've been investing, combined with seasonal strength in the fourth quarter.
In summary, our performance marks another quarter of progress, reflecting strong organic revenue growth across both segments, effective capital management and substantial free cash flow generation towards our near-term goal of $2.4 billion for the full year of 2017. Looking forward, we expect a strong finish to the year as we head into our seasonally strongest quarter with continued long-term growth, driven by an unmatched level of investment in advisory and analytic capabilities across our portfolio.
With that said, I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Christa for further financial review. Christa?"
119853,404166436,1064950,"Aon plc, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2016",2016-10-28,"Earnings Calls","Aon plc","Executives","Thank you so much, Greg, and good morning, everyone. As Greg noted, our results reflect solid organic revenue growth across both segments, substantial free cash flow generation and effective capital management, highlighted by $300 million of share repurch",1339,"Thank you so much, Greg, and good morning, everyone. As Greg noted, our results reflect solid organic revenue growth across both segments, substantial free cash flow generation and effective capital management, highlighted by $300 million of share repurchase in the quarter and more than $1 billion of share repurchase year-to-date.
Now let me turn to the financial results for the quarter on Page 6 of the presentation. Our core EPS performance, excluding certain items, increased 4% to $1.29 per share for the third quarter compared to $1.24 in the prior year quarter. Certain items that were adjusted for in the core EPS performance and highlighted in the schedules on Page 12 of the press release include noncash intangible asset amortization. Also included in the results was a $0.01 per share favorable impact related to foreign currency translation due primarily to the U.S. dollar strength against the pound. If currency do remain stable at today's rates, we would expect foreign currency translation to have a modest positive impact in the fourth quarter.
Now let me talk about each of the segments on the next slide. In our Risk Solutions segment, organic growth was 3%, operating margin increased 10 basis points to 20.9% and operating income increased 2% compared to the prior year quarter. Reported results are in line with our previous guidance of modest operating income growth in the third quarter. Operating margin improvement of 10 basis points reflects solid organic revenue growth and an 80 basis points favorable impact from foreign currency translation, partially offset by an unfavorable impact from the timing of certain compensation expenses and a minus 50 basis point unfavorable impact from higher E&O expense in the quarter.
For the first 9 months, operating margin improved 60 basis points, and operating income increased 3%. Anticipating a strong performance in the fourth quarter, we are fully on track to deliver improved operating income growth and further margin expansion for the full year, reflecting continued progress towards our long-term target of 26%.
Turning to the HR Solutions segment. Organic revenue growth was 4%, operating margin decreased 30 basis points to 17.1% and operating income decreased 4% compared to the prior year quarter. Operating income results include a $7 million or minus 70 basis points of legacy IT contract costs incurred in the quarter. This impact as well as an anticipated minus 70 basis point unfavorable impact related to previous portfolio repositioning activities and a minus 20 basis point unfavorable impact from foreign currency more than offset solid organic growth in the quarter.
For the first 9 months, operating margin decreased 70 basis points, and operating income decreased 8%. As discussed previously, we continue to take steps to reduce certain costs that remained after disposition of 2 businesses in the last 12 months as well as optimize our global cost structure in areas such as IT, real estate and global procurements. Combined with an expected strong performance in the fourth quarter, we are fully on track to continued margin expansion towards our long-term operating margin target of 22%.
Now let me discuss a few of the line items outside of the operating segments on Slide 9. Unallocated expenses were $42 million compared to $45 million in the prior year quarter. Interest income was $1 million compared to $3 million in the prior year quarter. Interest expense decreased $2 million to $70 million due to a decline in costs related to certain derivative hedging programs, which have now expired. Other income in both the current and prior year quarters included gains on certain long-term investments. Going forward, we expect a run rate of approximately $45 million per quarter of unallocated expense, $3 million per quarter of interest income and $70 million per quarter of interest expense.
Turning to taxes. The adjusted effective tax rate on net income from continuing operations, excluding the applicable tax impact associated with noncash pension settlements in the first half of the year, increased to 18.2% compared to 16% in the prior year quarter. Changes in the geographic distribution of income and certain favorable discrete tax adjustments impacted the adjusted effective tax rate in the current quarter. The prior year quarter adjusted effective tax rate excluded the applicable tax impact associated with expenses related to legacy litigation.
Lastly, average diluted shares outstanding decreased 5% to 269.6 million in the third quarter compared to 283.8 million in the prior year quarter as we effectively allocate capital. The company repurchased 2.7 million Class A ordinary shares for approximately $300 million in the third quarter. The company has $3 billion of remaining authorization under its share repurchase program. Actual shares outstanding on September 30 were 263.5 million, and there are approximately 6 million additional dilutive equivalents. Estimated Q4 2016 beginning dilutive share count is approximately 269 million, subject to share price movements, share issuance and share repurchase.
Now let me turn to the next slide to highlight our solid balance sheet and strong cash flow growth on Slide 10. At September 30, 2016, cash and short-term investments increased to $946 million. Total debt outstanding was approximately $6.2 billion, and total debt-to-EBITDA on a GAAP basis was 2.4x, similar to the prior quarter. Cash flow from operations for the first 9 months increased 14% or $180 million to $1.5 billion, driven by lower pension contributions, an increase in net income, working capital improvements and lower cash taxes. Free cash flow as defined by cash flow from operations less CapEx increased 24% or $252 million to $1.3 billion, reflecting strong growth in cash flow from operations and a $72 million decrease in CapEx. Looking forward, we expect to deliver strong double-digit free cash flow growth for the full year 2016, reflecting further progress towards our near-term goal of $2.4 billion of free cash flow for the full year 2017.
Turning to the next slide to discuss our significant increases in free cash flow. We value the firm based on free cash flow and allocate capital to maximize free cash flow returns. Free cash flow of $2.4 billion for the full year 2017 is not our end goal as we expect to deliver sustainable strong free cash flow growth on an annual basis beyond 2017.
There are 4 primary areas that we expect to contribute to our near-term goal of delivering $2.4 billion for the full year 2017. The first is continued operational performance, driven by organic revenue growth and margin expansion. The second is working capital improvements as we focus on closing the gap between receivables and payables. We've made substantial progress in this area over the last 5 years with further opportunity to increase free cash flow by over $500 million. Third is declining uses of cash for pension contributions, CapEx and restructuring, which we expect to free up more than $105 million of annual free cash flow between the end of 2015 and '17. And fourth, lower cash tax payments reflecting a lower effective tax rate.
Turning to our pension plans. We've taken significant steps to reduce the volatility and liability of our plans. In the first half of 2016, we completed 2 transactions to materially derisk our pension liabilities in the U.K., and we'll continue to actively manage derisking opportunities as they make financial sense. Further, we currently expect pension contributions to decline by approximately $44 million to $150 million in 2016 and expect noncash pension income on an underlying basis to be a modest benefit in 2016 versus 2015.
In summary, we delivered solid organic revenue growth, overall operating margin improvement despite certain anticipated headwinds in the quarter and continued to deliver double-digit free cash flow growth. For the first 9 months, results reflect positive performance across each of our key metrics heading into our seasonally strongest quarter. With the strong finish to the year, we are well on track in 2016 to deliver meaningful progress towards our near-term goal of $2.4 billion in free cash flow for the full year 2017.
With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to the operator for questions."

The numbers are really not apples-to-apples in any way, shape or form. So for us, the enrollment numbers really aren't as relevant at this point anymore. We've got so many off-cycle enrollments now on the horizon, a project-related revenue which is much more substantial than ever before, and this really ends up being a platform for us. We're seeing things like elective benefits, whether it's life, home, long-term visibility, short-term visibility, it's a very, very positive sort of set of developments for us. And if you look at it as a business, again, less about enrollment, about the business overall, this is double-digit revenue growth on exchanges for us. We moved to profitability last year. It's going to obviously be stronger this year. But I'd say from a macro standpoint, I mean, look at where we are in the exchanges. This is strong and steady growth. You know we've been the largest active, the largest retiree. You mentioned Starbucks, we don't mention our clients, but we are very privileged. Starbucks has a well-earned reputation for defining excellence in employee value proposition, and we help them deliver on that through our exchange. So we're very excited about what that means overall. So for us, this is just an exceptionally strong platform for us. And I would say, our pipeline is as strong as it's ever been. So there is no waning, there is no backing up, there is no deferring. It's as strong as it's ever been. Having said that, Dave, I still want to emphasize, and we've been saying this from the beginning, this is not a change in direction, the exchanges are an exceptionally strong solution for a subset of our clients, but it's really part of the overall health platform, which we feel very, very strong about."

I would note, last year, we had an extraordinary legal -- legacy litigation settlement of about $140 million, but we feel really good about the free cash flow growth for the full year 2016. We're on track to double-digit growth in free cash flow this year, and we're well on track to the $2.4 billion in free cash flow in 2017. So we feel really good about the growth in cash flow, and we feel equally good about the way in which we're deploying that cash on a really disciplined return on capital basis. And so we continue to see share repurchase as the highest return on capital opportunity across Aon. It really sets the bar. But equally, we've actually done over $0.5 billion of M&A year-to-date, and we feel really good about the opportunities, like Friedberg, like elective benefits, which are huge growth opportunities for us. And so we're very excited about the deployment of the cash as much as we are about the growth in free cash flow itself."

Let me describe kind of the rationale behind it. First of all, our clients tell us every day cyber is becoming an increasingly important concern for them, an important risk for them. If you think about what insurance has been able to do in the context of that risk, we roughly placed together the entire industry about, we call it, $2 billion, a little over $2 billion of premium. And Adam, that's good. That's terrific, but if you think about the $2 billion in premium in the context of $400 billion in client reported losses. And so for us we've only tapped the surface and started really delivering on the needs of our clients. And if you ask yourself -- and by the way, in the context of that, as you described it, appreciate you describing it, we have an awesome capability, the best in the industry, leading position, exceptional capability in the context of what insurance does. What we have essentially said is we got to do more for our clients. We got to take the capability we've got and build on it. And the way you build on it is not to bring more issuance expertise in but bring more cyber expertise in and really help insurers and capital understand how to quantify and deal with cyber risk in a way in which you would actually open up more capital. So instead of $2 billion in premium, it gets $400 billion in reported losses. We could do much, much better than that. And straws fiber is simply the preeminent platform in the world, in our view, around how to do that so this is a firm that's publicly reported has covered and helped remediate, understand, identify and deal with some of the most sophisticated complex cyber challenges in the world today. Imagine combining that capability with what we have from a capital and insurance side, that's going to open up just tremendous opportunities, we believe, to bring better solutions to our clients in a much more comprehensible way, which is why we're very excited to bring these assets together. And I can tell you we've had incredible client reaction. They see this logic immediately. They see the opportunity to take what is a very distributed risk in cyber because it attacks you from everywhere. They know it requires an integrated solution, and this is now the first they're going to get a chance to put some of those pieces together, and this is really a role a risk manager come play to take a broader view across the organization to help their CIOs and CEOs do this in a more effective way. So for us at this is terrific. And for Strauss fiber we are excited to be able to actually take the capability that they deliver to clients every day and back that up with capital. So if you think about it, it really is a net-net new creation of opportunity for our clients and in doing so net for Aon."

Just wondering that $500 million sort of maybe what's the runway, how long will that take. And in addition, you also talked about lower cash tax payments. Do you believe that there's opportunity to go below the 19% and maybe where can that go over time?"

So Quentin, I think the first question on working capital, what we would say is, we really think about it as days sales outstanding, so the days it takes to collect cash from clients; and days payables, which is the days it takes -- we collect cash",413,"Sure. So Quentin, I think the first question on working capital, what we would say is, we really think about it as days sales outstanding, so the days it takes to collect cash from clients; and days payables, which is the days it takes -- we collect cash or we pay suppliers. And right now we run negative working capital, and we believe for a professional services firm that being working capital neutral is the right goal. And in fact, in some of our leading countries, we're actually working capital positive. So we certainly see it as more than achievable. And so to get from where we are today to working capital neutral is a little over $500 million in free cash flow. So we feel really good about the ability to collect a further $500 million of working capital. It will take multiple years. It'll take 8 to 10 years to get that because it's not sort of some big bang effort. It's continued improvements and process. It's continued improvements in contract terms. A number of our contract terms are annual or multi-year agreements. And so it will absolutely take a long period of time to get there. So I don't want to sort of overplay sort of amount you're going to get in any one year, and so that's sort of on the working capital. And then the other thing I think I would note is, as you look at our working capital, you can see the improvements in receivables. If you divide receivables by revenue trailing 12 months, from Q3 the last 12 months, you can see we actually improve DSO on the next quarterly reported basis by 2 days, and so we continue to make progress. And I'll tell you that on BPO, we improved by 4 days. You can't see that externally, but we're continuing to make improvements on both fronts. And then in terms of the opportunity, on the tax side, what I would say is we really feel good about the sustainability of our 19% effective tax rate. We do run a global capital pool. We do see statutory rates around the world declining, particularly in the U.K., and we have growing business in emerging markets which happened to have lower tax rates. And so we feel really good therefore about the sustainability of the 19% and, therefore, opportunity to have improvements in cash taxes as cash taxes catch up to the lower effective tax rate."

If you rewound 5 years, we had 30-plus clients who had on-premises BPO. And today, it's in the midteens with every one of those clients moving from on-premise to the cloud with us. And so it is a fantastic value proposition for clients to do this. On average, clients are saving 30% of costs in moving to the cloud. And so -- and they get a much more effective solution, and so we do see the majority of our clients moving that way and we would expect that to continue. In terms of the margin profile of the business, today, it is a low single-digit margin business and it's moving to a midteens margin business over time. And so we do see that opportunity primarily driven by that cloud growth which is enormous. And as Greg described, I really just describe the cloud opportunity in HR and there is a cloud opportunity which we're increasingly seen as very happy HR customers actually want to move to cloud financials as well to actually bring together and get the same value proposition they got in HR and financials."

So to think back to the commentary we've had on these call, if I'm literally going back almost 10 years, everything we do is built off a foundation that Christa has set up and applied across the firm around return on invested capital. And one of the ways we can actually apply capital and a way that serve our clients most effectively and you've seen us do that over the years. And if you step back over the last 10 years, we've deployed probably, call it, $15 billion in capital, of which, call it, roughly half or more than that buyback, roughly half is on acquisitions. So net-net, this is obviously a very positive story and will continue to be very positive story for us. Within that context, you'll see us continuously try to look for ways to optimize return on invested capital on behalf of clients, strengthen the firm, double down on areas that we can grow and build capability in the areas of risk, retirement, health, talent et cetera, communication. So you see us doing that. That will drive everything we do. It's also why, in that context, Christa described and I described, the team described, buyback sets the benchmark for that. And then against that, we make acquisitions that are accretive against that benchmark, and that really has been the formulation, the foundation of exactly everything we've done and we'll continue to do that. And we're less worried about kind of a quarter plus or minus or a year plus or minus worried about and focused on -- in fact, maniacally focused on how we built this for Aon over time."

In fact, in many respects, what we've done is invest very, very heavily to increase operating leverage in the business, make the acquisitions Christa described to strengthen our position but, frankly",531,"We don't see it that way, Charles, as you might expect. In fact, in many respects, what we've done is invest very, very heavily to increase operating leverage in the business, make the acquisitions Christa described to strengthen our position but, frankly, gives us the ability to create net new demand on behalf of clients and substantially increase growth trajectory. You've actually seen it. if you think about sort of our performance in the third quarter, what this is a reflection of is certainly not the insurance environment. It's really a reflection of our ability to create net new demand and help clients succeed. So if you think about it, our view is if you think about some of the 3 or 4 years that we look to, to grow, obviously, there's all the traditional areas around property/casualty D&O and we think we made this multi-year investment to increase operating leverage in something called the Aon Client Promise. This is not just talk. This is a very real mechanics on how we interact and support clients every day. That's what's resulted in record new retention. That's resulted in record new business -- and besides record new business. And yet we're still relatively small when you think about sort of the opportunity to build market share globally. So we've got capability to build market share and compete globally in a way that we think is actually quite extraordinary, and that's called a tradition. In addition to that, we have capabilities in the areas outside the core that we're investing heavily in, call it a couple of examples, in Affinity and health and benefits, these are 2 areas reported up through our risk business that are $1 billion-plus businesses growing well above mid-single-digit with opportunities for margin expansion. So this is now a second full category, completely outside anything that we've just described. And then, finally, very exciting for us is we made substantial investments in data and analytics that we believe more than anyone else. And you see that coming out in manifestations in real things with clients. I mean Aon Client Treaty is simply the biggest transaction in the history of Lloyd's. We've got thousands of clients now taking advantage of that. It's incredibly impactful for them. Aon InPoint, 45-plus carriers onboard working with that, Aon Review. What we did in the U.S. mortgage, we literally are creating a $10 billion business out of just net new. So in many respects, Charles, we would describe what we've come to as sort of a set of opportunities to accelerate our ability to grow in the current environment irrespective of what happened sort of in the insurance environment. So for us, we're excited about the progress and we have real confidence that '17 and '18 we will bring more opportunity. And the final thing I would say about it is this idea of operating leverage. We're not just putting on net new revenue. This is a revenue that we believe has operational leverage different than a revenue we put on 3 or 4 years ago and how we've actually brought in on board which means we've got larger opportunities which are substantial."

Joining me here today is our CFO, Christa Davies.I would note that there are slides available on our website for you to follow along with our commentary today, and",1511,"Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter 2016 conference call. Joining me here today is our CFO, Christa Davies.
I would note that there are slides available on our website for you to follow along with our commentary today, and consistent with previous quarters, I'd like to cover 2 areas before turning the call over to Christa for further financial review. First is our performance against key metrics we communicate to shareholders. And second is overall organic growth performance, including continued areas of strategic investment across Aon.
On the first topic, our performance versus key metrics. Each quarter, we measure our performance against the key metrics we focus on achieving over the course of the year: grow organically, expand margins, increase earnings per share and deliver free cash flow growth.
Turning to Slide 3. In the third quarter, organic revenue growth was 4%, including growth across every major business, highlighted by 5% growth in both the Americas Retail Brokerage and Outsourcing businesses. Operating margin increased 10 basis points, reflecting modest improvement in Risk Solutions. EPS increased 4% to $1.29, primarily reflecting the effective capital management and underlying operational improvements. And finally, free cash flow for the 9 months is up 24%, reflecting strong cash flow from operations and a decline in capital expenditures.
Overall, we continue to strengthen the firm with positive performance across each of our key metrics for both the third quarter and the first 9 months of 2016, highlighted by solid organic revenue growth across both Risk Solutions and HR Solutions and strong double-digit growth in free cash flow.
Turning to Slide 4, on the second topic of growth and investment. I'm going to spend the next few minutes discussing the quarter for both of our segments. In Risk Solutions, organic revenue growth was 3% compared to 1% in the prior year quarter, driven by improved growth across all major businesses. As we've discussed previously, we're driving a set of initiatives to maximize return on invested capital and making strategic investments that are strengthening underlying performance and positioning our Risk Solutions segment for long-term growth and improved operating leverage, with management of our renewal book portfolio through our proactive partnership we call Aon Client Promise, which is driving retention rates of more than 90% on average across Retail Brokerage, including record retention rates of 94% in the U.S. and EMEA; new business generation of roughly $265 million in the third quarter across Retail Brokerage, including double-digit growth in Latin America, Affinity and EMEA; and another consecutive quarter of record new business in U.S. Retail; 22 consecutive quarters of positive net new business in core treaty reinsurance; increased operating leverage from our significant investments in innovative technology and data and analytics, including Aon InPoint, a growing business where we help carriers become more competitive, effective and operationally efficient by integrating our market-leading data and analytics with strategic consulting and access to Aon's unmatched expertise. This includes the Risk Insight Platform which now captures 3.3 million trades and nearly $165 billion of bound premium as well as our reinsurer dashboard, Review.
Another example is our Aon Broking initiative to better match client need with insurer appetite for risk. And finally, we're expanding our content in global footprint through tuck-in acquisitions that increase scale in emerging markets and expand capability. For example, we recently announced the addition of Stroz Friedberg, a global leader in cyber security, bringing together 2 of the world's most highly skilled teams focused on cyber risk mitigation. This investment extends Aon's leading position in cyber risk brokerage and creates a comprehensive cyber advisory group, allowing Aon's clients to have access to the most advanced thinking and solutions in the industry.
Reflecting on our individual businesses within Risk Solutions. In the Americas, organic revenue growth was 5% compared to 4% in the prior year quarter. Exposures continue to be positive across the region while the impact from pricing was negative, resulting in relatively stable market impact overall. We saw solid growth across all regions, U.S. Retail, Latin America and Canada, including growth across all businesses, property casualty, health and benefits and Affinity. Results were highlighted by double-digit growth in Affinity's consumer solutions group and strong growth in U.S. Retail, driven by record new business generation and retention.
In international, organic revenue growth was 2% compared to 1% in the prior year quarter. The impact from pricing remains modestly negative on average, driven by fragile market conditions in various countries across Europe and Asia and continued pricing pressure in the Pacific region, while exposures are modestly improving. Similar to the Americas, we saw growth across every major region, including EMEA, Asia and the Pacific. Results were highlighted by continued strength in New Zealand, record retention in EMEA and solid growth in Asia. In Continental Europe, we continue to see signs of improving growth, reflecting Aon's strength in client leadership across the region despite a macroeconomic environment that remains challenged in various countries.
In Reinsurance, organic revenue growth was 1% compared to minus 4% in the prior year quarter. This marks the fourth consecutive quarter of positive growth in Reinsurance, further validating our previous guidance of an expected return to modest growth in 2016.
Results in the quarter were primarily driven by continued net new business generation in treaty and growth in facultative placements. Results were partially offset by an unfavorable market impact globally.
As highlighted on our prior discussions, pricing continues to moderate, cedent demand continues to increase and capital is being deployed to new markets including U.S. mortgage credit risk, life and annuity risk and other emerging risks such as cyber liability. We believe new opportunities for growth, combined with Aon's industry-leading data and analytics and integrated capital solutions, have positioned our Reinsurance business for long-term growth.
Turning to HR Solutions. Organic revenue growth was 4% overall, with solid growth across high-demand areas where we continue to invest in innovative solutions and client-serving capabilities. These investments reflect Aon Hewitt's leadership and in-depth understanding of market threats, including solutions to help plan sponsors both manage pension risk and drive better retirement outcomes for their employees. A strong area of growth has been delegated in investment consulting, where assets under management have grown from $10 billion to almost $90 billion in 5 years. We expect continued global growth in this area as sponsors are faced with regulatory changes and increasingly complex global markets, continuing investments to strengthen our industry-leading portfolio of health solutions covering the full range of benefit strategies, client size and funding choices, including our suite of private health care exchanges.
We view health as a substantial long-term opportunity. We are the industry leader in managing unique company or employee population needs today, and our superior advisory capabilities allows to have clients evolve when their needs change and priorities shift and as the health care landscape continues to evolve.
We also continue to invest in Software-as-a-Service models in our HR BPO business, where growth of new clients and conversion of existing clients is driving strong demands as well as the expansion of our capabilities to include financial implementations.
And finally, we're investing in data and analytics in our health, retirement, investment and Talent & Rewards businesses to provide superior advice to drive better outcomes for our clients and our clients' employees.
Turning to the individual businesses within HR Solutions. In Consulting Services, organic revenue growth was 3%, similar to the prior year quarter. Results primarily reflect continued growth in retirement consulting, driven by demand for delegated investment consulting services as an increasing amount of clients find significant value in Aon's ability to provide advice and manage their retirement assets.
We saw growth in communications consulting, where clients proactively preparing their employees in advance of annual enrollment season as well as certain project-related work. Results in the quarter also include solid growth in our compensation consulting practice.
In Outsourcing, organic revenue growth was 5%, similar to the prior year quarter. Results reflect strong growth in HR BPO, driven by new client wins in cloud-based solutions. And we saw strong growth in our health exchange business for off-cycle enrollments and certain project-related work. Results in the quarter were partially offset by an anticipated modest decline in benefits administration.
Overall, in HR Solutions, we are firmly on track for improved organic revenue growth in both businesses for the second half of the year, driven by continued growth in high demand areas where we've been investing, combined with seasonal strength in the fourth quarter.
In summary, our performance marks another quarter of progress, reflecting strong organic revenue growth across both segments, effective capital management and substantial free cash flow generation towards our near-term goal of $2.4 billion for the full year of 2017. Looking forward, we expect a strong finish to the year as we head into our seasonally strongest quarter with continued long-term growth, driven by an unmatched level of investment in advisory and analytic capabilities across our portfolio.
With that said, I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Christa for further financial review. Christa?"
119853,404166436,1065096,"Aon plc, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2016",2016-10-28,"Earnings Calls","Aon plc","Executives","Thank you so much, Greg, and good morning, everyone. As Greg noted, our results reflect solid organic revenue growth across both segments, substantial free cash flow generation and effective capital management, highlighted by $300 million of share repurch",1339,"Thank you so much, Greg, and good morning, everyone. As Greg noted, our results reflect solid organic revenue growth across both segments, substantial free cash flow generation and effective capital management, highlighted by $300 million of share repurchase in the quarter and more than $1 billion of share repurchase year-to-date.
Now let me turn to the financial results for the quarter on Page 6 of the presentation. Our core EPS performance, excluding certain items, increased 4% to $1.29 per share for the third quarter compared to $1.24 in the prior year quarter. Certain items that were adjusted for in the core EPS performance and highlighted in the schedules on Page 12 of the press release include noncash intangible asset amortization. Also included in the results was a $0.01 per share favorable impact related to foreign currency translation due primarily to the U.S. dollar strength against the pound. If currency do remain stable at today's rates, we would expect foreign currency translation to have a modest positive impact in the fourth quarter.
Now let me talk about each of the segments on the next slide. In our Risk Solutions segment, organic growth was 3%, operating margin increased 10 basis points to 20.9% and operating income increased 2% compared to the prior year quarter. Reported results are in line with our previous guidance of modest operating income growth in the third quarter. Operating margin improvement of 10 basis points reflects solid organic revenue growth and an 80 basis points favorable impact from foreign currency translation, partially offset by an unfavorable impact from the timing of certain compensation expenses and a minus 50 basis point unfavorable impact from higher E&O expense in the quarter.
For the first 9 months, operating margin improved 60 basis points, and operating income increased 3%. Anticipating a strong performance in the fourth quarter, we are fully on track to deliver improved operating income growth and further margin expansion for the full year, reflecting continued progress towards our long-term target of 26%.
Turning to the HR Solutions segment. Organic revenue growth was 4%, operating margin decreased 30 basis points to 17.1% and operating income decreased 4% compared to the prior year quarter. Operating income results include a $7 million or minus 70 basis points of legacy IT contract costs incurred in the quarter. This impact as well as an anticipated minus 70 basis point unfavorable impact related to previous portfolio repositioning activities and a minus 20 basis point unfavorable impact from foreign currency more than offset solid organic growth in the quarter.
For the first 9 months, operating margin decreased 70 basis points, and operating income decreased 8%. As discussed previously, we continue to take steps to reduce certain costs that remained after disposition of 2 businesses in the last 12 months as well as optimize our global cost structure in areas such as IT, real estate and global procurements. Combined with an expected strong performance in the fourth quarter, we are fully on track to continued margin expansion towards our long-term operating margin target of 22%.
Now let me discuss a few of the line items outside of the operating segments on Slide 9. Unallocated expenses were $42 million compared to $45 million in the prior year quarter. Interest income was $1 million compared to $3 million in the prior year quarter. Interest expense decreased $2 million to $70 million due to a decline in costs related to certain derivative hedging programs, which have now expired. Other income in both the current and prior year quarters included gains on certain long-term investments. Going forward, we expect a run rate of approximately $45 million per quarter of unallocated expense, $3 million per quarter of interest income and $70 million per quarter of interest expense.
Turning to taxes. The adjusted effective tax rate on net income from continuing operations, excluding the applicable tax impact associated with noncash pension settlements in the first half of the year, increased to 18.2% compared to 16% in the prior year quarter. Changes in the geographic distribution of income and certain favorable discrete tax adjustments impacted the adjusted effective tax rate in the current quarter. The prior year quarter adjusted effective tax rate excluded the applicable tax impact associated with expenses related to legacy litigation.
Lastly, average diluted shares outstanding decreased 5% to 269.6 million in the third quarter compared to 283.8 million in the prior year quarter as we effectively allocate capital. The company repurchased 2.7 million Class A ordinary shares for approximately $300 million in the third quarter. The company has $3 billion of remaining authorization under its share repurchase program. Actual shares outstanding on September 30 were 263.5 million, and there are approximately 6 million additional dilutive equivalents. Estimated Q4 2016 beginning dilutive share count is approximately 269 million, subject to share price movements, share issuance and share repurchase.
Now let me turn to the next slide to highlight our solid balance sheet and strong cash flow growth on Slide 10. At September 30, 2016, cash and short-term investments increased to $946 million. Total debt outstanding was approximately $6.2 billion, and total debt-to-EBITDA on a GAAP basis was 2.4x, similar to the prior quarter. Cash flow from operations for the first 9 months increased 14% or $180 million to $1.5 billion, driven by lower pension contributions, an increase in net income, working capital improvements and lower cash taxes. Free cash flow as defined by cash flow from operations less CapEx increased 24% or $252 million to $1.3 billion, reflecting strong growth in cash flow from operations and a $72 million decrease in CapEx. Looking forward, we expect to deliver strong double-digit free cash flow growth for the full year 2016, reflecting further progress towards our near-term goal of $2.4 billion of free cash flow for the full year 2017.
Turning to the next slide to discuss our significant increases in free cash flow. We value the firm based on free cash flow and allocate capital to maximize free cash flow returns. Free cash flow of $2.4 billion for the full year 2017 is not our end goal as we expect to deliver sustainable strong free cash flow growth on an annual basis beyond 2017.
There are 4 primary areas that we expect to contribute to our near-term goal of delivering $2.4 billion for the full year 2017. The first is continued operational performance, driven by organic revenue growth and margin expansion. The second is working capital improvements as we focus on closing the gap between receivables and payables. We've made substantial progress in this area over the last 5 years with further opportunity to increase free cash flow by over $500 million. Third is declining uses of cash for pension contributions, CapEx and restructuring, which we expect to free up more than $105 million of annual free cash flow between the end of 2015 and '17. And fourth, lower cash tax payments reflecting a lower effective tax rate.
Turning to our pension plans. We've taken significant steps to reduce the volatility and liability of our plans. In the first half of 2016, we completed 2 transactions to materially derisk our pension liabilities in the U.K., and we'll continue to actively manage derisking opportunities as they make financial sense. Further, we currently expect pension contributions to decline by approximately $44 million to $150 million in 2016 and expect noncash pension income on an underlying basis to be a modest benefit in 2016 versus 2015.
In summary, we delivered solid organic revenue growth, overall operating margin improvement despite certain anticipated headwinds in the quarter and continued to deliver double-digit free cash flow growth. For the first 9 months, results reflect positive performance across each of our key metrics heading into our seasonally strongest quarter. With the strong finish to the year, we are well on track in 2016 to deliver meaningful progress towards our near-term goal of $2.4 billion in free cash flow for the full year 2017.
With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to the operator for questions."

And the direct result of that measurable is retention and something we also call rollovers, not only keeping the client but also doing more and serving them more effectively. And if you look at sort of where we are, we're a 90-plus-percent retention business. 94% is sort of in the U.S. And the fourth quarter is our strongest quarter by far. But you can imagine, we've got pretty good visibility in the sort of momentum and direction for that and feel good about our ability to close the year. And in terms of -- on the health care exchange piece, happy to talk more about it. If you like, we feel very, very good about our progress. We have great momentum on the exchange side but want to emphasize, for us, this is much -- it's part of a much, much bigger platform, much bigger perspective around the health platform overall and which we're bringing a broad set of solutions to the table, big companies, medium-sized companies, small companies and a complete suite of efforts to the table. And for us on the health side, we're very excited about it. This is a double-digit growth opportunity for us that we're already achieving. We see more potential going forward with substantial margin improvement potential as well. So we feel good about the momentum for the fourth quarter and into 2017."

The numbers are really not apples-to-apples in any way, shape or form. So for us, the enrollment numbers really aren't as relevant at this point anymore. We've got so many off-cycle enrollments now on the horizon, a project-related revenue which is much more substantial than ever before, and this really ends up being a platform for us. We're seeing things like elective benefits, whether it's life, home, long-term visibility, short-term visibility, it's a very, very positive sort of set of developments for us. And if you look at it as a business, again, less about enrollment, about the business overall, this is double-digit revenue growth on exchanges for us. We moved to profitability last year. It's going to obviously be stronger this year. But I'd say from a macro standpoint, I mean, look at where we are in the exchanges. This is strong and steady growth. You know we've been the largest active, the largest retiree. You mentioned Starbucks, we don't mention our clients, but we are very privileged. Starbucks has a well-earned reputation for defining excellence in employee value proposition, and we help them deliver on that through our exchange. So we're very excited about what that means overall. So for us, this is just an exceptionally strong platform for us. And I would say, our pipeline is as strong as it's ever been. So there is no waning, there is no backing up, there is no deferring. It's as strong as it's ever been. Having said that, Dave, I still want to emphasize, and we've been saying this from the beginning, this is not a change in direction, the exchanges are an exceptionally strong solution for a subset of our clients, but it's really part of the overall health platform, which we feel very, very strong about."

We really are excited about the addition of  Stroz Friedberg in addition to some exceptional talent we brought in on the topic of cyber. Let me describe kind of the rationale behind it. First of all, our clients tell us every day cyber is becoming an increasingly important concern for them, important risk for them. And if you think about what insurance has been able to do in the context of that risk, we roughly placed together the entire industry about, we call it, $2 billion -- a little over $2 billion in premium. And Adam, that's good. That's terrific, but if you think about the $2 billion in premium in the context of $400 billion in client reported losses. And so for us, we've only tapped the surface and started really delivering on the needs of our clients. And if you ask yourself -- and by the way, in the context of that, as you described, appreciate you describing it, we have an awesome capability, the best in the industry, leading position, exceptional capability in the context of what insurance does. What we have essentially said is we've got to do more for our clients. We've got to take the capability we've got and build on it. And the way you build on it is not to bring more insurance expertise in but bring more cyber expertise in and really help insurers and capital understand how to quantify and deal with cyber risk in a way in which you would actually open up more capital. So instead of $2 billion in premium, it gets $400 billion in reported losses, we could do much, much better than that. And Stroz Friedberg is simply the preeminent platform in the world, in our view, around how to do that. So this is a firm that's publicly reported has covered and helped remediate, understand, identify and deal with some of the most sophisticated, complex cyber challenges in the world today. Imagine combining that capability with what we have from a capital and insurance side, that's going to open up just tremendous opportunities, we believe, to bring better solutions to our clients in a much more comprehensive way, which is why we're very excited to bring these assets together. And I can tell you, we've had incredible client reaction. They see this logic immediately. They see the opportunity to take what is a very distributed risk in cyber because it attacks you from everywhere. They know it requires an integrated solution, and this is now the first time they're going to get a chance to put some of those pieces together. And this is really a role a risk manager can play to take a broader view across their organization to help their CIOs and CISOs to do this in a more effective way. So for us, this is terrific. And for Stroz Friedberg, we're excited to be able to actually take the capability that they deliver to clients every day and back that up with capital. So if you think about it, it really is a net-net new creation of opportunity for our clients, and in doing so, a net new for Aon."

So Quentin, I think on the first question on working capital, what we would say is we really think about it as days sales outstanding, so the days it takes to collect cash from clients; and days payables, which is the days that it takes -- we collect cash -- or we pay suppliers. And right now, we run negative working capital, and we believe for a professional services firm that being working capital neutral is the right goal. And in fact, in some of our leading countries, we're actually working capital positive. So we certainly see it more than achievable. And so to get from where we are today to working capital neutral is a little over $500 million in free cash flow. So we feel really good about the ability to collect the further $500 million of working capital. It will take multiple years. It'll take 8 to 10 years to get that because it is -- it's not sort of some big bang effort. It's continued improvements in process. It's continued improvements in contract terms. A number of our contract terms are annual or multi-year agreements. And so it will absolutely take a long period of time to get there. So I don't want to sort of overplay the sort of amount you're going to get in any 1 year. So that's sort of on the working capital. And then the other thing I think I would note is as you look at our working capital, you can see the improvements in receivables. If you divide receivables by revenue trailing 12 months, from Q3 the last 12 months, you can see we actually improved DSO on a next annually reported basis by 2 days. And so we continue to make progress. And I'll tell you that on BPO, we improved by 4 days. You can't see that externally, but we're continuing to make improvements on both fronts. And then in terms of the opportunity, on the tax side, what I would say is we really feel good about the sustainability of our 19% effective tax rate. We do run a global capital pool. We do see statutory rates around the world declining, particularly in the U.K. And we have growing business in emerging markets, which happened to have lower tax rates. And so we feel really good, therefore, about the sustainability of the 19% and, therefore, opportunity to have improvements in cash taxes as cash taxes catch up to the lower effective tax rate."

And so it is a fantastic value proposition for clients to do this. On average, clients are saving 30% of costs in moving to the cloud. And so -- and they get a much more effective solution. And so we do see the majority of our clients moving that way, and we expect that to continue. In terms of the margin profile of the business, today, it is a low single-digit margin business, and it's moving to a mid-teens margin business over time. And so we do see that opportunity primarily driven by that cloud growth, which is enormous. And as Greg described, I'd really just describe the cloud opportunity in HR, and there is a cloud opportunity which we're increasingly seeing as very happy HR customers actually want to move to cloud financials as well to actually bring together and get the same value proposition they got in HR and financials."

So to think back to commentary we've had on these calls, so literally going back almost 10 years, everything we do is built off a foundation that Christa has set up and applied across the firm around return on invested capital and one of the ways we can actually apply capital and a way that serve our clients most effectively. And you've seen us do that over the years. And if you step back over the last 10 years, we've deployed probably, call it, $15 billion in capital, of which, call it, roughly half or more of that buyback, roughly half is on some acquisitions. So net-net, this is obviously a very positive story and will continue to be a very positive story for us. Within that context, you'll see us continuously try to look for ways to optimize return on invested capital on behalf of clients, strengthen the firm, double down in areas that we can grow and build capability, in the areas of risk, retirement, health, talent, et cetera, communication. So you see us doing that. That will drive everything we do. It's also why, in that context, Christa described and I described, the team described, buyback sets the benchmark for that. And then against that, we make acquisitions that are accretive against that benchmark. And that really has been the formulation, the foundation of exactly everything we've done, and we'll continue to do that. And we're less worried about kind of a quarter plus or minus or a year plus or minus worried about and focused on -- in fact, maniacally focused on how we build this for Aon over time."

In fact, in many respects, what we've done is invest very, very heavily to increase operating leverage in the business, make the acquisitions Christa described to strengthen our position that, frankly, gives us the ability to create net new demand on behalf of clients and substantially increase growth trajectory. You've actually seen it. If you think about sort of our performance in the third quarter, what this is a reflection of is certainly not the insurance environment, it's really a reflection of our ability to create net new demand and help clients succeed. So if you think about it, our view is if you think about some of the 3 or 4 areas that we look to, to grow, obviously, there's all the traditional areas around property, casualty, D&O, and we made this multi-year investment to increase operating leverage in something called the Aon Client Promise. This is not just talk. This is very real mechanics on how we interact and support clients every day. That's what's resulted in record new retention. And that's resulted in record new business, so -- emphasize record new business. And yet we're still relatively small when you think about sort of the opportunity to build market share globally. So we've got capability to build market share and compete globally in a way that we think is actually quite extraordinary, and that's called a tradition. In addition to that, we have capabilities in the areas outside the core that we're investing heavily in, call it, a couple of examples, in Affinity and health and benefits, these are 2 areas reported up through our risk business that are $1 billion-plus businesses growing well above mid-single-digit with opportunities for margin expansion. So this is now a second full category, completely outside anything that we've just described. And then, finally, very exciting for us is we made substantial investments in data and analytics, we believe, more than anyone else. And you see that coming out, a manifestation of real things with our clients. I mean, Aon Client Treaty is simply the single biggest transaction in the history of Lloyd's. We've got thousands of clients now taking advantage of that. It's incredibly impactful for them. Aon InPoint, 45-plus carriers onboard working with that; Aon Review. What we did in U.S. mortgage, we literally are creating a $10 billion business out of -- so it's just net new. So in many respects, Charles, we would describe what we've come to as sort of a set of opportunities to accelerate our ability to grow in the current environment irrespective of what happens sort of in the insurance environment. So for us, we're excited about the progress, and we have real confidence that '17 and '18 will bring more opportunity. And the final thing I would say about it is this idea of operating leverage. We're not just putting on net new revenue. This is a revenue that we believe has operational leverage different than a revenue we put on 3 or 4 years ago and how we've actually brought it on board, which means we've got margin opportunities which are substantial."

Welcome to our third quarter 2016 conference call. Joining me here today is our CFO, Christa Davies.
I would note that there are slides available on our website for you to follow along with our commentary today, and consistent with previous quarters, I'd like to cover 2 areas before turning the call over to Christa for further financial review. First is our performance against key metrics we communicate to shareholders. And second is overall organic growth performance, including continued areas of strategic investment across Aon.
On the first topic, our performance versus key metrics. Each quarter, we measure our performance against the key metrics we focus on achieving over the course of the year: grow organically, expand margins, increase earnings per share and deliver free cash flow growth.
Turning to Slide 3. In the third quarter, organic revenue growth was 4%, including growth across every major business, highlighted by 5% growth in both the Americas Retail Brokerage and Outsourcing businesses. Operating margin increased 10 basis points, reflecting modest improvement in Risk Solutions. EPS increased 4% to $1.29, primarily reflecting the effective capital management and underlying operational improvements. And finally, free cash flow for the 9 months is up 24%, reflecting strong cash flow from operations and a decline in capital expenditures.
Overall, we continue to strengthen the firm with positive performance across each of our key metrics for both the third quarter and the first 9 months of 2016, highlighted by solid organic revenue growth across both Risk Solutions and HR Solutions and strong double-digit growth in free cash flow.
Turning to Slide 4, on the second topic of growth and investment. I'm going to spend the next few minutes discussing the quarter for both of our segments. In Risk Solutions, organic revenue growth was 3% compared to 1% in the prior year quarter, driven by improved growth across all major businesses. As we've discussed previously, we're driving a set of initiatives to maximize return on invested capital and making strategic investments that are strengthening underlying performance and positioning our Risk Solutions segment for long-term growth and improved operating leverage, with management of our renewal book portfolio through our proactive partnership we call Aon Client Promise, which is driving retention rates of more than 90% on average across Retail Brokerage, including record retention rates of 94% in the U.S. and EMEA; new business generation of roughly $265 million in the third quarter across Retail Brokerage, including double-digit growth in Latin America, Affinity and EMEA; and another consecutive quarter of record new business in U.S. Retail; 22 consecutive quarters of positive net new business in core treaty reinsurance; increased operating leverage from our significant investments in innovative technology and data and analytics, including Aon InPoint, a growing business where we help carriers become more competitive, effective and operationally efficient by integrating our market-leading data and analytics with strategic consulting and access to Aon's unmatched expertise. This includes the Risk Insight Platform which now captures 3.3 million trades and nearly $165 billion of bound premium as well as our reinsurer dashboard, Review.
Another example is our Aon Broking initiative to better match client need with insurer appetite for risk. And finally, we're expanding our content in global footprint through tuck-in acquisitions that increase scale in emerging markets and expand capability. For example, we recently announced the addition of Stroz Friedberg, a global leader in cyber security, bringing together 2 of the world's most highly skilled teams focused on cyber risk mitigation. This investment extends Aon's leading position in cyber risk brokerage and creates a comprehensive cyber advisory group, allowing Aon's clients to have access to the most advanced thinking and solutions in the industry.
Reflecting on our individual businesses within Risk Solutions. In the Americas, organic revenue growth was 5% compared to 4% in the prior year quarter. Exposures continue to be positive across the region while the impact from pricing was negative, resulting in relatively stable market impact overall. We saw solid growth across all regions, U.S. Retail, Latin America and Canada, including growth across all businesses, property casualty, health and benefits and Affinity. Results were highlighted by double-digit growth in Affinity's consumer solutions group and strong growth in U.S. Retail, driven by record new business generation and retention.
In international, organic revenue growth was 2% compared to 1% in the prior year quarter. The impact from pricing remains modestly negative on average, driven by fragile market conditions in various countries across Europe and Asia and continued pricing pressure in the Pacific region, while exposures are modestly improving. Similar to the Americas, we saw growth across every major region, including EMEA, Asia and the Pacific. Results were highlighted by continued strength in New Zealand, record retention in EMEA and solid growth in Asia. In Continental Europe, we continue to see signs of improving growth, reflecting Aon's strength in client leadership across the region despite a macroeconomic environment that remains challenged in various countries.
In Reinsurance, organic revenue growth was 1% compared to minus 4% in the prior year quarter. This marks the fourth consecutive quarter of positive growth in Reinsurance, further validating our previous guidance of an expected return to modest growth in 2016.
Results in the quarter were primarily driven by continued net new business generation in treaty and growth in facultative placements. Results were partially offset by an unfavorable market impact globally.
As highlighted on our prior discussions, pricing continues to moderate, cedent demand continues to increase and capital is being deployed to new markets including U.S. mortgage credit risk, life and annuity risk and other emerging risks such as cyber liability. We believe new opportunities for growth, combined with Aon's industry-leading data and analytics and integrated capital solutions, have positioned our Reinsurance business for long-term growth.
Turning to HR Solutions. Organic revenue growth was 4% overall, with solid growth across high-demand areas where we continue to invest in innovative solutions and client-serving capabilities. These investments reflect Aon Hewitt's leadership and in-depth understanding of market trends, including solutions to help plan sponsors both manage pension risk and drive better retirement outcomes for their employees. A strong area of growth has been delegated investment consulting, where assets under management have grown from $10 billion to almost $90 billion in 5 years. We expect continued global growth in this area as sponsors are faced with regulatory changes and increasingly complex global markets, continuing investments to strengthen our industry-leading portfolio of health solutions covering the full range of benefit strategies, client size and funding choices, including our suite of private health care exchanges.
We view health as a substantial long-term opportunity. We are the industry leader in managing unique company or employee population needs today, and our superior advisory capabilities allows to help clients evolve when their needs change and priorities shift and as the health care landscape continues to evolve.
We also continue to invest in Software-as-a-Service models in our HR BPO business, where growth of new clients and conversion of existing clients is driving strong demands as well as the expansion of our capabilities to include financial implementations.
And finally, we're investing in data and analytics in our health, retirement, investment and Talent & Rewards businesses to provide superior advice to drive better outcomes for our clients and our clients' employees.
Turning to the individual businesses within HR Solutions. In Consulting Services, organic revenue growth was 3%, similar to the prior year quarter. Results primarily reflect continued growth in retirement consulting, driven by demand for delegated investment consulting services as an increasing amount of clients find significant value in Aon's ability to provide advice and manage their retirement assets.
We saw growth in communications consulting, where clients proactively preparing their employees in advance of annual enrollment season as well as certain project-related work. Results in the quarter also include solid growth in our compensation consulting practice.
In Outsourcing, organic revenue growth was 5%, similar to the prior year quarter. Results reflect strong growth in HR BPO, driven by new client wins in cloud-based solutions. And we saw strong growth in our health exchange business for off-cycle enrollments and certain project-related work. Results in the quarter were partially offset by an anticipated modest decline in benefits administration.
Overall, in HR Solutions, we are firmly on track for improved organic revenue growth in both businesses for the second half of the year, driven by continued growth in high demand areas where we've been investing, combined with seasonal strength in the fourth quarter.
In summary, our performance marks another quarter of progress, reflecting strong organic revenue growth across both segments, effective capital management and substantial free cash flow generation towards our near-term goal of $2.4 billion for the full year of 2017. Looking forward, we expect a strong finish to the year as we head into our seasonally strongest quarter with continued long-term growth, driven by our unmatched level of investment in advisory and analytic capabilities across our portfolio.
With that said, I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Christa for further financial review. Christa?"

As Greg noted, our results reflect solid organic revenue growth across both segments, substantial free cash flow generation and effective capital management, highlighted by $300 million of share repurch",1339,"Thank you so much, Greg, and good morning, everyone. As Greg noted, our results reflect solid organic revenue growth across both segments, substantial free cash flow generation and effective capital management, highlighted by $300 million of share repurchase in the quarter and more than $1 billion of share repurchase year-to-date.
Now let me turn to the financial results for the quarter on Page 6 of the presentation. Our core EPS performance, excluding certain items, increased 4% to $1.29 per share for the third quarter compared to $1.24 in the prior year quarter. Certain items that were adjusted for in the core EPS performance and highlighted in the schedules on Page 12 of the press release include noncash intangible asset amortization. Also included in the results was a $0.01 per share favorable impact related to foreign currency translation due primarily to the U.S. dollar strength against the pound. If currency do remain stable at today's rates, we would expect foreign currency translation to have a modest positive impact in the fourth quarter.
Now let me talk about each of the segments on the next slide. In our Risk Solutions segment, organic growth was 3%, operating margin increased 10 basis points to 20.9% and operating income increased 2% compared to the prior year quarter. Reported results are in line with our previous guidance of modest operating income growth in the third quarter. Operating margin improvement of 10 basis points reflects solid organic revenue growth and an 80 basis points favorable impact from foreign currency translation, partially offset by an unfavorable impact from the timing of certain compensation expenses and a minus 50 basis point unfavorable impact from higher E&O expense in the quarter.
For the first 9 months, operating margin improved 60 basis points, and operating income increased 3%. Anticipating a strong performance in the fourth quarter, we are fully on track to deliver improved operating income growth and further margin expansion for the full year, reflecting continued progress towards our long-term target of 26%.
Turning to the HR Solutions segment. Organic revenue growth was 4%, operating margin decreased 30 basis points to 17.1% and operating income decreased 4% compared to the prior year quarter. Operating income results include a $7 million or minus 70 basis points of legacy IT contract costs incurred in the quarter. This impact as well as an anticipated minus 70 basis point unfavorable impact related to previous portfolio repositioning activities and a minus 20 basis point unfavorable impact from foreign currency more than offset solid organic growth in the quarter.
For the first 9 months, operating margin decreased 70 basis points, and operating income decreased 8%. As discussed previously, we continue to take steps to reduce certain costs that remained after disposition of 2 businesses in the last 12 months as well as optimize our global cost structure in areas such as IT, real estate and global procurements. Combined with an expected strong performance in the fourth quarter, we are fully on track for continued margin expansion towards our long-term operating margin target of 22%.
Now let me discuss a few of the line items outside of the operating segments on Slide 9. Unallocated expenses were $42 million compared to $45 million in the prior year quarter. Interest income was $1 million compared to $3 million in the prior year quarter. Interest expense decreased $2 million to $70 million due to a decline in costs related to certain derivative hedging programs, which have now expired. Other income in both the current and prior year quarters included gains on certain long-term investments. Going forward, we expect a run rate of approximately $45 million per quarter of unallocated expense, $3 million per quarter of interest income and $70 million per quarter of interest expense.
Turning to taxes. The adjusted effective tax rate on net income from continuing operations, excluding the applicable tax impact associated with noncash pension settlements in the first half of the year, increased to 18.2% compared to 16% in the prior year quarter. Changes in the geographic distribution of income and certain favorable discrete tax adjustments impacted the adjusted effective tax rate in the current quarter. The prior year quarter adjusted effective tax rate excluded the applicable tax impact associated with expenses related to legacy litigation.
Lastly, average diluted shares outstanding decreased 5% to 269.6 million in the third quarter compared to 283.8 million in the prior year quarter as we effectively allocate capital. The company repurchased 2.7 million Class A ordinary shares for approximately $300 million in the third quarter. The company has $3 billion of remaining authorization under its share repurchase program. Actual shares outstanding on September 30 were 263.5 million, and there are approximately 6 million additional dilutive equivalents. Estimated Q4 2016 beginning dilutive share count is approximately 269 million, subject to share price movements, share issuance and share repurchase.
Now let me turn to the next slide to highlight our solid balance sheet and strong cash flow growth on Slide 10. At September 30, 2016, cash and short-term investments increased to $946 million. Total debt outstanding was approximately $6.2 billion, and total debt-to-EBITDA on a GAAP basis was 2.4x, similar to the prior quarter. Cash flow from operations for the first 9 months increased 14% or $180 million to $1.5 billion, driven by lower pension contributions, an increase in net income, working capital improvements and lower cash taxes. Free cash flow as defined by cash flow from operations less CapEx increased 24% or $252 million to $1.3 billion, reflecting strong growth in cash flow from operations and a $72 million decrease in CapEx. Looking forward, we expect to deliver strong double-digit free cash flow growth for the full year 2016, reflecting further progress towards our near-term goal of $2.4 billion of free cash flow for the full year 2017.
Turning to the next slide to discuss our significant increases in free cash flow. We value the firm based on free cash flow and allocate capital to maximize free cash flow returns. Free cash flow of $2.4 billion for the full year 2017 is not our end goal as we expect to deliver sustainable strong free cash flow growth on an annual basis beyond 2017.
There are 4 primary areas that we expect to contribute to our near-term goal of delivering $2.4 billion for the full year 2017. The first is continued operational performance, driven by organic revenue growth and margin expansion. The second is working capital improvements as we focus on closing the gap between receivables and payables. We've made substantial progress in this area over the last 5 years with further opportunity to increase free cash flow by over $500 million. Third is declining uses of cash for pension contributions, CapEx and restructuring, which we expect to free up more than $105 million of annual free cash flow between the end of 2015 and '17. And fourth, lower cash tax payments reflecting a lower effective tax rate.
Turning to our pension plans. We've taken significant steps to reduce the volatility and liability of our plans. In the first half of 2016, we completed 2 transactions to materially derisk our pension liabilities in the U.K., and we'll continue to actively manage derisking opportunities as they make financial sense. Further, we currently expect pension contributions to decline by approximately $44 million to $150 million in 2016, and expect noncash pension income on an underlying basis to be a modest benefit in 2016 versus 2015.
In summary, we delivered solid organic revenue growth, overall operating margin improvement despite certain anticipated headwinds in the quarter and continued to deliver double-digit free cash flow growth. For the first 9 months, results reflect positive performance across each of our key metrics heading into our seasonally strongest quarter. With a strong finish to the year, we are well on track in 2016 to deliver meaningful progress towards our near-term goal of $2.4 billion in free cash flow for the full year 2017.
With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to the operator for questions."

As you know, we've been -- I described the Aon Client Promise in my commentary, and part of that is really how we support clients every day. And the direct result of that measurable is retention and something we also call rollovers, not only keeping the client but also doing more and serving them more effectively. And if you look at sort of where we are, we're a 90-plus-percent retention business. 94% is sort of in the U.S. And the fourth quarter is our strongest quarter by far. But you can imagine, we've got pretty good visibility in the sort of momentum and direction for that and feel good about our ability to close the year. And in terms of -- on the health care exchange piece, happy to talk more about it -- that if you like. We feel very, very good about our progress. We have great momentum on the exchange side but want to emphasize, for us, this is much -- it's part of a much, much bigger platform, much bigger perspective around the health platform overall in which we're bringing a broad set of solutions to the table, big companies, medium-sized companies, small companies and a complete suite of efforts to the table. And for us on the health side, we're very excited about it. This is a double-digit growth opportunity for us that we're already achieving. We see more potential going forward with substantial margin improvement potential as well. So we feel good about the momentum for the fourth quarter and into 2017."

The numbers are really not apples-to-apples in any way, shape or form. So for us, the enrollment numbers really aren't as relevant at this point anymore. We've got so many off-cycle enrollments now on the horizon, a project-related revenue which is much more substantial than ever before, and this really ends up being a platform for us. We're seeing things like elective benefits, whether it's life, home, long-term visibility, short-term visibility, it's a very, very positive sort of set of developments for us. And if you look at it as a business, again, less about enrollment, about the business overall, this is double-digit revenue growth on exchanges for us. We moved to profitability last year. It's going to obviously be stronger this year. But I'd say from a macro standpoint, I mean, look at where we are in the exchanges. This is strong and steady growth. You know we've been the largest active, the largest retiree. You mentioned Starbucks, we don't mention our clients, but we are very privileged. Starbucks has a well-earned reputation for defining excellence in employee value proposition, and we help them deliver on that through our exchange. So we're very excited about what that means overall. So for us, this is just an exceptionally strong platform for us. And I would say, our pipeline is as strong as it's ever been. So there is no waning, there is no backing up, there is no deferring. It's as strong as it's ever been. Having said that, Dave, I still want to emphasize, and we've been saying this from the beginning, this is not a change in direction, the exchanges are an exceptionally strong solution for a subset of our clients, but it's really part of the overall health platform, which we feel very, very strong about."

But equally, we've actually done over $0.5 billion of M&A year-to-date, and we feel really good about the opportunities, like cyber, like elective benefits, which are huge growth opportunities for us. And so we're very excited about the deployment of the cash as much as we are about the growth in free cash flow itself."

We really are excited about the addition of  Stroz Friedberg in addition to some exceptional talent we brought in on the topic of cyber. Let me describe kind of the rationale behind it. First of all, our clients tell us every day cyber is becoming an",530,"Yes. We really are excited about the addition of  Stroz Friedberg in addition to some exceptional talent we brought in on the topic of cyber. Let me describe kind of the rationale behind it. First of all, our clients tell us every day cyber is becoming an increasingly important concern for them, important risk for them. And if you think about what insurance has been able to do in the context of that risk, we've roughly placed together the entire industry about, we call it, $2 billion -- a little over $2 billion in premium. And Adam, that's good. That's terrific, but if you think about the $2 billion in premium in the context of $400 billion in client reported losses. And so for us, we've only tapped the surface and started really delivering on the needs of our clients. And if you ask yourself -- and by the way, in the context of that, as you described, appreciate you describing it, we have an awesome capability, the best in the industry, leading position, exceptional capability in the context of what insurance does. What we have essentially said is we've got to do more for our clients. We've got to take the capability we've got and build on it. And the way you build on it is not to bring more insurance expertise in but bring more cyber expertise in and really help insurers and capital understand how to quantify and deal with cyber risk in a way in which you would actually open up more capital. So instead of $2 billion in premium, it gets $400 billion in reported losses, we could do much, much better than that. And Stroz Friedberg is simply the preeminent platform in the world, in our view, around how to do that. So this is a firm that's publicly reported has covered and helped remediate, understand, identify and deal with some of the most sophisticated, complex cyber challenges in the world today. Imagine combining that capability with what we have from a capital and insurance side, that's going to open up just tremendous opportunities, we believe, to bring better solutions to our clients in a much more comprehensive way, which is why we're very excited to bring these assets together. And I can tell you, we've had incredible client reaction. They see this logic immediately. They see the opportunity to take what is a very distributed risk in cyber because it attacks you from everywhere. They know it requires an integrated solution, and this is now the first time they're going to get a chance to put some of those pieces together. And this is really a role a risk manager can play to take a broader view across their organization to help their CIOs and CISOs to do this in a more effective way. So for us, this is terrific. And for Stroz Friedberg, we're excited to be able to actually take the capability they deliver to clients every day and back that up with capital. So if you think about it, it really is a net-net new creation of opportunity for our clients, and in doing so, a net new for Aon."

You said you have a further opportunity to increase free cash flow by over $500 million from working capital, from procurement and from accounts payable.

Just wondering, that $500 million, sort of maybe what's the runway? How long will that take? And in addition, you also talked about lower cash tax payments. Do you believe that there is opportunity to go below the 19%? And maybe where can that go over time?"

So Quentin, I think on the first question on working capital, what we would say is we really think about it as days sales outstanding, so the days it takes to collect cash from clients; and days payables, which is the days that it takes -- we collect cash -- or we pay suppliers. And right now, we run negative working capital, and we believe for a professional services firm that being working capital neutral is the right goal. And in fact, in some of our leading countries, we're actually working capital positive. So we certainly see it's more than achievable. And so to get from where we are today to working capital neutral is a little over $500 million in free cash flow. So we feel really good about the ability to collect the further $500 million of working capital. It will take multiple years. It'll take 8 to 10 years to get there because it is -- it's not sort of some big bang effort. It's continued improvements in process. It's continued improvements in contract terms. A number of our contract terms are annual or multi-year agreements. And so it will absolutely take a long period of time to get there. So I don't want to sort of overplay the sort of amount you're going to get in any 1 year. So that's sort of on the working capital. And then the other thing I think I would note is as you look at our working capital, you can see the improvements in receivables. If you divide receivables by revenue trailing 12 months, from Q3 the last 12 months, you can see we actually improved DSO on a next annually reported basis by 2 days. And so we continue to make progress. And I'll tell you that on BPO, we improved by 4 days. You can't see that externally, but we're continuing to make improvements on both fronts. And then in terms of the opportunity, on the tax side, what I would say is we really feel good about the sustainability of our 19% effective tax rate. We do run a global capital pool. We do see statutory rates around the world declining, particularly in the U.K. And we have growing business in emerging markets, which happened to have lower tax rates. And so we feel really good, therefore, about the sustainability of the 19% and, therefore, opportunity to have improvements in cash taxes as cash taxes catch up to the lower effective tax rate."

If you rewound 5 years, we had 30-plus clients who had on-premises BPO. And today, it's in the mid-teens, with every one of those clients moving from on-premise to the cloud with us. And so it is a fantastic value proposition for clients to do this. On average, clients are saving 30% of costs in moving to the cloud. And so -- and they get a much more effective solution. And so we do see the majority of our clients moving that way, and we expect that to continue. In terms of the margin profile of the business, today, it is a low single-digit margin business, and it's moving to a mid-teens margin business over time. And so we do see that opportunity primarily driven by that cloud growth, which is enormous. And as Greg described, I'd really just describe the cloud opportunity in HR, and there is a cloud opportunity which we're increasingly seeing as very happy HR customers actually want to move to cloud financials as well to actually bring together and get the same value proposition they got in HR and financials."

So to think back to commentary we've had on these calls, so literally going back almost 10 years, everything we do is built off a foundation that Christa has set up and applied across the firm around return on invested capital and one of the ways we can actually apply capital and a way that serve our clients most effectively. And you've seen us do that over the years. And if you step back over the last 10 years, we've deployed probably, call it, $15 billion in capital, of which, call it, roughly half or more of that buyback, roughly half is on some acquisitions. So net-net, this is obviously a very positive story and will continue to be a very positive story for us. Within that context, you'll see us continuously try to look for ways to optimize return on invested capital on behalf of clients, strengthen the firm, double down in areas that we can grow and build capability, in the areas of risk, retirement, health, talent, et cetera, communication. So you see us doing that. That will drive everything we do. It's also why, in that context, you hear Christa described and I described, the team described, buyback sets the benchmark for that. And then against that, we make acquisitions that are accretive against that benchmark. And that really has been the formulation, the foundation of exactly everything we've done, and we'll continue to do that.

I guess my question is, a good problem to have, and not maybe the problem, but at record retention and record new business in risk, does that set up a comparable challenge in 2017 for organic growth knowing that if you're at 94% retentions and you're feeling at 100%, does it just create -- an excellent result makes a tough year-over-year comp going into next year? Or you just don't -- the things that are transpiring don't set up like that?"

In fact, in many respects, what we've done is invest very, very heavily to increase operating leverage in the business, make the acquisitions Christa described to strengthen our position that, frankl",532,"We don't see it that way, Charles, as you might expect. In fact, in many respects, what we've done is invest very, very heavily to increase operating leverage in the business, make the acquisitions Christa described to strengthen our position that, frankly, gives us the ability to create net new demand on behalf of clients and substantially increase growth trajectory. You've actually seen it. If you think about sort of our performance in the third quarter, what this is a reflection of is certainly not the insurance environment, it's really a reflection of our ability to create net new demand and help clients succeed. So if you think about it, our view is if you think about some of the 3 or 4 areas that we look to, to grow, obviously, there's all the traditional areas around property, casualty, D&O, and we made this multi-year investment to increase operating leverage in something called the Aon Client Promise. This is not just talk. This is very real mechanics on how we interact and support clients every day. That's what's resulted in record new retention. And that's resulted in record new business, so -- emphasize record new business. And yet we're still relatively small when you think about sort of the opportunity to build market share globally. So we've got capability to build market share and compete globally in a way that we think is actually quite extraordinary, and that's called a tradition. In addition to that, we have capabilities in the areas outside the core that we're investing heavily in, call it, -- a couple of examples, in Affinity and health and benefits, these are 2 areas reported up through our risk business that are $1 billion-plus businesses growing well above mid-single-digit with opportunities for margin expansion. So this is now a second full category, completely outside anything that we've just described. And then, finally, very exciting for us is we made substantial investments in data and analytics, we believe, more than anyone else. And you see that coming out, a manifestation of real things that help clients. I mean, Aon Client Treaty is simply the single biggest transaction in the history of Lloyd's. We've got thousands of clients now taking advantage of that. It's incredibly impactful for them. Aon InPoint, 45-plus carriers onboard working with that; Aon Review. What we did in U.S. mortgage, we literally are creating a $10 billion business out of -- so it's just net new. So in many respects, Charles, we would describe what we've come to as sort of a set of opportunities to accelerate our ability to grow in the current environment irrespective of what happens sort of in the insurance environment. So for us, we're excited about the progress, and we have real confidence that '17 and '18 will bring more opportunity. And the final thing I would say about it is this idea of operating leverage. We're not just putting on net new revenue. This is revenue that we believe has operational leverage different than a revenue we put on 3 or 4 years ago and how we've actually brought it on board, which means we've got margin opportunities which are substantial."

Welcome to our third quarter 2016 conference call. Joining me here today is our CFO, Christa Davies.I would note that there are slides available on our website for you to follow along with our commentary today, and",1510,"Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter 2016 conference call. Joining me here today is our CFO, Christa Davies.
I would note that there are slides available on our website for you to follow along with our commentary today, and consistent with previous quarters, I'd like to cover 2 areas before turning the call over to Christa for further financial review. First is our performance against key metrics we communicate to shareholders. And second is overall organic growth performance, including continued areas of strategic investment across Aon.
On the first topic, our performance versus key metrics. Each quarter, we measure our performance against the key metrics we focus on achieving over the course of the year: grow organically, expand margins, increase earnings per share and deliver free cash flow growth.
Turning to Slide 3. In the third quarter, organic revenue growth was 4%, including growth across every major business, highlighted by 5% growth in both the Americas Retail Brokerage and Outsourcing businesses. Operating margin increased 10 basis points, reflecting modest improvement in Risk Solutions. EPS increased 4% to $1.29, primarily reflecting the effective capital management and underlying operational improvements. And finally, free cash flow for the 9 months is up 24%, reflecting strong cash flow from operations and a decline in capital expenditures.
Overall, we continue to strengthen the firm with positive performance across each of our key metrics for both the third quarter and the first 9 months of 2016, highlighted by solid organic revenue growth across both Risk Solutions and HR Solutions and strong double-digit growth in free cash flow.
Turning to Slide 4, on the second topic of growth and investment. I'm going to spend the next few minutes discussing the quarter for both of our segments. In Risk Solutions, organic revenue growth was 3% compared to 1% in the prior year quarter, driven by improved growth across all major businesses. As we've discussed previously, we're driving a set of initiatives to maximize return on invested capital and making strategic investments that are strengthening underlying performance and positioning our Risk Solutions segment for long-term growth and improved operating leverage, with management of our renewal book portfolio through our proactive partnership we call Aon Client Promise, which is driving retention rates of more than 90% on average across Retail Brokerage, including record retention rates of 94% in the U.S. and EMEA; new business generation of roughly $265 million in the third quarter across Retail Brokerage, including double-digit growth in Latin America, Affinity and EMEA; and another consecutive quarter of record new business in U.S. Retail; 22 consecutive quarters of positive net new business in core treaty reinsurance; increased operating leverage from our significant investments in innovative technology and data and analytics, including Aon InPoint, a growing business where we help carriers become more competitive, effective and operationally efficient by integrating our market-leading data and analytics with strategic consulting and access to Aon's unmatched expertise. This includes the Risk Insight Platform which now captures 3.3 million trades and nearly $165 billion of bound premium as well as our reinsurer dashboard, Review.
Another example is our Aon Broking initiative to better match client need with insurer appetite for risk. And finally, we're expanding our content in global footprint through tuck-in acquisitions that increase scale in emerging markets and expand capability. For example, we recently announced the addition of Stroz Friedberg, a global leader in cyber security, bringing together 2 of the world's most highly skilled teams focused on cyber risk mitigation. This investment extends Aon's leading position in cyber risk brokerage and creates a comprehensive cyber advisory group, allowing Aon's clients to have access to the most advanced thinking and solutions in the industry.
Reflecting on our individual businesses within Risk Solutions. In the Americas, organic revenue growth was 5% compared to 4% in the prior year quarter. Exposures continue to be positive across the region while the impact from pricing was negative, resulting in relatively stable market impact overall. We saw solid growth across all regions, U.S. Retail, Latin America and Canada, including growth across all businesses, property casualty, health and benefits and Affinity. Results were highlighted by double-digit growth in Affinity's consumer solutions group and strong growth in U.S. Retail, driven by record new business generation and retention.
In international, organic revenue growth was 2% compared to 1% in the prior year quarter. The impact from pricing remains modestly negative on average, driven by fragile market conditions in various countries across Europe and Asia and continued pricing pressure in the Pacific region, while exposures are modestly improving. Similar to the Americas, we saw growth across every major region, including EMEA, Asia and the Pacific. Results were highlighted by continued strength in New Zealand, record retention in EMEA and solid growth in Asia. In Continental Europe, we continue to see signs of improving growth, reflecting Aon's strength in client leadership across the region despite a macroeconomic environment that remains challenged in various countries.
In Reinsurance, organic revenue growth was 1% compared to minus 4% in the prior year quarter. This marks the fourth consecutive quarter of positive growth in Reinsurance, further validating our previous guidance of an expected return to modest growth in 2016.
Results in the quarter were primarily driven by continued net new business generation in treaty and growth in facultative placements. Results were partially offset by an unfavorable market impact globally.
As highlighted on our prior discussions, pricing continues to moderate, cedent demand continues to increase and capital is being deployed to new markets including U.S. mortgage credit risk, life and annuity risk and other emerging risks such as cyber liability. We believe new opportunities for growth, combined with Aon's industry-leading data and analytics and integrated capital solutions, have positioned our Reinsurance business for long-term growth.
Turning to HR Solutions. Organic revenue growth was 4% overall, with solid growth across high-demand areas where we continue to invest in innovative solutions and client-serving capabilities. These investments reflect Aon Hewitt's leadership and in-depth understanding of market trends, including solutions to help plan sponsors both manage pension risk and drive better retirement outcomes for their employees. A strong area of growth has been delegated investment consulting, where assets under management have grown from $10 billion to almost $90 billion in 5 years. We expect continued global growth in this area as sponsors are faced with regulatory changes and increasingly complex global markets, continuing investments to strengthen our industry-leading portfolio of health solutions covering the full range of benefit strategies, client size and funding choices, including our suite of private health care exchanges.
We view health as a substantial long-term opportunity. We are the industry leader in managing unique company or employee population needs today, and our superior advisory capabilities allows to help clients evolve when their needs change and priorities shift and as the health care landscape continues to evolve.
We also continue to invest in Software-as-a-Service models in our HR BPO business, where growth of new clients and conversion of existing clients is driving strong demands as well as the expansion of our capabilities to include financial implementations.
And finally, we're investing in data and analytics in our health, retirement, investment and Talent & Rewards businesses to provide superior advice to drive better outcomes for our clients and our clients' employees.
Turning to the individual businesses within HR Solutions. In Consulting Services, organic revenue growth was 3%, similar to the prior year quarter. Results primarily reflect continued growth in retirement consulting, driven by demand for delegated investment consulting services as an increasing amount of clients find significant value in Aon's ability to provide advice and manage their retirement assets.
We saw growth in communications consulting, where clients proactively preparing their employees in advance of annual enrollment season as well as certain project-related work. Results in the quarter also include solid growth in our compensation consulting practice.
In Outsourcing, organic revenue growth was 5%, similar to the prior year quarter. Results reflect strong growth in HR BPO, driven by new client wins in cloud-based solutions. And we saw strong growth in our health exchange business for off-cycle enrollments and certain project-related work. Results in the quarter were partially offset by an anticipated modest decline in benefits administration.
Overall, in HR Solutions, we are firmly on track for improved organic revenue growth in both businesses for the second half of the year, driven by continued growth in high demand areas where we've been investing, combined with seasonal strength in the fourth quarter.
In summary, our performance marks another quarter of progress, reflecting strong organic revenue growth across both segments, effective capital management and substantial free cash flow generation towards our near-term goal of $2.4 billion for the full year of 2017. Looking forward, we expect a strong finish to the year as we head into our seasonally strongest quarter with continued long-term growth, driven by our unmatched level of investment in advisory and analytic capabilities across our portfolio.
With that said, I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Christa for further financial review. Christa?"
119853,404166436,1066693,"Aon plc, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2016",2016-10-28,"Earnings Calls","Aon plc","Executives","Thank you so much, Greg, and good morning, everyone. As Greg noted, our results reflect solid organic revenue growth across both segments, substantial free cash flow generation and effective capital management, highlighted by $300 million of share repurch",1339,"Thank you so much, Greg, and good morning, everyone. As Greg noted, our results reflect solid organic revenue growth across both segments, substantial free cash flow generation and effective capital management, highlighted by $300 million of share repurchase in the quarter and more than $1 billion of share repurchase year-to-date.
Now let me turn to the financial results for the quarter on Page 6 of the presentation. Our core EPS performance, excluding certain items, increased 4% to $1.29 per share for the third quarter compared to $1.24 in the prior year quarter. Certain items that were adjusted for in the core EPS performance and highlighted in the schedules on Page 12 of the press release include noncash intangible asset amortization. Also included in the results was a $0.01 per share favorable impact related to foreign currency translation due primarily to the U.S. dollar strength against the pound. If currency do remain stable at today's rates, we would expect foreign currency translation to have a modest positive impact in the fourth quarter.
Now let me talk about each of the segments on the next slide. In our Risk Solutions segment, organic growth was 3%, operating margin increased 10 basis points to 20.9% and operating income increased 2% compared to the prior year quarter. Reported results are in line with our previous guidance of modest operating income growth in the third quarter. Operating margin improvement of 10 basis points reflects solid organic revenue growth and an 80 basis points favorable impact from foreign currency translation, partially offset by an unfavorable impact from the timing of certain compensation expenses and a minus 50 basis point unfavorable impact from higher E&O expense in the quarter.
For the first 9 months, operating margin improved 60 basis points, and operating income increased 3%. Anticipating a strong performance in the fourth quarter, we are fully on track to deliver improved operating income growth and further margin expansion for the full year, reflecting continued progress towards our long-term target of 26%.
Turning to the HR Solutions segment. Organic revenue growth was 4%, operating margin decreased 30 basis points to 17.1% and operating income decreased 4% compared to the prior year quarter. Operating income results include a $7 million or minus 70 basis points of legacy IT contract costs incurred in the quarter. This impact as well as an anticipated minus 70 basis point unfavorable impact related to previous portfolio repositioning activities and a minus 20 basis point unfavorable impact from foreign currency more than offset solid organic growth in the quarter.
For the first 9 months, operating margin decreased 70 basis points, and operating income decreased 8%. As discussed previously, we continue to take steps to reduce certain costs that remained after disposition of 2 businesses in the last 12 months as well as optimize our global cost structure in areas such as IT, real estate and global procurements. Combined with an expected strong performance in the fourth quarter, we are fully on track for continued margin expansion towards our long-term operating margin target of 22%.
Now let me discuss a few of the line items outside of the operating segments on Slide 9. Unallocated expenses were $42 million compared to $45 million in the prior year quarter. Interest income was $1 million compared to $3 million in the prior year quarter. Interest expense decreased $2 million to $70 million due to a decline in costs related to certain derivative hedging programs, which have now expired. Other income in both the current and prior year quarters included gains on certain long-term investments. Going forward, we expect a run rate of approximately $45 million per quarter of unallocated expense, $3 million per quarter of interest income and $70 million per quarter of interest expense.
Turning to taxes. The adjusted effective tax rate on net income from continuing operations, excluding the applicable tax impact associated with noncash pension settlements in the first half of the year, increased to 18.2% compared to 16% in the prior year quarter. Changes in the geographic distribution of income and certain favorable discrete tax adjustments impacted the adjusted effective tax rate in the current quarter. The prior year quarter adjusted effective tax rate excluded the applicable tax impact associated with expenses related to legacy litigation.
Lastly, average diluted shares outstanding decreased 5% to 269.6 million in the third quarter compared to 283.8 million in the prior year quarter as we effectively allocate capital. The company repurchased 2.7 million Class A ordinary shares for approximately $300 million in the third quarter. The company has $3 billion of remaining authorization under its share repurchase program. Actual shares outstanding on September 30 were 263.5 million, and there are approximately 6 million additional dilutive equivalents. Estimated Q4 2016 beginning dilutive share count is approximately 269 million, subject to share price movements, share issuance and share repurchase.
Now let me turn to the next slide to highlight our solid balance sheet and strong cash flow growth on Slide 10. At September 30, 2016, cash and short-term investments increased to $946 million. Total debt outstanding was approximately $6.2 billion, and total debt-to-EBITDA on a GAAP basis was 2.4x, similar to the prior quarter. Cash flow from operations for the first 9 months increased 14% or $180 million to $1.5 billion, driven by lower pension contributions, an increase in net income, working capital improvements and lower cash taxes. Free cash flow as defined by cash flow from operations less CapEx increased 24% or $252 million to $1.3 billion, reflecting strong growth in cash flow from operations and a $72 million decrease in CapEx. Looking forward, we expect to deliver strong double-digit free cash flow growth for the full year 2016, reflecting further progress towards our near-term goal of $2.4 billion of free cash flow for the full year 2017.
Turning to the next slide to discuss our significant increases in free cash flow. We value the firm based on free cash flow and allocate capital to maximize free cash flow returns. Free cash flow of $2.4 billion for the full year 2017 is not our end goal as we expect to deliver sustainable strong free cash flow growth on an annual basis beyond 2017.
There are 4 primary areas that we expect to contribute to our near-term goal of delivering $2.4 billion for the full year 2017. The first is continued operational performance, driven by organic revenue growth and margin expansion. The second is working capital improvements as we focus on closing the gap between receivables and payables. We've made substantial progress in this area over the last 5 years with further opportunity to increase free cash flow by over $500 million. Third is declining uses of cash for pension contributions, CapEx and restructuring, which we expect to free up more than $105 million of annual free cash flow between the end of 2015 and '17. And fourth, lower cash tax payments reflecting a lower effective tax rate.
Turning to our pension plans. We've taken significant steps to reduce the volatility and liability of our plans. In the first half of 2016, we completed 2 transactions to materially derisk our pension liabilities in the U.K., and we'll continue to actively manage derisking opportunities as they make financial sense. Further, we currently expect pension contributions to decline by approximately $44 million to $150 million in 2016, and expect noncash pension income on an underlying basis to be a modest benefit in 2016 versus 2015.
In summary, we delivered solid organic revenue growth, overall operating margin improvement despite certain anticipated headwinds in the quarter and continued to deliver double-digit free cash flow growth. For the first 9 months, results reflect positive performance across each of our key metrics heading into our seasonally strongest quarter. With a strong finish to the year, we are well on track in 2016 to deliver meaningful progress towards our near-term goal of $2.4 billion in free cash flow for the full year 2017.
With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to the operator for questions."

The numbers are really not apples-to-apples in any way, shape or form. So for us, the enrollment numbers really aren't as relevant at this point anymore. We've got so many off-cycle enrollments now on the horizon, a project-related revenue which is much more substantial than ever before, and this really ends up being a platform for us. We're seeing things like elective benefits, whether it's life, home, long-term visibility, short-term visibility, it's a very, very positive sort of set of developments for us. And if you look at it as a business, again, less about enrollment, about the business overall, this is double-digit revenue growth on exchanges for us. We moved to profitability last year. It's going to obviously be stronger this year. But I'd say from a macro standpoint, I mean, look at where we are in the exchanges. This is strong and steady growth. You know we've been the largest active, the largest retiree. You mentioned Starbucks, we don't mention our clients, but we are very privileged. Starbucks has a well-earned reputation for defining excellence in employee value proposition, and we help them deliver on that through our exchange. So we're very excited about what that means overall. So for us, this is just an exceptionally strong platform for us. And I would say, our pipeline is as strong as it's ever been. So there is no waning, there is no backing up, there is no deferring. It's as strong as it's ever been. Having said that, Dave, I still want to emphasize, and we've been saying this from the beginning, this is not a change in direction, the exchanges are an exceptionally strong solution for a subset of our clients, but it's really part of the overall health platform, which we feel very, very strong about."

We really are excited about the addition of  Stroz Friedberg in addition to some exceptional talent we brought in on the topic of cyber. Let me describe kind of the rationale behind it. First of all, our clients tell us every day cyber is becoming an increasingly important concern for them, important risk for them. And if you think about what insurance has been able to do in the context of that risk, we've roughly placed together the entire industry about, we call it, $2 billion -- a little over $2 billion in premium. And Adam, that's good. That's terrific, but if you think about the $2 billion in premium in the context of $400 billion in client reported losses. And so for us, we've only tapped the surface and started really delivering on the needs of our clients. And if you ask yourself -- and by the way, in the context of that, as you described, appreciate you describing it, we have an awesome capability, the best in the industry, leading position, exceptional capability in the context of what insurance does. What we have essentially said is we've got to do more for our clients. We've got to take the capability we've got and build on it. And the way you build on it is not to bring more insurance expertise in but bring more cyber expertise in and really help insurers and capital understand how to quantify and deal with cyber risk in a way in which you would actually open up more capital. So instead of $2 billion in premium, it gets $400 billion in reported losses, we could do much, much better than that. And Stroz Friedberg is simply the preeminent platform in the world, in our view, around how to do that. So this is a firm that's publicly reported has covered and helped remediate, understand, identify and deal with some of the most sophisticated, complex cyber challenges in the world today. Imagine combining that capability with what we have from a capital and insurance side, that's going to open up just tremendous opportunities, we believe, to bring better solutions to our clients in a much more comprehensive way, which is why we're very excited to bring these assets together. And I can tell you, we've had incredible client reaction. They see this logic immediately. They see the opportunity to take what is a very distributed risk in cyber because it attacks you from everywhere. They know it requires an integrated solution, and this is now the first time they're going to get a chance to put some of those pieces together. And this is really a role a risk manager can play to take a broader view across their organization to help their CIOs and CISOs to do this in a more effective way. So for us, this is terrific. And for Stroz Friedberg, we're excited to be able to actually take the capability they deliver to clients every day and back that up with capital. So if you think about it, it really is a net-net new creation of opportunity for our clients, and in doing so, a net new for Aon."

So Quentin, I think on the first question on working capital, what we would say is we really think about it as days sales outstanding, so the days it takes to collect cash from clients; and days payables, which is the days that it takes -- we collect cash -- or we pay suppliers. And right now, we run negative working capital, and we believe for a professional services firm that being working capital neutral is the right goal. And in fact, in some of our leading countries, we're actually working capital positive. So we certainly see it's more than achievable. And so to get from where we are today to working capital neutral is a little over $500 million in free cash flow. So we feel really good about the ability to collect the further $500 million of working capital. It will take multiple years. It'll take 8 to 10 years to get there because it is -- it's not sort of some big bang effort. It's continued improvements in process. It's continued improvements in contract terms. A number of our contract terms are annual or multi-year agreements. And so it will absolutely take a long period of time to get there. So I don't want to sort of overplay the sort of amount you're going to get in any 1 year. So that's sort of on the working capital. And then the other thing I think I would note is as you look at our working capital, you can see the improvements in receivables. If you divide receivables by revenue trailing 12 months, from Q3 the last 12 months, you can see we actually improved DSO on a next annually reported basis by 2 days. And so we continue to make progress. And I'll tell you that on BPO, we improved by 4 days. You can't see that externally, but we're continuing to make improvements on both fronts. And then in terms of the opportunity, on the tax side, what I would say is we really feel good about the sustainability of our 19% effective tax rate. We do run a global capital pool. We do see statutory rates around the world declining, particularly in the U.K. And we have growing business in emerging markets, which happened to have lower tax rates. And so we feel really good, therefore, about the sustainability of the 19% and, therefore, opportunity to have improvements in cash taxes as cash taxes catch up to the lower effective tax rate."

And so it is a fantastic value proposition for clients to do this. On average, clients are saving 30% of costs in moving to the cloud. And so -- and they get a much more effective solution. And so we do see the majority of our clients moving that way, and we expect that to continue. In terms of the margin profile of the business, today, it is a low single-digit margin business, and it's moving to a mid-teens margin business over time. And so we do see that opportunity primarily driven by that cloud growth, which is enormous. And as Greg described, I'd really just describe the cloud opportunity in HR, and there is a cloud opportunity which we're increasingly seeing as very happy HR customers actually want to move to cloud financials as well to actually bring together and get the same value proposition they got in HR and financials."

So to think back to commentary we've had on these calls, so literally going back almost 10 years, everything we do is built off a foundation that Christa has set up and applied across the firm around return on invested capital and one of the ways we can actually apply capital and a way that serve our clients most effectively. And you've seen us do that over the years. And if you step back over the last 10 years, we've deployed probably, call it, $15 billion in capital, of which, call it, roughly half or more of that buyback, roughly half is on some acquisitions. So net-net, this is obviously a very positive story and will continue to be a very positive story for us. Within that context, you'll see us continuously try to look for ways to optimize return on invested capital on behalf of clients, strengthen the firm, double down in areas that we can grow and build capability, in the areas of risk, retirement, health, talent, et cetera, communication. So you see us doing that. That will drive everything we do. It's also why, in that context, you hear Christa described and I described, the team described, buyback sets the benchmark for that. And then against that, we make acquisitions that are accretive against that benchmark. And that really has been the formulation, the foundation of exactly everything we've done, and we'll continue to do that. And we're less worried about kind of a quarter plus or minus or a year plus or minus. We're worried about and focused on -- in fact, maniacally focused on how we build this for Aon over time."

In fact, in many respects, what we've done is invest very, very heavily to increase operating leverage in the business, make the acquisitions Christa described to strengthen our position that, frankly, gives us the ability to create net new demand on behalf of clients and substantially increase growth trajectory. You've actually seen it. If you think about sort of our performance in the third quarter, what this is a reflection of is certainly not the insurance environment, it's really a reflection of our ability to create net new demand and help clients succeed. So if you think about it, our view is if you think about some of the 3 or 4 areas that we look to, to grow, obviously, there's all the traditional areas around property, casualty, D&O, and we made this multi-year investment to increase operating leverage in something called the Aon Client Promise. This is not just talk. This is very real mechanics on how we interact and support clients every day. That's what's resulted in record new retention. And that's resulted in record new business, so -- emphasize record new business. And yet we're still relatively small when you think about sort of the opportunity to build market share globally. So we've got capability to build market share and compete globally in a way that we think is actually quite extraordinary, and that's called a tradition. In addition to that, we have capabilities in the areas outside the core that we're investing heavily in, call it, -- a couple of examples, in Affinity and health and benefits, these are 2 areas reported up through our risk business that are $1 billion-plus businesses growing well above mid-single-digit with opportunities for margin expansion. So this is now a second full category, completely outside anything that we've just described. And then, finally, very exciting for us is we made substantial investments in data and analytics, we believe, more than anyone else. And you see that coming out, a manifestation of real things that help clients. I mean, Aon Client Treaty is simply the single biggest transaction in the history of Lloyd's. We've got thousands of clients now taking advantage of that. It's incredibly impactful for them. Aon InPoint, 45-plus carriers onboard working with that; Aon Review. What we did in U.S. mortgage, we literally are creating a $10 billion business out of -- so it's just net new. So in many respects, Charles, we would describe what we've come to as sort of a set of opportunities to accelerate our ability to grow in the current environment irrespective of what happens sort of in the insurance environment. So for us, we're excited about the progress, and we have real confidence that '17 and '18 will bring more opportunity. And the final thing I would say about it is this idea of operating leverage. We're not just putting on net new revenue. This is revenue that we believe has operational leverage different than a revenue we put on 3 or 4 years ago and how we've actually brought it on board, which means we've got margin opportunities which are substantial."
