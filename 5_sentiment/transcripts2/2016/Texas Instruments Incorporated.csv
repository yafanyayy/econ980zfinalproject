As usual, Kevin March, TI's Chief Financial Officer, is with me today.For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at",824,"Thank you. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining our Fourth Quarter '15 and 2015 Earnings Conference Call. As usual, Kevin March, TI's Chief Financial Officer, is with me today.
For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. A replay will be available through the web. This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description.
Before I review the quarter, let me provide some information that's important to your calendars. We plan to hold a call on February 9 at 10:00 a.m. Central Time, to update our capital management strategy. Similar to what we've done in the past, Kevin March and I will provide insight into our strategy and we'll also answer some of the most frequently asked questions. 
Now I'll start with a quick summary of our financial results. Revenue declined 2% from a year ago, and was in line with our expectations even though we experienced slowing demand within the sector of the personal electronics market late in the quarter. Despite that, overall demand was about as expected. I'll elaborate in a few moments. 
Our core businesses of Analog and Embedded Processing performed well in the quarter and comprised 87% of fourth quarter revenue. Earnings per share were $0.80 in the quarter and included a $0.09 benefit for 2 items that were not in our outlook. These 2 items were a $0.05 net tax benefit and $0.04 for restructuring charges other. 
With that backdrop, let me move into the details of our performance, which even in the face of weaker demand within the sector of personal electronics market, continues to illustrate the ongoing strength of TI's business model. In the fourth quarter, our cash flow from operations was $1.4 billion. We believe that free cash flow growth especially on a per-share basis is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long-term. 
Free cash flow for the year was $3.7 billion, up 6% from a year ago. Free cash flow margin was 28.6% of revenue, up from 26.9% a year ago and consistent with our target range of 20% to 30% of revenue. We continue to benefit from the breadth and differentiation of our product portfolio and from the efficiencies of our manufacturing strategy, the latter of which includes our growing 300-millimeter analog output and the opportunistic purchase of assets ahead of demand. 
We also believe that free cash flow will be valued only if it's returned to shareholders or productively invested in the business. In 2015, we returned $4.2 billion of cash to investors through a combination of stock repurchases and dividends. Turning to our segments. Analog revenues decreased 2% from the year-ago quarter. Power Management, a High Performance Analog and Silicon Valley Analog declined while high volume Analog and Logic grew. 
Embedded Processing revenue increased 4% from the year-ago quarter due to Connectivity and Microcontrollers, Processors declined. In our Other segment, revenue declined 13% from the year-ago quarter due to custom ASIC and DLP products. Compared with the year-ago quarter, distribution resales decreased by 2%. Distributer inventory decreased about a day compared with the year-ago to just about 4 weeks. We believe this inventory level continues to reflect an environment of good product availability due to healthy TI inventories and stable lead times. Together, these continue to drive high customer service metrics. 
For the year in total, Analog and Embedded revenue grew a combined 3% despite significant headwind in Wireless infrastructure and foreign currency exchange rates. Analog was up 3% and Embedded was up 2%. In total, Analog and Embedded were 86% of TI's revenue for the year, up from 83% in 2014. Based on data through November, we gained market share in Analog for the sixth consecutive year and held our share gains in Embedded Processing. 
I'll now turn to our end market estimates for 2015. As a reminder, we provide this estimate annually of TI's revenue by the end markets our customers sell into. We break this into 6 categories: industrial, automotive, personal electronics but this will include products such as PCs, phones and TVs, communications equipment, enterprise systems and other, which is primarily calculators and royalties. Industrial and automotive combined were 46% of TI's revenue, up a couple of percentage points from last year due to automotive strength. Specifically, industrial made up 31% of TI's revenue; automotive, 15%; personal electronics, 30%; communications equipment, 13%; enterprise systems, 6%; and Other, 5%. 
Of note Apple, whose revenue is within personal electronics market, contributed approximately 11% of our revenue in 2015. Kevin will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook."

Gross profit in the quarter was $1.87 billion, a decline of 2% versus a year ago due to lower revenue, partially offset by lower manufacture cost. As a percent of revenue, gross profits had a new record of 58.",981,"Thank you, Dave and good afternoon, everyone. Gross profit in the quarter was $1.87 billion, a decline of 2% versus a year ago due to lower revenue, partially offset by lower manufacture cost. As a percent of revenue, gross profits had a new record of 58.5%. Operating expenses for the quarter totaled $711 million, down $29 million from the year ago primarily in SG&A. The decline reflects continued cost management across the company, including the previously announced targeted reductions in Embedded Processing in Japan, partially offset by higher compensation related costs. Acquisition charges were $81 million, almost all of which were the ongoing amortization of intangibles, which is noncash expense. 
Restructuring charges and Other were $68 million, which included gains on sales of 2 properties. It also included a $17 million charge in preparation for the closure of a site, which we announced today in our earnings release. We anticipate about $2 million of quarterly charges through the fourth quarter of 2018 for a total charge of about $40 million. We expect the transition to more cost-effective 200-millimeter fabs to take about 3 years, and result in annualized savings of about $35 million per year. 
Operating profit was $1.14 billion or 35.8% of revenue. Operating profit was up 4% from the year-ago quarter. Operating margin for Analog was 38.0%. Operating margin for Embedded Processing. was 23.4%, 6 percentage points higher than a year ago as we continue to focus investments on our best growth opportunities. Net income in the fourth quarter was $836 million or $0.80 per share. As a reminder, earnings per share included a $0.05 net tax benefit, primarily due to the reinstatement of the federal research tax credit and a net benefit of $0.04 from restructuring and other charges. 
I'll now comment on our capital management results starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $1.43 billion in the quarter. Inventory days were 115, up 4 days sequentially and down 2 days from a year ago. We plan to provide an update on our inventory model in our capital management call on Tuesday, February 9. Capital expenditures were $164 million in the quarter. In 2015, cash flow from operations was $4.27 billion, up 10% from the same period a year ago. For the year, capital expenditures were $551 million or 4% of revenue. As a reminder, our long-term expectation is for capital expenditures to be about 4% of revenue, which includes the expansion of our 300-millimeter Analog capacity on which we will provide an update on our capital management call in February. 
Free cash flow for the year was $3.72 billion, up 6% from a year ago. Free cash flow margin was 28.6% of revenue, up 170 basis points from a year ago. Our free cash flow growth reflects the continued strength of our business model. As we said, we believe free cash flow growth, especially on a per-share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long-term and will be valued only if its returned to shareholders or productively reinvested in the business. As we've noted, our intention to return 100% of our free cash flow plus any proceeds we receive from exercise of equity compensation minus any net debt retirement. 
In the fourth quarter, TI paid $386 million in dividends and repurchased $627 million of our stock for a total return of $1.01 billion. Total cash returned in 2015 was $4.19 billion. Outstanding share count was reduced by 3.4% over the past 12 months and by 41% since the end of 2004 from when we initiated a repurchase program designed to reduce our share count. These returns demonstrate our confidence in TI's business model and our commitment to return excess cash to our shareholders. 
Fundamental to our commitment to returning cash are our cash management and tax practices, which are designed to make cash available for a variety of uses, including paying dividends and repurchasing our stock. We ended the fourth quarter with $3.22 billion of cash and short-term investments with 82% of that cash on shore, making it available to return to shareholders. TI orders in the quarter were $3.10 billion, down 2% from the year-ago. 
Turning to our outlook. We expect TI revenue in the range of $2.85 billion to $3.09 billion in the first quarter. This includes significantly weaker demand within the sector of the personal electronics market, specifically we expect a year-over-year decline of about $150 million within a sector of our personal electronics revenue, except for this area of weakness, our expectations for the remainder of our business are about even with the year-ago quarter. 
We expect first quarter earnings per share to be in the range of $0.57 to $0.67. Acquisition charges, which are noncash amortization charges, will remain about even and hold at about $80 million per quarter through the third quarter of 2019, and will then decline to about $50 million per quarter for 2 additional years. Our expectation for our annual effective tax rate in 2016 is about 30% and this is the tax rate that you should use for the first quarter and for the year. 
In closing, I'll note that growth in our industry in 2015 was slower than we expected when we came into the year. However, our unique advantages of manufacturing and technology, portfolio breadth, market reach and the diverse and long-lived product position enabled important milestones for the year. These included expansion of 300-millimeter analog production, gross margin improvement of 130 basis points to a new record level, operating margin improvements of 260 basis points and free cash flow margin improvement of 170 basis points to a new record level. 
We will continue to feed our unique advantages through disciplined capital allocation and focus on the best growth opportunities, which I believe will enable us to continue to improve. With that let me turn it back to Dave."

And we did see that sector weakened late in the quarter, in the back half of the month of December. If I just take and look at for the year, how our end markets did, I'll put that into perspective. I'll start with an area of strength in automotive. That grew in the mid-teens. Most of the sectors inside of that growing double-digits. Industrial revenue was about even for the year, and we had about half of the sectors there were increasing -- offset by the others. Personal electronics, as we've just talked about, grew single digits. I'll note that we had certain growth in one customer that grew significantly that year. But that was up, primarily offset by declines and others. So therefore, a percentage of our revenue in personal electronics really didn't change too much, it went from 29% last year to 30% this year. Communications equipment was down 20% and that was primarily, driven by Wireless infrastructure and that was down around 30% for the year. And then finally, enterprise systems was down slightly due to projectors. So with that said, Chris, I think, as we talked about earlier in our prepared remarks, outside of that one area of weakness, everything else came in at about as we had expected. So that would be inclusive of PCs and the other areas that you talked about. Do you have a follow on?"

So our revenue profile inside of personal electronics obviously, will be more back half weighted as that customer did well in the marketplace obviously, our revenues will be reflective of that. I could point out that we saw a very diverse set of products to that customer and in fact, hundreds of products to it and products in every major platform. That said, I think that the revenues of that customer reported to be somewhere around 2/3 of it is in smartphones and you'd expect, since we have a pretty diverse position with that customer, our revenues will be very similar. So and certainly, I think that whenever you have it fairly significant change in demand of any customer, their supply chain considerations where you've got different pieces of inventory sitting inside of that supply chain. We happen to be on the beginning part of that supply chain. So I won't try to handicap where that is, it's -- where we think the demand will come in, in the first quarter, we'll see -- we'll make a prediction on second quarter later."

I think at the highest level, we think we continue to operate in a relatively weak macroeconomy as we have been in the last couple of years, so nothing terribly exciting in the economy as a whole. If you kind of look at the compares that we're talking about, recall that a year ago, we were seeing sharp declines of communications infrastructure and we were also seeing some pretty stiff headwinds in foreign exchange with the rate of exchange moving against us, from the U.S. dollar strength standpoint. So despite that, when you take a look at all that, we actually see, aside from this one sector of personal electronics, the balance of this is going to be about even on a year-over-year basis. So again, the headlines that we're seeing on the macro front and a lot of the angst that you mentioned, certainly sounds real, but actually from a demand signal standpoint from our customers, it's consists of what I just said. We continue to operate in a weak macroenvironment with lots of cross currents going on. So again, last year's weakness in infrastructure, very strong auto, foreign exchange issues that we're dealing with. This year, we don't see where those things will come into play right now."

But I'd just remind you of some moving parts that are going on here, you can spot it if you take a look at the release that we just put out there, I think the most apparent number you can see out there is the decline and depreciation to occur, and clearly, just from an accounting standpoint that increases our gross profit margin falls through to EPS. That depreciation will continue as glide path down in 2016, consistent with the fact that logos [ph] purchases that we made 5 years ago, are now reaching the end of life. In addition to that, we're seeing a growing portion of our chips being produced in the 300-millimeter capacity. And as you know, it costs us about 40% less per chip or about 20% less per device to manufacturers on 300-millimeter versus 200-millimeter. So that mix improves that will also fall through the bottom line. And then the third element that I'd just point out is we continue to see a mix shift in the source of revenue into industrial and automotive, which tend to have higher overall margins and certainly stickier margin profiles overtime. So collectively, those should help our overall margin and earnings performance, notwithstanding whatever direction revenue takes us through over the next 12 months. In addition to that from an EPS standpoint, as we have been doing for 11 years now, as long as the intrinsic value of the company is higher than the market value, we will continue to be buyers of TI shares. We reduced our share count 3.4% this past year and certainly, current prices says we should continue to be active accumulators of TI shares. So combined, we have -- at least we're certain would have momentum in our favor, notwithstanding any significant change in the revenue profile continuing to help us with earnings per share."

And those are about done now, they're pretty much finished up in the middle of last year. As we look forward, what we would expect to see and what we've talked about in the past that our OpEx that operate somewhere between 20% and 30% of revenue in a weak market and might be pushing 30%, in a reasonably strong market it might be pushing 20%. I think we're in the low 20s right now, 23% [ph] for 2015. So again, as I look forward, I don't see any real material changes to the OpEx profile. I will just remind you that we do always have a seasonable pattern on our OpEx, just like OpEx was down 3Q to 4Q because of holidays, Thanksgiving and Christmas, the OpEx will be up again in 1Q versus 4Q because of the absence of those holidays and also the annual pay and benefits increases that we have to do across the company in the first quarter.

And before I talk about industrial, I just want to remind those that may not be as familiar with this. When we talk about our industrial market, it's something that's very broad and different than what a typical investor would look from an industrial screen. So we've got 14 sectors that makes up industrial and they'll include things like factory automation, medical and healthcare, building automation, grid infrastructure, test measurement motor drives, electronics point of sale, space and avionics, display, power delivery, appliances, lighting, industrial transportation and then a bucket of everything else that goes into it. So slightly are very different than what most people would think of in industrials. And you're right, it was -- it had a strong year, a year before. I think when we started the year, we had expected it to be stronger than what it turned out. And typically, a lot of people ask us, hey, we hear the rumors in China. We see the stocks that they follow maybe the industrial segment are seeing very, very weak demand. But we turned in revenue that was consistent with what we saw after a very strong year. And fundamentally, what we think that's going on inside of that is that there's more semiconductor content going into the industrial market. And we think we're in the very early stages of that. And if you look at the automotive market, I think it's much easier to see that content because we know how many cars ship per year. It's much easier to see the difference between total SAR unit growth and what semiconductors are shipping into it. Certainly impossible to be able to see inside of industrial market because it's very, very broad and very, very diverse. But that said, we believe that we've got a decade or more runway of increasing content inside of the industrial market. So that's about all the inside I think I can share on that.

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining our fourth quarter '15 and 2015 Earnings Conference Call. As usual, Kevin March, TI's Chief Financial Officer, is with me today.
For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. A replay will be available through the web. 
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description.
Before I review the quarter, let me provide some information that's important to your calendars. We plan to hold a call on February 9 at 10 a.m. Central Time to update our capital management strategy. Similar to what we've done in the past, Kevin March and I will provide insight into our strategy, and we'll also answer some of the most frequently asked questions. 
Now I'll start with a quick summary of our financial results. Revenue declined 2% from a year ago and was in line with our expectations even though we experienced slowing demand within a sector of the personal electronics market late in the quarter. Despite that, overall demand was about as expected. I'll elaborate in a few moments. 
Our core businesses of Analog and Embedded Processing performed well in the quarter and comprised 87% of fourth quarter revenue. 
Earnings per share were $0.80 in the quarter and included a $0.09 benefit for 2 items that were not in our outlook. These 2 items were a $0.05 net tax benefit and $0.04 for Restructuring charges/other. 
With that backdrop, let me move into the details of our performance, which even in the face of weaker demand within the sector of personal electronics market continues to illustrate the ongoing strength of TI's business model. 
In the fourth quarter, our cash flow from operations was $1.4 billion. We believe that free cash flow growth, especially on a per-share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term. Free cash flow for the year was $3.7 billion, up 6% from a year ago. Free cash flow margin was 28.6% of revenue, up from 26.9% a year ago and consistent with our target range of 20% to 30% of revenue. We continue to benefit from the breadth and differentiation of our product portfolio and from the efficiencies of our manufacturing strategy, the latter of which includes our growing 300-millimeter Analog output and the opportunistic purchase of assets ahead of demand. 
We also believe that free cash flow will be valued only if it's returned to shareholders or productively invested in the business. In 2015, we returned $4.2 billion of cash to investors through a combination of stock repurchases and dividends. 
Turning to our segments. Analog revenue decreased 2% from the year-ago quarter. Power Management, High Performance Analog and Silicon Valley Analog declined while High Volume Analog & Logic grew. 
Embedded Processing revenue increased 4% from a year-ago quarter due to Connectivity and Microcontrollers. Processors declined. 
In our Other segment, revenue declined 13% from a year-ago quarter due to custom ASIC and DLP products. Compared with the year-ago quarter, distribution resales decreased by 2%. Distributor inventory decreased about a day compared with the year ago to just above 4 weeks. We believe this inventory level continues to reflect an environment of good product availability due to healthy TI inventories and stable lead times. Together, these continue to drive high customer service metrics. 
For the year in total, Analog and Embedded revenue grew a combined 3% despite significant headwinds in wireless infrastructure and foreign currency exchange rates. Analog was up 3%, and Embedded was up 2%. In total, Analog and Embedded were 86% of TI's revenue for the year, up from 83% in 2014. Based on data through November, we gained market share in Analog for the sixth consecutive year and held our share gains in Embedded Processing. 
I will now turn to our end market estimates for 2015. As a reminder, we provide this estimate annually of TI's revenue by the end markets our customers sell into. We break this into 6 categories: industrial; automotive; personal electronics, where this will include products such as PCs, phones and TVs; communications equipment; enterprise systems; and other, which is primarily calculators and royalties. 
Industrial and automotive combined were 46% of TI's revenue, up a couple of percentage points from last year due to automotive strength. Specifically, industrial made up 31% of TI's revenue; automotive, 15%; personal electronics, 30%; communications equipment, 13%; enterprise systems, 6%; and other, 5%. Of note, Apple, whose revenue is within personal electronics market, contributed approximately 11% of our revenue in 2015. 
Kevin will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook."

Gross profit in the quarter was $1.87 billion, a decline of 2% versus a year ago due to lower revenue, partially offset by lower manufacturing costs. As a percent of revenue, gross profits had a new record of",979,"Thank you, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. Gross profit in the quarter was $1.87 billion, a decline of 2% versus a year ago due to lower revenue, partially offset by lower manufacturing costs. As a percent of revenue, gross profits had a new record of 58.5%. Operating expenses for the quarter totaled $711 million, down $29 million from the year ago, primarily in SG&A. The decline reflects continued cost management across the company, including the previously announced targeted reductions in Embedded Processing in Japan, partially offset by higher compensation-related costs. Acquisition charges were $81 million, almost all of which were the ongoing amortization of intangibles, which is noncash expense. 
Restructuring charges/other was $68 million, which included gains on sales of 2 properties. It also included a $17 million charge in preparation for the closure of a site, which we announced today in our earnings release. We anticipate about $2 million of quarterly charges through the fourth quarter of 2018 for a total charge of about $40 million. We expect the transition to more cost effective 200-millimeter fabs to take about 3 years and result in annualized savings of about $35 million per year. 
Operating profit was $1.14 billion or 35.8% of revenue. Operating profit was up 4% from the year-ago quarter. Operating margin for Analog was 38.0%. Operating margin for Embedded Processing was 23.4%, 6 percentage points higher than a year ago as we continue to focus investments on our best growth opportunities. 
Net income in the fourth quarter was $836 million or $0.80 per share. As a reminder, earnings per share included a $0.05 net tax benefit, primarily due to the reinstatement of the federal research tax credit and a net benefit of $0.04 from Restructuring other charges. 
I'll now comment on our capital management results starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $1.43 billion in the quarter. Inventory days were 115, up 4 days sequentially and down 2 days from a year ago. We plan to provide an update on our inventory model in our capital management call on Tuesday, February 9. Capital expenditures were $164 million in the quarter. 
In 2015, cash flow from operations was $4.27 billion, up 10% from the same period a year ago. For the year, capital expenditures were $551 million or 4% of revenue. As a reminder, our long-term expectation is for capital expenditures to be about 4% of revenue, which includes the expansion of our 300-millimeter Analog capacity on which we will provide an update in our capital management call in February. 
Free cash flow for the year was $3.72 billion, up 6% from a year ago. Free cash flow margin was 28.6% of revenue, up 170 basis points from a year ago. Our free cash flow growth reflects the continued strength of our business model. As we said, we believe free cash flow growth, especially on a per-share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term and will be valued only if it's returned to shareholders or productively reinvested in the business. As we've noted, our intention is to return 100% of our free cash flow plus any proceeds we receive from exercise of equity compensation minus any net debt retirement. 
In the fourth quarter, TI paid $386 million in dividends and repurchased $627 million of our stock for a total return of $1.01 billion. Total cash returned in 2015 was $4.19 billion. Outstanding share count was reduced by 3.4% over the past 12 months and by 41% since the end of 2004 from we initiated a repurchase program designed to reduce our share count. These returns demonstrate our confidence in TI's business model and our commitment to return excess cash to our shareholders. 
Fundamental to our commitment to returning cash are our cash management and tax practices, which are designed to make cash available for a variety of uses, including paying dividends and repurchasing our stock. We ended the fourth quarter with $3.22 billion of cash and short-term investments with 82% of that cash onshore, making it available to return to shareholders. TI orders in the quarter were $3.10 billion, down 2% from the year ago. 
Turning to our outlook. We expect TI revenue in the range of $2.85 billion to $3.09 billion in the first quarter. This includes significantly weaker demand within the sector of the personal electronics market. Specifically, we expect a year-over-year decline of about $150 million within a sector of our personal electronics revenue. Except for this area of weakness, our expectations for the remainder of our business are about even with the year-ago quarter. 
We expect first quarter earnings per share to be in the range of $0.57 to $0.67. Acquisition charges, which are noncash amortization charges, will remain about even and hold at about $80 million per quarter through the third quarter of 2019 that will then decline to about $50 million per quarter for 2 additional years. 
Our expectation for our annual effective tax rate in 2016 is about 30%, and this is the tax rate that you should use for the first quarter and for the year. 
In closing, I'll note that growth in our industry in 2015 was slower than we expected when we came into the year. However, our unique advantages in manufacturing and technology, portfolio breadth, market reach and a diverse and long-lived product positions enabled important milestones in the year. These included expansion of 300-millimeter Analog production, gross margin improvement of 130 basis points to a new record level, operating margin improvements of 260 basis points and free cash flow margin improvement of 170 basis points to a new record level. 
We will continue to feed our unique advantages through disciplined capital allocation and focus on the best growth opportunities, which I believe will enable us to continue to improve. 
With that let me turn it back to Dave."

And we did see that sector weakened late in the quarter, in the back half of the month of December. If I just take and look at for the year how our end markets did, I'll put it -- put that into perspective. I'll start with an area of strength in automotive. That grew in the mid-teens. Most of the sectors inside of that growing double digits. Industrial revenue was about even for the year, and we had about half of the sectors there were increasing, offset by the others. Personal electronics, as we've just talked about, grew single digits. I'll note that we had certainly growth in one customer that grew significantly that year, but that was up, primarily offset by declines and others. So therefore, a percentage of our revenue in personal electronics really didn't change too much. It went from 29% last year to 30% this year. Communications equipment was down 20%, and that was primarily driven by wireless infrastructure, and that was down around 30% for the year. And then finally, enterprise systems was down slightly due to projectors. So with that said, Chris, I think, as we talked about earlier in our prepared remarks, outside of that one area of weakness, everything else came in about as we had expected. So that would be inclusive of PCs and the other areas that you talked about. Do you have a follow-on?"

As that customer did well in the marketplace, obviously our revenues would be reflective of that. I could point out that we saw very diverse set of products to that customer, and in fact, hundreds of products to it and products in every major platform. That said, I think that the revenues of that customer reported to be somewhere around 2/3 of it is in smartphones. And you'd expect, since we've got a pretty diverse position across that customer, our revenues would be very similar. So -- and certainly, I think that whenever you have a fairly significant change in demand of any customer, their supply chain considerations where you've got different pieces of inventory sitting inside of that supply chain. We happen to be on the beginning part of that supply chain. So I won't try to handicap where that is. It's where we think the demand will come in, in the first quarter, and we'll see -- we'll make a prediction on second quarter later."

So despite that, when you take a look at all that, we actually see, aside from this one sector in personal electronics, the balance of it's going to be about even on a year-over-year basis. So again, the headlines that we're seeing on the macro front and a lot of the angst that you mentioned certainly sounds real. But actually from a demand signal standpoint from our customers, it consists of what I just said. We continue to operate in a weak macro environment with lots of cross currents going on.

But I just -- let me just remind you of some moving parts that are going on here, and you can spot it if you take a look at the release that we just put out there. I think the most apparent number you can see on there is the decline and depreciation begin to occur. And clearly, just from an accounting standpoint, that increases our gross profit margin and falls through to EPS. That depreciation will continue as glide path down in 2016, consistent with the fact that a lot of those purchases that we made 5 years ago are now reaching the end of a depreciable life. In addition to that, we're seeing a growing portion of our chips being produced in the 300-millimeter capacity. And as you know, it costs us about 40% less per chip or about 20% less per device to manufacture on 300-millimeter versus 200-millimeter. So as that mix improves, that will also fall through the bottom line. And then the third element that I just point out is that we continue to see a mix shift in the source of revenue into industrial and automotive, which tend to have higher overall margins and certainly stickier revenue and margin profiles over time. So collectively, those should help our overall margin and earnings performance, notwithstanding whatever direction revenue takes us through over the next 12 months. In addition to that, from an EPS standpoint, as we have been doing for 11 years now, as long as the intrinsic value of the company is higher than the market value, we will continue to be buyers of TI shares. We reduced our share count 3.4% this past year. And certainly, at current prices, it says we should continue to be active accumulators of TI shares. So combined, we have -- we certainly would have momentum in our favor, notwithstanding any significant change in the revenue profile to continue to help us with earnings per share."

I guess the way I'd answer that is that there are no knobs on the horizon right now of any measure that were similar to what you've seen in the last couple of years. As you pointed out, we had some restructuring actions that we took in Japan and also in certain parts of Embedded Processing over the last 2 years, and those have removed quite a bit of OpEx cost. And those were about done now. They pretty much finished up in the middle of last year. As we look forward, what we would expect to see is what we've talked about in the past that our OpEx should operate somewhere between 20% and 30% of revenue in a weak market and might be pushing 30%. In a reasonably strong market, it might be pushing 20%. I think we're in the low 20s right now, 23% for 2015. So again, as I look forward, I don't see any real material changes to the OpEx profile. I will just remind you that we do always have a seasonable pattern on our OpEx, just like OpEx was down 3Q to 4Q because of holidays, such as Thanksgiving and Christmas. The OpEx will be up again in 1Q versus 4Q because of the absence of those holidays and also the annual pay and benefits increases that we institute across the company in the first quarter. And just to kind of give you some parameters on that, it's probably in the 4% to 5% range increase 4Q to 1Q on OpEx."

And before I talk about industrial, I just want to remind those that may not be as familiar with this. When we talk about our industrial market, it's something that's very broad and different than what a typical investor would look from an industrial screen. So we've got 14 sectors that makes up industrial, and they'll include things like factory automation, medical and healthcare, building automation, grid infrastructure, test measurement, motor drives, electronic point of sale, space and avionics, display, power delivery, appliances, lighting, industrial transportation and then a bucket of everything else that goes into it. So slightly are very different than what most people would think of in industrials. And you're right, it was -- it had a strong year, the year before. I think when we started the year, we had expected it to be stronger than what it turned out. And typically, a lot of people ask us, ""Hey, we hear the rumors in China."" We see the stocks that they follow maybe in the industrial segment are seeing very, very weak demand. But we turned in revenue that was consistent with what we saw after a very strong year. And fundamentally, what we think is going on inside of that is that there is more semiconductor content going into the industrial market, and we think we're in the very early stages of that. And if you look at the automotive market, I think it's much easier to see that content because we know how many cars are shipped per year. It's much easier to see the difference between total SAR unit growth and what semiconductors are shipping into it. Certainly impossible to be able to see inside of the industrial market because it's very, very broad and very, very diverse. But that said, we believe that we've got a decade or more of runway of increasing content inside of the industrial market. So that's about all the insight, I think, I can share on that.

Chris, your question on Connectivity, what's driving the growth there. There, we've got a very broad portfolio of products. We support about a dozen different standards from a Connectivity standpoint, so low-powered Bluetooth, to WiFi, to other sub-gigahertz standards. And so if somebody wants to connect something, we have a solution that we can offer them. And so we're just seeing a really good uptake of the products that we've got there. I think you rolled in a question about does it change our penchant for acquisition. Again, our belief is that when you acquire a company in the Embedded space, you're picking up additional architectures. And additional architectures doesn't make you stronger, it just makes you bigger. And so we'll continue to look for companies that have characteristics much like a National does. If we -- when we are interested and that's the profile of the type of company. Let me just add, too, on the Greenock facility that we do expect to save about $35 million once we've completed all the transition. That's on an annualized basis and once we do complete the transition of the products to the more cost-effective fabs. Okay, thanks, Chris."

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining our fourth quarter '15 and 2015 Earnings Conference Call. As usual, Kevin March, TI's Chief Financial Officer, is with me today.
For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. A replay will be available through the web. 
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description.
Before I review the quarter, let me provide some information that's important to your calendars. We plan to hold a call on February 9 at 10 a.m. Central Time to update our capital management strategy. Similar to what we've done in the past, Kevin March and I will provide insight into our strategy, and we'll also answer some of the most frequently asked questions. 
Now I'll start with a quick summary of our financial results. Revenue declined 2% from a year ago and was in line with our expectations even though we experienced slowing demand within a sector of the personal electronics market late in the quarter. Despite that, overall demand was about as expected. I'll elaborate in a few moments. 
Our core businesses of Analog and Embedded Processing performed well in the quarter and comprised 87% of fourth quarter revenue. 
Earnings per share were $0.80 in the quarter and included a $0.09 benefit for 2 items that were not in our outlook. These 2 items were a $0.05 net tax benefit and $0.04 for Restructuring charges/other. 
With that backdrop, let me move into the details of our performance, which even in the face of weaker demand within the sector of personal electronics market continues to illustrate the ongoing strength of TI's business model. 
In the fourth quarter, our cash flow from operations was $1.4 billion. We believe that free cash flow growth, especially on a per-share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term. Free cash flow for the year was $3.7 billion, up 6% from a year ago. Free cash flow margin was 28.6% of revenue, up from 26.9% a year ago and consistent with our target range of 20% to 30% of revenue. We continue to benefit from the breadth and differentiation of our product portfolio and from the efficiencies of our manufacturing strategy, the latter of which includes our growing 300-millimeter Analog output and the opportunistic purchase of assets ahead of demand. 
We also believe that free cash flow will be valued only if it's returned to shareholders or productively invested in the business. In 2015, we returned $4.2 billion of cash to investors through a combination of stock repurchases and dividends. 
Turning to our segments. Analog revenue decreased 2% from the year-ago quarter. Power Management, High Performance Analog and Silicon Valley Analog declined while High Volume Analog & Logic grew. 
Embedded Processing revenue increased 4% from a year-ago quarter due to Connectivity and Microcontrollers. Processors declined. 
In our Other segment, revenue declined 13% from year-ago quarter due to custom ASIC and DLP products. Compared with the year-ago quarter, distribution resales decreased by 2%. Distributor inventory decreased about a day compared with a year ago to just above 4 weeks. We believe this inventory level continues to reflect an environment of good product availability due to healthy TI inventories and stable lead times. Together, these continue to drive high customer service metrics. 
For the year in total, Analog and Embedded revenue grew a combined 3% despite significant headwinds in wireless infrastructure and foreign currency exchange rates. Analog was up 3% and Embedded was up 2%. In total, Analog and Embedded were 86% of TI's revenue for the year, up from 83% in 2014. Based on data through November, we gained market share in Analog for the sixth consecutive year and held our share gains in Embedded Processing. 
I will now turn to our end market estimates for 2015. As a reminder, we provide this estimate annually of TI's revenue by the end markets our customers sell into. We break this into 6 categories: industrial; automotive; personal electronics, where this will include products such as PCs, phones and TVs; communications equipment; enterprise systems; and other, which is primarily calculators and royalties. 
Industrial and automotive combined were 46% of TI's revenue, up a couple of percentage points from last year due to automotive strength. Specifically, industrial made up 31% of TI's revenue; automotive, 15%; personal electronics, 30%; communications equipment, 13%; enterprise systems, 6%; and other, 5%. Of note, Apple, whose revenue is within personal electronics market, contributed approximately 11% of our revenue in 2015. 
Kevin will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook."

Gross profit in the quarter was $1.87 billion, a decline of 2% versus a year ago due to lower revenue, partially offset by lower manufacturing costs. As a percent of revenue, gross profits set a new record of",977,"Thank you, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. Gross profit in the quarter was $1.87 billion, a decline of 2% versus a year ago due to lower revenue, partially offset by lower manufacturing costs. As a percent of revenue, gross profits set a new record of 58.5%. 
Operating expenses for the quarter totaled $711 million, down $29 million from a year ago, primarily in SG&A. The decline reflects continued cost management across the company, including the previously announced targeted reductions in Embedded Processing in Japan, partially offset by higher compensation-related costs. Acquisition charges were $81 million, almost all of which were the ongoing amortization of intangibles, which is noncash expense. 
Restructuring charges/other was $68 million, which included gains on sales of 2 properties. It also included a $17 million charge in preparation for the closure of a site, which we announced today in our earnings release. We anticipate about $2 million of quarterly charges through the fourth quarter of 2018 for a total charge of about $40 million. We expect the transition to more cost-effective 200-millimeter fabs to take about 3 years and result in annualized savings of about $35 million per year. 
Operating profit was $1.14 billion or 35.8% of revenue. Operating profit was up 4% from the year-ago quarter. Operating margin for Analog was 38.0%. Operating margin for Embedded Processing was 23.4%, 6 percentage points higher than a year ago as we continue to focus investments on our best growth opportunities. 
Net income in the fourth quarter was $836 million or $0.80 per share. As a reminder, earnings per share included a $0.05 net tax benefit, primarily due to the reinstatement of the federal research tax credit and a net benefit of $0.04 from Restructuring/other charges. 
I'll now comment on our capital management results starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $1.43 billion in the quarter. Inventory days were 115, up 4 days sequentially and down 2 days from a year ago. We plan to provide an update on our inventory model in our capital management call on Tuesday, February 9. Capital expenditures were $164 million in the quarter. 
In 2015, cash flow from operations was $4.27 billion, up 10% from the same period a year ago. For the year, capital expenditures were $551 million or 4% of revenue. As a reminder, our long-term expectation is for capital expenditures to be about 4% of revenue, which includes the expansion of our 300-millimeter Analog capacity on which we will provide an update in our capital management call in February. 
Free cash flow for the year was $3.72 billion, up 6% from a year ago. Free cash flow margin was 28.6% of revenue, up 170 basis points from a year ago. Our free cash flow growth reflects the continued strength of our business model. As we said, we believe free cash flow growth, especially on a per-share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term and will be valued only if it's returned to shareholders or productively reinvested in the business. As we've noted, our intention is to return 100% of our free cash flow plus any proceeds we receive from exercise of equity compensation minus any net debt retirement. 
In the fourth quarter, TI paid $386 million in dividends and repurchased $627 million of our stock for a total return of $1.01 billion. Total cash returned in 2015 was $4.19 billion. Outstanding share count was reduced by 3.4% over the past 12 months and by 41% since the end of 2004 when we initiated a repurchase program designed to reduce our share count. These returns demonstrate our confidence in TI's business model and our commitment to return excess cash to our shareholders. 
Fundamental to our commitment to returning cash are our cash management and tax practices, which are designed to make cash available for a variety of uses, including paying dividends and repurchasing our stock. We ended the fourth quarter with $3.22 billion of cash and short-term investments, with 82% of that cash onshore, making it available to return to shareholders. 
TI orders in the quarter were $3.10 billion, down 2% from a year ago. 
Turning to our outlook. We expect TI revenue in the range of $2.85 billion to $3.09 billion in the first quarter. This includes significantly weaker demand within a sector of the personal electronics market. Specifically, we expect a year-over-year decline of about $150 million within a sector of our personal electronics revenue. Except for this area of weakness, our expectations for the remainder of our business are about even with the year-ago quarter. 
We expect first quarter earnings per share to be in the range of $0.57 to $0.67. Acquisition charges, which are noncash amortization charges, will remain about even and hold at about $80 million per quarter through the third quarter of 2019. They will then decline to about $50 million per quarter for 2 additional years. 
Our expectation for our annual effective tax rate in 2016 is about 30%, and this is the tax rate that you should use for the first quarter and for the year. 
In closing, I'll note that growth in our industry in 2015 was slower than we expected when we came into the year. However, our unique advantages in manufacturing and technology, portfolio breadth, market reach and a diverse and long-lived product positions enabled important milestones in the year. These included expansion of 300-millimeter Analog production, gross margin improvement of 130 basis points to a new record level, operating margin improvements of 260 basis points and free cash flow margin improvement of 170 basis points to a new record level. 
We will continue to feed our unique advantages through disciplined capital allocation and focus on the best growth opportunities, which I believe will enable us to continue to improve. 
With that let me turn it back to Dave."

And we did see that sector weaken late in the quarter, in the back half of the month of December. If I just take and look at for the year how our end markets did, I'll put it -- put that into perspective. I'll start with an area of strength in automotive. That grew in the mid-teens; most of the sectors inside of that growing double digits. Industrial revenue was about even for the year, and we had about half of the sectors there were increasing, offset by the others. Personal electronics, as we've just talked about, grew single digits. I'll note that we had certainly growth in one customer that grew significantly that year, but that was up, primarily offset by declines and others. So therefore, our percentage of our revenue in personal electronics really didn't change too much. It went from 29% last year to 30% this year. Communications equipment was down 20%, and that was primarily driven by wireless infrastructure, and that was down around 30% for the year. And then finally, enterprise systems was down slightly due to projectors.

I can point out that we sell very diverse set of products to that customer, and in fact, hundreds of products to it and products in every major platform. That said, I think that the revenues of that customer reported to be somewhere around 2/3 of it is in smartphones. And you'd expect, since we've got a pretty diverse position across that customer, our revenues would be very similar. So -- and certainly, I think that whenever you have a fairly significant change in demand of any customer, their supply chain considerations, where you've got different pieces of inventory sitting inside of that supply chain, we happen to be on the beginning part of that supply chain. So I won't try to handicap where that is. It's where we think the demand will come in, in the first quarter, and we'll see -- we'll make a prediction on second quarter later."

With the rest of the business, even from last year, there's clearly a lot of investor angst about the macro in general. And clearly, if you look at your business profile throughout '15 and exclude Apple, you saw some weakness in the rest of your business starting in the June quarter, and you've had a couple of quarters of year-over-year declines in total revenue even as personal electronics have done strongly. And so when you look at the macro concerns that are out there, do you feel like that that's been fully reflected in the June, September, December numbers and that you're now coming out of this? Or how do you sort of handicap our macro concerns onto your forward-looking guidance?"

John, I think at the highest level, we think we'll continue to operate in a relatively weak macro economy as we have been for the last couple of years, so nothing terribly exciting in the economy as a whole. If you kind of look at the compares that we're talking about, recall that a year ago, we were seeing sharp declines at car [ph] communications infrastructure, and we were also seeing some pretty stiff headwinds in the form of foreign exchange with the rate of exchange moving against us from a U.S. dollar strength standpoint. So despite that, when you take a look at all that, we actually see, aside from this one sector in personal electronics, the balance of it's going to be about even on a year-over-year basis. So again, the headlines that we're seeing on the macro front and a lot of the angst that you mentioned certainly sounds real, but actually, from a demand signal standpoint from our customers, it's consistent with what I just said. We continue to operate in a weak macro environment with lots of cross currents going on. Again, last year's weakening in the comms infrastructure, very strong auto, foreign exchange issues that we were dealing with. This year, we don't see where those things are coming into play right now."

But I just -- let me just remind you of some moving parts that are going on here, and you can spot it if you take a look at the release that we just put out there. I think the most apparent number you can see on there is the decline in depreciation begin to occur. And clearly, just from an accounting standpoint, that increases our gross profit margin and falls through to EPS. That depreciation will continue its glide path down in 2016, consistent with the fact that a lot of those purchases that we made 5 years ago are now reaching the end of depreciable life. In addition to that, we're seeing a growing portion of our chips being produced in our 300-millimeter capacity. And as you know, it costs us about 40% less per chip or about 20% less per device to manufacture on 300-millimeter versus 200-millimeter. So as that mix improves, that will also fall through to the bottom line. And then the third element that I'd just point out is that we continue to see a mix shift in the source of revenue into industrial and automotive, which tend to have higher overall margins and certainly stickier revenue and margin profiles over time. So collectively, those should help our overall margin and earnings performance, notwithstanding whatever direction revenue takes us through over the next 12 months. In addition to that, from an EPS standpoint, as we have been doing for 11 years now, as long as the intrinsic value of the company is higher than the market value, we will continue to be buyers of TI shares. We reduced our share count 3.4% this past year. And certainly, at current prices, it says we should continue to be active accumulators of TI shares. So combined, we have -- we certainly would have momentum in our favor, notwithstanding any significant change in the revenue profile to continue to help us with earnings per share."

I guess the way I'd answer that is that there are no knobs on the horizon right now of any measure that were similar to what you've seen in the last couple of years. As you pointed out, we had some restructuring actions that we took in Japan and also in certain parts of Embedded Processing over the last 2 years, and those have removed quite a bit of OpEx cost. And those are about done now. They pretty much finished up in the middle of last year. As we look forward, what we would expect to see is what we've talked about in the past, that our OpEx should operate somewhere between 20% and 30% of revenue. In a weak market, it might be pushing 30%. In a reasonably strong market, it might be pushing 20%. I think we're in the low 20s right now, 23% for 2015. So again, as I look forward, I don't see any real material changes to the OpEx profile. I will just remind you that we do always have a seasonable pattern on our OpEx. Just like OpEx was down 3Q to 4Q because of holidays, such as Thanksgiving and Christmas, the OpEx will be up again in 1Q versus 4Q because of the absence of those holidays and also, the annual pay and benefits increases that we institute across the company in the first quarter. And just to kind of give you some parameters on that, it's probably in the 4% to 5% range increase 4Q to 1Q on OpEx."

We see the stocks that they follow maybe in the industrial segment are seeing very, very weak demand. But we turned in revenue that was consistent with what we saw after a very strong year. And fundamentally, what we think is going on inside of that is that there is more semiconductor content going into the industrial market, and we think we're in the very early stages of that. And if you look at the automotive market, I think it's much easier to see that content because we know how many cars ship per year. It's much easier to see the difference between total SAR unit growth and what semiconductors are shipping into it. Certainly, impossible to be able to see inside of the industrial market because it's very, very broad and very, very diverse. But that said, we believe that we've got a decade or more of runway of increasing content inside of the industrial market. So that's about all the insight I think I can share on that. Okay, thank you, Ambrish."

It will take us about 3 years to wind down those operations by our estimate right now as it takes just that much time to requalify those parts into other factories. And at the end of that period, we will no longer have an operation in Greenock. We took a $17 million charge in the quarter as we begin planning for that activity, and we expect that we'll probably continue to incur roughly $2 million of charges per quarter, each quarter through the end of 2018 as we wind it down for total charges of about $40 million over a 3-year period."

I think you rolled in a question about does it change our penchant for acquisition. Again, our belief is that when you acquire a company in the Embedded space, you're picking up additional architectures. And additional architectures doesn't make you stronger, it just makes you bigger. And so we'll continue to look for companies that have characteristics much like a National does if we -- when we are interested and that's the profile of the type of company. Let me just add, too, on the Greenock facility that we do expect to save about $35 million once we've completed all the transition.

This call",724,"Good afternoon, and thank you for joining our First Quarter '16 Earnings Conference Call. As usual, Kevin March, TI's Chief Financial Officer, is with me today. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. A replay will be available through the web as well. 
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description. 
I'll start with a quick summary. Revenue for the quarter was in the upper half of our expected range. Compared with the year ago, notable market activity for our products included continuing strength in automotive as well as improvement in the industrial and communications equipment. Revenue was down 5% due to the weakness in personal electronics market, which declined as expected. 
Our core businesses of Analog and Embedded Processing comprised 87% of first quarter revenue. Analog revenue declined 8% while Embedded Processing revenue grew 8%. Earnings per share was $0.65. With that backdrop, Kevin and I will move on to the details of our performance, which we believe continues to be representative of the ongoing strength of our business model. 
In the first quarter, our cash flow from operations was $547 million. We believe that free cash flow growth, especially on a per-share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long-term. Free cash flow for the trailing 12-month period was $3.7 billion, up 1% from the year-ago. Free cash flow margin was 28.4% of revenue, up from 27.3% a year ago and consistent with our targeted range of 20% to 30% of revenue. 
We continue to benefit from our improved product portfolio and the efficiencies of our manufacturing strategy, the latter of which includes our growing 300-millimeter Analog output and the opportunistic purchase of assets ahead of demand. We believe that free cash flow will be valued only if it's returned to shareholders or productively invested in the business. 
For the trailing 12-month period, we returned $4.2 billion of cash to our investors through a combination of dividends and stock repurchases. Analog revenue decreased 8% from a year ago. The decline was primarily due to high volume Analog & Logic, Power Management and High Performance Analog also declined while Silicon Valley Analog grew. 
Embedded Processing revenue increased 8% from a year ago due to growth in all 3 product lines led by processors. Our investments in Embedded are translating into tangible results as this quarter's revenue is a record. In our Other segment. Revenue declined 10% from a year ago, primarily due to custom ASIC products. Compared with the year-ago distributor resales decreased 4% due to lower demand in personal electronics that I described earlier. 
Inventory increased a couple of days to about 4.5 weeks. We believe this inventory level continues to reflect an environment of good product availability due to healthy TI inventories and stable lead times, which together drive high customer service metrics. As a reminder, inventory in our distribution channel has decreased over the past few years because of our consignment program. Now I'll provide some insight into this quarter's revenue performance by end market versus a year ago. 
Automotive demand remains very strong, driven by infotainment and hybrid electric vehicle and PowerTrain systems. Industrial demand strengthened broadly with most sectors growing. Within personal electronics, we had a portion of demand that declined about $150 million as expected. Overall, personal electronics was down more than that, primarily due to mobile phones. 
Communications equipment was about even from a year ago, an improvement from last quarter when it was down about 15%. And finally, enterprise systems declined. We continue to focus on making our company stronger through manufacturing and technology, the breadth of our product portfolio, the reach of our market channels and our diverse and long-lived positions. These 4 attributes taken together, are at the core of what puts TI in a unique class of companies able to -- capable of long-term free cash flow growth. 
Kevin will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook."

Gross profit in the quarter was $1.82 billion, a 60.6% of revenue, a new record. From a year ago, gross profit increased 290 basis points, primarily due to lower manufacturing costs as well as a higher percentage of more profitable products. Operating expenses were $774 million, about even with the year-ago period. Over the last 12 months, we have invested $1.27 billion in R&D, an important element of our capital allocation. 
Acquisition charges were $80 million, all of which were the ongoing amortization of intangibles, which is a noncash expense. Operating profit was $968 million or 32.2% of revenue. Operating profit was up 1% from the year-ago quarter. Operating margin for Analog was 36.1%. Operating margin for Embedded Processing was 25.0%, 670 basis points higher than a year ago as we focused on investments on the best sustainable growth opportunities with differentiated positions. 
Net income in the first quarter was $668 million or $0.65 per share. Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $547 million in the quarter. Inventory days were 137, as we space our inventory for increased shipments in the second quarter. Also, included were 3 to 4 days of inventory associated with the portion of the personal electronics market that started slowing late in the fourth quarter. We expect to ship this material later this year. Capital expenditures were $124 million in the quarter. 
On a trailing 12-month basis, cash flow from operations was $4.21 billion, up 4% from the same period a year ago. Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $552 million or 4% of revenue. As a reminder, our long-term expectation is for capital expenditures to be about 4% of revenue, which include the expansion of our 300-millimeter Analog capacity. Free cash flow for the past 12 months was $3.65 billion or 28.4% of revenue. Free cash flow was 1% higher than a year ago. This growth reflects the continued strength of our business model. 
As we've said, we believe free cash flow growth especially on a per-share basis is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long-term and will be valued only if it is returned to shareholders or productively reinvested in the business. As we've noted, our intent is to return 100% of our free cash flow plus any proceeds we receive from exercise of equity compensation minus net debt retirement.
In the first quarter, we paid $383 million in dividends and repurchased $630 million of our stock for a total of $1.01 billion. Total cash returned to the shareholders in the past 12 months was $4.17 billion. Outstanding share count was reduced by 3.6% over the past 12 months and by 41% since the end of 2004 when we initiated a program designed to produce [ph] our share count. These returns demonstrate our confidence in our business model and our commitment to return excess cash to our shareholders. 
Fundamental to our equipment to return cash are our cash management and tax practices. We ended the first quarter with $2.80 billion of cash and short-term investments with our U.S. entities owning the 80% of our cash. Because our cash is largely onshore, it is readily available for a variety of uses. Our orders in the quarter were $3.09 billion, down 4% from a year ago. 
Turning to our outlook. For the second quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $3.07 billion to $3.33 billion and earnings per share to be in the range of $0.67 to $0.77. Acquisition charges, which are noncash amortization charges will remain about even and hold at about $80 million per quarter through the third quarter of 2019. They will then decline to about $50 million per quarter for 2 additional years. 
Our expectation for our annual effective tax rate in 2016 is about 30% and this is the tax rate you should use for the second quarter and for the year. So in summary, we believe our first quarter results demonstrate the strength of our business model and with that, let me turn it back to Dave"

We get about 2.3x as many chips per wafer on the 300-millimeter versus 200-millimeter. The wafer processing cost is about 1.4x as much. So if you do the math, that means the actual buy cost is only about 60% as much on a 300-millimeter wafer [indiscernible] 200-millimeter wafer. When you kind of take that all the way through to finished goods, all things being equal, we want to a higher gross margin on those chips manufacturing the 300-millimeter. So that's increasingly important to us. As we look out in the future again, we've got about probably $6 billion [ph] of growth capacity in 300-millimeter and we continue to increase our earnings in that space. In fact, on a year-over-year, we actually had more starts on 300-millimeter than the year-ago."

The margin improvement that we'll see -- is a solid 25% operating profit in the quarter, and that's really much closer to what we expect from that business segment. As you noted, we had about a quarter-over-quarter, about a 62% fall through to operating profit from the revenue growth. And as we go forward, the focus of that division will be primarily on very solid cost containment and cost management, but a lot of energy on growing the top line and growing revenue, so that it can continue to drop through more profit as we go forward. I won't attempt to characterize whether or not we achieve the same levels as Analog. But we're confident there remains room for improvement in that overall P&L, primarily from continued cost containment and the drive towards revenue growth."

The strength was more broad-based and we continue to obviously, see strength in automotive and then the improvement in industrial and comms equipment. So very, very broad-based strength that we saw. So the second part of your question was sequentially what we saw from the trends. There no surprise that automotive remain very strong and it was driven by infotainment as well as the hybrid, electric and PowerTrain systems. Industrial again, we had growth across every sector it outside of industrial plus electronics down with more sectors declining and comms equipment was up sequentially, and that was the third quarter in a row that it actually grew. And then enterprise systems was up due to projectors. So did you have a follow on, Ross?"

And if it doesn't, we know how to react in that environment to. 
So it still continues to be a very good business for us. We continue to make investments with it. And we just know that it will be choppy. Longer-term, we don't view it as a market that will be a growth. We don't think that operators will take their CapEx spending now over the next 5, 10, 15 years.

Our depreciation runs more than 4%. So clearly, they'll have to converge at some point. Our depreciable life and most of our equipment is 5 years, and you may recall that it's about 5 years ago when we brought on several new factories, one in, the equipment regarding our fabric year in the Dallas area, and the factory we bought in China.

As usual, Kevin March, TI's Chief Financial Officer, is with me today. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This cal",727,"Good afternoon, and thank you for joining our First Quarter '16 Earnings Conference Call. 
As usual, Kevin March, TI's Chief Financial Officer, is with me today. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. A replay will be available through the web as well. 
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description. 
I'll start with a quick summary. Revenue for the quarter was in the upper half of our expected range. Compared with the year ago, notable market activity for our products included continuing strength in automotive as well as improvement in the industrial and communications equipment. Revenue was down 5% due to the weakness in personal electronics market, which declined as expected. 
Our core businesses of Analog and Embedded Processing comprised 87% of first quarter revenue. Analog revenue declined 8%, while Embedded Processing revenue grew 8%. 
Earnings per share was $0.65. 
With that backdrop, Kevin and I will move on to the details of our performance, which we believe continues to be representative of the ongoing strength of our business model. 
In the first quarter, our cash flow from operations was $547 million. We believe that free cash flow growth, especially on a per-share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term. Free cash flow for the trailing 12-month period was $3.7 billion, up 1% from the year-ago. Free cash flow margin was 28.4% of revenue, up from 27.3% a year ago and consistent with our targeted range of 20% to 30% of revenue. 
We continue to benefit from our improved product portfolio and the efficiencies of our manufacturing strategy, the latter of which includes our growing 300-millimeter Analog output and the opportunistic purchase of assets ahead of demand. 
We believe that free cash flow will be valued only if it's returned to shareholders or productively invested in the business. For the trailing 12-month period, we returned $4.2 billion of cash to our investors through a combination of dividends and stock repurchases. Analog revenue decreased 8% from a year ago. The decline was primarily due to high volume Analog & Logic. Power Management and High Performance Analog also declined, while Silicon Valley Analog grew. 
Embedded Processing revenue increased 8% from a year ago due to growth in all 3 product lines led by processors. Our investments in Embedded are translating into tangible results as this quarter's revenue is a record. 
In our Other segment. Revenue declined 10% from a year ago, primarily due to custom ASIC products. Compared with the year ago, distributor resales decreased 4% due to the lower demand in personal electronics that I described earlier. 
Inventory increased a couple of days to about 4.5 weeks. We believe this inventory level continues to reflect an environment of good product availability due to healthy TI inventories and stable lead times, which together drive high customer service metrics. As a reminder, inventory in our distribution channel has decreased over the past few years because of our consignment program. Now I'll provide some insight into this quarter's revenue performance by end market versus a year ago. 
Automotive demand remained very strong, driven by infotainment and hybrid electric vehicle and PowerTrain systems. Industrial demand strengthened broadly, with most sectors growing. Within personal electronics, we had a portion of demand that declined about $150 million as expected. Overall, personal electronics was down more than that primarily due to mobile phones. 
Communications equipment was about even from a year ago, an improvement from last quarter when it was down about 15%. And finally, enterprise systems declined. We continue to focus on making our company stronger through manufacturing and technology, the breadth of our product portfolio, the reach of our market channels and our diverse and long-lived positions. These 4 attributes, taken together, are at the core of what puts TI in a unique class of companies able to -- capable of long-term free cash flow growth.

Gross profit in the quarter was $1.82 billion, a 60.6% of revenue, a new record. From a year ago, gross profit margin increased 290 basis points, primarily due to lower manufacturing costs as well as a higher percentage of more profitable products. 
Operating expenses were $774 million, about even with the year ago period. 
Over the last 12 months, we have invested $1.27 billion in R&D, an important element of our capital allocation. 
Acquisition charges were $80 million, all of which were the ongoing amortization of intangibles, which is a noncash expense. 
Operating profit was $968 million or 32.2% of revenue. Operating profit was up 1% from the year ago quarter. Operating margin for Analog was 36.1%. Operating margin for Embedded Processing was 25.0%, 670 basis points higher than a year ago as we focused our investments on the best sustainable growth opportunities with differentiated positions. 
Net income in the first quarter was $668 million or $0.65 per share. 
Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $547 million in the quarter. Inventory days were 137, as we space our inventory for increased shipments in the second quarter. Also, included were 3 to 4 days of inventory associated with the portion of the personal electronics market that started slowing late in the fourth quarter. We expect to ship this material later this year. Capital expenditures were $124 million in the quarter. 
On a trailing 12-month basis, cash flow from operations was $4.21 billion, up 4% from the same period a year ago. Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $552 million or 4% of revenue. As a reminder, our long-term expectation is for capital expenditures to be about 4% of revenue, which include the expansion of our 300-millimeter Analog capacity. Free cash flow for the past 12 months was $3.65 billion or 28.4% of revenue. Free cash flow was 1% higher than a year ago. This growth reflects the continued strength of our business model. 
 
As we've said, we believe free cash flow growth especially on a per-share basis is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term and will be valued only if it is returned to shareholders or productively reinvested in the business. As we've noted, our intent is to return 100% of our free cash flow plus any proceed we receive from exercises of equity compensation minus net debt retirement.
In the first quarter, we paid $383 million in dividends and repurchased $630 million of our stock for a total of $1.01 billion. Total cash returned to the shareholders in the past 12 months was $4.17 billion. Outstanding share count was reduced by 3.6% over the past 12 months and by 41% since the end of 2004 when we initiated a program designed to reduce our share count. These returns demonstrate our confidence in our business model and our commitment to return excess cash to our shareholders. 
Fundamental to our effort to return cash are our cash management and tax practices. We ended the first quarter with $2.80 billion of cash and short-term investments, with our U.S. entities owning the 80% of our cash. Because our cash is largely onshore, it is readily available for a variety of uses. 
Our orders in the quarter were $3.09 billion, down 4% from a year ago. 
Turning to our outlook. For the second quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $3.07 billion to $3.33 billion and earnings per share to be in the range of $0.67 to $0.77. Acquisition charges, which are noncash amortization charges, will remain about even and hold at about $80 million per quarter through the third quarter of 2019. They will then decline to about $50 million per quarter for 2 additional years. 
Our expectation for our annual effective tax rate in 2016 is about 30%, and this is the tax rate you should use for the second quarter and for the year. 
So in summary, we believe our first quarter results demonstrate the strength of our business model. And with that, let me turn it back to Dave."

Roughly a quarter of our Analog revenue was generated on 300-millimeter last year. We have total internal capability, about $8 billion, so we're using about 1/4 of that capability at this point in time. Just to remind everybody else who's listening, the reason the 300-millimeter is so important to us is really the economics at the factory level. We get about 2.3x as many chips per wafer on the 300-millimeter versus the 200-millimeter. The wafer processing cost is about 1.4x as much. So if you do the math, that means the actual die cost is only about 60% as much on a 300-millimeter wafer as on a 200-millimeter wafer. When you kind of take that all the way through to finished goods, all things being equal, we wanted to put a higher gross margin on those chips we're manufacturing on 300-millimeter. So that's increasingly important to us. As we look out in the future again, we've got about probably $6 billion of growth capacity in 300-millimeter and we continue to increase our loadings in that space. In fact, on a year-over-year, we actually had more starts on 300-millimeter than we had a year ago."

If memory serves me correct, when you got out of the Wireless business, you didn't get out of all the cost and you put a lot of that cost into the Embedded Processing market.

The margin improvement that we'll see -- [indiscernible] on this business, now it's a solid 25% operating profit in the quarter, and that's really much closer to what we expect from that business segment. As you noted, we had about a -- quarter-over-quarter about a 62% fall-through to operating profit from the revenue growth. And as we go forward, the focus of that division will be primarily on very solid cost containment and cost management, but a lot of energy on growing the top line and growing revenue, so that it can continue to drop through more profit as we go forward. I won't attempt to characterize whether or not it achieves the same levels as Analog, but we are confident that there remains room for improvement in that overall P&L, primarily from continued cost containment and the drive towards revenue growth."

I think Harlan, the one nice thing about automotive is we can more easily identify what the unit SAAR growth is. And there's enough analysts that follow that market that we can track what the semiconductor content gain in. And there, we think that there's probably somewhere around $350 on average that sells into an automotive. That's a number that's been growing very nicely. And when I look at that, it's probably about 1% of the average sales price of a car. So it's not too hard to imagine that, that number will continue to grow and grow significantly over the future. When you contrast that to industrial, and we think we're in the very early stages of maybe where we were 3, 5 years ago in the automotive market with industrial. You really can't do that same type of analysis unfortunately, because we've got 14 different sectors that we sell into. Underneath that, there are literally hundreds of different and equipment that we track and develop solutions for. And there's just a very, very wide variety of applications. So we can see it going on. And the beauty of it is it's just not one thing. It really is growth on a very broad basis. And I think that, that's reflected in our numbers, not only this quarter, but it's been reflected in the numbers for a number of quarters now. So we really look forward to that opportunity in the future."

As it relates to the closure of the factory in Scotland, just a reminder, we expect that factory will not close before the end of 2018. As it has been with other factories in the past, when we close those things, it usually takes a couple of years as you slowly do lifetime builds on the inventory. And certainly, on other parts of those factories, you'll recall it to other existing factors. And that's just a multiyear effort. So it's progressing as planned, and we, again, don't expect it to actually complete until about the end of 2018."

This cal",727,"Good afternoon, and thank you for joining our First Quarter '16 Earnings Conference Call. 
As usual, Kevin March, TI's Chief Financial Officer, is with me today. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. A replay will be available through the web as well. 
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description. 
I'll start with a quick summary. Revenue for the quarter was in the upper half of our expected range. Compared with the year ago, notable market activity for our products included continuing strength in automotive as well as improvement in the industrial and communications equipment. Revenue was down 5% due to the weakness in personal electronics market, which declined as expected. 
Our core businesses of Analog and Embedded Processing comprised 87% of first quarter revenue. Analog revenue declined 8%, while Embedded Processing revenue grew 8%. 
Earnings per share was $0.65. 
With that backdrop, Kevin and I will move on to the details of our performance, which we believe continues to be representative of the ongoing strength of our business model. 
In the first quarter, our cash flow from operations was $547 million. We believe that free cash flow growth, especially on a per-share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term. Free cash flow for the trailing 12-month period was $3.7 billion, up 1% from the year-ago. Free cash flow margin was 28.4% of revenue, up from 27.3% a year ago and consistent with our targeted range of 20% to 30% of revenue. 
We continue to benefit from our improved product portfolio and the efficiencies of our manufacturing strategy, the latter of which includes our growing 300-millimeter Analog output and the opportunistic purchase of assets ahead of demand. 
We believe that free cash flow will be valued only if it's returned to shareholders or productively invested in the business. For the trailing 12-month period, we returned $4.2 billion of cash to our investors through a combination of dividends and stock repurchases. Analog revenue decreased 8% from a year ago. The decline was primarily due to high volume Analog & Logic. Power Management and High Performance Analog also declined, while Silicon Valley Analog grew. 
Embedded Processing revenue increased 8% from a year ago due to growth in all 3 product lines led by processors. Our investments in Embedded are translating into tangible results as this quarter's revenue is a record. 
In our Other segment. Revenue declined 10% from a year ago, primarily due to custom ASIC products. Compared with the year ago, distributor resales decreased 4% due to the lower demand in personal electronics that I described earlier. 
Inventory increased a couple of days to about 4.5 weeks. We believe this inventory level continues to reflect an environment of good product availability due to healthy TI inventories and stable lead times, which together drive high customer service metrics. As a reminder, inventory in our distribution channel has decreased over the past few years because of our consignment program. Now I'll provide some insight into this quarter's revenue performance by end market versus a year ago. 
Automotive demand remained very strong, driven by infotainment and hybrid electric vehicle and PowerTrain systems. Industrial demand strengthened broadly, with most sectors growing. Within personal electronics, we had a portion of demand that declined about $150 million as expected. Overall, personal electronics was down more than that primarily due to mobile phones. 
Communications equipment was about even from a year ago, an improvement from last quarter when it was down about 15%. And finally, enterprise systems declined. We continue to focus on making our company stronger through manufacturing and technology, the breadth of our product portfolio, the reach of our market channels and our diverse and long-lived positions. These 4 attributes, taken together, are at the core of what puts TI in a unique class of companies able to -- capable of long-term free cash flow growth. 
Kevin will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook."

Gross profit in the quarter was $1.82 billion, a 60.6% of revenue, a new record. From a year ago, gross profit margin increased 290 basis points, primarily due to lower manufacturing costs as well as a higher percentage of more profitable products. 
Operating expenses were $774 million, about even with the year ago period. 
Over the last 12 months, we have invested $1.27 billion in R&D, an important element of our capital allocation. 
Acquisition charges were $80 million, all of which were the ongoing amortization of intangibles, which is a noncash expense. 
Operating profit was $968 million or 32.2% of revenue. Operating profit was up 1% from the year ago quarter. Operating margin for Analog was 36.1%. Operating margin for Embedded Processing was 25.0%, 670 basis points higher than a year ago as we focused our investments on the best sustainable growth opportunities with differentiated positions. 
Net income in the first quarter was $668 million or $0.65 per share. 
Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $547 million in the quarter. Inventory days were 137, as we staged our inventory for increased shipments in the second quarter. Also, included were 3 to 4 days of inventory associated with the portion of the personal electronics market that started slowing late in the fourth quarter. We expect to ship this material later this year. Capital expenditures were $124 million in the quarter. 
On a trailing 12-month basis, cash flow from operations was $4.21 billion, up 4% from the same period a year ago. Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $552 million or 4% of revenue. As a reminder, our long-term expectation is for capital expenditures to be about 4% of revenue, which include the expansion of our 300-millimeter Analog capacity. Free cash flow for the past 12 months was $3.65 billion or 28.4% of revenue. Free cash flow was 1% higher than a year ago. This growth reflects the continued strength of our business model. 
 
As we've said, we believe free cash flow growth especially on a per-share basis is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term and will be valued only if it is returned to shareholders or productively reinvested in the business. As we've noted, our intent is to return 100% of our free cash flow plus any proceed we receive from exercises of equity compensation minus net debt retirement.
In the first quarter, we paid $383 million in dividends and repurchased $630 million of our stock for a total of $1.01 billion. Total cash returned to the shareholders in the past 12 months was $4.17 billion. Outstanding share count was reduced by 3.6% over the past 12 months and by 41% since the end of 2004 when we initiated a program designed to reduce our share count. These returns demonstrate our confidence in our business model and our commitment to return excess cash to our shareholders. 
Fundamental to our effort to return cash are our cash management and tax practices. We ended the first quarter with $2.80 billion of cash and short-term investments, with our U.S. entities owning the 80% of our cash. Because our cash is largely onshore, it is readily available for a variety of uses. 
Our orders in the quarter were $3.09 billion, down 4% from a year ago. 
Turning to our outlook. For the second quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $3.07 billion to $3.33 billion and earnings per share to be in the range of $0.67 to $0.77. Acquisition charges, which are noncash amortization charges, will remain about even and hold at about $80 million per quarter through the third quarter of 2019. They will then decline to about $50 million per quarter for 2 additional years. 
Our expectation for our annual effective tax rate in 2016 is about 30%, and this is the tax rate you should use for the second quarter and for the year. 
So in summary, we believe our first quarter results demonstrate the strength of our business model. And with that, let me turn it back to Dave."

Roughly a quarter of our Analog revenue was generated on 300-millimeter last year. We have total internal capability, about $8 billion, so we're using about 1/4 of that capability at this point in time. Just to remind everybody else who's listening, the reason the 300-millimeter is so important to us is really the economics at the factory level. We get about 2.3x as many chips per wafer on the 300-millimeter versus the 200-millimeter. The wafer processing cost is about 1.4x as much. So if you do the math, that means the actual die cost is only about 60% as much on a 300-millimeter wafer as on a 200-millimeter wafer. When you kind of take that all the way through to finished goods, all things being equal, we wanted to put a higher gross margin on those chips we're manufacturing on 300-millimeter. So that's increasingly important to us. As we look out in the future again, we've got about probably $6 billion of growth capacity in 300-millimeter and we continue to increase our loadings in that space. In fact, on a year-over-year, we actually had more starts on 300-millimeter than we had a year ago."

If memory serves me correct, when you got out of the Wireless business, you didn't get out of all the cost and you put a lot of that cost into the Embedded Processing market. If I look at sort of the incremental margin, up margin sequentially, it's greater than 60%. Are we sort of at a tipping point here where that's kind of the incremental op margin we should start to see about this business? And is there any reason why the Embedded op margin shouldn't converge with the Analog op margins over time?"

What you might recall was that a year ago, we were still in the process of winding up some restructuring actions in the Embedded Processing segment. That finished about the middle of the second quarter. There was a little that bled over into the middle of second quarter. And so consequently, now we're seeing the benefit of those cost restructurings. The margin improvement that we'll see -- we're right on this business, now it's a solid 25% operating profit in the quarter, and that's really much closer to what we expect from that business segment. As you noted, we had about a -- quarter-over-quarter about a 62% fall-through to operating profit from the revenue growth. And as we go forward, the focus of that division will be primarily on very solid cost containment and cost management, but a lot of energy on growing the top line and growing revenue, so that it can continue to drop through more profit as we go forward. I won't attempt to characterize whether or not it achieves the same levels as Analog, but we are confident that there remains room for improvement in that overall P&L, primarily from continued cost containment and the drive towards revenue growth."

They all grew very nicely, but it was led by processors. So our communications infrastructure processors would be inside of that business. But we also sell automotive products that are inside of that business that drove that growth. In the Other business, the custom ASIC business, I'll just say that we sell a different mix of products to customers, so it's not always the same. We've got some customers where we only sell both just Embedded and Analog into those customers. So -- and that said, just as a reminder, longer-term, we do expect that the custom ASIC business will decline because that functionality is being absorbed into our SOCs inside the Embedded business. Thank you, Stacy."

And when I look at that, it's probably about 1% of the average sales price of a car. So it's not too hard to imagine that, that number will continue to grow and grow significantly over the future. When you contrast that to industrial, and we think we're in the very early stages of maybe where we were 3, 5 years ago in the automotive market with industrial. You really can't do that same type of analysis unfortunately, because we've got 14 different sectors that we sell into. Underneath that, there are literally hundreds of different end equipments that we track and develop solutions for. And there's just a very, very wide variety of applications. So we can see it going on. And the beauty of it is it's just not one thing. It really is growth on a very broad basis.

From an Analog standpoint, it actually is very, very broad-based. And one of the things that we've been focused on is broadening the number of business units that the company participates in, in automotive. And I think if you went back 5, 10 years ago, we might have had 1 or 2 business units participating in that marketplace. And today, out of our 70 or so different business units, I think over half of them actually shipped products into that marketplace. So it's very, very broad-based. We've got 5, what we call sectors that make up the automotive market. And again, the largest one is not more than mid-single digits as a percentage of our revenue last year. So they are -- the 5 segments are Infotainment & Cluster; Passive Safety; Advanced Driver Assistance System, or ADAS, as it's known; Body Electronics, which also includes Lighting; and then the Hybrid/Electric Vehicle and PowerTrain.

As usual, Kevin March, TI's Chief Financial Officer is with me today. 
For any of you who missed the release can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. A replay will be available through the web. 
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description. 
I'll start with a quick summary. Revenue and earnings per share for the quarter were solidly in the upper half of our for expected range. Compared with the year ago, demand for our products continue to be strong in the automotive market and grew in industrial and communications equipment market. Despite sequential growth, demand in the personal electronics market was down from a year ago. 
In our core businesses: Embedded Processing revenue grew 9% and Analog revenue was about even with the same quarter a year ago. Operating margins increased in both businesses. Earnings per share were $0.76. With that backdrop, Kevin and I will move on to the details of our performance, which we believe continues to be representative of the ongoing strength of our business model. 
In the second quarter, our cash flow from operations was $1.1 billion. We believe that free cash flow growth especially on a per-share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long-term. Free cash flow for the trailing 12-month period was $3.9 billion, up 7% from a year ago. Free cash flow margin was 30% of revenue, up from 27.4% a year ago. 
We continue to benefit from our improved product portfolio and the efficiencies of our manufacturing strategy, the latter of which includes our growing 300-millimeter Analog output and the opportunistic purchase of assets ahead of demand. We believe that free cash flow will be valued only if it's returned to shareholders or productively invested in the business. 
For the trailing 12-month period, we returned $4.1 billion of cash to investors through a combination of dividends and stock repurchases. From a year ago, Analog revenue was about even with growth in High Performance Analog and Silicon Valley set [ph] by declines in high volume Analog & Logic and Power Management. Embedded Processing revenue increased by 9% from a year ago due to growth in all 3 product line led by processors. Our investments in Embedded continue to build a diverse business of long-lived products that contribute to free cash flow growth over the long-term. 
In our Other segment. Revenue declined 4% from a year ago due to calculators, royalties and custom ASIC products, which was partially offset by DLP products. Now I'll move to provide some insight into this quarter's revenue performance by end market versus a year ago. Automotive demand remained strong with the majority of sectors growing led by infotainment. Industrial demand had broad-based growth, with more than half of the sectors growing. Personal electronics declined broadly led by mobile phone. Communications equipment grew from a year ago but declined sequentially. And finally, enterprise systems group. 
We continue to focus on making our company stronger through manufacturing and technology, the breadth of our product portfolio, the reach of our market channels and our diverse and long-lived position. These 4 attributes, taken together are at the core of what puts TI in a unique class of companies capable of long-term free cash flow growth. 
Kevin will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook."

Gross profit in the quarter was $2.0 billion or 61.2% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit margin increased 300 basis points primarily due to lower manufacturing costs. Operating expenses were $805 million,",696,"Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. Gross profit in the quarter was $2.0 billion or 61.2% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit margin increased 300 basis points primarily due to lower manufacturing costs. Operating expenses were $805 million, up 2% from a year ago. Over the last 12 months, we've invested $1.29 billion on research and development, an important element of our capital allocation. Acquisition charges were $79 million, all of which were the ongoing amortization of intangibles, which is a noncash expense. 
Operating profit was $1.12 billion or 34.1% of revenue. Operating profit was up 11% from the year-ago quarter. Operating margin for Analog was 37.7% and for Embedded Processing, was 25.0%. Our focus investments on the best sustainable growth opportunities with differentiated positions enabled both businesses to continue to contribute nicely to free cash flow growth. Net income in the second quarter was $779 million or $0.76 per share. 
Now let me comment on our capital management results starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $1.07 billion in the quarter. Inventory days were 133, consistent with our long-term model of 105 to 135 days as we staged inventory for expected revenue growth in the third quarter. Capital expenditures were $158 million in the quarter. On a trailing 12-month basis, cash flow from operations was $4.46 billion, up 9% in the same period a year ago. Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $585 million or 4.5% of revenue. 
As a reminder, our long-term expectations for capital expenditures, including the expansion of our 300-millimeter Analog capacity to be about 4% of revenue. Free cash flow for the past 12 months was $3.87 billion or 30.0% of revenue. Free cash flow was 7% higher than a year ago. Our cash flow reflects the strength of our business model. As we said, we believe free cash flow growth, especially on a per-share basis is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long-term and will be valued only if it's returned to shareholders or productively reinvested into the business. 
As we've noted, our intent is to return 100% of our free cash flow plus any proceeds we receive in the exercise of equity compensation minus net debt retirement. For those who may have missed it. In May, we issued $500 million of 6-year debt at a coupon rate of 1.85%. In addition, we have retired $1 billion of debt. This leaves total debt of $3.63 [ph] billion with a weighted average coupon rate of 2.22%. In the second quarter, we paid $382 million in dividends and repurchased $527 million of our stock for a total return of $909 million. Total cash returned to shareholders in the past 12 months was $4.07 billion. 
Outstanding share count was reduced by 3% over the past 12 months and by 42% since the end of 2004 when we initiated a program designed to reduce our share count. These combined returns demonstrate our confidence in our business model and our commitments to return excess cash to our shareholders. Fundamental to our equipment to return cash are our cash management and tax practices. We ended the second quarter with $2.54 billion in cash and short-term investments with our U.S. entities owning about 80% of our cash. This on shore cash is readily available for a variety of uses. Our orders in the quarter were $3.33 billion, up 2% from a year ago. 
Turning to our outlook. For the third quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $3.34 billion to $3.62 billion, and earnings per share to be in the range of $0.81 to $0.91. Acquisition charges, which are noncash amortization charges, will remain about even and hold at about $80 million per quarter through the third quarter of 2019. They will then decline to about $50 million per quarter for 2 additional years. Our expectation for our annual effective tax rate in 2016 is unchanged at about 30% and this is the tax rate you should use for the first quarter and for the year. 
In summary, we believe our second quarter results demonstrate the strength of our business model. With that, let me turn it back to Dave."

The drivers to gross margin were last quarter and going for the forseeable quarter, the same thing we've been seeing for a while and that is, we're seeing depreciation rolling off, which is clarity giving us the company benefit to gross margin. But more importantly, we got increased production on 300-millimeter, which is considerably more cost-effective on a chip level than the equivalent 200-millimeter production. And as we see depreciation continue to roll off, albeit more slowly as we move into future quarters, and more production on 300-millimeter, we'll continue to see the benefit to gross margins. So I think that the -- well, what you've seen going on is just a preview to what you'll see going on if you look out further. If you look out further in time as to what to expect, I think we'll just tell you to do what we've been doing in the past, which is Delta revenue that you forecast in your model that falls through to about 70%, 75% on average overtime, that'll give you a pretty good way to anticipate what the company's gross margin is to pass."

The underutilization cost are almost exactly the same for multiple quarters in a row now. Depreciation has actually come down, so you compare the most recent quarter to $155 million of depreciation. The year-ago quarter was $198 million. So you get about $45 million depreciation, and really the rest of it is just lower overall manufacturing costs. And again, incrementally, we're getting more production on 300-millimeter, which at that dye level has a 40% cost benefit for us. So that's an overall 20% improvement to gross profit margin on -- or excuse me, 20 -- case growth profit margin up effectively because cost comes down that bought them out. So you got the combination of all of those things, laying in together. So again, depreciation down about $45 million, 2Q to 2Q on a year-over-year basis, underutilization charge is pretty flat throughout that period. So it was really a conversion to lower-cost manufacturing."

Again the last couple of years, we're around the middle of that pack we're around 23%, 24%, 25% kind of range, so that's kind of a high level looking OpEx as a whole and more specifically on R&D. When it comes to allocating capital and R&D is certainly a place where we allocate some of that capital, so it's a pretty important thing for any management to pay attention to, we take it extremely seriously that when we do allocate to R&D, we allocate in areas that we believe that we can actually developed differentiated products with very long revenue streams and very high margin opportunities. Now the idea is to maximize the amount of revenue we get on R&D dollars spent. So it's not a percent per se that we're trying to manage to. It's an opportunity that we're going after. And as we just talked about earlier in the call, some of our R&D spending is actually moving up a little bit even in this past few quarters and will probably move up to the next few quarters as we see opportunities to reallocate some of our resources from where they have been into development areas for are in the purposes that will just extend the overall availability of our products and the new marketplace. So we're really looking at opportunistically and not based upon a particular model or percent of revenue or anything like that."

We have been reducing a couple of years up through about May of last year. We've got that OpEx down mostly at the level that we want that. So it really is a question of being able to drive revenue growth and leverage off of the OpEx that we have and that leverage then falls straight through to free cash flow, which is a direct benefit of course, to our shareholders based upon the performance the we talked about capital management. So that's how we tend to look at it as opposed to trying to force a model out of it, the 2 segments being comparable. We look at what they can actually generate online."

And if you look at that $5 billion, 1 of the reasons why we believe that our manufacturing and technology is one of the competitive advantages that we've got is because that $5 billion is significantly larger than any of our Analog competitors that we've got. So that level of scale just doesn't makes sense for them. And beyond our fab, we've got and qualified our second 300-millimeter factory that we creatively called DMOS6, which is a little less than a mile from the office that we're currently in. So I can say that we did qualify that at the end of last year as we were anticipating. And we have revenue-generating wafers that are running through that factory today.

As usual, Kevin March, TI's Chief Financial Officer, is with me today. 
For any of you who missed the release,  you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. A replay will be available through the web. 
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description. 
I'll start with a quick summary. Revenue and earnings per share for the quarter were solidly in the upper half of our for expected range. Compared with a year ago, demand for our products continue to be strong in the automotive market and grew in industrial and communications equipment market. Despite sequential growth, demand in the personal electronics market was down from a year ago. 
In our 4 businesses, Embedded Processing revenue grew 9%, and Analog revenue was about even with the same quarter a year ago. Operating margins increased in both businesses. Earnings per share were $0.76. With that backdrop, Kevin and I will move on to the details of our performance, which we believe continues to be representative of the ongoing strength of our business model. 
In the second quarter, our cash flow from operations was $1.1 billion. We believe that free cash flow growth, especially on a per-share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long-term. Free cash flow for the trailing 12-month period was $3.9 billion, up 7% from a year ago. Free cash flow margin was 30% of revenue, up from 27.4% a year ago. 
We continue to benefit from our improved product portfolio and the efficiencies of our manufacturing strategy, the latter of which includes our growing 300-millimeter Analog output and the opportunistic purchase of assets ahead of demand. We believe that free cash flow will be valued only if it's returned to shareholders or productively invested in the business. 
For the trailing 12-month period, we returned $4.1 billion of cash to investors through a combination of dividends and stock repurchases. From a year ago, Analog revenue was about even with growth in High Performance Analog and Silicon Valley set by declines in High Volume Analog & Logic and Power Management. 
Embedded Processing revenue increased by 9% from a year ago due to growth in all 3 product line led by processors. Our investments in Embedded continue to build a diverse business of long-lived products that contribute to free cash flow growth over the long-term. 
In our Other segment. Revenue declined 4% from a year ago due to calculators, royalties and custom ASIC products, which was partially offset by DLP products. 
Now I'll move to provide some insight into this quarter's revenue performance by end market versus a year ago. Automotive demand remained strong with the majority of sectors growing led by infotainment. Industrial demand had broad-based growth, with more than half of the sectors growing. Personal electronics declined broadly led by mobile phone. Communications equipment grew from a year ago but declined sequentially. And finally, enterprise systems grew.
We continue to focus on making our company stronger through manufacturing and technology, the breadth of our product portfolio, the reach of our market channels and our diverse and long-lived position. These 4 attributes, taken together, are at the core of what puts TI in a unique class of companies capable of long-term free cash flow growth. 
Kevin will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook."

Gross profit in the quarter was $2.0 billion or 61.2% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit margin increased 300 basis points primarily due to lower manufacturing costs. Operating expenses were $805 million,",695,"Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. Gross profit in the quarter was $2.0 billion or 61.2% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit margin increased 300 basis points primarily due to lower manufacturing costs. Operating expenses were $805 million, up 2% from a year ago. Over the last 12 months, we've invested $1.29 billion on research and development, an important element of our capital allocation. 
Acquisition charges were $79 million, all of which for the ongoing amortization of intangibles, which is a noncash expense. Operating profit was $1.12 billion or 34.1% of revenue. Operating profit was up 11% from the year-ago quarter. Operating margin for Analog was 37.7%, and for Embedded Processing was 25.0%. Our focus investments on the best sustainable growth opportunities with differentiated positions enable both businesses to continue to contribute nicely to free cash flow growth. Net income in the second quarter was $779 million or $0.76 per share. 
Now let me comment on our capital management results starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $1.07 billion in the quarter. Inventory days are 133, consistent with our long-term model of 105 to 135 days as we staged inventory for expected revenue growth in the third quarter. Capital expenditures were $158 million in the quarter. On a trailing 12-month basis, cash flow from operations was $4.46 billion, up 9% in the same period a year ago. Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $585 million or 4.5% of revenue. 
As a reminder, our long-term expectations is for capital expenditures, including the expansion of our 300-millimeter Analog capacity, to be about 4% of revenue. 
Free cash flow for the past 12 months was $3.87 billion or 30.0% of revenue. Free cash flow was 7% higher than a year ago. Our cash flow reflects the strength of our business model. As we've said, we believe free cash flow growth, especially on a per-share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long-term and will be valued only if it's returned to shareholders or productively reinvested into the business. 
As we've noted, our intent is to return 100% of our free cash flow plus any proceeds we receive in the exercise of equity compensation minus net debt retirement. 
For those who may have missed it. In May, we issued $500 million of 6-year debt at a coupon rate of 1.85%. In addition, we have retired $1 billion of debt. This leaves total debt of $3.63 billion with a weighted average coupon rate of 2.22%. 
In the second quarter, we paid $382 million in dividends and repurchased $527 million of our stock for a total return of $909 million. Total cash returned to shareholders in the past 12 months was $4.07 billion. 
Outstanding share count was reduced by 3% over the past 12 months and by 42% since the end of 2004 when we initiated a program designed to reduce our share count. These combined returns demonstrate our confidence in our business model and our commitments to return excess cash to our shareholders. 
Fundamental to our equipment to return cash are our cash management and tax practices. We ended the second quarter with $2.54 billion of cash and short-term investments with our U.S. entities owning about 80% of our cash. This onshore cash is readily available for a variety of uses. Our orders in the quarter were $3.33 billion, up 2% from a year ago. 
Turning to our outlook. For the third quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $3.34 billion to $3.62 billion, and earnings per share to be in the range of $0.81 to $0.91. Acquisition charges, which are noncash amortization charges, will remain about even and hold at about $80 million per quarter through the third quarter of 2019. They will then decline to about $50 million per quarter for 2 additional years. Our expectation for our annual effective tax rate in 2016 is unchanged at about 30%, and this is the tax rate you should use for the first quarter and for the year. 
In summary, we believe our second quarter results demonstrate the strength of our business model. With that, let me turn it back to Dave."

Stacy, the drivers to gross margin are -- last quarter and going in for the forseeable future is, the same thing that we've been seeing for a while, and that is, we're seeing depreciation rolling off, which just clearly have given us accounting benefit to gross margin. But more importantly, we've got increased production on 300-millimeter, which is considerably more cost-effective on a chip level than the equivalent 200-millimeter production. And as we see depreciation continue to roll off, albeit more slowly as we move into future quarters and more production on 300-millimeter, we'll continue to see the benefit to gross margins. So I think that the -- well, what you've seen going on is just a preview to what you'll see going on as we look out a little bit further. 
If we look out further in time as to what to expect, I think we'll just tell you to do what we've been doing in the past, which is on a delta revenue that you forecast in your model, that falls through around 70%, 75% on average over time.

The underutilization cost are almost exactly the same for multiple quarters in a row now. Depreciation has actually come down. So you compare the most recent quarter, to $155 million of depreciation. The year-ago quarter was $198 million. So you're getting about $45 million depreciation left. And really, the rest of it is just lower overall manufacturing costs. And again, incrementally, we're getting more production on 300-millimeter, which, at that dye level, has a 40% cost benefit for us. So that's an overall 20% improvement to gross profit margin on -- or excuse me, 20% case growth profit margin up effectively because cost comes down, bottom them out. So you've got the combination of all of those things laying in together. So again, depreciation down about $45 million 2Q-to-2Q on a year-over-year basis. Underutilization charge is pretty flat throughout that period. So it's really a conversion to lower-cost manufacturing."

And that team has been doing a very good job at turning the results of their efforts into solid revenue growth. And consequently, we're seeing the profitability go up. They are committed to continuing in that direction and so I look forward to see what they turn in as we go multiple quarters out."

So that's part of what's going on there. But as you noted, it is down quarter-over-quarter on a day's basis. And typically -- going into third quarter, typically, it tends to be an up revenue quarter for us. And as you mentioned, when we level load the factories, that would anticipate that some of the inventory will be drained as we go through the quarter.

It's a pretty important thing for any management to pay attention to. We take it extremely seriously to make sure that when we do allocate to R&D, we allocate in areas that we believe that we can actually develop differentiated products with very long revenue streams and very high margin opportunities. Now the idea is to maximize the amount of revenue we get on R&D dollars spent. So it's not a percent per se that we're trying to manage to. It's an opportunity that we're going after. And as we've just talked about earlier in the call, some of our R&D spending is actually moving up a little bit even these past few quarters, and will probably continue to move up in the next few quarters as we are seeing opportunities to reallocate some of our resources from where they have been into development areas for R&D purposes that will just extend the overall availability of our products into new marketplaces.

So -- and that's just an environment that I'd say that it's okay. If I used one word to describe it, it's not really strong. It's not really weak. And we're operating in that type of environment. I think the benefit of us having consignment and having consignment with distribution is that our revenues more closely match that demand. That doesn't mean that they can't change quickly in the future at some point. But certainly, we're shipping what we believe -- what we know for sure, and that portion of demand is -- those shipments was very, very close to actual demand and consumption. So thank you, Tore.

For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com",627,"Thank you. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining our second quarter 2016 earnings conference call. As usual, Kevin March, TI's Chief Financial Officer, is with me today. 
For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. A replay will be available through the web. 
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description. 
I'll start with a quick summary. Revenue and earnings per share for the quarter were solidly in the upper half of our expected range. Compared with a year ago, demand for our products continue to be strong in the automotive market and grew in the industrial and communications equipment market. Despite sequential growth, demand in the personal electronics market was down from a year ago. 
In our core businesses, Embedded Processing revenue grew 9%, and Analog revenue was about even with the same quarter a year ago. Operating margins increased in both businesses. Earnings per share were $0.76. With that backdrop, Kevin and I will move on to the details of our performance, which we believe continues to be representative of the ongoing strength of our business model. 
In the second quarter, our cash flow from operations was $1.1 billion. We believe that free cash flow growth, especially on a per-share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long-term. Free cash flow for the trailing 12-month period was $3.9 billion, up 7% from a year ago. Free cash flow margin was 30% of revenue, up from 27.4% a year ago. 
We continue to benefit from our improved product portfolio and the efficiencies of our manufacturing strategy, the latter of which includes our growing 300-millimeter Analog output and the opportunistic purchase of assets ahead of demand. We believe that free cash flow will be valued only if it's returned to shareholders or productively invested in the business. 
For the trailing 12-month period, we returned $4.1 billion of cash to investors through a combination of dividends and stock repurchases. From a year ago, Analog revenue was about even with growth in High Performance Analog and Silicon Valley offset by declines in High Volume Analog & Logic and Power Management. 
Embedded Processing revenue increased by 9% from a year ago due to growth in all 3 product lines, led by processors. Our investments in Embedded continue to build a diverse business of long-lived products that contribute to free cash flow growth over the long-term. 
In our Other segment. Revenue declined 4% from a year ago due to calculators, royalties and custom ASIC products, which was partially offset by DLP products. 
Now I'll move to provide some insight into this quarter's revenue performance by end market versus a year ago. Automotive demand remained strong with the majority of sectors growing led by infotainment. Industrial demand had broad-based growth, with more than half of the sectors growing. Personal electronics declined broadly, led by mobile phone. Communications equipment grew from a year ago but declined sequentially. And finally, enterprise systems grew.
We continue to focus on making our company stronger through manufacturing and technology, the breadth of our product portfolio, the reach of our market channels and our diverse and long-lived position. These 4 attributes, taken together, are at the core of what puts TI in a unique class of companies capable of long-term free cash flow growth. 
Kevin will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook."

Gross profit in the quarter was $2.0 billion or 61.2% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit margin increased 300 basis points primarily due to lower manufacturing costs. Operating expenses were $805 million,",694,"Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. Gross profit in the quarter was $2.0 billion or 61.2% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit margin increased 300 basis points primarily due to lower manufacturing costs. Operating expenses were $805 million, up 2% from a year ago. Over the last 12 months, we've invested $1.29 billion on research and development, an important element of our capital allocation. 
Acquisition charges were $79 million, all of which were the ongoing amortization of intangibles, which is a noncash expense. Operating profit was $1.12 billion or 34.1% of revenue. Operating profit was up 11% from the year-ago quarter. Operating margin for Analog was 37.7%, and for Embedded Processing was 25.0%. Our focused investments on the best sustainable growth opportunities with differentiated positions enable both businesses to continue to contribute nicely to free cash flow growth. Net income in the second quarter was $779 million or $0.76 per share. 
Now let me comment on our capital management results starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $1.07 billion in the quarter. Inventory days are 133, consistent with our long-term model of 105 to 135 days as we stage inventory for expected revenue growth in the third quarter. Capital expenditures were $158 million in the quarter. On a trailing 12-month basis, cash flow from operations was $4.46 billion, up 9% in the same period a year ago. Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $585 million or 4.5% of revenue. 
As a reminder, our long-term expectations for capital expenditures, including the expansion of our 300-millimeter Analog capacity, to be about 4% of revenue. 
Free cash flow for the past 12 months was $3.87 billion or 30.0% of revenue. Free cash flow was 7% higher than a year ago. Our cash flow reflects the strength of our business model. As we've said, we believe free cash flow growth, especially on a per-share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long-term and will be valued only if it's returned to shareholders or productively reinvested into the business. 
As we've noted, our intent is to return 100% of our free cash flow plus any proceeds we receive in the exercise of equity compensation minus net debt retirement. 
For those who may have missed it. In May, we issued $500 million of 6-year debt at a coupon rate of 1.85%. In addition, we have retired $1 billion of debt. This leaves total debt of $3.63 billion with a weighted average coupon rate of 2.22%. 
In the second quarter, we paid $382 million in dividends and repurchased $527 million of our stock for a total return of $909 million. Total cash returned to shareholders in the past 12 months was $4.07 billion. 
Outstanding share count was reduced by 3% over the past 12 months and by 42% since the end of 2004, when we initiated a program designed to reduce our share count. These combined returns demonstrate our confidence in our business model and our commitments to return excess cash to our shareholders. 
Fundamental to our commitment to return cash are our cash management and tax practices. We ended the second quarter with $2.54 billion of cash and short-term investments with our U.S. entities owning about 80% of our cash. This onshore cash is readily available for a variety of uses. Our orders in the quarter were $3.33 billion, up 2% from a year ago. 
Turning to our outlook. For the third quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $3.34 billion to $3.62 billion and earnings per share to be in the range of $0.81 to $0.91. Acquisition charges, which are noncash amortization charges, will remain about even and hold at about $80 million per quarter through the third quarter of 2019. They will then decline to about $50 million per quarter for 2 additional years. Our expectation for our annual effective tax rate in 2016 is unchanged at about 30%, and this is the tax rate you should use for the third quarter and for the year. 
In summary, we believe our second quarter results demonstrate the strength of our business model. With that, let me turn it back to Dave."

Stacy, the drivers to gross margin are -- last quarter and going for the forseeable future is the same thing that we've been seeing for a while, and that is, we're seeing depreciation rolling off, which has clearly given us an accounting benefit to gross margin. But more importantly, we've got increased production on 300-millimeter, which is considerably more cost-effective on a chip level than the equivalent 200-millimeter production. And as we see depreciation continue to roll off, albeit more slowly as we move into future quarters and more production on 300-millimeter, we'll continue to see the benefit to gross margins. So I think that the -- well, what you've seen going on is just a prelude to what you'll see going on as we look out a little bit further. 
If we look out further in time as to what to expect, I think we'd just tell you to do what we've been doing in the past, which is on any delta revenue that you forecast in your model, that falls through around 70%, 75% on average over time.

That's also true year-over-year, by the way. We just got pay and benefit increases. But also importantly on the R&D, as you noted, we have been, for a number of quarters now, reallocating our internal resources towards more development efforts. So those will be resources that may have been working in manufacturing support or they may have been working in SG&A, and we're redeploying those resources into development activity in R&D, and we expect to continue doing that for a number of quarters to come. And so consequently, you're seeing R&D begin to move up a little bit more than what you might see on the G&A line."

C.J., just to think about that, from an underutilization standpoint, frankly, there's no real benefit going on there. The underutilization cost are almost exactly the same for multiple quarters in a row now. Depreciation has actually come down. So if you compare the most recent quarter, $155 million of depreciation, the year-ago quarter was $198 million. So you're getting about $45 million depreciation lift. And really, the rest of it is just lower overall manufacturing costs. And again, incrementally, we're getting more production on 300-millimeter, which, at that dye level, has a 40% cost benefit for us. So that's an overall 20% improvement to gross profit margin on -- or excuse me, 20% -- takes growth profit margin up effectively because cost comes down, bottom them out. So you've got the combination of all of those things weighing together. So again, depreciation down about $45 million 2Q-to-2Q on a year-over-year basis. Underutilization charge is pretty flat throughout that period. So it's really a conversion to lower-cost manufacturing."

So that's part of what's going on there. But as you noted, it is down quarter-over-quarter on a day's basis.

Now the idea is to maximize the amount of revenue we get on R&D dollars spent. So it's not a percent per se that we're trying to manage to. It's an opportunity that we're going after. And as we've just talked about earlier in the call, some of our R&D spend is actually moving up a little bit even these past few quarters, and will probably continue to move up in the next few quarters as we are seeing opportunities to reallocate some of our resources from where they have been into development areas for R&D purposes that will just extend the overall availability of our products into new marketplaces. So we're really look at it opportunistically and not based upon a particular model or percent of revenue or anything like that."

If things were to weaken in that market, and we don't know if that's going to be next quarter or 5 years from now when that does, but we know how to handle those types of situations tactically.

From an OpEx standpoint, we have been reducing OpEx for a couple of years up through about May of last year. We've got an OpEx now mostly at the level that we want it that. So it really is a question of being able to drive revenue growth and get leverage off the OpEx that we have. And that leverage then falls straight through to free cash flow, which is a direct benefit, of course, to our shareholders based upon the formula we've talked about with capital management. So that's how we tend to look at it as opposed to trying to force a model on it that no -- the 2 segments being comparable, we look at what they can actually generate bottom line."

And if you look at that $5 billion, one of the reasons why we believe that our manufacturing and technology is one of the competitive advantages that we've got is because that $5 billion is significantly larger than any of our Analog competitors that we've got. So that level of scale just doesn't makes sense for them. And beyond our fab, we've got and qualified our second 300-millimeter factory that we creatively call DMOS6, which sits a little less than a mile from the office that we're currently in. So I can say that we did qualify that at the end of last year as we were anticipating. And we have revenue-generating wafers that are running through that factory today. So We'll update next year on our capital management call where we stand on that overall utilization, our intent is to build more product inside of there. But we'll wait until then to update it."

For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. A replay will be available through the web. 
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description. 
I'll start with a quick summary. Revenue and earnings per share for the quarter were solidly in the upper half of our expected range. Compared with a year ago, demand for our products continue to be strong in the automotive market and grew in the industrial and communications equipment market. Despite sequential growth, demand in the personal electronics market was down from a year ago. 
In our core businesses, Embedded Processing revenue grew 9%, and Analog revenue was about even with the same quarter a year ago. Operating margins increased in both businesses. Earnings per share were $0.76. With that backdrop, Kevin and I will move on to the details of our performance, which we believe continues to be representative of the ongoing strength of our business model. 
In the second quarter, our cash flow from operations was $1.1 billion. We believe that free cash flow growth, especially on a per-share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long-term. Free cash flow for the trailing 12-month period was $3.9 billion, up 7% from a year ago. Free cash flow margin was 30% of revenue, up from 27.4% a year ago. 
We continue to benefit from our improved product portfolio and the efficiencies of our manufacturing strategy, the latter of which includes our growing 300-millimeter Analog output and the opportunistic purchase of assets ahead of demand. We believe that free cash flow will be valued only if it's returned to shareholders or productively invested in the business. 
For the trailing 12-month period, we returned $4.1 billion of cash to investors through a combination of dividends and stock repurchases. From a year ago, Analog revenue was about even with growth in High Performance Analog and Silicon Valley offset by declines in High Volume Analog & Logic and Power Management. 
Embedded Processing revenue increased by 9% from a year ago due to growth in all 3 product lines, led by processors. Our investments in Embedded continue to build a diverse business of long-lived products that contribute to free cash flow growth over the long-term. 
In our Other segment. Revenue declined 4% from a year ago due to calculators, royalties and custom ASIC products, which was partially offset by DLP products. 
Now I'll move to provide some insight into this quarter's revenue performance by end market versus a year ago. Automotive demand remained strong with the majority of sectors growing led by infotainment. Industrial demand had broad-based growth, with more than half of the sectors growing. Personal electronics declined broadly, led by mobile phone. Communications equipment grew from a year ago but declined sequentially. And finally, enterprise systems grew.
We continue to focus on making our company stronger through manufacturing and technology, the breadth of our product portfolio, the reach of our market channels and our diverse and long-lived position. These 4 attributes, taken together, are at the core of what puts TI in a unique class of companies capable of long-term free cash flow growth. 
Kevin will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook."

Gross profit in the quarter was $2.0 billion or 61.2% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit margin increased 300 basis points primarily due to lower manufacturing costs. Operating expenses were $805 million,",694,"Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. Gross profit in the quarter was $2.0 billion or 61.2% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit margin increased 300 basis points primarily due to lower manufacturing costs. Operating expenses were $805 million, up 2% from a year ago. Over the last 12 months, we've invested $1.29 billion on research and development, an important element of our capital allocation. 
Acquisition charges were $79 million, all of which were the ongoing amortization of intangibles, which is a noncash expense. Operating profit was $1.12 billion or 34.1% of revenue. Operating profit was up 11% from the year-ago quarter. Operating margin for Analog was 37.7%, and for Embedded Processing was 25.0%. Our focused investments on the best sustainable growth opportunities with differentiated positions enable both businesses to continue to contribute nicely to free cash flow growth. Net income in the second quarter was $779 million or $0.76 per share. 
Now let me comment on our capital management results starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $1.07 billion in the quarter. Inventory days are 133, consistent with our long-term model of 105 to 135 days as we stage inventory for expected revenue growth in the third quarter. Capital expenditures were $158 million in the quarter. On a trailing 12-month basis, cash flow from operations was $4.46 billion, up 9% in the same period a year ago. Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $585 million or 4.5% of revenue. 
As a reminder, our long-term expectations for capital expenditures, including the expansion of our 300-millimeter Analog capacity, to be about 4% of revenue. 
Free cash flow for the past 12 months was $3.87 billion or 30.0% of revenue. Free cash flow was 7% higher than a year ago. Our cash flow reflects the strength of our business model. As we've said, we believe free cash flow growth, especially on a per-share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long-term and will be valued only if it's returned to shareholders or productively reinvested into the business. 
As we've noted, our intent is to return 100% of our free cash flow plus any proceeds we receive in the exercise of equity compensation minus net debt retirement. 
For those who may have missed it. In May, we issued $500 million of 6-year debt at a coupon rate of 1.85%. In addition, we have retired $1 billion of debt. This leaves total debt of $3.63 billion with a weighted average coupon rate of 2.22%. 
In the second quarter, we paid $382 million in dividends and repurchased $527 million of our stock for a total return of $909 million. Total cash returned to shareholders in the past 12 months was $4.07 billion. 
Outstanding share count was reduced by 3% over the past 12 months and by 42% since the end of 2004, when we initiated a program designed to reduce our share count. These combined returns demonstrate our confidence in our business model and our commitments to return excess cash to our shareholders. 
Fundamental to our commitment to return cash are our cash management and tax practices. We ended the second quarter with $2.54 billion of cash and short-term investments with our U.S. entities owning about 80% of our cash. This onshore cash is readily available for a variety of uses. Our orders in the quarter were $3.33 billion, up 2% from a year ago. 
Turning to our outlook. For the third quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $3.34 billion to $3.62 billion and earnings per share to be in the range of $0.81 to $0.91. Acquisition charges, which are noncash amortization charges, will remain about even and hold at about $80 million per quarter through the third quarter of 2019. They will then decline to about $50 million per quarter for 2 additional years. Our expectation for our annual effective tax rate in 2016 is unchanged at about 30%, and this is the tax rate you should use for the third quarter and for the year. 
In summary, we believe our second quarter results demonstrate the strength of our business model. With that, let me turn it back to Dave."

Stacy, the drivers to gross margin are -- last quarter and going for the foreseeable future is the same thing that we've been seeing for a while, and that is, we're seeing depreciation rolling off, which has clearly given us an accounting benefit to gross margin. But more importantly, we've got increased production on 300-millimeter, which is considerably more cost-effective on a chip level than the equivalent 200-millimeter production. And as we see depreciation continue to roll off, albeit more slowly as we move into future quarters and more production on 300-millimeter, we'll continue to see the benefit to gross margins. So I think that the -- well, what you've seen going on is just a prelude to what you'll see going on as we look out a little bit further. 
If we look out further in time as to what to expect, I think we'd just tell you to do what we've been doing in the past, which is on any delta revenue that you forecast in your model, that falls through around 70%, 75% on average over time.

C.J., just to think about that, from an underutilization standpoint, frankly, there's no real benefit going on there. The underutilization cost are almost exactly the same for multiple quarters in a row now. Depreciation has actually come down. So if you compare the most recent quarter, $155 million of depreciation, the year-ago quarter was $198 million. So you're getting about $45 million depreciation lift. And really, the rest of it is just lower overall manufacturing costs. And again, incrementally, we're getting more production on 300-millimeter, which, at that dye level, has a 40% cost benefit for us. So that's an overall 20% improvement to gross profit margin on -- or excuse me, 20% -- takes growth profit margin up effectively because cost comes down, bottom them out. So you've got the combination of all of those things weighing together. So again, depreciation down about $45 million 2Q-to-2Q on a year-over-year basis. Underutilization charge is pretty flat throughout that period. So it's really a conversion to lower-cost manufacturing."

I would just point out a couple of things on inventory to kind of keep in mind. Total dollars of inventory are actually down on a year-over-year basis even though days are up, and that's really a function of the higher profitability that the company is performing at now, and you just do the math at a higher gross margin percent, that same inventory towards more days of potential sales. So that's part of what's going on there. But as you noted, it is down quarter-over-quarter on a day's basis. And typically -- going into third quarter, typically, it tends to be an up-revenue quarter for us. And as you mentioned, when we level load the factories, that would anticipate that some of the inventory will be drained as we go through the quarter. But we don't have a specific forecast as days or dollars. We just expect that will probably drain somewhat going into the third quarter, and then we'll continue to adjust our loadings and our expectation for the first and fourth quarter as we continue through the year."

And more specifically on R&D, when it comes to allocating capital -- and R&D is certainly a place where we allocate some of that capital to; it's a pretty important thing for any management team to pay attention to. We take it extremely seriously to make sure that when we do allocate to R&D, we allocate in areas that we believe that we can actually develop differentiated products with very long revenue streams and very high margin opportunities. Now the idea is to maximize the amount of revenue we get on R&D dollars spent. So it's not a percent per se that we're trying to manage to. It's an opportunity that we're going after. And as we've just talked about earlier in the call, some of our R&D spend is actually moving up a little bit even these past few quarters, and will probably continue to move up in the next few quarters as we are seeing opportunities to reallocate some of our resources from where they have been into development areas for R&D purposes that will just extend the overall availability of our products into new marketplaces.

And if you look at that $5 billion, one of the reasons why we believe that our manufacturing and technology is one of the competitive advantages that we've got is because that $5 billion is significantly larger than any of our Analog competitors that we've got.

And as usual, Kevin March, TI's Chief Financial Officer is with me today. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it in our website at ti.com/ir. 
This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. A replay will be available through the web. This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description. 
I'll start with a quick summary. Revenue and earnings per share for the quarter were slightly above our expected range. Compared with a year ago, demand for our products continue to be strong in the automotive market and strengthened in the industrial market. Demand in the personal electronics market was about even from a year ago. In our core businesses, Embedded Processing revenue grew 10% and Analog revenue grew 6% compared with the same quarter a year ago. Operating margins in both -- increased in both business. Earnings per share were $0.94. With that backdrop, Kevin and I will move on to the details of our performance, which we believe continues to be representative of the ongoing strength of our business model. 
In the third quarter, our cash flow from operations was $1.4 billion. We believe that free cash flow growth, especially on a per-share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long-term. Free cash flow for the trailing 12-month period was $3.9 billion, up 8% from a year ago. Free cash flow margin was 29.5% of revenue, up from 27.5% a year ago. We continue to benefit from our improved product portfolio and the efficiency of our manufacturing strategy, the latter of which includes our growing 300-millimeter Analog output and the opportunistic purchase of assets ahead of demand. 
We believe that free cash flow will be valued only if it's productively invested in the business or returned to shareholders. For the trailing 12-month period, we returned $3.8 billion of cash to investors through a combination of dividends and stock repurchases. Also today, we announced a 32% dividend increase that Kevin will provide more detail on in a moment. 
From a year ago, Analog revenue grew 6% due to High Performance Analog, Silicon Valley Analog and Power Management. High Volume Analog & Logic was about even. Embedded Processing revenue increased by 10% from a year ago due to growth in all 3 product lines led by processors. In our Other segment, revenue grew 7% from a year ago, primarily due to calculators and DLP products, and was partially offset by decreases in royalties and custom ASIC products. 
Now I'll provide some insight into this quarter's revenue performance by end market versus a year ago. Automotive demand remained strong with most sectors growing double-digits. Industrial demand improved and had broad-based growth with most sectors growing. Personal electronics was about even, despite continued year-over-year decline in demand from one customer. This decline was offset by growth elsewhere. Communications equipment grew from a year ago and was even sequentially. And lastly, enterprise systems grew. 
We continue to focus on making our company stronger through: manufacturing and technology, the breadth of our product portfolio, the reach of our market channels and our diverse and long-lived positions. These 4 attributes taken together are at the core of what puts TI in a unique class of companies capable of long-term free cash flow growth. 
Kevin will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook."

From a year ago, gross profit margin increased 380 basis points, primarily due to lower manufacturing costs. Operating expenses were $804 million or 21.9% of revenue. For the last 12 months, we've invested $1.33 billion in R&D, an important element of our capital allocation. 
Acquisition charges were $80 million, all of which were the ongoing amortization of intangibles, which is a noncash expense. Operating profit was $1.40 billion or 38.0% of revenue. Operating profit was up 20% from the year-ago quarter. Operating margin for Analog was 40.9% and Embedded Processing was 27.7%. Our focused investments on the best sustainable growth opportunities with differentiated positions enable both businesses to contribute to nice free cash flow growth. 
Net income in the third quarter was $968 million or $0.94 per share. Let me now comment on our capital management results starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $1.41 billion in the quarter. Inventory days were 117, consistent with our long-term model of 105 to 135 days. Capital expenditures were $139 million in the quarter. On a trailing 12-month basis, cash flow from operations was $4.46 billion, up 8% from the same period a year ago. 
Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $585 million or 4% of revenue. As a reminder, our long-term expectation is for capital expenditures, including the expansion of our 300-millimeter Analog capacity, to be about 4% of revenue. Free cash flow for the past 12 months was $3.87 billion or 29.5% of revenue. Free cash flow was 8% higher than a year ago. Our cash flow reflects the strength of our business model. 
As we said, we believe free cash flow growth, especially on a per-share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long-term and will be valued only if it's productively invested in the business or returned to shareholders. Our intent over time remains to returns all of our free cash flow plus any proceeds we receive from the exercise of equity compensation minus net debt [ph] requirements. 
Consistent with this intent, we have announced a 32% or $0.12 increase in our quarterly dividend. This brings our quarterly dividend to $0.50 per share or $2 annualized. I will also note that we have update our long-term dividend model from our prior target for about 50% for our trailing 4-year average free cash flow to a range of 50% to 80%. This new range provides a more robust framework to adjust the allocation of our shareholder returns between dividend growth and share repurchases. 
Today's announcement extends our string of dividend increases to 13 consecutive years, which we believe are important element to shareholder returns. In the third quarter, we paid $382 million in dividends and repurchased $500 million of our stock for a total return of $882 million. Total cash returned to shareholders in the past 12 months was $3.82 billion. Outstanding share count was reduced by 2% over the past 12 months and by 42% since the end of 2004 when we initiated a program designed to reduce our share count. 
These combined returns demonstrate our confidence in our business model and our commitment to return excess cash to our shareholders. Fundamental to our commitment to return cash, our cash management tax practices. We ended the third quarter with $3.14 billion of cash and short-term investments with our U.S. entity owning about 80% of our cash. This onshore cash is readily available for a variety of services. Our orders in the quarter were $3.64 billion, up 6% from a year ago. 
Turning to our outlook. For the fourth quarter we expect revenue in the range of $3.17 billion to $3.43 billion and earnings per share to be in the range of $0.76 to $0.86. Our expectation for our annual effective tax rate in 2016 is unchanged and about 30% and this is the tax rate you should use for the fourth quarter and for the year. 
So in summary, we believe our third quarter results continue to demonstrate the strength of our business model. With that, let me turn it back to Dave."

There are really 4 attributes that we think we have that put us in a pretty unique position versus our competitors and actually quite difficult for them to duplicate. Those include our approach to manufacturing technology, the breadth of our product portfolio, our reach to our market channels and the diversity of all the positions of our products in the marketplace. So when we look at acquisitions, it's about trying to see if we can strengthen those 4 attributes and really starts out by looking at companies from the standpoint of a strategic match. And that means -- well that strategic management leverage, the strength of competitive advantages that we've building on for these last number of years. So from a strategic standpoint, that will probably include a company that's likely engaged in Analog and probably has pretty good exposure to industrial and automotive, which is where we believe most of the growth in the sectors going to happen for quite a few years to come. If potential target passes the strategy test, then we've got to get passed the numbers, that really means the price that we pay for it. Well the return on that price, well the return on that investment capital exceed our weighted average cost of capital on a full year time frame. If we can't get all that to work then we will remain disciplined and just stay on the sidelines. If we look at what's going on in the M&A landscape in the last couple of years, it's like those that there are probably 2 things underway for most participants in that space. They're either trying to increase their scale or broaden their market opportunities because they have fairly narrow markets. In our case, we already enjoy advantages in both of those. So we don't feel compelled to have to move unless we can past that strategy and map test that I just talked about a moment ago."

We have been buying back shares every quarter, since the fourth quarter of 2004. Our method for buying back shares would be disciplined and consistent about how we go about doing it. More importantly, what we've talked about is that we will buy back more shares when the prices are lower and probably fewer shares when the prices are higher. And so to that end, we recently as with today's announcement, have updated our allocation budget, if you will, for what we allocate for free cash flow to dividends from 50% of our trailing 4 years average free cash flow to 50% to 80%. We think this new range provides a more robust network that allows us to adjust the allocation of our shareholders return between dividend growth and share repurchases. To as far as leveraging the balance sheet any further right now, the balance sheet has been leveraged higher in the past. We have been slowly paying that debt back down over time, which means that debt is available should an important strategic opportunity presents itself at the right moment in time.

So we kind of just look at that as an enabling technology. The good news is that, that business complements our Analog product portfolio very well. It isn't one type of product or a technology that's building that business. We've got a very good diversity of customers that we're building over time.

And as usual, Kevin March, TI's Chief Financial Officer is with me today. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. 
This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. A replay will be available through the web. This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description. 
I'll start with a quick summary. Revenue and earnings per share for the quarter were slightly above our expected range. Compared with a year ago, demand for our products continue to be strong in the automotive market and strengthened in the industrial market. Demand in the personal electronics market was about even from a year ago. In our core businesses, Embedded Processing revenue grew 10% and Analog revenue grew 6% compared with the same quarter a year ago. Operating margins in both -- increased in both businesses. Earnings per share were $0.94. With that backdrop, Kevin and I will move on to the details of our performance, which we believe continues to be representative of the ongoing strength of our business model. 
In the third quarter, our cash flow from operations was $1.4 billion. We believe that free cash flow growth, especially on a per-share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long-term. Free cash flow for the trailing 12-month period was $3.9 billion, up 8% from a year ago. Free cash flow margin was 29.5% of revenue, up from 27.5% a year ago. We continue to benefit from our improved product portfolio and the efficiency of our manufacturing strategy, the latter of which includes our growing 300-millimeter Analog output and the opportunistic purchase of assets ahead of demand. 
We believe that free cash flow will be valued only if it's productively invested in the business or returned to shareholders. For the trailing 12-month period, we returned $3.8 billion of cash to investors through a combination of dividends and stock repurchases. Also today, we announced a 32% dividend increase that Kevin will provide more detail on in a moment. 
From a year ago, Analog revenue grew 6% due to High Performance Analog, Silicon Valley Analog and Power Management. High Volume Analog & Logic was about even. Embedded Processing revenue increased by 10% from a year ago due to growth in all 3 product lines led by processors. In our Other segment, revenue grew 7% from a year ago, primarily due to calculators and DLP products, and was partially offset by decreases in royalties and custom ASIC products. 
Now I'll provide some insight into this quarter's revenue performance by end market versus a year ago. Automotive demand remained strong with most sectors growing double-digits. Industrial demand improved and had broad-based growth with most sectors growing. Personal electronics was about even, despite continued year-over-year decline in demand from one customer. This decline was offset by growth elsewhere. Communications equipment grew from a year ago and was even sequentially. And lastly, enterprise systems grew. 
We continue to focus on making our company stronger through: manufacturing and technology, the breadth of our product portfolio, the reach of our market channels and our diverse and long-lived positions. These 4 attributes taken together are at the core of what puts TI in a unique class of companies capable of long-term free cash flow growth. 
Kevin will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook."

Gross profit in the quarter of $2.28 billion was 62.0% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit margin increased to 380 basis points, primarily due to lower manufacturing costs. Operating expenses were $804 mil",702,"Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. Gross profit in the quarter of $2.28 billion was 62.0% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit margin increased to 380 basis points, primarily due to lower manufacturing costs. Operating expenses were $804 million or 21.9% of revenue. Over the last 12 months, we've invested $1.33 billion in R&D, an important element of our capital allocation. 
Acquisition charges were $80 million, all of which were the ongoing amortization of intangibles, which is a noncash expense. Operating profit was $1.40 billion or 38.0% of revenue. Operating profit was up 20% from the year-ago quarter. Operating margin for Analog was 40.9% and for Embedded Processing was 27.7%. Our focused investments on the best sustainable growth opportunities with differentiated positions enable both businesses to continue to contribute nicely to free cash flow growth. 
Net income in the third quarter was $968 million or $0.94 per share. Let me now comment on our capital management results starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $1.41 billion in the quarter. Inventory days were 117, consistent with our long-term model of 105 to 135 days. Capital expenditures were $139 million in the quarter. On a trailing 12-month basis, cash flow from operations was $4.46 billion, up 8% from the same period a year ago. 
Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $585 million or 4% of revenue. As a reminder, our long-term expectation is for capital expenditures, including the expansion of our 300-millimeter Analog capacity, to be about 4% of revenue. Free cash flow for the past 12 months was $3.87 billion or 29.5% of revenue. Free cash flow was 8% higher than a year ago. Our cash flow reflects the strength of our business model. 
As we've said, we believe free cash flow growth, especially on a per-share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long-term and will be valued only if it's productively invested in the business or returned to shareholders. Our intent over time remains to return all of our free cash flow plus any proceeds we receive from the exercise of equity compensation minus net debt requirements. 
Consistent with this intent, we have announced a 32% or $0.12 increase in our quarterly dividend. This brings our quarterly dividend to $0.50 per share or $2 annualized. I will also note that we have updated our long-term dividend model from our prior target of about 50% for our trailing 4-year average free cash flow to a range of 50% to 80%. This new range provides a more robust framework to adjust the allocation of our shareholder returns between dividend growth and share repurchases. 
Today's announcement extends our string of dividend increases to 13 consecutive years, which we believe are important element of shareholder returns. In the third quarter, we paid $382 million in dividends and repurchased $500 million of our stock for a total return of $882 million. Total cash returned to shareholders in the past 12 months was $3.82 billion. Outstanding share count was reduced by 2% over the past 12 months and by 42% since the end of 2004 when we initiated a program designed to reduce our share count. 
These combined returns demonstrate our confidence in our business model and our commitment to return excess cash to our shareholders. Fundamental to our commitment to return cash are our cash management and tax practices. We ended the third quarter with $3.14 billion of cash and short-term investments with our U.S. entities owning about 80% of our cash. This onshore cash is readily available for a variety of uses. Our orders in the quarter were $3.64 billion, up 6% from a year ago. 
Turning to our outlook. For the fourth quarter we expect revenue in the range of $3.17 billion to $3.43 billion and earnings per share to be in the range of $0.76 to $0.86. Our expectation for our annual effective tax rate in 2016 is unchanged at about 30% and this is the tax rate you should use for the fourth quarter and for the year. 
So in summary, we believe our third quarter results continue to demonstrate the strength of our business model. With that, let me turn it back to Dave."

We've got 5 sectors inside of that market and most of them had grown double-digits. Industrial demand improved and the encouraging part of that was that it was very, very broad-based and we had most of the sectors growing. Inside of personal electronics, that was even. And that was despite continued year-over-year declines and demand from one customer. But I think speaking to the diversity of our product portfolio and our customer base, we were able to offset that with growth elsewhere inside of personal electronics. And then communications equipment grew from a year ago, was even sequentially. So -- and lastly, we did see growth in enterprise systems as well. So when we look into the fourth quarter, we don't -- we'll call out anything that is moving around significantly. You've seen us do that in the past when we've had some type of discontinuity to help explain the results. And that's not the case as we move into fourth quarter. So do you have a follow-up, Toshi?"

There are really 4 attributes that we think that we have that put us in a pretty unique position versus our competitors and to actually quite difficult for others to duplicate. Those include our approach to manufacturing technology, the breadth of our product portfolio, our reach to our market channels and the diversity in all the positions that our products enjoy in the marketplace. So when we look at the acquisitions, it's about trying to see if we can strengthen those 4 attributes and really it starts out by looking at companies from the standpoint of a strategic match. And that means will that strategic match leverage the strength and competitive advantages we've been building on for these last number of years. So from a strategic standpoint, that would probably include a company that's likely engaged in Analog and probably has pretty good exposure to industrial and automotive, which is where we believe most of the growth for semiconductor is going to happen for quite a few years to come. If a potential target passes the strategy test, then we got to get passed the number test and that really means the price that we pay for it. Well, the return on that price, well, the return on that investment in capital exceed our weighted average cost of capital in about 4-year time frame. If we can't get all that to work then we will remain disciplined and just stay on the sidelines. As we look at what's been going on in the M&A landscape these last couple of years, it strikes to us that there are probably really 2 things underway for most participants in that space. They're either trying to increase their scale or broaden their market opportunities because they have fairly narrow markets. In our case, we already enjoy advantages in both of those. So we don't feel compelled to have to move unless we can past that strategy and map test, I just talked about a moment ago."

And in fact, why we point to the year-over-year guidance and how that is consistent with just our belief is that things in the macro really haven't changed too dramatically. So that's -- that has gone into the guidance. Do you have a follow-on?"

We have been buying back shares every quarter, since the fourth quarter of 2004. Our method for buying back shares is to be disciplined and consistent in how we go about doing it. More importantly, what we've talked about is that we will buy back more shares when the price is lower and probably fewer shares when the price is higher. And so to that end, we recently as with today's announcement, have updated our allocation budget, if you will, for what we allocate for free cash flow to dividends from 50% of our trailing 4 years average free cash flow to 50% to 80%. We think this new range provides a more robust framework that allows us to adjust the allocation of our shareholder return between dividend growth and share repurchases. To as far as leveraging the balance sheet any further right now, the balance sheet has been leveraged higher in the past. We have been slowly paying that debt back down over time, which means the debt is available should an important strategic opportunity presents itself at the right moment in time. We believe that leveraging now just for the sake of leveraging would actually block the balance sheet from being available should an opportunity present itself out there from a strategic standpoint."

If you reach a point where share price tends to be relatively lower at a point in time, then this allows us to slow down the dividend growth rate and adjust that back towards dividend repurchases. So that's what this new range is designed to do, it's to give us more flexibility to be responsive to the changing market valuations that we see out there."

This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. A replay will be available through the web. This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description. 
I'll start with a quick summary. Revenue and earnings per share for the quarter were slightly above our expected range. Compared with a year ago, demand for our products continue to be strong in the automotive market and strengthened in the industrial market. Demand in the personal electronics market was about even from a year ago. In our core businesses, Embedded Processing revenue grew 10% and Analog revenue grew 6% compared with the same quarter a year ago. Operating margins in both -- increased in both businesses. Earnings per share were $0.94. With that backdrop, Kevin and I will move on to the details of our performance, which we believe continues to be representative of the ongoing strength of our business model. 
In the third quarter, our cash flow from operations was $1.4 billion. We believe that free cash flow growth, especially on a per-share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long-term. Free cash flow for the trailing 12-month period was $3.9 billion, up 8% from a year ago. Free cash flow margin was 29.5% of revenue, up from 27.5% a year ago. We continue to benefit from our improved product portfolio and the efficiency of our manufacturing strategy, the latter of which includes our growing 300-millimeter Analog output and the opportunistic purchase of assets ahead of demand. 
We believe that free cash flow will be valued only if it's productively invested in the business or returned to shareholders. For the trailing 12-month period, we returned $3.8 billion of cash to investors through a combination of dividends and stock repurchases. Also today, we announced a 32% dividend increase that Kevin will provide more detail on in a moment. 
From a year ago, Analog revenue grew 6% due to High Performance Analog, Silicon Valley Analog and Power Management. High Volume Analog & Logic was about even. Embedded Processing revenue increased by 10% from a year ago due to growth in all 3 product lines led by processors. In our Other segment, revenue grew 7% from a year ago, primarily due to calculators and DLP products, and was partially offset by decreases in royalties and custom ASIC products. 
Now I'll provide some insight into this quarter's revenue performance by end market versus a year ago. Automotive demand remained strong with most sectors growing double-digits. Industrial demand improved and had broad-based growth with most sectors growing. Personal electronics was about even, despite continued year-over-year decline in demand from one customer. This decline was offset by growth elsewhere. Communications equipment grew from a year ago and was even sequentially. And lastly, enterprise systems grew. 
We continue to focus on making our company stronger through: manufacturing and technology, the breadth of our product portfolio, the reach of our market channels and our diverse and long-lived positions. These 4 attributes taken together are at the core of what puts TI in a unique class of companies capable of long-term free cash flow growth. 
Kevin will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook."

From a year ago, gross profit margin increased 380 basis points, primarily due to lower manufacturing costs. Operating expenses were $804 million or 21.9% of revenue. Over the last 12 months, we've invested $1.33 billion in R&D, an important element of our capital allocation. 
Acquisition charges were $80 million, all of which were the ongoing amortization of intangibles, which is a noncash expense. Operating profit was $1.40 billion or 38.0% of revenue. Operating profit was up 20% from the year-ago quarter. Operating margin for Analog was 40.9% and for Embedded Processing was 27.7%. Our focused investments on the best sustainable growth opportunities with differentiated positions enable both businesses to continue to contribute nicely to free cash flow growth. 
Net income in the third quarter was $968 million or $0.94 per share. Let me now comment on our capital management results starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $1.41 billion in the quarter. Inventory days were 117, consistent with our long-term model of 105 to 135 days. Capital expenditures were $139 million in the quarter. On a trailing 12-month basis, cash flow from operations was $4.46 billion, up 8% from the same period a year ago. 
Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $585 million or 4% of revenue. As a reminder, our long-term expectation is for capital expenditures, including the expansion of our 300-millimeter Analog capacity, to be about 4% of revenue. Free cash flow for the past 12 months was $3.87 billion or 29.5% of revenue. Free cash flow was 8% higher than a year ago. Our cash flow reflects the strength of our business model. 
As we've said, we believe free cash flow growth, especially on a per-share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long-term and will be valued only if it's productively invested in the business or returned to shareholders. Our intent over time remains to return all of our free cash flow plus any proceeds we receive from the exercise of equity compensation minus net debt requirements. 
Consistent with this intent, we have announced a 32% or $0.12 increase in our quarterly dividend. This brings our quarterly dividend to $0.50 per share or $2 annualized. I will also note that we have updated our long-term dividend model from our prior target of about 50% for our trailing 4-year average free cash flow to a range of 50% to 80%. This new range provides a more robust framework to adjust the allocation of our shareholder returns between dividend growth and share repurchases. 
Today's announcement extends our string of dividend increases to 13 consecutive years, which we believe are important element of shareholder returns. In the third quarter, we paid $382 million in dividends and repurchased $500 million of our stock for a total return of $882 million. Total cash returned to shareholders in the past 12 months was $3.82 billion. Outstanding share count was reduced by 2% over the past 12 months and by 42% since the end of 2004 when we initiated a program designed to reduce our share count. 
These combined returns demonstrate our confidence in our business model and our commitment to return excess cash to our shareholders. Fundamental to our commitment to return cash are our cash management and tax practices. We ended the third quarter with $3.14 billion of cash and short-term investments with our U.S. entities owning about 80% of our cash. This onshore cash is readily available for a variety of uses. Our orders in the quarter were $3.64 billion, up 6% from a year ago. 
Turning to our outlook. For the fourth quarter we expect revenue in the range of $3.17 billion to $3.43 billion and earnings per share to be in the range of $0.76 to $0.86. Our expectation for our annual effective tax rate in 2016 is unchanged at about 30% and this is the tax rate you should use for the fourth quarter and for the year. 
So in summary, we believe our third quarter results continue to demonstrate the strength of our business model. With that, let me turn it back to Dave."

We've got 5 sectors inside of that market and most of them had grown double-digits.

And that was despite continued year-over-year declines and demand from one customer. But I think speaking to the diversity of our product portfolio and our customer base, we were able to offset that with growth elsewhere inside of personal electronics. And then communications equipment grew from a year ago, was even sequentially. So -- and lastly, we did see growth in enterprise systems as well.

There are really 4 attributes that we think that we have that put us in a pretty unique position versus our competitors and to actually quite difficult for others to duplicate. Those include our approach to manufacturing technology, the breadth of our product portfolio, our reach to our market channels and the diversity in all the positions that our products enjoy in the marketplace. So when we look at the acquisitions, it's about trying to see if we can strengthen those 4 attributes and really it starts out by looking at companies from the standpoint of a strategic match. And that means will that strategic match leverage the strength and competitive advantages we've been building on for these last number of years. So from a strategic standpoint, that would probably include a company that's likely engaged in Analog and probably has pretty good exposure to industrial and automotive, which is where we believe most of the growth for semiconductor is going to happen for quite a few years to come. If a potential target passes the strategy test, then we got to get passed the number test and that really means the price that we pay for it. Well, the return on that price, well, the return on that investment in capital exceed our weighted average cost of capital in about 4-year time frame. If we can't get all that to work then we will remain disciplined and just stay on the sidelines. As we look at what's been going on in the M&A landscape these last couple of years, it strikes us that there are probably really 2 things underway for most participants in that space. They're either trying to increase their scale or broaden their market opportunities because they have fairly narrow markets. In our case, we already enjoy advantages in both of those. So we don't feel compelled to have to move unless we can pass that strategy and math test, I just talked about a moment ago."

So as an example, 3 years ago, we discontinued our incentive programs for demand creation on accounts that represented about 80% of the TAM where we had resources calling on those accounts directly. And we made that change because our team is just more effective and efficient at demand creation. And this has played out as we've continued to gain share every year since then. And then more recently, we've discontinued the incentives for the remaining balance of the account. So -- and so we expect, as with all relationships, we'll continue to evolve.

More importantly, what we've talked about is that we will buy back more shares when the price is lower and probably fewer shares when the price is higher. And so to that end, we recently as with today's announcement, have updated our allocation budget, if you will, for what we allocate for free cash flow to dividends from 50% of our trailing 4 years average free cash flow to 50% to 80%. We think this new range provides a more robust framework that allows us to adjust the allocation of our shareholder return between dividend growth and share repurchases. To as far as leveraging the balance sheet any further right now, the balance sheet has been leveraged higher in the past. We have been slowly paying that debt back down over time, which means the debt is available should an important strategic opportunity presents itself at the right moment in time.

We call it -- we take all the free cash flow and we use it either for dividend or buyback. And this allows us to allocate more towards dividend growth as opposed to buyback going forward. If we reach a point where share price tends to be relatively lower at a point in time, then this allows us to slow down the dividend growth rate and adjust that back towards dividend repurchases.

And as usual, Kevin March, TI's Chief Financial Officer is with me today. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. 
This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. A replay will be available through the web. This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description. 
I'll start with a quick summary. Revenue and earnings per share for the quarter were slightly above our expected range. Compared with a year ago, demand for our products continue to be strong in the automotive market and strengthened in the industrial market. Demand in the personal electronics market was about even from a year ago. In our core businesses, Embedded Processing revenue grew 10% and Analog revenue grew 6% compared with the same quarter a year ago. Operating margins in both -- increased in both businesses. Earnings per share were $0.94. With that backdrop, Kevin and I will move on to the details of our performance, which we believe continues to be representative of the ongoing strength of our business model. 
In the third quarter, our cash flow from operations was $1.4 billion. We believe that free cash flow growth, especially on a per-share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long-term. Free cash flow for the trailing 12-month period was $3.9 billion, up 8% from a year ago. Free cash flow margin was 29.5% of revenue, up from 27.5% a year ago. We continue to benefit from our improved product portfolio and the efficiency of our manufacturing strategy, the latter of which includes our growing 300-millimeter Analog output and the opportunistic purchase of assets ahead of demand. 
We believe that free cash flow will be valued only if it's productively invested in the business or returned to shareholders. For the trailing 12-month period, we returned $3.8 billion of cash to investors through a combination of dividends and stock repurchases. Also today, we announced a 32% dividend increase that Kevin will provide more detail on in a moment. 
From a year ago, Analog revenue grew 6% due to High Performance Analog, Silicon Valley Analog and Power Management. High Volume Analog & Logic was about even. Embedded Processing revenue increased by 10% from a year ago due to growth in all 3 product lines led by processors. In our Other segment, revenue grew 7% from a year ago, primarily due to calculators and DLP products, and was partially offset by decreases in royalties and custom ASIC products. 
Now I'll provide some insight into this quarter's revenue performance by end market versus a year ago. Automotive demand remained strong with most sectors growing double-digits. Industrial demand improved and had broad-based growth with most sectors growing. Personal electronics was about even, despite continued year-over-year decline in demand from one customer. This decline was offset by growth elsewhere. Communications equipment grew from a year ago and was even sequentially. And lastly, enterprise systems grew. 
We continue to focus on making our company stronger through: manufacturing and technology, the breadth of our product portfolio, the reach of our market channels and our diverse and long-lived positions. These 4 attributes taken together are at the core of what puts TI in a unique class of companies capable of long-term free cash flow growth. 
Kevin will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook."

From a year ago, gross profit margin increased 380 basis points, primarily due to lower manufacturing costs. Operating expenses were $804 million or 21.9% of revenue. Over the last 12 months, we've invested $1.33 billion in R&D, an important element of our capital allocation. 
Acquisition charges were $80 million, all of which were the ongoing amortization of intangibles, which is a noncash expense. Operating profit was $1.40 billion or 38.0% of revenue. Operating profit was up 20% from the year-ago quarter. Operating margin for Analog was 40.9% and for Embedded Processing was 27.7%. Our focused investments on the best sustainable growth opportunities with differentiated positions enable both businesses to continue to contribute nicely to free cash flow growth. 
Net income in the third quarter was $968 million or $0.94 per share. Let me now comment on our capital management results starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $1.41 billion in the quarter. Inventory days were 117, consistent with our long-term model of 105 to 135 days. Capital expenditures were $139 million in the quarter. On a trailing 12-month basis, cash flow from operations was $4.46 billion, up 8% from the same period a year ago. 
Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $585 million or 4% of revenue. As a reminder, our long-term expectation is for capital expenditures, including the expansion of our 300-millimeter Analog capacity, to be about 4% of revenue. Free cash flow for the past 12 months was $3.87 billion or 29.5% of revenue. Free cash flow was 8% higher than a year ago. Our cash flow reflects the strength of our business model. 
As we've said, we believe free cash flow growth, especially on a per-share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long-term and will be valued only if it's productively invested in the business or returned to shareholders. Our intent over time remains to return all of our free cash flow plus any proceeds we receive from the exercise of equity compensation minus net debt requirements. 
Consistent with this intent, we have announced a 32% or $0.12 increase in our quarterly dividend. This brings our quarterly dividend to $0.50 per share or $2 annualized. I will also note that we have updated our long-term dividend model from our prior target of about 50% for our trailing 4-year average free cash flow to a range of 50% to 80%. This new range provides a more robust framework to adjust the allocation of our shareholder returns between dividend growth and share repurchases. 
Today's announcement extends our string of dividend increases to 13 consecutive years, which we believe are important element of shareholder returns. In the third quarter, we paid $382 million in dividends and repurchased $500 million of our stock for a total return of $882 million. Total cash returned to shareholders in the past 12 months was $3.82 billion. Outstanding share count was reduced by 2% over the past 12 months and by 42% since the end of 2004 when we initiated a program designed to reduce our share count. 
These combined returns demonstrate our confidence in our business model and our commitment to return excess cash to our shareholders. Fundamental to our commitment to return cash are our cash management and tax practices. We ended the third quarter with $3.14 billion of cash and short-term investments with our U.S. entities owning about 80% of our cash. This onshore cash is readily available for a variety of uses. Our orders in the quarter were $3.64 billion, up 6% from a year ago. 
Turning to our outlook. For the fourth quarter we expect revenue in the range of $3.17 billion to $3.43 billion and earnings per share to be in the range of $0.76 to $0.86. Our expectation for our annual effective tax rate in 2016 is unchanged at about 30% and this is the tax rate you should use for the fourth quarter and for the year. 
So in summary, we believe our third quarter results continue to demonstrate the strength of our business model. With that, let me turn it back to Dave."

And that was despite continued year-over-year declines and demand from one customer. But I think speaking to the diversity of our product portfolio and our customer base, we were able to offset that with growth elsewhere inside of personal electronics. And then communications equipment grew from a year ago, was even sequentially. So -- and lastly, we did see growth in enterprise systems as well. So when we look into the fourth quarter, we don't -- we'll call out anything that is moving around significantly.

There are really 4 attributes that we think that we have that put us in a pretty unique position versus our competitors and to actually quite difficult for others to duplicate. Those include our approach to manufacturing technology, the breadth of our product portfolio, our reach to our market channels and the diversity in all the positions that our products enjoy in the marketplace. So when we look at the acquisitions, it's about trying to see if we can strengthen those 4 attributes and really it starts out by looking at companies from the standpoint of a strategic match. And that means will that strategic match leverage the strength and competitive advantages we've been building on for these last number of years. So from a strategic standpoint, that would probably include a company that's likely engaged in Analog and probably has pretty good exposure to industrial and automotive, which is where we believe most of the growth for semiconductor is going to happen for quite a few years to come. If a potential target passes the strategy test, then we got to get passed the number test and that really means the price that we pay for it. Well, the return on that price, well, the return on that investment in capital exceed our weighted average cost of capital in about 4-year time frame. If we can't get all that to work then we will remain disciplined and just stay on the sidelines. As we look at what's been going on in the M&A landscape these last couple of years, it strikes us that there are probably really 2 things underway for most participants in that space. They're either trying to increase their scale or broaden their market opportunities because they have fairly narrow markets. In our case, we already enjoy advantages in both of those. So we don't feel compelled to have to move unless we can pass that strategy and math test, I just talked about a moment ago."

We think this new range provides a more robust framework that allows us to adjust the allocation of our shareholder return between dividend growth and share repurchases. To as far as leveraging the balance sheet any further right now, the balance sheet has been leveraged higher in the past. We have been slowly paying that debt back down over time, which means the debt is available should an important strategic opportunity presents itself at the right moment in time.

We call it -- we take all the free cash flow and we use it either for dividend or buyback. And this allows us to allocate more towards dividend growth as opposed to buyback going forward. If we reach a point where share price tends to be relatively lower at a point in time, then this allows us to slow down the dividend growth rate and adjust that back towards dividend repurchases.

Your R&D has sort of increased double-digits for a few quarters. It sounds like it will do so again. I guess, does that suggest that you're kind of shifting a little bit from harvest into investing more in your business? And if that's the case, should we recalibrate expectations maybe in calendar '17 and '18, that the share gain that you guys have typically had of 30, 40, 50 basis points could be somewhat higher given all the investments you're making?"

And really what we're doing on this stuff today, we're being very disciplined on R&D as well. We're not spending just for the sake of spending, but we're spending because we have a higher degree of confidence in the ideas that are coming to us that we can actually turn that into profitable revenue growth and ideally, market share. And we're doing that by just reallocating our internal resources as I mentioned, meaning we're not taking our total spending up, but we're taking people who may have been working in the manufacturing lines or people who may have been working in sales or general administrative areas and putting them into working on R&D projects as well. So as an overall reallocation internally, and I would expect that, that will continue to support our market share gains as we go forward."

And I think that, that just speaks to the quality of the market. So I think this -- these opportunities that Kevin's talking about just gives us confidence that we can continue to have share gains in the future. So thanks, Amit.

And we have been pretty much every quarter, picking up some pieces of equipment here or there. But again, we look at the total opportunity, meaning, can we get it at the right price? And can it be something that will contribute to our free cash flow as we go forward? And so we look at it in that context when we consider these sort of things. So I would expect that we'll continue to be out there, making opportunistic acquisitions. Some may rise to the level of an announcement, but most of them will probably just remain as they have been, just spot purchase that we do from time to time as we look around the world."

So like you said, in the comms equipment space, you've got processors that have multicores of both ARMs and DSPs, but also have a heavy component of hardware accelerators. Our OMAP products that are gaining traction in automotive and other applications inside of industrial, have DSPs inside of them. If you look at our communication products where we support over a dozen different standards that helped machines be connected and be smarter, they will have DSPs inside of them. So we kind of just look at that as an enabling technology. The good news is that, that business complements our Analog product portfolio very well. It isn't one type of product or a technology that's building that business. We've got a very good diversity of customers that we're building over time. So we're encouraged by the confidence and the sustainability of that revenue. And the wires underneath and the technology underneath are important on how we deliver it.
