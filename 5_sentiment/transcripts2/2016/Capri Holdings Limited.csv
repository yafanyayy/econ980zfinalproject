Good morning, and welcome to Michael Kors' third quarter fiscal 2016 earnings call. I'm pleased to report that our revenues, comparable store sales and earnings per share results for the third quarter exceeded our expectation, which",1757,"Thank you, Krystyna. Good morning, and welcome to Michael Kors' third quarter fiscal 2016 earnings call. 
I'm pleased to report that our revenues, comparable store sales and earnings per share results for the third quarter exceeded our expectation, which speaks to the enduring strength of the Michael Kors luxury brand, in particular, during the all-important holiday season. We know that consumers have a lot of choices when it comes to what brands they purchase. And the fact that they chose Michael Kors is a great testament to our world-class design team, strong product offering and the lasting connection that we have fostered with our customers. 
For the quarter, total revenue increased 6% on a reported basis. In constant currency, total revenue increased 10% driven by growth across segments and geographies. Earnings per share increased 7% to $1.59 on a reported basis, and on a constant-currency basis, earnings per share grew 11%. 
Our Retail business delivered solid results across all geographies driven by strong double-digit sales growth in our digital flagship business and new store openings. On a constant-currency basis, global comparable store sales increased 2%, which was ahead of our expectations and marked another quarter of sequential improvement. Importantly, while mall traffic in North America declined, we saw a significant increase in conversion rates in our own retail stores, which further illustrates the strength of the Michael Kors brand. On a constant-currency basis, comp store sales rose in the low single digits in North America and Europe and in the high double digits in Japan. While our wholesale business was roughly flat for the quarter on a reported basis, we delivered results above our expectations despite the challenging and highly promotional retail environment. In fact, while the North American department store channel was challenged, we believe our results continue to outpace the overall channel performance, which enabled us to further strengthen our leadership position in this channel. Internationally, European wholesale sales grew 4% on a reported basis and almost 20% on a constant-currency basis, and we saw 26% growth in our Asian wholesale business. 
We also achieved solid growth in our licensing business. While the overall watch category remains challenged during the third quarter, we were excited to see favorable response to the newness that we introduced into our watch offering as well as our jewelry assortment. In watches, Navy, Sable and black platings as well as colored leather straps proved to be sought-after additions in our collection. Customers also responded well to our updated jewelry offering with particular strength in the padlock, parts and disc motifs. And our watch and bracelet gift sets were strong sellers during the season.  Our fragrance collections for women as well as men's fragrance also proved to be great gifts with our customers who are shopping for family and friends are looking to treat themselves to something special. We were also pleased to see strong growth of our fragrance offering in the travel retail channel worldwide. In addition, we continue to see very positive response to our eyewear collections and are happy that our new partnership in this category has been such a strong success. 
Turning to our product categories. We were pleased with the performance of our accessories business where we injected new styles that contributed to strong growth and market share gains in the quarter. Total accessory sales on a retail basis grew at a high single digit rate globally and a mid-single digit rate in North America demonstrating our leadership in this category, especially against a difficult retail backdrop. The demand for smaller-sized bags, crossbodies and small leather goods continued to impact AUR in the quarter. However, we again saw a high double-digit increase in units sold proving that customers continue to seek out Michael Kors luxury accessories. Footwear sales were also strong during the quarter driven by our fashion active category. Unfortunately, the unseasonably warm weather hurt boot sales, which negatively impacted our footwear margins and AUR. Overall, our new merchandise assortment for holiday reflected the latest designs from Michael and our design team and spotlighted modern and glamor, easy elegance and sports lux essentials. The updated silhouettes as well as our gifting assortment resonated well with customers globally and our #JustBecause marketing campaign proved very successful in connecting our customers with just the right gift for everyone on their shopping list. 
Looking ahead, we remain focused on executing our key strategic initiatives that will drive us towards our long-term growth targets. First and foremost, we remain committed to delivering luxury products that embodies fashion, design innovation and the Michael Kors luxury brand DNA. 
As we look to the spring season, we will be introducing our largest assortment of new handbag groups created to inspire our customers with exciting new trends. Our collections will underscore Michael's fashion leadership with an offering that reflects new color pallets, innovative materials, embellishment, mixed-media in leather, luxurious textures and elegant silhouettes across product categories. In footwear, the fashion active category remains one of our highest growing areas, and we expect to leverage this trend in the spring. We're also capturing the denim trend in our accessories and apparel assortments, which are featured in our new national advertising ad campaigns. We have begun to evolve our advertising campaigns to reflect the glamorous destinations and inspirational moments of the modern Michael Kors customer. Our integrated marketing programs with compelling digital and social media campaigns delivered through desktop and mobile devices as well as traditional prints, billboards and target marketing are designed to extend our reach allowing us to engage consumers with our brand, immerse them in the Michael Kors Lifestyle and encourage them to shop our sites and stores. 
In our retail business, we continue to develop our digital flagship strategy globally at a rapid pace and build upon our omnichannel capabilities. We have digital platforms in place in the U.S. and Canada, and we are on track to launch in 6 European countries this fall and an additional 16 countries in Europe thereafter. 
Importantly, we are working to seamlessly integrate the consumer shopping experience across all touch points. We are taking steps to enhance our mobile shopping experience and expect to see the benefits of these measures over the coming months. We will also begin to leverage our analytics and CRM capabilities to share Michael's message with consumers through various communication vehicles and to present and tailor our styling to the individual customer. Overall, our digital flagship strategy is enabling us to engage consumers with our luxury lifestyle brand and provide a best-in-class shopping experience. As you know, we have a strong and influential online presence as consumers turn to Michael Kors for fashion insights, and we continue to see our fan base grow across all social media platforms, further demonstrating the power of our brand. In addition, we remain focused on expanding our global retail footprint, and we will continue to open flagship locations in key cities around the world to drive revenues and brand recognition. Our latest flagship opened this past November in the Ginza district in Tokyo and we will be opening new flagships in London, Seoul and Singapore this coming year. These locations not only enable us to present the most expansive collection of our fashion product, including both our collection and lifestyle offerings as well as men's products in the select location, but also showcase the Michael Kors luxury DNA for consumers worldwide. Internationally, we completed the integration of our Korean business in January and are excited about the retail growth potential in this market. Lastly, we continue to extend our men's presence at retail both the standalone stores as well as through the addition of our men's offering in our existing lifestyle stores in North America, Europe and Asia. We opened 4 men's location this quarter in Scottsdale Fashion Square in Arizona, Memorial City in Houston, Garden State Plaza in New Jersey and San Francisco Center in California. And we are pleased with the initial consumer response. At the end of this fiscal year, we expect our full men's assortment to be available on 11 locations and we continue to believe there's a potential for up to 500 locations worldwide. 
In our wholesale channel, we expect moderately lower sales growth. As we have stated previously, we will be managing our North American wholesale inventory to ensure that we maintain the integrity of our brand. We see continued sales growth internationally from the expansion of our accessories, women's wear and footwear business and the development of our men's category. We remain particularly excited about the expansion of our men's business in wholesale, and are on track to open 75 men's shop-in-shops globally this year. 
Importantly, we continue to believe that this is a significant new category for the company, and I am confident that we can develop this business and become a leading man's luxury brand. 
In licensing, we are excited about the continued growth opportunity of our fragrance and eyewear categories and the newness in the watch category as we continue to introduce updated watch styles and launch our new connected fashion line later this year. As we look at consumer trends, we believe that connected accessories will reshape the fashion watch business globally. Michael Kors is known for being at the forefront of the fashion watch category, and we expect to quickly emerge as a leader in connected fashion as well. 
Turning to our regional licenses. We remain focused on expanding our presence across Asia, which represents a significant growth opportunity for our company. In Greater China, we continue to see an increase in brand acceptance, as evidenced by another quarter of double-digit comp store sales growth. As the Chinese consumer's desire for our brand builds, we are capturing this demand, both in the region and as they travel globally to our airport locations worldwide and in areas such as Japan, Korea and Europe. We look forward to our continued the global expansion through our strong regional partnerships and growing demand for our luxury brands. 
In summary, we are pleased with the success we achieved in the third quarter with an excellent holiday season driven by a luxury fashion product assortment, strength of our digital flagship and sequential improvement in our comparable store sales as well as continued success of our wholesale business. Our results demonstrate the sustained demand for our luxury fashion products globally and the market leadership of the Michael Kors brand. 
Now let me turn it over to Joe for a detailed review of our third quarter financial results and our outlook."

We are pleased to report financial results above our guidance for the third quarter. Total revenue grew 6.3% to $1.4 billion. On a constant-currency basis, total revenue grew 9.9% driven by increases across the Americas, Europe and Japan of 1.4%, 29.1% and 68%, respectively. In our Retail segment, net sales increased 11.1%. In constant currency, retail net sales increased 15.7% driven by the opening of 114 net new stores since the third quarter of last year and strong performance of our digital flagships. We saw a marginal decline in comps of 0.9% on a reported basis. On a constant-currency basis, comp store sales increased 2.0% reflecting a sequential improvement from the second quarter of our total comp as well as our retail store comp and outperformance versus our guidance. The increase is attributable to positive comp store sales in North America, Europe and Japan as consumers respond favorably to our luxury product offering. Our U.S. digital flagship sales contributed 350 [ph] basis points to our overall comp performance in the quarter on a constant-currency basis. In our Wholesale segment, net sales grew 0.3%. On a constant-currency basis, wholesale sales increased 3.0% driven primarily by our footwear category and strong growth in international markets. In our Licensing segment, revenue increased 8.4% driven primarily by higher licensing revenues related to sales of jewelry and eyewear as well as higher international licensing revenue. We opened 52 new watch and jewelry shop-in-shops during the quarter and ended the quarter with 362 shop-in-shops globally. 
Gross margin declined 140 basis points to 59.5%, which includes a 95 basis point foreign currency translation and transaction impact. The decline in gross margin reflects a 310 basis point decline in retail gross margins primarily due to additional markdowns, a 50 basis point decline in wholesale gross margins primarily due to additional wholesale allowances partially offset by higher licensing gross margin dollars. Total operating expenses grew 10.7%. The increase in SG&A was due to higher retail occupancy and salary costs related to new store openings and included higher e-commerce expenses and an increase in corporate-related expenses. The increase in depreciation expense was primarily due to the opening of retail stores, new shop-in-shops and the increase in lease rights related to our new European stores and investments in our corporate facilities and IT infrastructure. 
As a percent of total revenue, total operating expenses increased 120 basis points to 30.2%. This was below the 200 to 240 basis points of deleverage in our guidance primarily due to better-than-expected sales in the quarter. 
Income from operations was $409.3 million or 29.3% of total revenues as compared to 31.8% of total revenue in the same period last year. 
Retail opening -- operating margin declined 340 basis points due to the decline of retail gross margins as discussed earlier, and a 30 basis point increase in operating expenses attributed to higher store-related costs and depreciation expense largely offset by lower distribution and general expenses. 
Wholesale operating margin declined 180 basis points due to the decline in wholesale gross margin, as discussed earlier, and a 130 basis point increase in operating expenses attributed to increased distribution cost, selling cost and depreciation expense partially offset by lower general expenses. 
Licensing margin increased 60 basis points due to lower operating expenses, including advertising costs, partially offset by higher cost associated with intellectual property protection as we take action against counterfeit activity globally. 
Income taxes were $114.4 million in the quarter. And our effective tax rate was 28.0% as compared to 27.2% in the same period last year. The increase on our effective tax rate was primarily due to the absence of the prior year favorable settlement of certain instruments in connection with our international structuring, partly offset by the increase in taxable income in certain non-U.S. subsidiaries, which are subject to lower tax rates. 
Net income was $294.6 million for the third quarter, and diluted earnings per share were $1.59. The unfavorable currency impact on EPS was $0.06 per share. 
Turning to the balance sheet. At the end of the quarter, cash and cash equivalents was $696.8 million. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 4.7 million shares totaling $200 million under our share repurchase program, and we have another $558.1 million of availability remaining. There are no outstanding borrowings under our credit facility at the end of the quarter in either year. Inventory increased 9.5% versus last year slightly ahead of revenue growth and in line with our expectation. As discussed in our last call, the change in foreign exchange rates continue to impact our European inventory, and we are now recording incremental inventory related to the consolidation of MK Panama. We expect our growth and inventory to continue to outpace our growth in sales as we open new retail stores and shop-in-shops, expand our digital flagships and further develop our men's business. We also expect that the exchange rate differential and the MK Panama consolidation in addition to the transition of the Korean business in-house, we continue to impact inventory levels until we anniversary these events. 
Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $96.8 million and were related to the build-out of new retail stores and shop-in-shops as well as investments in our distribution facility, our corporate offices and other infrastructure improvements. We added 34 new stores in the third quarter, 15 in the Americas, 16 in Europe and 3 in Japan. In addition, we expanded or relocated 8 stores and converted 79 wholesale doors into shop-in-shops globally. 
Turning to our outlook. For the fourth quarter, we expect total revenue to be between $1.13 billion and $1.15 billion, which includes approximately $36 million of additional sales due to our 53rd week. On a constant-currency basis, total revenue is expected to increase in the high single digit range assuming an impact of approximately $20 million from the change in foreign currency rates. We expect comp store sales to be flat on a reported basis and to increase in the low single digits in constant currency driven by growth of our U.S. digital sales, the introduction of new innovative product offerings for spring 2016 and diminishing FX headwinds. However, we anticipate lower revenues in our licensing business during the quarter due to lower watch sales and a decrease in revenue related to eyewear as we anniversary our launch with Luxottica and the final quarter of shipments from Marsean [ph] last year. We expect international gross margin to remain under pressure in the fourth quarter as favorable hedging contracts we entered into last year expire. Operating expenses as a percentage of total revenue is expected to increase 190 basis points to 220 basis points. We expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.93 to $0.97 assuming a tax rate of approximately 27.5% and 182.5 million shares outstanding. We expect foreign currency to impact net income by approximately $3 million and EPS by approximately $0.02 for the fourth quarter. For the full fiscal year, our outlook for revenue and EPS remains unchanged. We expect revenue of approximately $4.65 billion on a reported basis. On a constant-currency basis, total revenue is expected to increase in the low double-digit range assuming an impact of approximately $180 million from the change in foreign currency rates. We expect a mid-single digit comp store decrease on a reported basis and a low single digit decrease in constant currency. 
Operating expense as a percentage of total revenue is expected to increase by approximately 230 basis points for the year. We expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $4.38 to $4.42 for the year assuming a tax rate of approximately 28.5% and 190 million shares outstanding. We expect foreign currency to impact net income by approximately $38 million and EPS by approximately $0.20 for the year. 
I will now turn the call back to John for closing remarks."

And those were driven by, first, traffic; and second, conversion. Again, what we see happening is customers are starting their shopping experience, as you all know, digitally, mobily first, and so the mobile traffic that we're getting to the site just keeps accelerating every single month. And we think we've got some real opportunities to even take that to another level. So we're extremely pleased with the traffic that we saw there. And we're also just pleased with the fact that certain categories, and I might add, footwear, in particular, is seeing a huge lift on e-commerce. Again, we're able to represent a much greater assortment of products that we are actually in many of our own stores, which has been a really interesting finding for us and is leading us to look at our stores today currently. And we're going to be expanding the footwear areas inside of our own stores to capitalize on what the consumer is really telling us given what she's seeing online. So again, we like what's happening there, and we think that's just going to continue to grow. And again sequentially, that will not grow as fast as you've seen over the past year or so, but the sheer dollar number is quite impressive. I might also add that even with the lift in e-commerce, we actually saw a sequential improvement in comp stores in just the stores themselves in sales. And again, that was driven, as I said earlier, by conversion. The conversion rates are getting very, very high inside the stores. And I want to give a very big New York shout out to our thousands of sales associates all over the world who I think did an amazing job. We had a great holiday season, first and foremost, because of Michael's design team and the product that they put together, but we've got thousands and thousands of people who have jet-set training and continued even with declining traffic in shopping mall to really deliver for us and for the consumers that they serve. So real kudos to them. In terms of Europe, we were generally pleased with the quarter. I have to be honest with you. There was a couple of areas of softness as you can be well aware, and France was a very difficult market for us after the events that happened there. And again, the whole -- it wasn't just Paris that was affected, remember, we're very strong brand across many of the areas, and people we're really not in the mood to shop. We are affected in Belgium, Belgium as well. And then the other place that we felt some softness is in the UK. And we've been feeling that. We've been talking about that really since last year, and that's been the euro-dollar exchange, and also the Russian is not coming there as much as they did and some of the Middle Easterners as well. So that market has been a little been more challenged for us. That all being said, we're seeing an actual acceleration in the business as we kick off the fourth quarter, which we're very excited about. and we think that some of the new product reads, we told you that in the last quarter, as we saw some of the new products hitting the stores, the reaction was quite strong. And again, the other thing that we're seeing happen in Europe, like we saw in America 3 years ago, some of the e-commerce penetrations with our partners, whether that Harris or word or other accounts in marketplaces, really accelerating very quickly. And so we're very pleased with what's happening in the European market and continue to watch the growth there."

I know you touched on it in response to Kimberly's questions in the prepared remarks. But is it a new phenomenon, this kind of accelerating conversion? And do you feel like it's firmly tied to the development of the digital platform, inter-training or the other factors driving this? Because you've got exposure to these channel that a lot of other companies or resources are struggling, tourist markets, mall channels, outlets, et cetera. Maybe we can dive in a little bit deeper and understand what's driving that conversion and how much more opportunity there is to use conversion to drive the comps?"
143971118,322486247,924454,"Michael Kors Holdings Limited, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Feb 02, 2016",2016-02-02,"Earnings Calls","Capri Holdings Limited","Executives","Omar, we believe that, and I'm going to focus this on North America for the moment, we believe that mall traffic in North America is going to continue to decline. And the reason for that is again, we think that people in North America are a bit more savvy",567,"Omar, we believe that, and I'm going to focus this on North America for the moment, we believe that mall traffic in North America is going to continue to decline. And the reason for that is again, we think that people in North America are a bit more savvy when it comes to digital shopping. And just been more cultural here for a longer period of time, and you have big companies who were quite strong at it. And we've seen that both in our own stores, and you can see that through our wholesale partners as well, where digital is just becoming a bigger piece of the business. We haven't seen that yet been in Asia where mall traffic continues to be still pretty good. And Europe, I'd say, mall traffic is kind of average. We haven't seen the deceleration that we saw in the United States. In the United States, we attribute it primarily to digital shopping for people. The reason why the conversion is climbing, I think, is twofold. Number one, just as a percent of total, obviously, if your traffic is down and your sales are trending up, you're going to -- it's going to come usually through conversion, not necessarily through ticket climbing so high. But the second thing is we really worked hard with our teams inside the stores. We told you in our prepared remarks that the smaller bags in the AURs, that's the reality of fashion. We were one of the first people who jumped on that. And we believe that the global market for luxury handbags is approximately flat. But in unit sales, we're up in the very strong double digits. So what does that tell you? That tells you that there are more customers actually buying Michael Kors products than what you look at in the comp store sales. You're comparing comp store sales in dollars, which is, obviously, how we all earn EPS. But in actual units, there's a lot more people buying Michael Kors products and probably some of the competitors than you're actually seeing. So the category in dollars is roughly flat, but actually in units, it's quite strong. So how do you go after that? Well, we believe that when somebody is coming in and interested in the crossbodies, they need a new wallet because the wallet size is smaller in the crossbody versus a mid-sized handbag where it might be or things like that. So the market is changing very, very rapidly as the consumers fashion taste is changing, and we see our opportunity really being in up-sell with the customer, or in trying to take advantage of trend. That's the second thing, I think, we've done a very good job on. Again, whether it's backpacks or crossbodies, saddlebags, we also did a great job with our active footwear. I mean, it's no secret some of big athletic companies are doing very, very well. And we've been on that trend for the last 2 years. And that category is growing significantly for us. So I think what our customers responding to is we've got the right fashion for them at the right time. We've got really well-trained associates, and these associates, quite frankly, know how to up-sell in terms of multiple items to get that transaction value up, which is helping in our total conversion rates inside a store. Does that help?"

First off, we love our partners, whether it's Macy's or Dillard's or Lord & Taylor's or Bloomingdale's or Saks or [indiscernible] or Harry's or Selfridge's or [indiscernible]. The wholesale channel is phenomenal. Department stores are phenomenal. They carry amazing brands inside these channels and I think that the theory that this channel is a channel that's going away is not a very well-thought-out theory. That channel is like every channel in retail today, is being challenged because the consumer is shopping differently. And as they shop differently, quite frankly, they're smarter. They have the ability to see things online, a lot more assortment, a lot more selection. They can compare side-by-side. They can compare pricing online. So what we just believe is that, that channel is going to figure out how to manage its growth over the next 12 to 24 months, as many of us saw. And we think it's better to have less inventory in there, to have less promotions, which will keep the brand integrity at a higher level. And our partners are very supportive of this. We also want to turn our inventories faster for them and for us. And we think the better we look to our end consumer and not confusing them with different promotional activities at different levels, the better it is for the brand long term. So as I said in our prepared remarks, we believe that channel is going to be down on a go-forward basis for us. And WL make that up more so in our retail stores, our e-commerce, our expansions in certain marketplaces, and then ultimately long term, as we've in the past, we are looking at the certain other licenses that be may or may not bring in-house. Our men's business growth. So we have plenty of opportunity for us to grow. It doesn't all have to be pushed. And that's what we are afraid of, we don't want to push too hard because we think that could damage the brand long term."

And I think I said in the last quarterly call that we are hoping, believe, think, wish, whatever you want to say, that we start to lap this in June, July, August of next year. We saw the small bag trend happening, it really started happening 2 years ago. We think we're a bit more up against that. There will be less of a headwind for us. There's no guarantees on that. Again it's just going to depend on the trends that are happening. You even see in money pieces now are getting smaller because again people are -- as more things end up on your phone, you need less things in your wallet. So that's just a fact. So actually a much smaller money pieces are accelerating even faster than our larger money pieces. So we are seeing that across-the-board. In terms of promotional activity. Look, there's no question at our third quarter or the retailer fourth quarter had more promotional activity inside of it. I wouldn't say there was more events, I would just say there was a lot more markdowns related to clearing inventories as everyone wanted to be cleaned to start to the year. We had terribly unseasonably warm weather, which really affected everyone in the business. And not just things like boots and coats, which everybody talks about, but when people are going to do stores because it's 60 degrees outside on the day before Christmas, it just got a psychological payload that we really think affected the business in North America. So I think people got healthy with inventories, and I think that was a very good thing for us to start out the spring season."

I would say that as in the prepared remarks, we really saw something very interesting. We saw -- when we put newness on the table, the customer responded very, very positively. So you're going to see something from us this spring. We have one of the largest new assortments of watches coming in our history, and that's going to be led by slim watches. We think there's a very, very big fashion trend towards slim. So Michael Kors will be pushing that in a very significant way. And we think that's one of the key issues. We probably we didn't have enough newness out there, I told you that in previous calls. We think we've addressed that this spring season. And secondly, clearly, consumers are just wearing less watches because of what a smartphone will do for you, and the fact that people are glued to their phone and they use of that for more of a timepiece. I think, and I believe, thinks as well, that the smartwatch technology is actually going to revolutionize the fashion watch business. I think over the next 5 to 10 years, most fashion watches will be sold with some type of smartwatch technology. So we're super excited. We'll be announcing our whole program at [indiscernible] in March, with a launch in-store in August. And watch out.

The AURs are going to move up a little bit in products because as we add materialization and as we add embellishment and as we do different things to the product to enhance it, we actually want to move the AUR up a little bit. Michael and I were talking last night, so funny. When a customer sees amazing design and understands that, that is something that's different, we don't have any problem with selling the pricing of it. And I think as an industry, we probably got a little too focused on the $300 handbags price points. So again, it's not that we're jumping into saying that our business is now going to be $700, which, by the way, we have that category today in our stores because we have our Michael Kors Collection bags in the stores. But we think that the customers looking, just like we said in watches, they are looking for something that's more exciting, that's why we've invited you all to come up to showrooms in the next couple of weeks, to see the product. Because Oliver, if I may say, when I read a lot of the reports, everyone said that Michael Kors is ubiquitous. Michael Kors is overdistributed. Michael Kors is this, that, the other thing. And the truth is that we keep growing, and the customer keeps responding, and the customer is voting not only yes in dollars, but she's voting yes in units. So what we're going to stay committed to is great design. There is going to be some elevation in the AUR. In terms of additional space in the store, no. What we're probably going to do is take a little less of our basics and probably wind those -- pull those back a little bit in increased fashion a little bit more, which, again, customer's saying yes. She wants something, new not only from us, it's from our competitors as well, I'm talking from the luxury European competitors are seeing the exact same thing. So it's right for trend, it's right for the business, and it's right for inspiring our customers."

As you can see, when you really look at our income statement, the revenues continue to grow inside the company. We're making sequential improvement in comp store sales. So hopefully, a bit of the naysayers who say that our brand is ubiquitous, overdistributed, et cetera, some of that hopefully will -- you'll get comfortable with the fact that Michael Kors brand is still very strong, growing and developing, both in North America and globally. That being said, our expense, our SG&A is actually rising slightly quicker than our sales, which is something that we're working on. And that's being driven by a number of different projects, as you know, that we were investing in. And also we have anticipated a much higher top line, in particular, because of the FX exchange. So in terms of -- we're about halfway through the development of our VenLo project, which is a very, very expensive endeavor for us, 1 million square-foot facility in The Netherlands to support our $1 billion-plus business in Europe. And the fact that we're going to be launching ultimately in 22 countries are online. We want to have really the best-in-class facility to be able to handle that and not have to keep upsizing the way that we did in Los Angeles, which was a bit painful for us. So that project will be finished somewhere around August, September, October. And we really won't get leverage from that in the first year. Actually, we will -- that will go against us as we learn to operate the facility, et cetera. But again, as we've told you, we're a luxury business investing for the future. So we're not -- if we don't make these investments, WR not going to have a company that's going to be sustainable long-term. So that's the first big investment. Secondly, as we bring e-commerce around the world, and quite frankly, move sales from brick-and-mortar to e-commerce, we have the expense to bring up e-commerce, all the systemic issues for hiring staff well in advance of having an revenues, so all these are going us negative headwinds. And then unfortunately, today, e-commerce generates a lower opening profit for us than four-wall brick-and-mortar. We think over time that will reverse itself. But, as you know, when the consumer requires free delivery, free return, wonderful packaging plus there's a new trend that people are buying multiple sizes of things, to try them on the home and then return them, that all is a negative headwind for us. So I would say that we're again, about halfway through our investment in -- to be able to have our entire network built out in terms of global e-commerce. And then we're here finishing out our corporate headquarters, which, again you'll see in a couple of weeks, which was a very significant project for us. We said that we wanted to look, feel and act like a digital company. I think you're going to be very impressed when you see what we've done here. It's great for recruiting the best in the industry, it's great for employee retention. And I think we did it in a way that was very reasonable given where we are in our building and how we were able to execute that. So those are the 3 big projects. We've got some minor things that are headwinds for us. We bought Korea in-house, that's going to be negative for the first couple of years. We've got our joint venture in South America that, unfortunately, will be a negative for us as we deal with some of the headwinds down there. And men's will be negative for us in the next couple of years. Again, if we don't make these investment, we're not going to build a long-term company and have it sustainable. So we believe that going forward, SG&A still will slightly outpace sales, and we hope to get that probably turned around in our fiscal '18, but it will not be an fiscal '17 at this point. So hopefully that gives you some color on that question."

However, when you think about CapEx, our $400 million CapEx for the current fiscal year is a peak CapEx, and we will be thinking in terms of decreasing that CapEx spend definitely going forward. In terms of the hedges. I can't give you any definitive answer to that. Our hedges are typically 9 months to a year out. They are -- they relate to operations that we operate in non-U.S. currencies we're our purchasing inventory in U.S. dollars. And we talked about that in prior quarters. As those hedges roll off, we, of course, are entering new hedges, but there will be more at the spot rate when they roll off. And so that's just contributing to the -- that will increase inventory cost, and therefore, have a headwind in terms of gross margin."

So Don is somebody who walks in the door, hits the ground running, doesn't miss a bit, has great leadership and merchant qualities. And so as far as we're concerned, really nothing has changed at all. And, as you know, we are really excited about Marcell Ostwald joining the company, and I can't tell you how thrilled you're going to be to see the men's product when you walk in the door, and I'm very excited for when you all come to visit because for the first time, normally, it's always the female analyst oohing and aahing, this time, we're going to have hopefully have a few men oohing and aahing at our walk through. So we feel -- the men's business, we've said before, is $1 billion opportunity for the company. And we've said -- about 1/3 of that rough will come from men's sportswear, about 1/3 of that will come from Men's Leather, and about 1/3 of that will come from watches, maybe a little less from watches. But we kind of broke that down in that area. The watches, we obviously, won't report the revenue inside of our company, but we'll report the royalties of that [indiscernible]. We are well on track with all of our North American partners in constructing shops. So we'll be in all the best stores again, whether that's Saks, Bloomingdale's, Macy's, Dillard's, Lord & Taylor, they're either up or under construction or are going forward. I have to say that some of the new products has just hit retail in the last week. Marcel was just barely able to touch some of that and the sell-through has been terrific. And we are really going to see the big impact this come fall season. We're also in the 150-plus stores today already in Europe. So the distribution is there. We have beautiful shops in Harrods, in Selfridge's and at [indiscernible], and in [indiscernible], et cetera. And the European community is really supportive of that. I just came back from Asia 2 weeks ago, we have some very significant plants about rolling that business out. Again, that will be a department-store-driven business, but we shop-in-shops that will actually -- we'll count those as stores. Remember, we count concessions in our store counts. So when I give you that 500 store count globally, that includes concessions as well inside that number. So internally, inside the company, we're really excited about it, big opportunity. And there really hasn't been a major new men's wear business launched in 20 years in terms of significant across all categories that I think our wholesale partners can get behind in a big way. So we're excited to be a part of that. And then we have the freestanding store opportunities/stores that will be connected to our existing stores. And we think that's going to be big opportunities. 1 last call, I will tell you that in our stores over the holiday season what really surprised us is leather accounted for close to 40% of sales inside the store that opened. And again, they were only open for a couple of months and it was during the holiday season, but we were really shocked by the strength of our business in leather. It really bodes well for the development of that category."

So unfortunately, we've seen the watch category decline, we're seeing the jewelry category increase. One of the things that we're going to do in our own stores for the spring of 2017, and you've heard me talk about this kind of last year more that while we love introducing the jewelry category, unfortunately that drove the AUR of the total jewelry and watch category down for us because we were selling $150 bracelet or an $85 pair of earrings versus a $225 watch. So that really hurt us. And again, I think sometimes, when people are looking at the business, they don't -- they think it's all handbags that's driving the comp up and down, but it word that's not really actually the issue. So we kind of hurt ourselves a little bit with that. So what we're going to do is we will exit most of the fashion jewelry line in the spring of '17 from our own stores, and we will introduce a more fine jewelry line inside of our own stores, really bringing it closer to the watch AUR, not completely, but it will be -- it will have gold, we'll have silver, we'll have plated materials as well, 18-karat plated, et cetera, and we're going to really elevate that whole category inside of our store, and there'll be select retail partners that we will allow also to carry that. It's going to be very limited distribution, and we think it's a big opportunity for us to trade up the AURs in the stores. Going back to the original question that Kimberly and Omar, we were talking about is, as traffic decline in these stores, we all have to be focused on conversion. And we're not going to raise our AURs by 25% and 30% and 40%. But if you can get your AUR up 5% or 10%, that's going to make a big difference, and we're going to be doing that not only in our own stores, but looking at the department store channel as well on the specialty store channel and really take advantage of that. The second question you ask, we don't break out the percentage of -- for advertising. The only thing I can tell you is that we will continue to support that part of our business. As you know, we have, first off, the greatest voice in the fashion industry with Michael himself. We have the greatest PR, marketing and digital team, we think, in the industry, and I said in the prepared remark, every single channel, social channel, we increased whether it fans, followers, et cetera, and that really speaks volumes to what's happening with our advertising and marketing and the way that our teams are handing that. And again, we're going to be very proactive not only on existing channels but as we've done in the past, we've been really a leader in looking at we channels as they emerge and how we can have a voice in there."

We don't give guidance on that yet. We'll do that in June. But we have, between our licensed partners and ourselves, we have about [ph] 860 stores worldwide. And out of that 860 stores, in the Americas, we have about 400 stores. That includes Canada",491,"Sure. We don't give guidance on that yet. We'll do that in June. But we have, between our licensed partners and ourselves, we have about [ph] 860 stores worldwide. And out of that 860 stores, in the Americas, we have about 400 stores. That includes Canada, Latin America, United States, et cetera. So we're kind of getting built and finished with our store rollout. In North America, in particular, it's going to be very few stores. We told you many years ago, and I know many people have not love the fact that I've held very steadfast, we told you we were going to build 400 stores in North America. And many of you have asked me over and over again, why are doing you that? We said we're going to keep building 400 stores in North America. And we will finish that build out. The Americas got a little bit larger as a number because it now includes Latin America. So maybe it will be 425 or 430 or something like that. Whatever it is, we're pretty much done with our build out in this region of the world. Europe will continue to accelerate. In that marketplace, we have 171 of our own stores, and then we have a number with -- in Russia, et cetera. And again, we believe that, that marketplace will have in excess of 200 [indiscernible] stores, we've said that in the past. And then Asia is a place where we think we have a lot of opportunity. So all in all, we've said it about 1,000 stores is where we think we'll be as a company, and that includes our license partners. So we have 150 or so to go. That does not include men's. We've said that men's will be something that will be a plus for us. So again, the last thing I just want to say is, again, I believe the -- we make a lot of money in For Hall in the stores. We also believe that, while e-commerce one day will end up being 20% or 30% of our business, it's not going to be 100%. So stores are not going away. They're not dying, and we need stores to service communities and people. And also, I think, as you become omni, you really have a distinct advantage of having stores. So I'll give you a good example. Our return rates on e-commerce are running very low. But a number of those returns are coming back to stores. And it actually gives us an opportunity to interact with a customer, and we have seen evidence where we're actually not only taking the return, but trading the customer up and creating even a better experience with the customer. So again, we embraced omni, we embraced our retail flagships and our retail fleet that we have today. And we will finish that build out and get ourselves to the approximately 1,000 stores."

I think that's a little bit off the table. We've got a handful stores that we did expand already. I don't have the exact number in front of me but it's probably in the 30-plus or 40-plus range. Those we're pleased with what happened with those stores. What we need to see is we're going to reconfigure a number of existing stores, as I mentioned earlier, to increase the footwear space inside those stores. We're really happy with what's happening with footwear. And we think it's another reason for the customer to come in and shop with us, et cetera. So we've got to see how that plays out. I want to remind everyone that as we increase our women's ready-to-wear and our women's footwear business both in wholesale and in retail, that has an impact on our margin for 2 reasons: Number one, we have lower margins going in; and number two, their size businesses. And when you have size businesses, you have markdowns that are greater than what you run. Your handbags aren't really sized and watches aren't really sized. So it will help us draw the top line. And ultimately, we think, it will help us grow the consumer experience. But as Joe indicated before, gross margins are kind of be flattish in the zone of where they are today looking out going forward, impacted a little bit by what's going to happen with shoes and bags and even men's wear has lower gross margins as well."

But as we've said in the past, we're a company that has an amazing operating model. We have -- I think, the second or third highest operating margins in the world in luxury compared to the European luxury operators, et cetera, we're going to end this year somewhere around 25% operating margins, which really is extraordinary. And we generate a lot of cash, and we've been very aggressive about buying back stock because we feel that the market, if I may say that, has misunderstood our story and our potential and our long-term vision and our success quite frankly. So we are going to continue to be very aggressive given what we think is a dislocation of where our multiple is versus the rest of the industry. And I might remind everyone that we will end the year with the top line growth and bottom line growth, which is very unusual for many, many players in luxury industry. Pardon me if I -- the for Michael Kors for a minute. The line of credits is there for a number of different reasons. First, it's there, again, if we continue to see dislocations, we may or may not decide to even get more aggressive with our buyback purchases. As Joe said before, we have $580 million left on our authorization, but our board feels very strongly in making sure that we continue to return value to shareholders. Secondly, the line is there to look at potential licenses. We have a number of them that could be brought back in-house. And again, when we think that those are in a strategic place for us or are going to be accretive for us, we will act upon that. As you said before, we're very pleased with what's happening in China for us. And even though Hong Kong and Macau remain difficult, we had double-digit comp store increase even with Hong Kong and Macau being difficult. What does that tell you about the brand? That's the brand is strong, you are very excited about what's happening with our product in that marketplace. So we'll like that then as we said in the prepared comments, she's shopping around the world with us the Mainland China marketplace, as you know. Well over 50% luxury goods purchased outside of the mainland. Then the third purpose for the line is we said it in our last call is when and if strategic acquisition is something we htink fits with our company's short term and/or long term objectives, we may very will act. So we have an incredible balance sheet. We have an incredible cash flow generation, and we have the ammunition to do a lot of different things to continue to generate revenue and earnings per share growth for the long term.

And we saw this really pleased with our full price stores. She came in, she shop, she shop for gifts that earlier that we saw sequential improvement fiction like and she had a lot of choices out there in the marketplace and up only a lot of prices. So we were particularly pleased with that. And again, we spend so much time talking about North America, North America. We're doing 30% of our business know approximately internationally. We really like what we saw happening in Europe. And Asia is continuing to just build momentum. So as you think of this company long-term, and this will be my concluding remarks, we always knew that North America would be a marketplace that ultimately would reach a point where we have lower growth. That's where we are today. We're still growing in the marketplace. And we're still taking market share, which, again, I hope you recognize given our results. So we think that really resonates for the brand well. Europe, still good opportunity for us to develop stores. Wholesale shop-in-shops there, and many marketplaces where we're still underpenetrated. Asia is wide open for us. We still are super underpenetrated. In Korea, Japan, China and in certain places in Southeast Asia. So when you think about Michael Kors, think about growth. It's not going to be double-digit growth, those days are behind us. But we're going to have solid growth going forward, in the leisure industry today, I think there's not a lot of companies that can stand up and say that and keep delivering on that quarter of quarter.

Good morning, and welcome to Michael Kors' third quarter fiscal 2016 earnings call. I'm pleased to report that our revenues, comparable store sales and earnings per share results for the third quarter exceeded our expectation, which",1754,"Thank you, Krystyna. Good morning, and welcome to Michael Kors' third quarter fiscal 2016 earnings call. 
I'm pleased to report that our revenues, comparable store sales and earnings per share results for the third quarter exceeded our expectation, which speaks to the enduring strength of the Michael Kors luxury brand, in particular, during the all-important holiday season. We know that consumers have a lot of choices when it comes to what brands they purchase. And the fact that they chose Michael Kors is a great testament to our world-class design team, strong product offering and the lasting connection that we have fostered with our customers. 
For the quarter, total revenue increased 6% on a reported basis. In constant currency, total revenue increased 10% driven by growth across segments and geographies. Earnings per share increased 7% to $1.59 on a reported basis, and on a constant-currency basis, earnings per share grew 11%. 
Our Retail business delivered solid results across all geographies driven by strong double-digit sales growth in our digital flagship business and new store openings. On a constant-currency basis, global comparable store sales increased 2%, which was ahead of our expectations and marked another quarter of sequential improvement. Importantly, while mall traffic in North America declined, we saw a significant increase in conversion rates in our own retail stores, which further illustrates the strength of the Michael Kors brand. On a constant-currency basis, comp store sales rose in the low single digits in North America and Europe, and in the high double digits in Japan. While our wholesale business was roughly flat for the quarter on a reported basis, we delivered results above our expectations despite the challenging and highly promotional retail environment. In fact, while the North American department store channel was challenged, we believe our results continue to outpace the overall channel performance, which enabled us to further strengthen our leadership position in this channel. Internationally, European wholesale sales grew 4% on a reported basis and almost 20% on a constant-currency basis, and we saw 26% growth in our Asian wholesale business. 
We also achieved solid growth in our licensing business. While the overall watch category remains challenged during the third quarter, we were excited to see favorable response to the newness that we introduced into our watch offering as well as our jewelry assortment. In watches, navy, sable and black plating's as well as colored leather straps proved to be sought-after additions in our collection. Customers also responded well to our updated jewelry offering, with particular strength in the padlock, parts and disc motifs. And our watch and bracelet gift sets were strong sellers during the season. Our fragrance collections for women as well as men's fragrance also proved to be great gifts with our customers who are shopping for family and friends or looking to treat themselves to something special. We were also pleased to see strong growth of our fragrance offering in the travel retail channel worldwide. In addition, we continue to see very positive response to our eyewear collections and are happy that our new partnership in this category has been such a strong success. 
Turning to our product categories. We were pleased with the performance of our accessories business, where we injected new styles that contributed to strong growth and market share gains in the quarter. Total accessory sales on a retail basis grew at a high single digit rate globally and a mid-single digit rate in North America, demonstrating our leadership in this category, especially against a difficult retail backdrop. The demand for smaller-sized bags, crossbodies and small leather goods continued to impact AUR in the quarter. However, we again saw a high double-digit increase in units sold, proving that customers continue to seek out Michael Kors luxury accessories. Footwear sales were also strong during the quarter driven by our fashion active category. Unfortunately, the unseasonably warm weather hurt boot sales, which negatively impacted our footwear margins and AUR. Overall, our new merchandise assortment for holiday reflected the latest designs from Michael and our design team and spotlighted modern glamor, easy elegance and sports lux essentials. The updated silhouettes as well as our gifting assortment resonated well with customers globally and our #JustBecause marketing campaign proved very successful in connecting our customers with just the right gift for everyone on their shopping list. 
Looking ahead, we remain focused on executing our key strategic initiatives that will drive us towards our long-term growth targets. First and foremost, we remain committed to delivering luxury products that embodies fashion, design innovation and the Michael Kors luxury brand DNA. 
As we look to the spring season, we will be introducing our largest assortment of new handbag groups created to inspire our customers with exciting new trends. Our collections will underscore Michael's fashion leadership with an offering that reflects new color pallets, innovative materials, embellishment, mixed-media in leather, luxurious textures and elegant silhouettes across product categories. In footwear, the fashion active category remains one of our highest growing areas, and we expect to leverage this trend in the spring. We are also capturing the denim trend in our accessories and apparel assortments, which are featured in our new national advertising ad campaigns. We have begun to evolve our advertising campaigns to reflect the glamorous destinations and inspirational moments of the modern Michael Kors customer. Our integrated marketing programs with compelling digital and social media campaigns delivered through desktop and mobile devices as well as traditional prints, billboard and target marketing are designed to extend our reach, allowing us to engage consumers with our brand, immerse them in the Michael Kors Lifestyle and encourage them to shop our sites and stores. 
In our retail business, we continue to develop our digital flagship strategy globally, at a rapid pace and build upon our omnichannel capabilities. We have digital platforms in place, in the U.S. and Canada, and we are on track to launch in 6 European countries this fall and an additional 16 countries in Europe thereafter. 
Importantly, we are working to seamlessly integrate the consumer shopping experience across all touch points. We are taking steps to enhance our mobile shopping experience and expect to see the benefits of these measures over the coming months. We will also begin to leverage our analytics and CRM capabilities to share Michael's message with consumers through various communication vehicles and to present and tailor our styling to the individual customer. Overall, our digital flagship strategy is enabling us to engage consumers with our luxury lifestyle brand and provide a best-in-class shopping experience. As you know, we have a strong and influential online presence as consumers turn to Michael Kors for fashion insights, and we continue to see our fan base grow across all social media platforms, further demonstrating the power of our brand. In addition, we remain focused on expanding our global retail footprint, and we will continue to open flagship locations in key cities around the world to drive revenues and brand recognition. Our latest flagship opened this past November in the Ginza district in Tokyo, and we will be opening new flagships in London, Seoul and Singapore this coming year. These locations not only enable us to present the most expansive collection of our fashion product, including both our collection and lifestyle offerings as well as men's products in select locations, but also showcase the Michael Kors luxury DNA for consumers worldwide. Internationally, we completed the integration of our Korean business in January and are excited about the retail growth potential in this market. Lastly, we continue to extend our men's presence at retail, both with standalone stores as well as through the addition of our men's offering in our existing lifestyle stores in North America, Europe and Asia. We opened 4 men's location this quarter in Scottsdale Fashion Square in Arizona, Memorial City in Houston, Garden State Plaza in New Jersey and San Francisco Center in California. And we are pleased with the initial consumer response. By the end of this fiscal year, we expect our full men's assortment to be available on 11 locations, and we continue to believe there's a potential for up to 500 locations worldwide. 
In our wholesale channel, we expect moderately lower sales growth. As we have stated previously, we will be managing our North American wholesale inventory to ensure that we maintain the integrity of our brand. We see continued sales growth internationally from the expansion of our accessories, womenswear and footwear business and the development of our men's category. We remain particularly excited about the expansion of our men's business in wholesale, and are on track to open 75 men's shop-in-shops globally this year. 
Importantly, we continue to believe that this is a significant new category for the company, and I am confident that we can develop this business and become a leading men's luxury brand. 
In licensing, we are excited about the continued growth opportunity of our fragrance and eyewear categories and the newness in the watch category as we continue to introduce updated watch styles and launch our new connected fashion line later this year. As we look at consumer trends, we believe that connected accessories will reshape the fashion watch business globally. Michael Kors is known for being at the forefront of the fashion watch category, and we expect to quickly emerge as a leader in connected fashion as well. 
Turning to our regional licenses. We remain focused on expanding our presence across Asia, which represents a significant growth opportunity for our company. In Greater China, we continue to see an increase in brand acceptance, as evidenced by another quarter of double-digit comp store sales growth. As the Chinese consumer's desire for our brand builds, we are capturing this demand, both in the region and as they travel globally through our airport locations worldwide and in areas such as Japan, Korea and Europe. We look forward to our continued global expansion through our strong regional partnerships and growing demand for our luxury brands. 
In summary, we are pleased with the success we achieved in the third quarter, with an excellent holiday season driven by a luxury fashion product assortment, strength of our digital flagships and sequential improvement in our comparable store sales as well as continued success of our wholesale business. Our results demonstrate the sustained demand for our luxury fashion products globally and the market leadership of the Michael Kors brand. 
Now let me turn it over to Joe for a detailed review of our third quarter financial results and our outlook."

We are pleased to report financial results above our guidance for the third quarter. Total revenue grew 6.3% to $1.4 billion. On a constant-currency basis, total revenue grew 9.9% driven by increases across the Americas, Europe and Japan of 1.4%, 29.1% and 68% respectively. In our retail segment, net sales increased 11.1%. In constant currency, retail net sales increased 15.7% driven by the opening of 114 net new stores since the third quarter of last year and strong performance of our digital flagships. We saw a marginal decline in comps of 0.9% on a reported basis. On a constant-currency basis, comp store sales increased 2.0% reflecting a sequential improvement from the second quarter of our total comp as well as our retail store comp and outperformance versus our guidance. The increase is attributable to positive comp store sales in North America, Europe and Japan as consumers respond favorably to our luxury product offering. Our U.S. digital flagship sales contributed 360 basis points to our overall comp performance in the quarter on a constant-currency basis. In our wholesale segment, net sales grew 0.3%. On a constant-currency basis, wholesale sales increased 3.0% driven primarily by our footwear category and strong growth in international markets. In our licensing segment, revenue increased 8.4% driven primarily by higher licensing revenues related to sales of jewelry and eyewear as well as higher international licensing revenue. We opened 52 new watch and jewelry shop-in-shops during the quarter and ended the quarter with 362 shop-in-shops globally. 
Gross margin declined 140 basis points to 59.5%, which includes a 95 basis point foreign currency translation and transaction impact. The decline in gross margin reflects a 310 basis point decline in retail gross margins, primarily due to additional markdowns. A 50 basis point decline in wholesale gross margins, primarily due to additional wholesale allowances partially offset by higher licensing gross margin dollars. Total operating expenses grew 10.7%. The increase in SG&A was due to higher retail occupancy and salary costs related to new store openings and included higher e-commerce expenses and an increase in corporate-related expenses. The increase in depreciation expense was primarily due to the opening of retail stores, new shop-in-shops and increase in lease rights related to our new European stores and investments in our corporate facilities and IT infrastructure. 
As a percent of total revenue, total operating expenses increased 120 basis points to 30.2%. This was below the 200 to 240 basis points of deleverage in our guidance, primarily due to better-than-expected sales in the quarter. 
Income from operations was $409.3 million or 29.3% of total revenue as compared to 31.8% of total revenue in the same period last year. 
Retail opening -- operating margin declined 340 basis points due to the decline of retail gross margins as discussed earlier, and a 30 basis point increase in operating expenses attributed to higher store-related costs and depreciation expense, largely offset by lower distribution and general expenses. 
Wholesale operating margin declined 180 basis points due to the decline in wholesale gross margin, as discussed earlier, and a 130 basis point increase in operating expenses attributed to increased distribution costs, selling cost and depreciation expense partially offset by lower general expenses. 
Licensing margin increased 60 basis points due to lower operating expenses, including advertising costs, partially offset by higher costs associated with intellectual property protection as we take action against counterfeit activity globally. 
Income taxes were $114.4 million in the quarter. And our effective tax rate was 28.0% as compared to 27.2% in the same period last year. The increase in our effective tax rate was primarily due to the absence of the prior year favorable settlement of certain instruments in connection with our international structuring, partly offset by the increase in taxable income in certain non-U.S. subsidiaries, which are subject to lower tax rates. 
Net income was $294.6 million for the third quarter, and diluted earnings per share were $1.59. The unfavorable currency impact on EPS was $0.06 per share. 
Turning to the balance sheet. At the end of the quarter, cash and cash equivalents was $696.8 million. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 4.7 million shares, totaling $200 million under our share repurchase program, and we have another $558.1 million of availability remaining. There are no outstanding borrowings under our credit facility at the end of the quarter in either year. Inventory increased 9.5% versus last year, slightly ahead of revenue growth and in line with our expectation. As discussed in our last call, the change in foreign exchange rates continue to impact our European inventory, and we are now recording incremental inventory related to the consolidation of MK Panama. We expect our growth in the inventory to continue to outpace our growth in sales as we open new retail stores and shop-in-shops, expand our digital flagships and further develop our men's business. We also expect that the exchange rate differential and the MK Panama consolidation, in addition to the transition of the Korean business in-house, will continue to impact inventory levels until we anniversary these events. 
Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $96.8 million and were related to the build-out of new retail stores and shop-in-shops as well as investments in our distribution facilities, our corporate offices and other infrastructure improvements. We added 34 new stores in the third quarter, 15 in the Americas, 16 in Europe and 3 in Japan. In addition, we expanded or relocated 8 stores and converted 79 wholesale doors into shop-in-shops globally. 
Turning to our outlook. For the fourth quarter, we expect total revenue to be between $1.13 billion and $1.15 billion, which includes approximately $36 million of additional sales due to our 53rd week. On a constant-currency basis, total revenue is expected to increase in the high single digit range assuming an impact of approximately $20 million from the change in foreign currency rates. We expect comp store sales to be flat on a reported basis and to increase in the low single digits in constant currency driven by growth of our U.S. digital sales, the introduction of new innovative product offerings for spring 2016 and diminishing FX headwinds. However, we anticipate lower revenues in our licensing business during the quarter due to lower watch sales and a decrease in revenue related to eyewear as we anniversary our launch with Luxottica and the final quarter of shipments from Marcel last year. We expect international gross margin to remain under pressure in the fourth quarter as favorable hedging contracts we entered into last year expire. Operating expenses as a percentage of total revenue is expected to increase 190 basis points to 220 basis points. We expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.93 to $0.97 assuming a tax rate of approximately 27.5% and 182.5 million shares outstanding. We expect foreign currency to impact net income by approximately $3 million and EPS by approximately $0.02 for the fourth quarter. For the full fiscal year, our outlook for revenue and EPS remains unchanged. We expect revenue of approximately $4.65 billion on a reported basis. On a constant-currency basis, total revenue is expected to increase in the low double-digit range, assuming an impact of approximately $180 million from the change in foreign currency rates. We expect a mid-single digit comp store decrease on a reported basis and a low single digit decrease in constant currency. 
Operating expense as a percentage of total revenue is expected to increase by approximately 230 basis points for the year. We expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $4.38 to $4.42 for the year, assuming a tax rate of approximately 28.5% and 190 million shares outstanding. We expect foreign currency to impact net income by approximately $38 million and EPS by approximately $0.20 for the year. 
I will now turn the call back to John for closing remarks."

Are you seeing -- just for results across various countries in Europe, and maybe you can talk, in particular, about the wholesale piece, which was a real source, I think, of upside surprise."

And those were driven by, first, traffic; and second, conversion. Again, what we see happening is customers are starting their shopping experience, as you all know, digitally, or mobily first. And so the mobile traffic that we're getting to the site, it just keeps accelerating every single month. And we think we've got some real opportunities to even take that to another level. So we're extremely pleased with the traffic that we saw there. And we're also just pleased with the fact that certain categories, and I might add, footwear, in particular, is seeing a huge lift on e-commerce. Again, we're able to represent a much greater assortment of products that we are actually in many of our own stores, which has been a really interesting finding for us and is leading us to look at our stores today currently. And we're going to be expanding the footwear areas inside of our own stores to capitalize on what the consumer is really telling us given what she's seeing online. So again, we like what's happening there, and we think that's just going to continue to grow. And again sequentially, that will not grow as fast as you've seen over the past year or so, but the sheer dollar number is quite impressive. I might also add that even with the lift in e-commerce, we actually saw a sequential improvement in comp stores in just the stores themselves in sales. And again, that was driven, as I said earlier, by conversion. The conversion rates are getting very, very high inside the stores. And I want to give a very big New York shout out to our thousands of sales associates all over the world, who I think did an amazing job. We had a great holiday season. First and foremost, because of Michael's design teams and the product that they put together, but we've got thousands and thousands of people who have jet-set training and continue even with declining traffic in shopping malls to really deliver for us and for the consumers that they serve. So real kudos to them. In terms of Europe, we were generally pleased with the quarter. I have to be honest with you. There was a couple of areas of softness as you can be well aware, and France was a very difficult market for us after the events that happened there. And again, the whole -- it wasn't just Paris that was affected, remember, we're a very strong brand across many of the areas, and people were really not in a mood to shop. We were affected in Belgium, Belgium as well. And then the other place that we felt some softness is in the UK. And we've been feeling that. We've been talking about that really since last year, and that's been the euro-dollar exchange, and also the Russians not coming there as much as they did and some of the Middle Easterners as well. So that market's been a little more challenged for us. That all being said, we're seeing an actual acceleration in the business as we kick off the fourth quarter, which we're very excited about. And we think that some of the new product reads, we told you that in the last quarter, as we saw some of the new products hitting the stores, the reaction was quite strong. And again, the other thing that we're seeing happen in Europe, like we saw in America 3 years ago, some of the e-commerce penetrations with our partners, whether that's Harrods or Selfridges or other accounts in the marketplaces, is really accelerating very quickly. And so we're very pleased with what's happening in the European market and continue to see lots of growth there."

I know you touched on it in response to Kimberly's questions in the prepared remarks. But is it a new phenomenon, this kind of accelerating conversion? And is it -- do you feel like it's firmly tied to the development of the digital platform, in-store training are there other factors driving this? Because you've got exposure to these channels that a lot of other companies, retailers are struggling, tourist markets, mall channel and outlets, et cetera. Maybe we can dive in a little bit deeper and understand what's driving that conversion and how much more opportunity there is to use conversion to drive the comps?"

We believe that mall traffic in North America is going to continue to decline.

We believe that mall traffic in North America is going to continue to decline. And the reason for that is again, we think that people in North America are a bit more savvy when it comes to digital shopping. And just been more cultural year for a longer period of time, and you have big companies who are quite strong at it. And we've seen that both in our own stores, and you can see that through our wholesale partners as well, where digital is just becoming a bigger piece of the business. We haven't seen that yet in Asia, where mall traffic continues to be still pretty good. And Europe, I'd say, mall traffic is kind of average. We haven't seen the deceleration that we saw in the United States. And in the United States, again, we attribute it primarily to digital shopping for people. The reason why the conversion is climbing, I think, is twofold. Number one, just as a percent of total, obviously, if your traffic is down and your sales are trending up, you're going to -- it's going to come usually through conversion, not necessarily through ticket climbing so high. But the second thing is we've really worked hard with our teams inside the stores. We told you in our prepared remarks that the smaller bags in the AURs, that's the reality of fashion. We were one of the first people that jumped on that. And we believe that the global market for luxury handbags is approximately flat. But in unit sales, we're up into the very strong double digits. So what does that tell you? That tells you that there are more customers actually buying Michael Kors products than what you look at in the comp store sales. You're comparing comp store sales in dollars, which is, obviously, how we all earn EPS. But in actual units, there's a lot more people buying Michael Kors product and probably some of are the competitors than you're actually seeing. So the category in dollars is roughly flat, but actually in units, it's quite strong. So how do you go after that? Well, we believe that when somebody is coming in and interested in the crossbody, they need a new wallet because the wallet size is smaller in a crossbody versus a mid-sized handbag, where it might be a zip-around continent or things like that. So the market is changing very, very rapidly as the consumers fashion taste is changing, and we see our opportunity really, being in up-sell with the customer, or in trying to take advantage of trend. That's the second thing, I think, we've done a very good job on. Again, whether it was backpacks, whether it was crossbodies, saddlebags. We also did a great job with our active footwear. I mean, it's no secret some of big athletic companies are doing very, very well. And we've been on that trend for the last 2 years. And that category is growing significantly for us. So I think what our customers responding to is we've got the right fashion for them at the right time. We've got really well-trained associates, and these associates, quite frankly, know how to up-sell in terms of the multiple items to get that transaction value up, which is helping in our total conversion rates inside the store. Does that help?"

First off, we love our partners, whether it's Macy's or Dillard's or Lord & Taylor's or Bloomingdale's or Saks or Neimans or Harrods or Selfridges or Takashimaya. The wholesale channel is phenomenal. Department stores are phenomenal. They carry amazing brands inside these channels and I think that the theory that this channel is a channel that's going away is not a very well-thought-out theory. That channel is like every channel in retail today, is being challenged because the consumer is shopping differently. And as they shop differently, quite frankly, they're smarter. They have the ability to see things online, a lot more assortment, a lot more selection. They can compare side-by-side. They can compare pricing online. So what we just believe is that, that channel is going to figure out how to manage its growth over the next 12 to 24 months, as many of us saw. And we think it's better to have less inventory in there, to have less promotions, which will keep the brand integrity at a higher level. And our partners are very supportive of this. We also want to turn our inventories faster for them and for us. And we think the better we look to our end consumer and not confusing them with different promotional activities at different levels, the better it is for the brand long term. So as I said in our prepared remarks, we believe that channel is going to be down on a go-forward basis for us. And we'll make that up more so in our retail stores, our e-commerce, expansions in certain marketplaces, and then ultimately long term, where, as we've said in the past, we're looking at certain other licenses that we may or may not bring in-house. Our men's business growth. So we have plenty of opportunity for us to grow. It doesn't all have to be pushed. And that's what we're afraid of. We don't want to push too hard because we think that could damage the brand long term."

I don't have the exact percentage in here for you, but it's definitively much more driven by bag size than it is by promotional activity. And I think I said in the last quarterly call that we are hoping, believe, think, wish, whatever you want to say, that we start to lap this in June, July, August of next year. We saw the small bag trend happening. It really started happening 2 years ago. We think we're a bit more up against that, or there will be less of a headwind for us. There's no guarantees on that. Again, it's just going to depend on the trends that are happening. You even see in money pieces now are getting smaller because again people are -- as more things end up on your phone, you need less things in your wallet. So that's just a fact. So actually, a much -- smaller money pieces are accelerating even faster than our larger money pieces. So we are seeing it across the board. In terms of the promotional activity, look, there's no question that the -- our third quarter or the retailer fourth quarter had more promotional activity inside of it. I wouldn't say there was more events, I would just say there was a lot more markdowns related to clearing inventories as everyone wanted to be cleaned to start the year. We had terribly unseasonably warm weather, which really affected everyone in the business. And not just things like boots and coats, which everybody talks about, but when people aren't going to do the stores because it's 60 degrees outside on the day before Christmas. It just got a psychological halo that we really think affected the business in North America. So I think people got healthy with inventories, and I think that was a very good thing for us to start out the spring season."

First off, we don't disclose the various categories in detail like that. The watch business remained difficult during the quarter. I would say that as in the prepared remarks, we really saw something very interesting. We saw, when we put newness on the table, the customer responded very, very positively. So you're going to see something from us in spring. We have one of the largest new assortments of watches coming in our history, and that's going to be led by slim watches. We think there's a very, very big fashion trend towards slim. So Michael Kors will be pushing that in a very significant way. And we think that's one of the key issues. We probably we didn't have enough newness out there, I told you that in previous calls. We think we've addressed that this spring season. And secondly, clearly, consumers are just wearing less watches because of what a smartphone will do for you, and the fact that people are glued to their phone and they use that for more of a timepiece. I think, and I believe, Kosta Kartsotis and Fossil thinks as well, that the smartwatch technology is actually going to revolutionize the fashion watch business. I think over the next 5 to 10 years, most fashion watches will be sold with some type of smartwatch technology in it. So we're super excited. We'll be announcing our whole program at Basel in March, with a launch in-store in August. And watch out. We're a very competitive group, Fossil and Michael Kors, and we see big opportunity in a category that is today in the billions of dollars. That being, not only smartwatches but other connected accessories as well, and we tend on competing and competing at a very high level."

The AUR is going to move up a little bit in products because as we add materialization and as we add embellishment and as we do different things to the product to enhance it. We actually want to move the AUR up a little bit. Michael and I were talking last night, it's still funny. When a customer sees amazing design and understands that, that is something that's different, we don't have any problem with selling the pricing of it. And I think as an industry, we probably got a little too focused on the $300 handbag price points. So again, it's not that we're jumping into saying that our business is now going to be $700, which, by the way, we have that category today in our stores because we have our Michael Kors Collection bags in the stores. But we think that the customers looking, just like we said in watches, they're looking for something that's more exciting, and that's why we've invited you all to come up to the showrooms in the next couple of weeks, to see the product. Because Oliver, if I may say, when I read a lot of the reports, everyone said that Michael Kors is ubiquitous. Michael Kors is over distributed. Michael Kors is this, that, and the other thing. And the truth is that we keep growing, and the customer keeps responding. And the customer is voting not only yes in dollars, but she's voting yes in units. So what we're going to stay committed to is great design. There is going to be some elevation in the AUR. In terms of additional space in the store, no. What we'll probably going to do is take a little less of our basics and probably wind those -- pull those back a little bit and increase fashion a little bit more, which, again, customer's saying yes. She wants something new not only from us, it's from our competitors as well. I'm talking from the luxury European competitors are seeing the exact same thing. So it's right for trend, its right for the business, and its right for inspire our customer."

As you can see, when you really look at our income statement, the revenues continue to grow inside the company. We're making sequential improvement in comp store sales. So hopefully, a bit of the naysayers who say that our brand is ubiquitous, over distributed, et cetera, some of that hopefully will -- you'll get comfortable with the fact that Michael Kors brand is still very strong, growing and developing, both in North America and globally. That being said, our expense, our SG&A is actually rising slightly quicker than our sales, which is something that we're working on. And that's being driven by a number of different projects, as you know, that we were investing in. And also we have anticipated a much higher top line, in particular, because of the FX change. So in terms of -- we're about halfway through the development of our Venlo project, which is a very, very expensive endeavor for us, a million square-foot facility in the Netherlands to support our $1 billion-plus business in Europe. And the fact that we're going to be launching, ultimately in 22 countries our online. We want to have -- really have the best-in-class facility to be able to handle that and not have to keep upsizing the way that we did in Los Angeles, which was a bit painful for us. So that project will be finished somewhere around August, September, October. And we really won't get leverage from that in the first year. Actually, we will -- that will go against us as we learn to operate the facility, et cetera. But again, as we've told you, we're a luxury business investing for the future. So we're not -- if we don't make these investments, we're not going to have a company that's going to be sustainable long term. So that's the first big investment. Secondly, as we bring up e-commerce around the world, and quite frankly, move sales from brick-and-mortar to e-commerce, we have the expense to bring up e-commerce, all the systemic issues, we're hiring staff well in advance of having any revenues, so all these are going as negative headwinds. And then unfortunately, today, e-commerce generates a lower opening profit for us than four-wall brick-and-mortar. We think over time that will reverse itself. But, as you know, when the consumer requires free delivery, free return, wonderful packaging plus there's a new trend that people are buying multiple sizes of things, to try them at home and then return them. That all is a negative headwind for us. So I would say that we're again, about halfway through our investment in -- to be able to have our entire network built-out in terms of global e-commerce. And then we're here finishing out our corporate headquarters, which, again you'll see in a couple of weeks, which was a very significant project for us. We said that we wanted to look, feel and act like a digital company. I think you're going to be very impressed when you see what we've done here. It's great for recruiting the best in the industry, it's great for employee retention. And I think we did it in a way that was very reasonable given where we are in our building and how we were able to execute that. So those are the 3 big projects. We've got some minor things that are headwinds for us. We brought Korea in-house, that's going to be negative for the first couple of years. We've got our joint venture in South America that, unfortunately, will be a negative for us as we deal with some of the headwinds down there. And men's will be negative for us for the next couple of years. Again, if we don't make these investments, we're not going to build a long-term company and have it sustainable. So we believe that going forward, SG&A still will slightly outpace sales, and we hope to get that probably turned around in our fiscal '18, but it will not be in fiscal '17 at this point. So hopefully that gives you some color on that question."

However, when you think about CapEx, our $400 million CapEx for the current fiscal year is a peak CapEx, and we will be thinking in terms of decreasing that CapEx spend significantly going forward. In terms of the hedges, I can't give you any definitive answer to that. Our hedges are typically 9 months to a year out. They are -- they relate to operations that we operate in non-U.S. currencies, where are purchasing inventory in U.S. dollars. And we talked about that in prior quarters. As those hedges roll-off, we, of course, are entering new hedges, but there will be more to spot right, when they roll off. And so that's just contributing to -- that will increase inventory costs, and therefore, have a headwind in terms of the gross margin."

We really enjoyed his leadership here. So I guess we did a switch with John Varvatos. Mark went to John Varvatos and Don Witkowski came from John Varvatos to come over here to run men's. You may not know this but actually Don ran men's here many, many years ago when we first started it. Don was with me at Donna Karan as well. So Don is somebody who walks in the door, hits the ground running, doesn't miss a beat, has great leadership and merchant qualities. And so as far as we're concerned, really nothing has changed at all. And, as you know, we are really excited about Marcel Ostwald joining the company, and I can't tell you how thrilled you're going to be to see the men's product when you walk in the door. And I'm very excited for when you all come visit because for the first time, normally, it's always the female analysts who are oohing and aahing. This time, we're going to have hopefully have a few men oohing and aahing at our walk through. So we feel -- the men's business, we've said before, is $1 billion opportunity for the company. And we've said -- about 1/3 of that rough will come from men's sportswear, about 1/3 of that will come from Men's Leather, and about 1/3 of that will come from watches, maybe a little less from watches. But we kind of broke that down in that area. The watches, we obviously won't report. The revenue inside of our company, but we'll report the royalties in that chart. We are well on track with all of our North American partners in constructing shops. So we'll be in all the best stores again, whether that's Saks, Bloomingdale's, Macy's, Dillard's, Lord & Taylor, they're either up or under construction or are going forward. I have to say that some of the new products has just hit retail in the last week. Marcel was just barely able to touch some of that and the sell-throughs have been terrific. And we're really going to see the big impact this come fall season. We're also in the 150-plus stores today already in Europe. So the distribution is there. We have beautiful shops in Harrods, in Selfridges and at Peek & Cloppenburg, and in El Corte Inglés, et cetera. And the European community is really supportive of that. I just came back from Asia, 2 weeks ago. We have some very significant plants about rolling that business out. Again, that will be a department-store-driven business, but with shop-in-shops that will actually -- we'll count those as stores. Remember, we count concessions in our store counts. So when I give you that 500 store count globally, that includes concessions as well inside that number. So internally, inside the company, we're really excited about it, big opportunity. And there really hasn't been a major new menswear business launched in 20 years in terms of significant across all categories that I think our wholesale partners can get behind in a big way. So we're excited to be a part of that. And then we have the freestanding store opportunities/stores that will be connected to our existing stores. And we think that's going to be a big opportunity. One last call, I will tell you that in our stores over the holiday season what really surprised us is leather accounted for close to 40% of sales inside the store that opened. And again, they were only open for a couple of months and it was during the holiday season, but we were really shocked by the strength of our business in leather and really bodes well for the development of that category."

So unfortunately, we've seen the watch category decline, we're seeing the jewelry category increase. One of the things that we're going to do in our own stores for the spring of 2017, and you've heard me talk about this kind of last year more that while we love to introduce in the jewelry category, unfortunately that drove the AUR of the total jewelry and watch category down for us because we were selling $150 bracelet or an $85 pair of earrings versus a $225 watch. So that really hurt us. And again, I think sometimes, when people are looking at the business, they don't -- they think it's all handbags that's driving the comp up and down, but in a lot of cases that's not really, actually the issue. So we kind of hurt ourselves a little bit with that. So what we're going to do is we will exit most of the fashion jewelry line in the spring of '17 from our own stores, and we will introduce a more fine jewelry line inside of our own stores, really bringing it closer to the watch AUR, not completely, but it will be -- it will have gold, it'll have silver, will have plated materials as well, 18-karat plated, et cetera. And we're going to really elevate that whole category inside of our store, and there'll be select retail partners that we will allow also to carry that. But it's going to be very limited distribution, and we think it's a big opportunity for us to trade up the AURs in the store. Going back to the original question that Kimberly and Omar, we were talking about is, as traffic declines in these stores, we all have to be focused on conversion. And how can we -- we're not going to raise our AURs by 25% and 30% and 40%. But if you can get your AUR up 5% or 10%, that's going to make a big difference, and we're going to be doing that not only in our own stores, but looking at the department store channel as well on the specialty store channel and really take advantage of that. The second question you asked, we don't break out the percentage of -- for advertising. The only thing I can tell you is that we will continue to support that part of our business. As you know, we have, first off, the greatest voice in the fashion industry with Michael himself. We have the greatest PR, marketing and digital team, we think, in the industry, and I said in the prepared remarks, every single channel, social channel, we increased whether it's fans, followers, et cetera, and that really speaks volumes to what's happening with our advertising and marketing and the way that our teams are handing that. And again, we're going to be very proactive not only on existing channels but as we've done in the past, we've been really a leader in looking at new channels as they emerge and how we can have a voice in there."

But we have, between our licensed partners and ourselves, we have about 860 stores worldwide. And out of that 860 stores, in the Americas, we have about 400 stores. That includes Canada, Latin America, United States, et cetera. So we're kind of getting built and finished with our store rollout. In North America, in particular, it's going to be very few stores. We told you many years ago, and I know many people have not loved the fact that I've held very steadfast to the number. We told you we were going to build 400 stores in North America. And many people have asked me over and over again, why are you doing that? And we've said we're going to keep building 400 stores in North America. And we will finish that build out. The Americas got a little bit larger as a number because it now includes Latin America. So maybe it will be 425 or 430 or something like that. Whatever it is, we're pretty much done with our build out in this region of the world. Europe will continue to accelerate. In that marketplace, we have 171 of our own stores, and then we have a number with -- in Russia, et cetera. And again, we believe that, that marketplace will have in excess of 200 stores, we've said that in the past. And then Asia is a place where we think, we have a lot of opportunity. So all in all, we've said about 1,000 stores is where we think we'll be as a company, and that includes our license partners. So we have 150 or so to go. That does not include men's. We've said that men's will be something that will be a plus for us. So again -- and the last thing I just want to say is, again, I believe the -- we make a lot of money in four-wall in the stores. We also believe that, while e-commerce one day will end up being 20% or 30% of our business, it's not going to be 100%. So stores are not going away. They're not dying, and we need stores to service communities and people. And then also, I think, as you become omni, you really have a distinct advantage in having stores. So I'll give you a good example. Our return rates on e-commerce are running very low. But a number of those returns are coming back to stores. And it actually gives us an opportunity to interact with the customer, and we have seen evidence where we're actually not only taking the return, but trading the customer up and creating even a better experience with the customer. So again, we embraced omni, we embraced our retail flagships and our retail fleet that we have today. And we will finish the build out and get ourselves to the approximately 1,000 stores."

Those -- we're pleased with what happened with those stores. What we need to see is we're going to reconfigure a number of existing stores, as I mentioned earlier, to increase the footwear space inside those stores. We're really happy with what's happening with footwear. And we think it's another reason for the customer to come in and shop with us, et cetera. So we've got to see how that plays out. I want to remind everyone that as we increase our women's ready-to-wear and our women's footwear business, both in wholesale and in retail, that has an impact on our margin for 2 reasons: Number one, we have lower margins going in; and number two, their size businesses. And when you have size businesses, you have markdowns that are greater than what you run, and handbags aren't really sized and watches aren't really sized. So it will help us grow the top line. And ultimately, we think, it will help us grow the consumer experience. But as Joe indicated before, gross margins are kind of be flattish in the zone of where they are today, looking out going forward, impacted a little bit by what's going to happen with shoes and bags and even menswear has lower gross margins as well."

We have I think, the second or third highest operating margins in the world, in luxury, compared to the European luxury operators, et cetera. We're going to end this year somewhere around 25% operating margins, which really is extraordinary. And we generate a lot of cash, and we've been very aggressive about buying back stock because we feel that the market, if I may say that, has misunderstood our story and our potential and our long-term vision and our success quite frankly. So we are going to continue to be very aggressive given what we think is a dislocation of where our multiple is versus the rest of the industry. And I might remind everyone that we will end the year with top line growth and bottom line growth, which is very unusual for many, many players in the luxury industry. Pardon me if I bang the drum for Michael Kors for a minute. The line of credit is there for a number of different reasons. First, it's there, again, if we continue to see dislocations, we may or may not decide to even get more aggressive with our buyback purchases. As Joe said before, we have $580 million left on our authorization, but our board feels very strongly in making sure that we continue to return value to shareholders. Secondly, the line is there to look at potential licenses. We have a number of them that could be brought back in-house. And again, when we think that those are in a strategic place for us or are going to be accretive for us, we will act upon that. As you said before, we're very pleased with what's happening in China for us. And even though Hong Kong and Macau remain difficult, we had double-digit comp store increase even with Hong Kong and Macau being difficult. I mean, what does that tell you about the brand? The brand is strong, resonating, customers very excited about what's happening with our product in that marketplace. So we like that and as we said in the prepared comments, she's shopping around the world with us not just in the Mainland China marketplace as you know. Well over 50% of luxury goods is purchased outside of the mainland. And the third purpose for the line is and we said it in our last call is when and if a strategic acquisition is something that we think fits with our company's short-term and/or long-term objectives, we may very well act. So we have an incredible balance sheet. We have an incredible cash flow generation, and we have the ammunition to do a lot of different things to continue to generate revenue and earnings per share growth for the long term.

She came in, she shopped, she shopped for gifts and I said to you earlier that we saw sequential improvement. She liked what -- the product we were offering her and she had a lot of choices out there in the marketplace and not only she had lot of choices. She had a lot of choices, a lot of prices. So we were particularly pleased with that. And again, we spend so much time talking about North America, North America. We're doing 30% of our business now approximately internationally. And we really like what we saw happening in Europe, and Asia is continuing to just build momentum. So as you think of this company long term, and this will be my concluding remarks, we always knew that North America would be a marketplace that ultimately would reach a point where we have lower growth. That's where we are today. We're still growing in the marketplace. And we're still taking market share, which, again, I hope you recognize given our results. So we think that really resonates for the brand well. Europe, still good opportunity for us to develop stores. Wholesale shop-in-shops there, and many marketplaces where we're still underpenetrated. Asia is wide open for us. We still are super underpenetrated in Korea, Japan, China and in certain places in Southeast Asia. So when you think about Michael Kors, think about growth. It's not going to be double-digit growth, those days are behind us. But we're going to have solid growth going forward, and in the luxury industry today, I think there's not a lot of companies that can stand up and say that and keep delivering on that quarter after quarter.

Good morning, and welcome to Michael Kors' third quarter fiscal 2016 earnings call. I'm pleased to report that our revenues, comparable store sales and earnings per share results for the third quarter exceeded our expectations, whic",1754,"Thank you, Krystyna. Good morning, and welcome to Michael Kors' third quarter fiscal 2016 earnings call. 
I'm pleased to report that our revenues, comparable store sales and earnings per share results for the third quarter exceeded our expectations, which speaks to the enduring strength of the Michael Kors luxury brand, in particular, during the all-important holiday season. We know that consumers have a lot of choices when it comes to what brands they purchase. And the fact that they chose Michael Kors is a great testament to our world-class design team, strong product offering and the lasting connection that we have fostered with our customers. 
For the quarter, total revenue increased 6% on a reported basis. In constant currency, total revenue increased 10% driven by growth across segments and geographies. Earnings per share increased 7% to $1.59 on a reported basis, and on a constant-currency basis, earnings per share grew 11%. 
Our Retail business delivered solid results across all geographies driven by strong double-digit sales growth in our digital flagship business and new store openings. On a constant-currency basis, global comparable store sales increased 2%, which was ahead of our expectations and marked another quarter of sequential improvement. Importantly, while mall traffic in North America declined, we saw a significant increase in conversion rates in our own retail stores, which further illustrates the strength of the Michael Kors brand. On a constant-currency basis, comp store sales rose in the low single digits in North America and Europe, and in the high double digits in Japan. While our wholesale business was roughly flat for the quarter on a reported basis, we delivered results above our expectations despite the challenging and highly promotional retail environment. In fact, while the North American department store channel was challenged, we believe our results continued to outpace the overall channel performance, which enabled us to further strengthen our leadership position in this channel. Internationally, European wholesale sales grew 4% on a reported basis and almost 20% on a constant-currency basis, and we saw 26% growth in our Asian wholesale business. 
We also achieved solid growth in our licensing business. While the overall watch category remains challenged during the third quarter, we were excited to see favorable response to the newness that we introduced into our watch offering as well as our jewelry assortment. In watches, navy, sable and black platings as well as colored leather straps proved to be sought-after additions in our collection. Customers also responded well to our updated jewelry offering, with particular strength in the padlock, parts and disc motifs. And our watch and bracelet gift sets were strong sellers during the season. Our fragrance collections for women as well as men's fragrance also proved to be great gifts with our customers who are shopping for family and friends or looking to treat themselves to something special. We were also pleased to see strong growth of our fragrance offering in the travel retail channel worldwide. In addition, we continue to see very positive response to our eyewear collections and are happy that our new partnership in this category has been such a strong success. 
Turning to our product categories. We were pleased with the performance of our accessories business, where we injected new styles that contributed to strong growth and market share gains in the quarter. Total accessory sales on a retail basis grew at a high single digit rate globally and a mid-single digit rate in North America, demonstrating our leadership in this category, especially against a difficult retail backdrop. The demand for smaller-sized bags, crossbodies and small leather goods continued to impact AUR in the quarter. However, we again saw a high double-digit increase in units sold, proving that customers continue to seek out Michael Kors luxury accessories. Footwear sales were also strong during the quarter driven by our fashion active category. Unfortunately, the unseasonably warm weather hurt boot sales, which negatively impacted our footwear margins and AUR. Overall, our new merchandise assortment for holiday reflected the latest designs from Michael and our design team and spotlighted modern glamor, easy elegance and sport lux essentials. The updated silhouettes as well as our gifting assortment resonated well with customers globally and our #JustBecause marketing campaign proved very successful in connecting our customers with just the right gift for everyone on their shopping list. 
Looking ahead, we remain focused on executing our key strategic initiatives that will drive us towards our long-term growth targets. First and foremost, we remain committed to delivering luxury products that embodies fashion, design innovation and the Michael Kors luxury brand DNA. 
As we look to the spring season, we will be introducing our largest assortment of new handbag groups created to inspire our customers with exciting new trends. Our collections will underscore Michael's fashion leadership with an offering that reflects new color pallets, innovative materials, embellishment, mixed-media in leather, luxurious textures and elegant silhouettes across product categories. In footwear, the fashion active category remains one of our highest growing areas, and we expect to leverage this trend in the spring. We are also capturing the denim trend in our accessories and apparel assortments, which are featured in our new national advertising ad campaigns. We have begun to evolve our advertising campaigns to reflect the glamorous destinations and inspirational moments of the modern Michael Kors customer. Our integrated marketing programs with compelling digital and social media campaigns delivered through desktop and mobile devices as well as traditional print, billboard and target marketing are designed to extend our reach, allowing us to engage consumers with our brand, immerse them in the Michael Kors Lifestyle and encourage them to shop our sites and stores. 
In our retail business, we continue to develop our digital flagship strategy globally, at a rapid pace and build upon our omnichannel capabilities. We have digital platforms in place, in the U.S. and Canada, and we are on track to launch in 6 European countries this fall and an additional 16 countries in Europe thereafter. 
Importantly, we are working to seamlessly integrate the consumer shopping experience across all touch points. We are taking steps to enhance our mobile shopping experience and expect to see the benefits of these measures over the coming months. We will also begin to leverage our analytics and CRM capabilities to share Michael's message with consumers through various communication vehicles and to present and tailor our styling to the individual customer. Overall, our digital flagship strategy is enabling us to engage consumers with our luxury lifestyle brand and provide a best-in-class shopping experience. As you know, we have a strong and influential online presence as consumers turn to Michael Kors for fashion insights, and we continue to see our fan base grow across all social media platforms, further demonstrating the power of our brand. In addition, we remain focused on expanding our global retail footprint, and we will continue to open flagship locations in key cities around the world to drive revenues and brand recognition. Our latest flagship opened this past November in the Ginza district in Tokyo, and we will be opening new flagships in London, Seoul and Singapore this coming year. These locations not only enable us to present the most expansive collection of our fashion product, including both our collection and lifestyle offerings as well as men's products in select locations, but also showcase the Michael Kors luxury DNA for consumers worldwide. Internationally, we completed the integration of our Korean business in January and are excited about the retail growth potential in this market. Lastly, we continue to extend our men's presence at retail, both with standalone stores as well as through the addition of our men's offering in our existing lifestyle stores in North America, Europe and Asia. We opened 4 men's location this quarter in Scottsdale Fashion Square in Arizona, Memorial City in Houston, Garden State Plaza in New Jersey and San Francisco Center in California. And we are pleased with the initial consumer response. By the end of this fiscal year, we expect our full men's assortment to be available on 11 locations, and we continue to believe there's a potential for up to 500 locations worldwide. 
In our wholesale channel, we expect moderately lower sales growth. As we have stated previously, we will be managing our North American wholesale inventory to ensure that we maintain the integrity of our brand. We see continued sales growth internationally from the expansion of our accessories, womenswear and footwear business and the development of our men's category. We remain particularly excited about the expansion of our men's business in wholesale, and are on track to open 75 men's shop-in-shops globally this year. 
Importantly, we continue to believe that this is a significant new category for the company, and I am confident that we can develop this business and become a leading men's luxury brand. 
In licensing, we are excited about the continued growth opportunity of our fragrance and eyewear categories and the newness in the watch category as we continue to introduce updated watch styles and launch our new connected fashion line later this year. As we look at consumer trends, we believe that connected accessories will reshape the fashion watch business globally. Michael Kors is known for being at the forefront of the fashion watch category, and we expect to quickly emerge as a leader in connected fashion as well. 
Turning to our regional licenses. We remain focused on expanding our presence across Asia, which represents a significant growth opportunity for our company. In Greater China, we continue to see an increase in brand acceptance, as evidenced by another quarter of double-digit comp store sales growth. As the Chinese consumers' desire for our brand builds, we are capturing this demand, both in the region and as they travel globally through our airport locations worldwide and in areas such as Japan, Korea and Europe. We look forward to our continued global expansion through our strong regional partnerships and growing demand for our luxury brands. 
In summary, we are pleased with the success we achieved in the third quarter, with an excellent holiday season driven by a luxury fashion product assortment, strength of our digital flagships and sequential improvement in our comparable store sales as well as continued success of our wholesale business. Our results demonstrate the sustained demand for our luxury fashion products globally and the market leadership of the Michael Kors brand. 
Now let me turn it over to Joe for a detailed review of our third quarter financial results and our outlook."

We are pleased to report financial results above our guidance for the third quarter. Total revenue grew 6.3% to $1.4 billion. On a constant-currency basis, total revenue grew 9.9% driven by increases across the Americas, Europe and Japan of 1.4%, 29.1% and 68% respectively. In our retail segment, net sales increased 11.1%. In constant currency, retail net sales increased 15.7% driven by the opening of 114 net new stores since the third quarter of last year and strong performance of our digital flagships. We saw a marginal decline in comps of 0.9% on a reported basis. On a constant-currency basis, comp store sales increased 2.0% reflecting a sequential improvement from the second quarter of our total comp as well as our retail store comp and outperformance versus our guidance. The increase is attributable to positive comp store sales in North America, Europe and Japan as consumers respond favorably to our luxury product offering. Our U.S. digital flagship sales contributed 360 basis points to our overall comp performance in the quarter on a constant-currency basis. In our wholesale segment, net sales grew 0.3%. On a constant-currency basis, wholesale sales increased 3.0% driven primarily by our footwear category and strong growth in international markets. In our licensing segment, revenue increased 8.4% driven primarily by higher licensing revenues related to sales of jewelry and eyewear as well as higher international licensing revenue. We opened 52 new watch and jewelry shop-in-shops during the quarter and ended the quarter with 362 shop-in-shops globally. 
Gross margin declined 140 basis points to 59.5%, which includes a 95 basis point foreign currency translation and transaction impact. The decline in gross margin reflects a 310 basis point decline in retail gross margins, primarily due to additional markdowns. A 50 basis point decline in wholesale gross margins, primarily due to additional wholesale allowances partially offset by higher licensing gross margin dollars. Total operating expenses grew 10.7%. The increase in SG&A was due to higher retail occupancy and salary costs related to new store openings and included higher e-commerce expenses and an increase in corporate-related expenses. The increase in depreciation expense was primarily due to the opening of retail stores, new shop-in-shops, an increase in lease rights related to our new European stores and investments in our corporate facilities and IT infrastructure. 
As a percent of total revenue, total operating expenses increased 120 basis points to 30.2%. This was below the 200 to 240 basis points of deleverage in our guidance, primarily due to better-than-expected sales in the quarter. 
Income from operations was $409.3 million or 29.3% of total revenue as compared to 31.8% of total revenue in the same period last year. 
Retail opening -- operating margin declined 340 basis points due to the decline of retail gross margins as discussed earlier, and a 30 basis point increase in operating expenses attributed to higher store-related costs and depreciation expense, largely offset by lower distribution and general expenses. 
Wholesale operating margin declined 180 basis points due to the decline in wholesale gross margin, as discussed earlier, and a 130 basis point increase in operating expenses attributed to increased distribution costs, selling cost and depreciation expense partially offset by lower general expenses. 
Licensing margin increased 60 basis points due to lower operating expenses, including advertising costs, partially offset by higher costs associated with intellectual property protection as we take action against counterfeit activity globally. 
Income taxes were $114.4 million in the quarter. And our effective tax rate was 28.0% as compared to 27.2% in the same period last year. The increase in our effective tax rate was primarily due to the absence of the prior year favorable settlement of certain instruments in connection with our international structuring, partly offset by the increase in taxable income in certain non-U.S. subsidiaries, which are subject to lower tax rates. 
Net income was $294.6 million for the third quarter, and diluted earnings per share were $1.59. The unfavorable currency impact on EPS was $0.06 per share. 
Turning to the balance sheet. At the end of the quarter, cash and cash equivalents was $696.8 million. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 4.7 million shares, totaling $200 million under our share repurchase program, and we have another $558.1 million of availability remaining. There are no outstanding borrowings under our credit facility at the end of the quarter in either year. Inventory increased 9.5% versus last year, slightly ahead of revenue growth and in line with our expectation. As discussed in our last call, the change in foreign exchange rates continued to impact our European inventory, and we are now recording incremental inventory related to the consolidation of MK Panama. We expect our growth in inventory to continue to outpace our growth in sales as we open new retail stores and shop-in-shops, expand our digital flagships and further develop our men's business. We also expect that the exchange rate differential and the MK Panama consolidation, in addition to the transition of the Korean business in-house, will continue to impact inventory levels until we anniversary these events. 
Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $96.8 million and were related to the build-out of new retail stores and shop-in-shops as well as investments in our distribution facilities, our corporate offices and other infrastructure improvements. We added 34 new stores in the third quarter, 15 in the Americas, 16 in Europe and 3 in Japan. In addition, we expanded or relocated 8 stores and converted 79 wholesale doors into shop-in-shops globally. 
Turning to our outlook. For the fourth quarter, we expect total revenue to be between $1.13 billion and $1.15 billion, which includes approximately $36 million of additional sales due to our 53rd week. On a constant-currency basis, total revenue is expected to increase in the high single digit range assuming an impact of approximately $20 million from the change in foreign currency rates. We expect comp store sales to be flat on a reported basis and to increase in the low single digits in constant currency driven by growth of our U.S. digital sales, the introduction of new innovative product offerings for spring 2016 and diminishing FX headwinds. However, we anticipate lower revenues in our licensing business during the quarter due to lower watch sales and a decrease in revenue related to eyewear as we anniversary our launch with Luxottica and the final quarter of shipments from Marcel last year. We expect international gross margin to remain under pressure in the fourth quarter as favorable hedging contracts we entered into last year expire. Operating expenses as a percentage of total revenue is expected to increase 190 basis points to 220 basis points. We expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.93 to $0.97 assuming a tax rate of approximately 27.5% and 182.5 million shares outstanding. We expect foreign currency to impact net income by approximately $3 million and EPS by approximately $0.02 for the fourth quarter. For the full fiscal year, our outlook for revenue and EPS remains unchanged. We expect revenue of approximately $4.65 billion on a reported basis. On a constant-currency basis, total revenue is expected to increase in the low double-digit range, assuming an impact of approximately $180 million from the change in foreign currency rates. We expect a mid-single digit comp store decrease on a reported basis and a low single digit decrease in constant currency. 
Operating expense as a percentage of total revenue is expected to increase by approximately 230 basis points for the year. We expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $4.38 to $4.42 for the year, assuming a tax rate of approximately 28.5% and 190 million shares outstanding. We expect foreign currency to impact net income by approximately $38 million and EPS by approximately $0.20 for the year. 
I will now turn the call back to John for closing remarks."

And then Europe also, I think a little bit of a positive surprise just given what we've heard from others. The fact that it's still running positive on a constant-currency basis. Are you seeing disparate results across various countries in Europe, and maybe you can talk, in particular, about the wholesale piece, which was a real source, I think, of upside surprise."

And those were driven by, first, traffic; and second, conversion. Again, what we see happening is customers are starting their shopping experience, as you all know, digitally, or mobily first. And so the mobile traffic that we're getting to the site, it just keeps accelerating every single month. And we think we've got some real opportunities to even take that to another level. So we're extremely pleased with the traffic that we saw there. And we're also just pleased with the fact that certain categories, and I might add, footwear, in particular, is seeing a huge lift on e-commerce. Again, we're able to represent a much greater assortment of products that we are actually in many of our own stores, which has been a really interesting finding for us and is leading us to look at our stores today currently. And we're going to be expanding the footwear areas inside of our own stores to capitalize on what the consumer is really telling us given what she's seeing online. So again, we like what's happening there, and we think that's just going to continue to grow. And again sequentially, that will not grow as fast as you've seen over the past year or so, but the sheer dollar number is quite impressive. I might also add that even with the lift in e-commerce, we actually saw sequential improvement in comp stores in just the stores themselves in sales. And again, that was driven, as I said earlier, by conversion. The conversion rates are getting very, very high inside the stores. And I want to give a very big New York shout out to our thousands of sales associates all over the world, who I think did an amazing job. We had a great holiday season. First and foremost, because of Michael's design teams and the product that they put together, but we've got thousands and thousands of people who have jet-set training and continue even with declining traffic in shopping malls to really deliver for us and for the consumers that they serve. So real kudos to them. In terms of Europe, we were generally pleased with the quarter. I have to be honest with you. There was a couple of areas of softness as you can be well aware, and France was a very difficult market for us after the events that happened there. And again, the whole -- it wasn't just Paris that was affected, remember, we're a very strong brand across many of the areas, and people were really not in a mood to shop. We were affected in Belgium, Belgium as well. And then the other place that we felt some softness is in the UK. And we've been feeling that. We've been talking about that really since last year, and that's been the euro-dollar exchange, and also the Russians not coming there as much as they did and some of the Middle Easterners as well. So that market's been a little more challenged for us. That all being said, we're seeing an actual acceleration in the business as we kick off the fourth quarter, which we're very excited about. And we think that some of the new product reads, we told you that in the last quarter, as we saw some of the new products hitting the stores, the reaction was quite strong. And again, the other thing that we're seeing happen in Europe, like we saw in America 3 years ago, some of the e-commerce penetrations with our partners, whether that's Harrods or Selfridges or other accounts in the marketplaces, is really accelerating very quickly. And so we're very pleased with what's happening in the European market and continue to see lots of growth there."

And is it -- do you feel like it's firmly tied to the development of the digital platform, in-store training are there other factors driving this? Because you've got exposure to these channels that a lot of other companies, retailers are struggling, tourist markets, mall channel and outlets, et cetera. Maybe we can dive in a little bit deeper and understand what's driving that conversion and how much more opportunity there is to use conversion to drive the comps?"

We believe that mall traffic in North America is going to continue to decline. And the reason for that is again, we think that people in North America are a bit more savvy",577,"Omar, we believe that, and I'm going to focus this on North America for the moment. We believe that mall traffic in North America is going to continue to decline. And the reason for that is again, we think that people in North America are a bit more savvy when it comes to digital shopping. And just been more cultural year for a longer period of time, and you have big companies who are quite strong at it. And we've seen that both in our own stores, and you can see that through our wholesale partners as well, where digital is just becoming a bigger piece of the business. We haven't seen that yet in Asia, where mall traffic continues to be still pretty good. And Europe, I'd say, mall traffic is kind of average. We haven't seen the deceleration that we saw in the United States. And in the United States, again, we attribute it primarily to digital shopping for people. The reason why the conversion is climbing, I think, is twofold. Number one, just as a percent of total, obviously, if your traffic is down and your sales are trending up, you're going to -- it's going to come usually through conversion, not necessarily through ticket climbing so high. But the second thing is we've really worked hard with our teams inside the stores. We told you in our prepared remarks that the smaller bags in the AURs, that's the reality of fashion. We were one of the first people that jumped on that. And we believe that the global market for luxury handbags is approximately flat. But in unit sales, we're up into the very strong double digits. So what does that tell you? That tells you that there are more customers actually buying Michael Kors products than what you look at in the comp store sales. You're comparing comp store sales in dollars, which is, obviously, how we all earn EPS. But in actual units, there's a lot more people buying Michael Kors product and probably some of our other competitors than you're actually seeing. So the category in dollars is roughly flat, but actually in units, it's quite strong. So how do you go after that? Well, we believe that when somebody is coming in and interested in the crossbody, they need a new wallet because the wallet size is smaller in a crossbody versus a mid-sized handbag, where it might be a zip-around continent or things like that. So the market is changing very, very rapidly as the consumers fashion taste is changing, and we see our opportunity really, being in up-sell with the customer, or in trying to take advantage of trend. That's the second thing, I think, we've done a very good job on. Again, whether it was backpacks, whether it was crossbodies, saddlebags. We also did a great job with our active footwear. I mean, it's no secret some of big athletic companies are doing very, very well. And we've been on that trend for the last 2 years. And that category is growing significantly for us. So I think what our customer is responding to is we've got the right fashion for them at the right time. We've got really well-trained associates, and these associates, quite frankly, know how to up-sell in terms of the multiple items to get that transaction value up, which is helping in our total conversion rates inside the store. Does that help?"

First off, we love our partners, whether it's Macy's or Dillard's or Lord & Taylor's or Bloomingdale's or Saks or Neimans or Harrods or Selfridges or Takashimaya. The wholesale channel is phenomenal. Department stores are phenomenal. They carry amazing brands inside these channels and I think that the theory that this channel is a channel that's going away is not a very well thought out theory. That channel is like every channel in retail today, is being challenged because the consumer is shopping differently. And as they shop differently, quite frankly, they're smarter. They have the ability to see things online, a lot more assortment, a lot more selection. They can compare side-by-side. They can compare pricing online. So what we just believe is that, that channel is going to figure out how to manage its growth over the next 12 to 24 months, as many of us are. And we think it's better to have less inventory in there, to have less promotions, which will keep the brand integrity at a higher level. And our partners are very supportive of this. We also want to turn our inventories faster for them and for us. And we think the better we look to our end consumer and not confusing them with different promotional activities at different levels, the better it is for the brand long term. So as I said in our prepared remarks, we believe that channel is going to be down on a go-forward basis for us. And we'll make that up more so in our retail stores, our e-commerce, expansions in certain marketplaces, and then ultimately long term, where, as we've said in the past, we're looking at certain other licenses that we may or may not bring in-house. Our men's business growth. So we have plenty of opportunity for us to grow. It doesn't all have to be pushed. And that's what we're afraid of. We don't want to push too hard because we think that could damage the brand long term."

And I think I said in the last quarterly call that we are hoping, believe, think, wish, whatever you want to say, that we start to lap this in June, July, August of next year. We saw the small bag trend happening. It really started happening 2 years ago. We think we're a bit more up against that, or there will be less of a headwind for us. There's no guarantees on that. Again, it's just going to depend on the trends that are happening. You even see in money pieces now are getting smaller because again people are -- as more things end up on your phone, you need less things in your wallet. So that's just a fact. So actually, a much -- smaller money pieces are accelerating even faster than our larger money pieces. So we are seeing it across the board. In terms of the promotional activity, look, there's no question that the -- our third quarter or the retailer fourth quarter had more promotional activity inside of it. I wouldn't say there was more events, I would just say there was a lot more markdowns related to clearing inventories as everyone wanted to be clean to start the year. We had terribly unseasonably warm weather, which really affected everyone in the business. And not just things like boots and coats, which everybody talks about, but when people aren't going to do the stores because it's 60 degrees outside on the day before Christmas,it just got a psychological halo that we really think affected the business in North America. So I think people got healthy with inventories, and I think that was a very good thing for us to start out the spring season."

First off, we don't disclose the various categories in detail like that. The watch business remained difficult during the quarter. I would say that as in the prepared remarks, we really saw something very interesting. We saw, when we put newness on the table, the customer responded very, very positively. So you're going to see something from us in spring. We have one of the largest new assortments of watches coming in our history, and that's going to be led by slim watches. We think there's a very, very big fashion trend towards slim. So Michael Kors will be pushing that in a very significant way. And we think that's one of the key issues. We probably we didn't have enough newness out there, I told you that in previous calls. We think we've addressed that this spring season. And secondly, clearly, consumers are just wearing less watches because of what a smartphone will do for you, and the fact that people are glued to their phone and they use that for more of a timepiece. I think, and I believe, Kosta Kartsotis and Fossil thinks as well, that the smartwatch technology is actually going to revolutionize the fashion watch business. I think over the next 5 to 10 years, most fashion watches will be sold with some type of smartwatch technology in it. So we're super excited. We'll be announcing our whole program at Basel in March, with a launch in-store in August. And watch out. We're a very competitive group, Fossil and Michael Kors, and we see big opportunity in a category that is today in the billions of dollars. That being, not only smartwatches but other connected accessories as well, and we tend on competing and competing at a very high level."

The AUR is going to move up a little bit in products because as we add materialization and as we add embellishments and as we do different things to the product to enhance it. We actually want to move the AUR up a little bit. Michael and I were talking last night, it's sol funny. When a customer sees amazing design and understands that, that is something that's different, we don't have any problem with selling the pricing of it. And I think as an industry, we probably got a little too focused on the $300 handbag price points. So again, it's not that we're jumping into saying that our business is now going to be $700, which, by the way, we have that category today in our stores because we have our Michael Kors Collection bags in the stores. But we think that the customers looking, just like we said in watches, they're looking for something that's more exciting, and that's why we've invited you all to come up to the showrooms in the next couple of weeks, to see the product. Because Oliver, if I may say, when I read a lot of the reports, everyone said that Michael Kors is ubiquitous. Michael Kors is over distributed. Michael Kors is this, that, and the other thing. And the truth is that we keep growing, and the customer keeps responding. And the customer is voting not only yes in dollars, but she's voting yes in units. So what we're going to stay committed to is great design. There is going to be some elevation in the AUR. In terms of additional space in the store, no. What we'll probably going to do is take a little less of our basics and probably wind those -- pull those back a little bit and increase fashion a little bit more, which, again, customer's saying yes. She wants something new not only from us, but from our competitors as well. I'm talking from the luxury European competitors are seeing the exact same thing. So it's right for trend, its right for the business, and its right for inspire our customer."

As you can see, when you really look at our income statement, the revenues continue to grow inside the company. We're making sequential improvement in comp store sales. So hopefully, a bit of the naysayers who say that our brand is ubiquitous, over distributed, et cetera, some of that hopefully will -- you'll get comfortable with the fact that Michael Kors brand is still very strong, growing and developing, both in North America and globally. That being said, our expense, our SG&A is actually rising slightly quicker than our sales, which is something that we're working on. And that's being driven by a number of different projects, as you know, that we were investing in. And also we have anticipated a much higher top line, in particular, because of the FX change. So in terms of -- we're about halfway through the development of our Venlo project, which is a very, very expensive endeavor for us, a million square-foot facility in the Netherlands to support our $1 billion-plus business in Europe. And the fact that we're going to be launching, ultimately in 22 countries our online. We want to have -- really have the best-in-class facility to be able to handle that and not have to keep upsizing the way that we did in Los Angeles, which was a bit painful for us. So that project will be finished somewhere around August, September, October. And we really won't get leverage from that in the first year. Actually, we will -- that will go against us as we learn to operate the facility, et cetera. But again, as we've told you, we're a luxury business investing for the future. So we're not -- if we don't make these investments, we're not going to have a company that's going to be sustainable long term. So that's the first big investment. Secondly, as we bring up e-commerce around the world, and quite frankly, move sales from brick-and-mortar to e-commerce, we have the expense of bringing up e-commerce, all the systemic issues. We're hiring staff well in advance of having any revenues, so all these are going as negative headwinds. And then unfortunately, today, e-commerce generates a lower opening profit for us than four wall brick-and-mortar. We think over time that will reverse itself. But, as you know, when the consumer requires free delivery, free return, wonderful packaging plus there's a new trend that people are buying multiple sizes of things, to try them at home and then return them. That all is a negative headwind for us. So I would say that we're again, about halfway through our investment in -- to be able to have our entire network built-out in terms of global e-commerce. And then we're here finishing out our corporate headquarters, which, again you'll see in a couple of weeks, which was a very significant project for us. We said that we wanted to look, feel and act like a digital company. I think you're going to be very impressed when you see what we've done here. It's great for recruiting the best in the industry, it's great for employee retention. And I think we did it in a way that was very reasonable given where we are in our building and how we were able to execute that. So those are the 3 big projects. We've got some minor things, as you know, that are headwinds for us. We brought Korea in-house, that's going to be negative for the first couple of years. We've got our joint ventures in South America that, unfortunately, will be a negative for us as we deal with some of the headwinds down there. And men's will be negative for us for the next couple of years. Again, if we don't make these investments, we're not going to build a long-term company and have it sustainable. So we believe that going forward, SG&A still will slightly outpace sales, and we hope to get that probably turned around in our fiscal '18, but it will not be in fiscal '17 at this point. So hopefully that gives you some color on that question."

However, when you think about CapEx, our $400 million CapEx for the current fiscal year is a peak CapEx, and we will be thinking in terms of decreasing that CapEx spend significantly going forward. In terms of the hedges, I can't give you any definitive answer to that. Our hedges are typically 9 months to a year out. They are -- they relate to operations that we operate in non-U.S. currencies, where our purchasing  inventory in U.S. dollars. And we talked about that in prior quarters. As those hedges roll-off, we, of course, are entering new hedges, but there will be more to spot rate when they roll off. And so that's just contributing to -- that will increase inventory costs, and therefore, have a headwind in terms of the gross margin."

So Don is somebody who walks in the door, hits the ground running, doesn't miss a beat, has great leadership and merchant qualities. And so as far as we're concerned, really nothing has changed at all. And, as you know, we are really excited about Marcel Ostwald joining the company, and I can't tell you how thrilled you're going to be to see the men's product when you walk in the door. And I'm very excited for when you all come visit because for the first time, normally, it's always the female analysts who are oohing and aahing. This time, we're going to have hopefully have a few men oohing and aahing at our walk through. So we feel good. The men's business, we've said before, is $1 billion opportunity for the company. And we've said -- about 1/3 of that roughly will come from men's sportswear, about 1/3 of that will come from Men's Leather, and about 1/3 of that will come from watches, maybe a little less from watches. But we kind of broke that down in that area. The watches, we obviously won't report the revenue inside of our company, but we'll report the royalties in that chart. We are well on track with all of our North American partners in constructing shops. So we'll be in all the best stores again, whether that's Saks, Bloomingdale's, Macy's, Dillard's, Lord & Taylor, they're either up or under construction or are going forward. I have to say that some of the new products have just hit retail in the last week. Marcel was just barely able to touch some of that and the sell-throughs have been terrific. And we're really going to see the big impact this come fall season. We're also in the 150-plus stores today already in Europe. So the distribution is there. We have beautiful shops in Harrods, in Selfridges and at Peek & Cloppenburg, and in El Corte Inglés, et cetera. And the European community is really supportive of that. I just came back from Asia, 2 weeks ago. We have some very significant plants about rolling that business out. Again, that will be a department-store-driven business, but with shop-in-shops that will actually -- we'll count those as stores. Remember, we count concessions in our store counts. So when I give you that 500 store count globally, that includes concessions as well inside that number. So internally, inside the company, we're really excited about it, big opportunity. And there really hasn't been a major new menswear business launched in 20 years in terms of significant across all categories that I think our wholesale partners can get behind in a big way. So we're excited to be a part of that. And then we have the freestanding store opportunities/stores that will be connected to our existing stores. And we think that's going to be a big opportunity. One last call out, I will tell you that in our stores over the holiday season what really surprised us is leather accounted for close to 40% of sales inside the stores that opened. And again, they were only open for a couple of months and it was during the holiday season, but we were really shocked by the strength of our business in leather and really bodes well for the development of that category."

So while unfortunately, we've seen the watch category decline, we're seeing the jewelry category increase. One of the things that we're going to do in our own stores for the spring of 2017, and you've heard me talk about this kind of last year more that while we love to introduce new in the jewelry category, unfortunately that drove the AUR of the total jewelry and watch category down for us because we were selling $150 bracelet or an $85 pair of earrings versus a $225 watch. So that really hurt us. And again, I think sometimes, when people are looking at the business, they don't -- they think it's all handbags that's driving the comp up and down, but in a lot of cases that's not really, actually the issue. So we kind of hurt ourselves a little bit with that. So what we're going to do is we will exit most of the fashion jewelry line in the spring of '17 from our own stores, and we will introduce a more fine jewelry line inside of our own stores, really bringing it closer to the watch AUR, not completely, but it will be -- it will have gold, it'll have silver, will have plated materials as well, 18-karat plated, et cetera. And we're going to really elevate that whole category inside of our store, and there'll be select retail partners that we will allow also to carry that. But it's going to be very limited distribution, and we think it's a big opportunity for us to trade up the AURs in the store. Going back to the original question that Kimberly and Omar were talking about is, as traffic declines in these stores, we all have to be focused on conversion. And how can we -- we're not going to raise our AURs by 25% and 30% and 40%. But if you can get your AUR up 5% or 10%, that's going to make a big difference, and we're going to be doing that not only in our own stores, but looking at the department store channel as well on the specialty store channel and really take advantage of that. The second question you asked, we don't break out the percentage of -- for advertising. The only thing I can tell you is that we will continue to support that part of our business. As you know, we have, first off, the greatest voice in the fashion industry with Michael himself. We have the greatest PR, marketing and digital team, we think, in the industry, and I said in the prepared remarks, every single channel, social channel, we increased whether it's fans, followers, et cetera, and that really speaks volumes to what's happening with our advertising and marketing and the way that our teams are handing that. And again, we're going to be very proactive not only on existing channels but as we've done in the past, we've been really a leader in looking at new channels as they emerge and how we can have a voice in them."

We don't give guidance on that yet. We'll do that in June. But we have, between our licensed partners and ourselves, we have about 860 stores worldwide.

But we have, between our licensed partners and ourselves, we have about 860 stores worldwide. And out of that 860 stores, in the Americas, we have about 400 stores. That includes Canada, Latin America, United States, et cetera. So we're kind of getting built and finished with our store rollout. In North America, in particular, it's going to be very few stores. We told you many years ago, and I know many people have not loved the fact that I've held very steadfast to the number. We told you we were going to build 400 stores in North America. And many people have asked me over and over again, why are you doing that? And we've said we're going to keep building 400 stores in North America. And we will finish that build out. The Americas got a little bit larger as a number because it now includes Latin America. So maybe it will be 425 or 430 or something like that. Whatever it is, we're pretty much done with our build out in this region of the world. Europe will continue to accelerate. In that marketplace, we have 171 of our own stores, and then we have a number with -- in Russia, et cetera. And again, we believe that, that marketplace will have in excess of 200 stores, we've said that in the past. And then Asia is a place where we think, we have a lot of opportunity. So all in all, we've said about 1,000 stores is where we think we'll be as a company, and that includes our license partners. So we have 150 or so to go. That does not include Men's. We've said that Men's will be something that will be a plus for us. So again -- and the last thing I just want to say is, again, I believe the -- we make a lot of money in four-wall in the stores. We also believe that, while e-commerce one day will end up being 20% or 30% of our business, it's not going to be 100%. So stores are not going away. They're not dying, and we need stores to service communities and people. And then also, I think, as you become omni, you really have a distinct advantage in having stores. So I'll give you a good example. Our return rates on e-commerce are running very low. But a number of those returns are coming back to stores. And it actually gives us an opportunity to interact with the customer, and we have seen evidence where we're actually not only taking the return, but trading the customer up and creating even a better experience with the customer. So again, we embraced omni, we embraced our retail flagships and our retail fleet that we have today. And we will finish the build out and get ourselves to the approximately 1,000 stores."

I think that's a little bit off the table. We've got a handful of stores that we did expand already. I don't have the exact number in front of me but it's probably in the 30-plus or 40-plus range. Those -- we're pleased with what happened with those stores. What we need to see is we're going to reconfigure a number of existing stores, as I mentioned earlier, to increase the footwear space inside those stores. We're really happy with what's happening with footwear. And we think it's another reason for the customer to come in and shop with us, et cetera. So we've got to see how that plays out. I want to remind everyone that as we increase our women's ready-to-wear and our women's footwear business, both in wholesale and in retail, that has an impact on our margin for 2 reasons: Number one, we have lower margins going in; and number two, their size businesses. And when you have size businesses, you have markdowns that are greater than what you run, and handbags aren't really sized and watches aren't really sized. So it will help us grow the top line. And ultimately, we think, it will help us grow the consumer experience. But as Joe indicated before, gross margins are kind of be flattish in the zone of where they are today, looking out going forward, impacted a little bit by what's going to happen with shoes and bags and even menswear has lower gross margins as well."

But as we've said in the past, we're a company that has an amazing operating model. We have I think, the second or third highest operating margins in the world, in luxury, compared to the European luxury operators, et cetera. We're going to end this year somewhere around 25% operating margins, which really is extraordinary. And we generate a lot of cash, and we've been very aggressive about buying back stock because we feel that the market, if I may say that, has misunderstood our story and our potential and our long-term vision and our success quite frankly. So we are going to continue to be very aggressive given what we think is a dislocation of where our multiple is versus the rest of the industry. And I might remind everyone that we will end the year with top line growth and bottom line growth, which is very unusual for many, many players in the luxury industry. Pardon me if I bang the drum for Michael Kors for a minute. The line of credit is there for a number of different reasons. First, it's there, again, if we continue to see dislocations, we may or may not decide to even get more aggressive with our buyback purchases. As Joe said before, we have $580 million left on our authorization, but our board feels very strongly in making sure that we continue to return value to shareholders. Secondly, the line is there to look at potential licenses. We have a number of them that could be brought back in-house. And again, when we think that those are in a strategic place for us or are going to be accretive for us, we will act upon that. As you said before, we're very pleased with what's happening in China for us. And even though Hong Kong and Macau remain difficult, we had double-digit comp store increase even with Hong Kong and Macau being difficult. I mean, what does that tell you about the brand? The brand is strong, resonating, customer is very excited about what's happening with our product in that marketplace. So we like that and as we said in the prepared comments, she's shopping around the world with us not just in the mainland China marketplace as you know. Well over 50% of luxury goods is purchased outside of the mainland. And the third purpose for the line is and we said it in our last call is when and if a strategic acquisition is something that we think fits with our company's short-term and/or long-term objectives, we may very well act. So we have an incredible balance sheet. We have an incredible cash flow generation, and we have the ammunition to do a lot of different things to continue to generate revenue and earnings per share growth for the long term. Joe, do you want to add anything about the balance sheet?"

November and December just got better for us as we went through the quarter. And we saw -- what we really were pleased about was our full price stores. She came in, she shopped, she shopped for gifts and I said to you earlier that we saw sequential improvement. She liked what product we were offering her and she had a lot of choices out there in the marketplace and not only she had lot of choices. She had a lot of choices at a lot of prices. So we were particularly pleased with that. And again, we spend so much time talking about North America, North America. We're doing 30% of our business now approximately internationally. And we really like what we saw happening in Europe, and Asia is continuing to just build momentum. So as you think of this company long term, and this will be my concluding remarks, we always knew that North America would be a marketplace that ultimately would reach a point where we have lower growth. That's where we are today. We're still growing in the marketplace. And we're still taking market share, which, again, I hope you recognize given our results. So we think that really resonates for the brand well. Europe, still good opportunity for us to develop stores. Wholesale shop-in-shops there, and many marketplaces where we're still underpenetrated. Asia is wide open for us. We still are super underpenetrated in Korea, Japan, China and in certain places in Southeast Asia. So when you think about Michael Kors, think about growth. It's not going to be double-digit growth, those days are behind us. But we're going to have solid growth going forward, and in the luxury industry today, I think there's not a lot of companies that can stand up and say that and keep delivering on that quarter after quarter.

Good morning, and welcome to Michael Kors' third quarter fiscal 2016 earnings call. 
I'm pleased to report that our revenues, comparable store sales and earnings per share results for the third quarter exceeded our expectations, which speaks to the enduring strength of the Michael Kors luxury brand, in particular, during the all-important holiday season. We know that consumers have a lot of choices when it comes to what brands they purchase. And the fact that they chose Michael Kors is a great testament to our world-class design team, strong product offering and the lasting connection that we have fostered with our customers. 
For the quarter, total revenue increased 6% on a reported basis. In constant currency, total revenue increased 10% driven by growth across segments and geographies. Earnings per share increased 7% to $1.59 on a reported basis, and on a constant-currency basis, earnings per share grew 11%. 
Our Retail business delivered solid results across all geographies driven by strong double-digit sales growth in our digital flagship business and new store openings. On a constant-currency basis, global comparable store sales increased 2%, which was ahead of our expectations and marked another quarter of sequential improvement. Importantly, while mall traffic in North America declined, we saw a significant increase in conversion rates in our own retail stores, which further illustrates the strength of the Michael Kors brand. On a constant-currency basis, comp store sales rose in the low single digits in North America and Europe, and in the high double digits in Japan. While our wholesale business was roughly flat for the quarter on a reported basis, we delivered results above our expectations despite the challenging and highly promotional retail environment. In fact, while the North American department store channel was challenged, we believe our results continued to outpace the overall channel performance, which enabled us to further strengthen our leadership position in this channel. Internationally, European wholesale sales grew 4% on a reported basis and almost 20% on a constant-currency basis, and we saw 26% growth in our Asian wholesale business. 
We also achieved solid growth in our licensing business. While the overall watch category remains challenged during the third quarter, we were excited to see favorable response to the newness that we introduced into our watch offering as well as our jewelry assortment. In watches, navy, sable and black platings as well as colored leather straps proved to be sought-after additions in our collection. Customers also responded well to our updated jewelry offering, with particular strength in the padlock, parts and disc motifs. And our watch and bracelet gift sets were strong sellers during the season. Our fragrance collections for women as well as men's fragrance also proved to be great gifts with our customers who are shopping for family and friends or looking to treat themselves to something special. We were also pleased to see strong growth of our fragrance offering in the travel retail channel worldwide. In addition, we continue to see very positive response to our eyewear collections and are happy that our new partnership in this category has been such a strong success. 
Turning to our product categories. We were pleased with the performance of our accessories business, where we injected new styles that contributed to strong growth and market share gains in the quarter. Total accessory sales on a retail basis grew at a high single digit rate globally and a mid-single digit rate in North America, demonstrating our leadership in this category, especially against a difficult retail backdrop. The demand for smaller-sized bags, crossbodies and small leather goods continued to impact AUR in the quarter. However, we again saw a high double-digit increase in units sold, proving that customers continue to seek out Michael Kors luxury accessories. Footwear sales were also strong during the quarter driven by our fashion active category. Unfortunately, the unseasonably warm weather hurt boot sales, which negatively impacted our footwear margins and AUR. Overall, our new merchandise assortment for holiday reflected the latest designs from Michael and our design team and spotlighted modern glamor, easy elegance and sport lux essentials. The updated silhouettes as well as our gifting assortment resonated well with customers globally and our #JustBecause marketing campaign proved very successful in connecting our customers with just the right gift for everyone on their shopping list. 
Looking ahead, we remain focused on executing our key strategic initiatives that will drive us towards our long-term growth targets. First and foremost, we remain committed to delivering luxury products that embodies fashion, design innovation and the Michael Kors luxury brand DNA. 
As we look to the spring season, we will be introducing our largest assortment of new handbag groups created to inspire our customers with exciting new trends. Our collections will underscore Michael's fashion leadership with an offering that reflects new color pallets, innovative materials, embellishment, mixed-media in leather, luxurious textures and elegant silhouettes across product categories. In footwear, the fashion active category remains one of our highest growing areas, and we expect to leverage this trend in the spring. We are also capturing the denim trend in our accessories and apparel assortments, which are featured in our new national advertising ad campaigns. We have begun to evolve our advertising campaigns to reflect the glamorous destinations and inspirational moments of the modern Michael Kors customer. Our integrated marketing programs with compelling digital and social media campaigns delivered through desktop and mobile devices as well as traditional print, billboard and target marketing are designed to extend our reach, allowing us to engage consumers with our brand, immerse them in the Michael Kors Lifestyle and encourage them to shop our sites and stores. 
In our retail business, we continue to develop our digital flagship strategy globally, at a rapid pace and build upon our omnichannel capabilities. We have digital platforms in place, in the U.S. and Canada, and we are on track to launch in 6 European countries this fall and an additional 16 countries in Europe thereafter. 
Importantly, we are working to seamlessly integrate the consumer shopping experience across all touch points. We are taking steps to enhance our mobile shopping experience and expect to see the benefits of these measures over the coming months. We will also begin to leverage our analytics and CRM capabilities to share Michael's message with consumers through various communication vehicles and to present and tailor our styling to the individual customer. Overall, our digital flagship strategy is enabling us to engage consumers with our luxury lifestyle brand and provide a best-in-class shopping experience. As you know, we have a strong and influential online presence as consumers turn to Michael Kors for fashion insights, and we continue to see our fan base grow across all social media platforms, further demonstrating the power of our brand. In addition, we remain focused on expanding our global retail footprint, and we will continue to open flagship locations in key cities around the world to drive revenues and brand recognition. Our latest flagship opened this past November in the Ginza district in Tokyo, and we will be opening new flagships in London, Seoul and Singapore this coming year. These locations not only enable us to present the most expansive collection of our fashion product, including both our collection and lifestyle offerings as well as men's products in select locations, but also showcase the Michael Kors luxury DNA for consumers worldwide. Internationally, we completed the integration of our Korean business in January and are excited about the retail growth potential in this market. Lastly, we continue to extend our men's presence at retail, both with standalone stores as well as through the addition of our men's offering in our existing lifestyle stores in North America, Europe and Asia. We opened 4 men's location this quarter in Scottsdale Fashion Square in Arizona, Memorial City in Houston, Garden State Plaza in New Jersey and San Francisco Center in California. And we are pleased with the initial consumer response. By the end of this fiscal year, we expect our full men's assortment to be available on 11 locations, and we continue to believe there's a potential for up to 500 locations worldwide. 
In our wholesale channel, we expect moderately lower sales growth. As we have stated previously, we will be managing our North American wholesale inventory to ensure that we maintain the integrity of our brand. We see continued sales growth internationally from the expansion of our accessories, womenswear and footwear business and the development of our men's category. We remain particularly excited about the expansion of our men's business in wholesale, and are on track to open 75 men's shop-in-shops globally this year. 
Importantly, we continue to believe that this is a significant new category for the company, and I am confident that we can develop this business and become a leading men's luxury brand. 
In licensing, we are excited about the continued growth opportunity of our fragrance and eyewear categories and the newness in the watch category as we continue to introduce updated watch styles and launch our new connected fashion line later this year. As we look at consumer trends, we believe that connected accessories will reshape the fashion watch business globally. Michael Kors is known for being at the forefront of the fashion watch category, and we expect to quickly emerge as a leader in connected fashion as well. 
Turning to our regional licenses. We remain focused on expanding our presence across Asia, which represents a significant growth opportunity for our company. In Greater China, we continue to see an increase in brand acceptance, as evidenced by another quarter of double-digit comp store sales growth. As the Chinese consumers' desire for our brand builds, we are capturing this demand, both in the region and as they travel globally through our airport locations worldwide and in areas such as Japan, Korea and Europe. We look forward to our continued global expansion through our strong regional partnerships and growing demand for our luxury brands. 
In summary, we are pleased with the success we achieved in the third quarter, with an excellent holiday season driven by a luxury fashion product assortment, strength of our digital flagships and sequential improvement in our comparable store sales as well as continued success of our wholesale business. Our results demonstrate the sustained demand for our luxury fashion products globally and the market leadership of the Michael Kors brand. 
Now let me turn it over to Joe for a detailed review of our third quarter financial results and our outlook."

We are pleased to report financial results above our guidance for the third quarter. Total revenue grew 6.3% to $1.4 billion. On a constant-currency basis, total revenue grew 9.9% driven by increases across the Americas, Europe and Japan of 1.4%, 29.1% and 68% respectively. In our retail segment, net sales increased 11.1%. In constant currency, retail net sales increased 15.7% driven by the opening of 114 net new stores since the third quarter of last year and strong performance of our digital flagships. We saw a marginal decline in comps of 0.9% on a reported basis. On a constant-currency basis, comp store sales increased 2.0% reflecting a sequential improvement from the second quarter of our total comp as well as our retail store comp and outperformance versus our guidance. The increase is attributable to positive comp store sales in North America, Europe and Japan as consumers respond favorably to our luxury product offering. Our U.S. digital flagship sales contributed 360 basis points to our overall comp performance in the quarter on a constant-currency basis. In our wholesale segment, net sales grew 0.3%. On a constant-currency basis, wholesale sales increased 3.0% driven primarily by our footwear category and strong growth in international markets. In our licensing segment, revenue increased 8.4% driven primarily by higher licensing revenues related to sales of jewelry and eyewear as well as higher international licensing revenue. We opened 52 new watch and jewelry shop-in-shops during the quarter and ended the quarter with 362 shop-in-shops globally. 
Gross margin declined 140 basis points to 59.5%, which includes a 95 basis point foreign currency translation and transaction impact. The decline in gross margin reflects a 310 basis point decline in retail gross margins, primarily due to additional markdowns. A 50 basis point decline in wholesale gross margins, primarily due to additional wholesale allowances partially offset by higher licensing gross margin dollars. Total operating expenses grew 10.7%. The increase in SG&A was due to higher retail occupancy and salary costs related to new store openings and included higher e-commerce expenses and an increase in corporate-related expenses. The increase in depreciation expense was primarily due to the opening of retail stores, new shop-in-shops, an increase in lease rights related to our new European stores and investments in our corporate facilities and IT infrastructure. 
As a percent of total revenue, total operating expenses increased 120 basis points to 30.2%. This was below the 200 to 240 basis points of deleverage in our guidance, primarily due to better-than-expected sales in the quarter. 
Income from operations was $409.3 million or 29.3% of total revenue as compared to 31.8% of total revenue in the same period last year. 
Retail opening -- operating margin declined 340 basis points due to the decline of retail gross margins as discussed earlier, and a 30 basis point increase in operating expenses attributed to higher store-related costs and depreciation expense, largely offset by lower distribution and general expenses. 
Wholesale operating margin declined 180 basis points due to the decline in wholesale gross margin, as discussed earlier, and a 130 basis point increase in operating expenses attributed to increased distribution costs, selling cost and depreciation expense partially offset by lower general expenses. 
Licensing margin increased 60 basis points due to lower operating expenses, including advertising costs, partially offset by higher costs associated with intellectual property protection as we take action against counterfeit activity globally. 
Income taxes were $114.4 million in the quarter. And our effective tax rate was 28.0% as compared to 27.2% in the same period last year. The increase in our effective tax rate was primarily due to the absence of the prior year favorable settlement of certain instruments in connection with our international structuring, partly offset by the increase in taxable income in certain non-U.S. subsidiaries, which are subject to lower tax rates. 
Net income was $294.6 million for the third quarter, and diluted earnings per share were $1.59. The unfavorable currency impact on EPS was $0.06 per share. 
Turning to the balance sheet. At the end of the quarter, cash and cash equivalents was $696.8 million. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 4.7 million shares, totaling $200 million under our share repurchase program, and we have another $558.1 million of availability remaining. There are no outstanding borrowings under our credit facility at the end of the quarter in either year. Inventory increased 9.5% versus last year, slightly ahead of revenue growth and in line with our expectation. As discussed in our last call, the change in foreign exchange rates continued to impact our European inventory, and we are now recording incremental inventory related to the consolidation of MK Panama. We expect our growth in inventory to continue to outpace our growth in sales as we open new retail stores and shop-in-shops, expand our digital flagships and further develop our men's business. We also expect that the exchange rate differential and the MK Panama consolidation, in addition to the transition of the Korean business in-house, will continue to impact inventory levels until we anniversary these events. 
Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $96.8 million and were related to the build-out of new retail stores and shop-in-shops as well as investments in our distribution facilities, our corporate offices and other infrastructure improvements. We added 34 new stores in the third quarter, 15 in the Americas, 16 in Europe and 3 in Japan. In addition, we expanded or relocated 8 stores and converted 79 wholesale doors into shop-in-shops globally. 
Turning to our outlook. For the fourth quarter, we expect total revenue to be between $1.13 billion and $1.15 billion, which includes approximately $36 million of additional sales due to our 53rd week. On a constant-currency basis, total revenue is expected to increase in the high single digit range assuming an impact of approximately $20 million from the change in foreign currency rates. We expect comp store sales to be flat on a reported basis and to increase in the low single digits in constant currency driven by growth of our U.S. digital sales, the introduction of new innovative product offerings for spring 2016 and diminishing FX headwinds. However, we anticipate lower revenues in our licensing business during the quarter due to lower watch sales and a decrease in revenue related to eyewear as we anniversary our launch with Luxottica and the final quarter of shipments from Marcel last year. We expect international gross margin to remain under pressure in the fourth quarter as favorable hedging contracts we entered into last year expire. Operating expenses as a percentage of total revenue is expected to increase 190 basis points to 220 basis points. We expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.93 to $0.97 assuming a tax rate of approximately 27.5% and 182.5 million shares outstanding. We expect foreign currency to impact net income by approximately $3 million and EPS by approximately $0.02 for the fourth quarter. For the full fiscal year, our outlook for revenue and EPS remains unchanged. We expect revenue of approximately $4.65 billion on a reported basis. On a constant-currency basis, total revenue is expected to increase in the low double-digit range, assuming an impact of approximately $180 million from the change in foreign currency rates. We expect a mid-single digit comp store decrease on a reported basis and a low single digit decrease in constant currency. 
Operating expense as a percentage of total revenue is expected to increase by approximately 230 basis points for the year. We expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $4.38 to $4.42 for the year, assuming a tax rate of approximately 28.5% and 190 million shares outstanding. We expect foreign currency to impact net income by approximately $38 million and EPS by approximately $0.20 for the year. 
I will now turn the call back to John for closing remarks."

And then Europe also, I think a little bit of a positive surprise just given what we've heard from others. The fact that it's still running positive on a constant-currency basis. Are you seeing disparate results across various countries in Europe, and maybe you can talk, in particular, about the wholesale piece, which was a real source, I think, of upside surprise."

And those were driven by, first, traffic; and second, conversion. Again, what we see happening is customers are starting their shopping experience, as you all know, digitally, or mobily first. And so the mobile traffic that we're getting to the site, it just keeps accelerating every single month. And we think we've got some real opportunities to even take that to another level. So we're extremely pleased with the traffic that we saw there. And we're also just pleased with the fact that certain categories, and I might add, footwear, in particular, is seeing a huge lift on e-commerce. Again, we're able to represent a much greater assortment of products that we are actually in many of our own stores, which has been a really interesting finding for us and is leading us to look at our stores today currently. And we're going to be expanding the footwear areas inside of our own stores to capitalize on what the consumer is really telling us given what she's seeing online. So again, we like what's happening there, and we think that's just going to continue to grow. And again sequentially, that will not grow as fast as you've seen over the past year or so, but the sheer dollar number is quite impressive. I might also add that even with the lift in e-commerce, we actually saw sequential improvement in comp stores in just the stores themselves in sales. And again, that was driven, as I said earlier, by conversion. The conversion rates are getting very, very high inside the stores. And I want to give a very big New York shout out to our thousands of sales associates all over the world, who I think did an amazing job. We had a great holiday season. First and foremost, because of Michael's design teams and the product that they put together, but we've got thousands and thousands of people who have jet-set training and continue even with declining traffic in shopping malls to really deliver for us and for the consumers that they serve. So real kudos to them. In terms of Europe, we were generally pleased with the quarter. I have to be honest with you. There was a couple of areas of softness as you can be well aware, and France was a very difficult market for us after the events that happened there. And again, the whole -- it wasn't just Paris that was affected, remember, we're a very strong brand across many of the areas, and people were really not in a mood to shop. We were affected in Belgium, Belgium as well. And then the other place that we felt some softness is in the UK. And we've been feeling that. We've been talking about that really since last year, and that's been the euro-dollar exchange, and also the Russians not coming there as much as they did and some of the Middle Easterners as well. So that market's been a little more challenged for us. That all being said, we're seeing an actual acceleration in the business as we kick off the fourth quarter, which we're very excited about. And we think that some of the new product reads, we told you that in the last quarter, as we saw some of the new products hitting the stores, the reaction was quite strong. And again, the other thing that we're seeing happen in Europe, like we saw in America 3 years ago, some of the e-commerce penetrations with our partners, whether that's Harrods or Selfridges or other accounts in the marketplaces, is really accelerating very quickly. And so we're very pleased with what's happening in the European market and continue to see lots of growth there."

I know you touched on it in response to Kimberly's questions in the prepared remarks. But is it a new phenomenon, this kind of accelerating conversion? And is it -- do you feel like it's firmly tied to the development of the digital platform, in-store training are there other factors driving this? Because you've got exposure to these channels that a lot of other companies, retailers are struggling, tourist markets, mall channel and outlets, et cetera. Maybe we can dive in a little bit deeper and understand what's driving that conversion and how much more opportunity there is to use conversion to drive the comps?"

We believe that mall traffic in North America is going to continue to decline.

We believe that mall traffic in North America is going to continue to decline. And the reason for that is again, we think that people in North America are a bit more savvy when it comes to digital shopping. And just been more cultural year for a longer period of time, and you have big companies who are quite strong at it. And we've seen that both in our own stores, and you can see that through our wholesale partners as well, where digital is just becoming a bigger piece of the business. We haven't seen that yet in Asia, where mall traffic continues to be still pretty good. And Europe, I'd say, mall traffic is kind of average. We haven't seen the deceleration that we saw in the United States. And in the United States, again, we attribute it primarily to digital shopping for people. The reason why the conversion is climbing, I think, is twofold. Number one, just as a percent of total, obviously, if your traffic is down and your sales are trending up, you're going to -- it's going to come usually through conversion, not necessarily through ticket climbing so high. But the second thing is we've really worked hard with our teams inside the stores. We told you in our prepared remarks that the smaller bags in the AURs, that's the reality of fashion. We were one of the first people that jumped on that. And we believe that the global market for luxury handbags is approximately flat. But in unit sales, we're up into the very strong double digits. So what does that tell you? That tells you that there are more customers actually buying Michael Kors products than what you look at in the comp store sales. You're comparing comp store sales in dollars, which is, obviously, how we all earn EPS. But in actual units, there's a lot more people buying Michael Kors product and probably some of our other competitors than you're actually seeing. So the category in dollars is roughly flat, but actually in units, it's quite strong. So how do you go after that? Well, we believe that when somebody is coming in and interested in the crossbody, they need a new wallet because the wallet size is smaller in a crossbody versus a mid-sized handbag, where it might be a zip-around continent or things like that. So the market is changing very, very rapidly as the consumers fashion taste is changing, and we see our opportunity really, being in up-sell with the customer, or in trying to take advantage of trend. That's the second thing, I think, we've done a very good job on. Again, whether it was backpacks, whether it was crossbodies, saddlebags. We also did a great job with our active footwear. I mean, it's no secret some of big athletic companies are doing very, very well. And we've been on that trend for the last 2 years. And that category is growing significantly for us. So I think what our customer is responding to is we've got the right fashion for them at the right time. We've got really well-trained associates, and these associates, quite frankly, know how to up-sell in terms of the multiple items to get that transaction value up, which is helping in our total conversion rates inside the store. Does that help?"

First off, we love our partners, whether it's Macy's or Dillard's or Lord & Taylor's or Bloomingdale's or Saks or Neimans or Harrods or Selfridges or Takashimaya. The wholesale channel is phenomenal. Department stores are phenomenal. They carry amazing brands inside these channels and I think that the theory that this channel is a channel that's going away is not a very well thought out theory. That channel is like every channel in retail today, is being challenged because the consumer is shopping differently. And as they shop differently, quite frankly, they're smarter. They have the ability to see things online, a lot more assortment, a lot more selection. They can compare side-by-side. They can compare pricing online. So what we just believe is that, that channel is going to figure out how to manage its growth over the next 12 to 24 months, as many of us are. And we think it's better to have less inventory in there, to have less promotions, which will keep the brand integrity at a higher level. And our partners are very supportive of this. We also want to turn our inventories faster for them and for us. And we think the better we look to our end consumer and not confusing them with different promotional activities at different levels, the better it is for the brand long term. So as I said in our prepared remarks, we believe that channel is going to be down on a go-forward basis for us. And we'll make that up more so in our retail stores, our e-commerce, expansions in certain marketplaces, and then ultimately long term, where, as we've said in the past, we're looking at certain other licenses that we may or may not bring in-house. Our men's business growth. So we have plenty of opportunity for us to grow. It doesn't all have to be pushed. And that's what we're afraid of. We don't want to push too hard because we think that could damage the brand long term."

And I think I said in the last quarterly call that we are hoping, believe, think, wish, whatever you want to say, that we start to lap this in June, July, August of next year. We saw the small bag trend happening. It really started happening 2 years ago. We think we're a bit more up against that, or there will be less of a headwind for us. There's no guarantees on that. Again, it's just going to depend on the trends that are happening. You even see in money pieces now are getting smaller because again people are -- as more things end up on your phone, you need less things in your wallet. So that's just a fact. So actually, a much -- smaller money pieces are accelerating even faster than our larger money pieces. So we are seeing it across the board. In terms of the promotional activity, look, there's no question that the -- our third quarter or the retailer fourth quarter had more promotional activity inside of it. I wouldn't say there was more events, I would just say there was a lot more markdowns related to clearing inventories as everyone wanted to be clean to start the year. We had terribly unseasonably warm weather, which really affected everyone in the business. And not just things like boots and coats, which everybody talks about, but when people aren't going to do the stores because it's 60 degrees outside on the day before Christmas, it just got a psychological halo that we really think affected the business in North America. So I think people got healthy with inventories, and I think that was a very good thing for us to start out the spring season."

First off, we don't disclose the various categories in detail like that. The watch business remained difficult during the quarter. I would say that as in the prepared remarks, we really saw something very interesting. We saw, when we put newness on the table, the customer responded very, very positively. So you're going to see something from us in spring. We have one of the largest new assortments of watches coming in our history, and that's going to be led by slim watches. We think there's a very, very big fashion trend towards slim. So Michael Kors will be pushing that in a very significant way. And we think that's one of the key issues. We probably we didn't have enough newness out there, I told you that in previous calls. We think we've addressed that this spring season. And secondly, clearly, consumers are just wearing less watches because of what a smartphone will do for you, and the fact that people are glued to their phone and they use that for more of a timepiece. I think, and I believe, Kosta Kartsotis and Fossil thinks as well, that the smartwatch technology is actually going to revolutionize the fashion watch business. I think over the next 5 to 10 years, most fashion watches will be sold with some type of smartwatch technology in it. So we're super excited. We'll be announcing our whole program at Basel in March, with a launch in-store in August. And watch out. We're a very competitive group, Fossil and Michael Kors, and we see big opportunity in a category that is today in the billions of dollars.

The AUR is going to move up a little bit in products because as we add materialization and as we add embellishments and as we do different things to the product to enhance it. We actually want to move the AUR up a little bit. Michael and I were talking last night, it's so funny. When a customer sees amazing design and understands that, that is something that's different, we don't have any problem with selling the pricing of it. And I think as an industry, we probably got a little too focused on the $300 handbag price points. So again, it's not that we're jumping into saying that our business is now going to be $700, which, by the way, we have that category today in our stores because we have our Michael Kors Collection bags in the stores. But we think that the customers looking, just like we said in watches, they're looking for something that's more exciting, and that's why we've invited you all to come up to the showrooms in the next couple of weeks, to see the product. Because Oliver, if I may say, when I read a lot of the reports, everyone said that Michael Kors is ubiquitous. Michael Kors is over distributed. Michael Kors is this, that, and the other thing. And the truth is that we keep growing, and the customer keeps responding. And the customer is voting not only yes in dollars, but she's voting yes in units. So what we're going to stay committed to is great design. There is going to be some elevation in the AUR. In terms of additional space in the store, no. What we'll probably going to do is take a little less of our basics and probably wind those -- pull those back a little bit and increase fashion a little bit more, which, again, customer's saying yes.

As you can see, when you really look at our income statement, the revenues continue to grow inside the company. We're making sequential improvement in comp store sales. So hopefully, a bit of the naysayers who say that our brand is ubiquitous, over distributed, et cetera, some of that hopefully will -- you'll get comfortable with the fact that Michael Kors brand is still very strong, growing and developing, both in North America and globally. That being said, our expense, our SG&A is actually rising slightly quicker than our sales, which is something that we're working on. And that's being driven by a number of different projects, as you know, that we were investing in. And also we have anticipated a much higher top line, in particular, because of the FX change. So in terms of -- we're about halfway through the development of our Venlo project, which is a very, very expensive endeavor for us, a million square-foot facility in the Netherlands to support our $1 billion-plus business in Europe. And the fact that we're going to be launching, ultimately in 22 countries our online. We want to have -- really have the best-in-class facility to be able to handle that and not have to keep upsizing the way that we did in Los Angeles, which was a bit painful for us. So that project will be finished somewhere around August, September, October. And we really won't get leverage from that in the first year. Actually, we will -- that will go against us as we learn to operate the facility, et cetera. But again, as we've told you, we're a luxury business investing for the future. So we're not -- if we don't make these investments, we're not going to have a company that's going to be sustainable long term. So that's the first big investment. Secondly, as we bring up e-commerce around the world, and quite frankly, move sales from brick-and-mortar to e-commerce, we have the expense of bringing up e-commerce, all the systemic issues. We're hiring staff well in advance of having any revenues, so all these are going as negative headwinds. And then unfortunately, today, e-commerce generates a lower opening profit for us than four wall brick-and-mortar. We think over time that will reverse itself. But, as you know, when the consumer requires free delivery, free return, wonderful packaging plus there's a new trend that people are buying multiple sizes of things, to try them at home and then return them. That all is a negative headwind for us. So I would say that we're again, about halfway through our investment in -- to be able to have our entire network built-out in terms of global e-commerce. And then we're here finishing out our corporate headquarters, which, again you'll see in a couple of weeks, which was a very significant project for us. We said that we wanted to look, feel and act like a digital company. I think you're going to be very impressed when you see what we've done here. It's great for recruiting the best in the industry, it's great for employee retention. And I think we did it in a way that was very reasonable given where we are in our building and how we were able to execute that. So those are the 3 big projects. We've got some minor things, as you know, that are headwinds for us. We brought Korea in-house, that's going to be negative for the first couple of years. We've got our joint ventures in South America that, unfortunately, will be a negative for us as we deal with some of the headwinds down there. And men's will be negative for us for the next couple of years. Again, if we don't make these investments, we're not going to build a long-term company and have it sustainable. So we believe that going forward, SG&A still will slightly outpace sales, and we hope to get that probably turned around in our fiscal '18, but it will not be in fiscal '17 at this point. So hopefully that gives you some color on that question."

However, when you think about CapEx, our $400 million CapEx for the current fiscal year is a peak CapEx, and we will be thinking in terms of decreasing that CapEx spend significantly going forward. In terms of the hedges, I can't give you any definitive answer to that. Our hedges are typically 9 months to a year out. They are -- they relate to operations that we operate in non-U.S. currencies, where our purchasing  inventory in U.S. dollars. And we talked about that in prior quarters. As those hedges roll-off, we, of course, are entering new hedges, but there will be more to spot rate when they roll off. And so that's just contributing to -- that will increase inventory costs, and therefore, have a headwind in terms of the gross margin."

You may not know this but actually Don ran men's here many, many years ago when we first started it. Don was with me at Donna Karan as well. So Don is somebody who walks in the door, hits the ground running, doesn't miss a beat, has great leadership and merchant qualities. And so as far as we're concerned, really nothing has changed at all. And, as you know, we are really excited about Marcel Ostwald joining the company, and I can't tell you how thrilled you're going to be to see the men's product when you walk in the door. And I'm very excited for when you all come visit because for the first time, normally, it's always the female analysts who are oohing and aahing. This time, we're going to have hopefully have a few men oohing and aahing at our walk through. So we feel good. The men's business, we've said before, is $1 billion opportunity for the company. And we've said -- about 1/3 of that roughly will come from men's sportswear, about 1/3 of that will come from Men's Leather, and about 1/3 of that will come from watches, maybe a little less from watches. But we kind of broke that down in that area. The watches, we obviously won't report the revenue inside of our company, but we'll report the royalties in that chart. We are well on track with all of our North American partners in constructing shops. So we'll be in all the best stores again, whether that's Saks, Bloomingdale's, Macy's, Dillard's, Lord & Taylor, they're either up or under construction or are going forward. I have to say that some of the new products have just hit retail in the last week. Marcel was just barely able to touch some of that and the sell-throughs have been terrific. And we're really going to see the big impact this come fall season. We're also in the 150-plus stores today already in Europe. So the distribution is there. We have beautiful shops in Harrods, in Selfridges and at Peek & Cloppenburg, and in El Corte Inglés, et cetera. And the European community is really supportive of that. I just came back from Asia, 2 weeks ago. We have some very significant plants about rolling that business out. Again, that will be a department-store-driven business, but with shop-in-shops that will actually -- we'll count those as stores. Remember, we count concessions in our store counts. So when I give you that 500 store count globally, that includes concessions as well inside that number. So internally, inside the company, we're really excited about it, big opportunity. And there really hasn't been a major new menswear business launched in 20 years in terms of significant across all categories that I think our wholesale partners can get behind in a big way. So we're excited to be a part of that. And then we have the freestanding store opportunities/stores that will be connected to our existing stores. And we think that's going to be a big opportunity. One last call out, I will tell you that in our stores over the holiday season what really surprised us is leather accounted for close to 40% of sales inside the stores that opened. And again, they were only open for a couple of months and it was during the holiday season, but we were really shocked by the strength of our business in leather and really bodes well for the development of that category."

So while unfortunately, we've seen the watch category decline, we're seeing the jewelry category increase. One of the things that we're going to do in our own stores for the spring of 2017, and you've heard me talk about this kind of last year more that while we love to introduce new in the jewelry category, unfortunately that drove the AUR of the total jewelry and watch category down for us because we were selling $150 bracelet or an $85 pair of earrings versus a $225 watch. So that really hurt us. And again, I think sometimes, when people are looking at the business, they don't -- they think it's all handbags that's driving the comp up and down, but in a lot of cases that's not really, actually the issue. So we kind of hurt ourselves a little bit with that. So what we're going to do is we will exit most of the fashion jewelry line in the spring of '17 from our own stores, and we will introduce a more fine jewelry line inside of our own stores, really bringing it closer to the watch AUR, not completely, but it will be -- it will have gold, it'll have silver, will have plated materials as well, 18-karat plated, et cetera. And we're going to really elevate that whole category inside of our store, and there'll be select retail partners that we will allow also to carry that. But it's going to be very limited distribution, and we think it's a big opportunity for us to trade up the AURs in the store. Going back to the original question that Kimberly and Omar were talking about is, as traffic declines in these stores, we all have to be focused on conversion. And how can we -- we're not going to raise our AURs by 25% and 30% and 40%. But if you can get your AUR up 5% or 10%, that's going to make a big difference, and we're going to be doing that not only in our own stores, but looking at the department store channel as well on the specialty store channel and really take advantage of that. The second question you asked, we don't break out the percentage of -- for advertising. The only thing I can tell you is that we will continue to support that part of our business. As you know, we have, first off, the greatest voice in the fashion industry with Michael himself. We have the greatest PR, marketing and digital team, we think, in the industry, and I said in the prepared remarks, every single channel, social channel, we increased whether it's fans, followers, et cetera, and that really speaks volumes to what's happening with our advertising and marketing and the way that our teams are handing that. And again, we're going to be very proactive not only on existing channels but as we've done in the past, we've been really a leader in looking at new channels as they emerge and how we can have a voice in them."

But we have, between our licensed partners and ourselves, we have about 860 stores worldwide. And out of that 860 stores, in the Americas, we have about 400 stores. That includes Canada, Latin America, United States, et cetera. So we're kind of getting built and finished with our store rollout. In North America, in particular, it's going to be very few stores. We told you many years ago, and I know many people have not loved the fact that I've held very steadfast to the number. We told you we were going to build 400 stores in North America. And many people have asked me over and over again, why are you doing that? And we've said we're going to keep building 400 stores in North America. And we will finish that build out. The Americas got a little bit larger as a number because it now includes Latin America. So maybe it will be 425 or 430 or something like that. Whatever it is, we're pretty much done with our build out in this region of the world. Europe will continue to accelerate. In that marketplace, we have 171 of our own stores, and then we have a number with -- in Russia, et cetera. And again, we believe that, that marketplace will have in excess of 200 stores, we've said that in the past. And then Asia is a place where we think, we have a lot of opportunity. So all in all, we've said about 1,000 stores is where we think we'll be as a company, and that includes our license partners. So we have 150 or so to go. That does not include Men's. We've said that Men's will be something that will be a plus for us. So again -- and the last thing I just want to say is, again, I believe the -- we make a lot of money in four-wall in the stores. We also believe that, while e-commerce one day will end up being 20% or 30% of our business, it's not going to be 100%. So stores are not going away. They're not dying, and we need stores to service communities and people. And then also, I think, as you become omni, you really have a distinct advantage in having stores. So I'll give you a good example. Our return rates on e-commerce are running very low. But a number of those returns are coming back to stores. And it actually gives us an opportunity to interact with the customer, and we have seen evidence where we're actually not only taking the return, but trading the customer up and creating even a better experience with the customer. So again, we embraced omni, we embraced our retail flagships and our retail fleet that we have today. And we will finish the build out and get ourselves to the approximately 1,000 stores."

Those -- we're pleased with what happened with those stores. What we need to see is we're going to reconfigure a number of existing stores, as I mentioned earlier, to increase the footwear space inside those stores. We're really happy with what's happening with footwear. And we think it's another reason for the customer to come in and shop with us, et cetera. So we've got to see how that plays out. I want to remind everyone that as we increase our women's ready-to-wear and our women's footwear business, both in wholesale and in retail, that has an impact on our margin for 2 reasons: Number one, we have lower margins going in; and number two, their size businesses. And when you have size businesses, you have markdowns that are greater than what you run, and handbags aren't really sized and watches aren't really sized. So it will help us grow the top line. And ultimately, we think, it will help us grow the consumer experience. But as Joe indicated before, gross margins are kind of be flattish in the zone of where they are today, looking out going forward, impacted a little bit by what's going to happen with shoes and bags and even menswear has lower gross margins as well."

We're going to end this year somewhere around 25% operating margins, which really is extraordinary. And we generate a lot of cash, and we've been very aggressive about buying back stock because we feel that the market, if I may say that, has misunderstood our story and our potential and our long-term vision and our success quite frankly. So we are going to continue to be very aggressive given what we think is a dislocation of where our multiple is versus the rest of the industry. And I might remind everyone that we will end the year with top line growth and bottom line growth, which is very unusual for many, many players in the luxury industry. Pardon me if I bang the drum for Michael Kors for a minute. The line of credit is there for a number of different reasons. First, it's there, again, if we continue to see dislocations, we may or may not decide to even get more aggressive with our buyback purchases. As Joe said before, we have $580 million left on our authorization, but our board feels very strongly in making sure that we continue to return value to shareholders. Secondly, the line is there to look at potential licenses. We have a number of them that could be brought back in-house. And again, when we think that those are in a strategic place for us or are going to be accretive for us, we will act upon that. As you said before, we're very pleased with what's happening in China for us. And even though Hong Kong and Macau remain difficult, we had double-digit comp store increase even with Hong Kong and Macau being difficult. I mean, what does that tell you about the brand? The brand is strong, resonating, customer is very excited about what's happening with our product in that marketplace. So we like that and as we said in the prepared comments, she's shopping around the world with us not just in the mainland China marketplace as you know. Well over 50% of luxury goods is purchased outside of the mainland. And the third purpose for the line is and we said it in our last call is when and if a strategic acquisition is something that we think fits with our company's short-term and/or long-term objectives, we may very well act. So we have an incredible balance sheet. We have an incredible cash flow generation, and we have the ammunition to do a lot of different things to continue to generate revenue and earnings per share growth for the long term.

November and December just got better for us as we went through the quarter. And we saw -- what we really were pleased about was our full price stores. She came in, she shopped, she shopped for gifts and I said to you earlier that we saw sequential improvement. She liked what product we were offering her and she had a lot of choices out there in the marketplace and not only she had lot of choices. She had a lot of choices at a lot of prices. So we were particularly pleased with that. And again, we spend so much time talking about North America, North America. We're doing 30% of our business now approximately internationally. And we really like what we saw happening in Europe, and Asia is continuing to just build momentum. So as you think of this company long term, and this will be my concluding remarks, we always knew that North America would be a marketplace that ultimately would reach a point where we have lower growth. That's where we are today. We're still growing in the marketplace. And we're still taking market share, which, again, I hope you recognize given our results. So we think that really resonates for the brand well. Europe, still good opportunity for us to develop stores. Wholesale shop-in-shops there, and many marketplaces where we're still underpenetrated. Asia is wide open for us. We still are super underpenetrated in Korea, Japan, China and in certain places in Southeast Asia. So when you think about Michael Kors, think about growth. It's not going to be double-digit growth, those days are behind us. But we're going to have solid growth going forward, and in the luxury industry today, I think there's not a lot of companies that can stand up and say that and keep delivering on that quarter after quarter. I want to thank you all for taking the time to be with us today. Look forward to updating you on our results in our next conference call. Thank you."

Good morning, and welcome to Michael Kors fourth quarter fiscal 2016 earnings call. Reflecting on fiscal 2016, we achieved another record year with total revenue growth up 8% reaching $4.7 billion and an earnings per share increase of",2672,"Thank you, Krystyna. Good morning, and welcome to Michael Kors fourth quarter fiscal 2016 earnings call. Reflecting on fiscal 2016, we achieved another record year with total revenue growth up 8% reaching $4.7 billion and an earnings per share increase of 4% to $4.44 per share. On a constant-currency basis, total revenue and EPS grew 12% and 8%, respectively. I'm proud of the entire Michael Kors team and what we have accomplished over the course of the year. 
Beyond delivering strong financial performance, we raised the level of fashion innovation and newness in our product assortments. Michael and the design team elevated our product offering with new trend leading silhouettes, textures, colors and materials, which were met with a positive response from our customers. 
Our North American digital flagship business more than doubled in fiscal 2017. We also launched our digital flagship in Canada and developed a global platform that will enable us to launch our digital flagships across international markets. We opened a net total of 142 retail stores globally, 47 in the Americas and 95 internationally. We also opened several flagship stores in renowned luxury retail locations across the globe, including the Ginza District in Tokyo, Beijing and Stockholm with great success. More recently, we opened our largest flagship location in Europe on Regent Street in London, featuring our latest store design concept, and plan to open our Singapore flagship later this year. 
We have developed a platform to support accelerated growth in Asia. First, we transitioned our South Korean license in-house in January and have successfully integrated the region into our business. We also established our Hong Kong wholesale distribution operations, which enable us to provide even greater service and support to our Asian customers. In addition, we are pleased to announce that we have completed the acquisition of our Greater China license, which fits perfectly into our growth strategy in Asia. We believe that Asia will ultimately be $1 billion market, and that this acquisition is the cornerstone for our growth plan in this region. 
We accelerated the rollout of our menswear line with new and innovative designs in sportswear and leather goods. While we're still in early stages, we're pleased with the strong momentum in this business as we expand our presence at retail and in the wholesale channel. This is another area of business that, we believe, will drive long-term growth for the company. 
Finally, we continue to make enhancements to our infrastructure in order to support our long-term sustainable growth. During the year, we took our North American e-commerce fulfillment operations in-house, enabling us to better and more efficiently service customers in this channel. We also further enhanced our omnichannel capabilities allowing us to capture additional sales as our customers' shopping behavior change. And to support our growth in Europe, we built out our distribution center in Venlo, Holland with our e-commerce operations launching in midsummer this year and our operations for retail and wholesale going live in early calendar 2017. 
We ended 2016 on a strong note with fourth quarter total revenues and EPS growth ahead of our expectations. Total revenue increased 11% on a reported basis and 12% on a constant-currency basis, driven by growth in both our retail and wholesale channels as well as across geographies. Earnings per share increased 9% to $0.98 on a reported basis and grew 11% on a constant-currency basis. While slower mall traffic trends, the decline in tourism in North America as well as certain European cities and FX headwinds all remain a challenge for the industry as a whole, we were able to deliver solid results, which we believe is a testament to our world-class design team, exceptional product offerings, integrated marketing campaign and the lasting connection that we have fostered with our customers. 
Our retail business delivered solid growth across geographies driven by strong double-digit sales increases in our digital flagships and new store openings. Our global comparable sales increased 0.3% on a reported basis. In constant currency, our comparable sales rose 1.5%, which was in line with our guidance and was primarily driven by strong performance in our accessories and footwear categories. While we saw a slight decline in North American comps on a constant-currency basis in the fourth quarter, Europe comps increased in the mid-single digits and comps in Japan rose in a strong double digits. Mall traffic in North America continued to decline during the quarter. However, we once again saw a significant increase in conversion rates in our own retail stores as customers responded favorably to our new product offerings. Sales in our digital flagships once again showed significant growth in the fourth quarter. We believe that our digital flagships represent a meaningful growth opportunity, and we will continue to expand this business globally as we launch in Europe this fall.  We continue to build upon our omnichannel capabilities and remain focused on seamlessly integrating the customer shopping experience across all touch points as well as taking steps to enhance our mobile shopping experience. We look forward to seeing the benefit of these efforts over the coming years. 
We are currently undertaking a project to significantly elevate our CRM and data science capabilities. In parallel, we are investing in talent and technology in order to incorporate learning from the customer insights we are gaining. We will continue to capitalize on our CRM capabilities and MICHAEL's voice to gain a competitive advantage by evolving our customer-centric marketing. In addition, data science-driven segmentation enables us to personalize MICHAEL's message allowing us to strengthen the relationship between our brand and our most loyal customers. We believe that having a deep understanding of our customer behavior allows us to better excite and engage the customer, introducing services and products from our Lifestyle portfolio curated just for her. As you know, we have a strong and influential online presence as consumers turn to Michael Kors for fashion insights, and we continue to see our fan base grow across all social media platforms further demonstrating the power of our brand. Sales in our wholesale business grew 4% for the quarter on a reported basis, which was ahead of our expectations. Europe wholesale sales were flat on a reported basis and grew 2% in constant currency. While in Asia, we saw significant growth of nearly 8x -- 18x to $27 million. In North America, the department store channel remain challenged. However, the new spring collection we introduced were well received with strong sell-throughs in the fourth quarter. We believe that the North America retail environment remain highly promotional, which is impacting the long-term brand equity of Michael Kors. We will be actively decreasing our exposure to the wholesale channel by reducing inventory levels to focus on a higher level of full priced sell-throughs and a lower level of markdowns. While this strategy is expected to result in a meaningful decrease in wholesale net sales in fiscal 2017, we believe that it is the right strategy for the overall health of our business long term as we protect our margins and brand equity. 
In our Licensing segment, revenue declined during the quarter due to lower sales of watches as well as reduced sales in eyewear as we anniversary-ed our launch with Luxottica and the final quarter of shipments from Marchon last year. That said, we are pleased with the favorable response that we have seen to our new slim modern watch styles, particularly the Hartmann and Jarron [ph] case bodies, both of which are exceeding expectations. In addition, our updated jewelry offering, featuring padlocked motifs as well as our watch and jewelry giftset boxes, also continue to perform well. In eyewear, our spring fashion styles, the new round Kendall and the Cat [indiscernible] were met with strong response, and we are seeing positive sales momentum in our eyewear offerings globally. We remain a global trend leader in watches and jewelry with our entrance into the connected fashion accessories category. This fall, we will introduce our new wearable technology accessories line beginning with Michael Kors ACCESS display watch smartwatches. This launch is geared towards the fashion-focused consumer and features a smart timepiece that focuses on glamorous style and innovative design. Michael Kors ACCESS combines the cutting edge technology that our partner, Google, is known for, with the chic and glamorous fashion aesthetics of the Michael Kors luxury brand. These smartwatches will be available in 2 styles: The Dylan and Bradshaw, with price points between $395 and $595. This is truly a unique accessory featuring an exclusive custom display dial experience, which you can change with just a swipe. With hundreds of different display options, you can set your watch face to a glittering -- that complements your outfit by night and switch to a digital chronograph that shows your fitness stats at the gym the next morning. Certain watchers will feature interchangeable wristbands and will be available for both men and women. Powered by Google's Android Wear operating system, the touchscreen display smartwatches include social media updates, text phone calls and email alerts, app notifications, Smart Health from Google Now, voice control of device and services via Okay Google, and, of course, built-in fitness tracking. As part of our unified wearable strategy, we are also launching 3 styles of smart jewelry: The Crosby, Reed and Thompson, available in multiple colors, platings and a variety of bands. These modern styles are designed to give our customer a fitness tracker that is fashionable, and that she will want to wear every day either alone or as a complement to her jewelry. Smart jewelry will feature activity tracking, sleep monitoring and link remote control functionality, and will be priced from $95 to $145. Initially, the wearable technology will be a small piece of our overall business in terms of revenue. However, as I've said in the past, based on our previous success in watches and jewelry, we believe that we can quickly become a fashion leader in this category. Long term, the wearable technology category will become pivotal component of our watch and jewelry business. 
In addition, we are pleased to announce the fall debut of a new fragrance for women called Wanderlust. The new scent will have global appeal evoking infinite desire for adventure, romance and discovery. The new fragrance line will initially be offered exclusively in our North American resale stores before becoming available globally in both our retail stores and through our wholesale partners. We will be supporting the launch with a compelling marketing campaign, which includes print, TV and social media, featuring Lily Aldridge and Water Pilant. We believe this new collection will allow us to capitalize on the growing momentum in fragrance and beauty and further increase our penetration in this category. 
Turning to our product categories. We saw growth in our accessories category led by new handbag groups introduced this spring, including our denim styles, the quilted Sloan shoulder bag, our savanna Satchel and Haley tote. In addition, our backpack continues to resonate well with customers. 
Total accessory sales on a retail basis grow at low double digits globally. In North America, we saw weakness in the category in the wholesale channel. However, we experienced strong double-digit growth in accessories in our own retail stores. While the momentum in our small bags, crossbodies and small leather goods as well as promotional activity continue to impact AUR in the quarter, units sold increased double digits once again, which indicates continued demand for our luxury product offering. 
We also saw another solid quarter for growth in our footwear business as Michael Kors has become a dominant brand in this category. We offered a broad array of styles with performance led by the strength in fashion, active footwear as well as espadrilles and casual sandals, including our MK slide and warm platforms style. Customers also responded well to new designs detailing, particularly the perforated floral design of the Olevia Active Slip-on and Denim Styles of Old Lehigh tough sneaker and Dorsey espadrille. 
We're extremely pleased with the performance of our men's sportswear and leather goods business, which is showing strong momentum. The men's collection embodies effortless style with a modern edge for the confident, connected and adventurous Michael Kors man. While men's is still a small portion of our overall revenue, I'm confident that this will be an integral part of our business as we evolve into a leading men's luxury brand. During the year, we opened 117 shop-in-shops globally. In addition, we extended our men's presence at retail with the opening of 2 standalone stores as well as through the addition of our men's offering in 9 of our existing stores in North America, Europe and Asia. During fiscal 2017, we plan to open approximately 10 retail locations and 150 men's shops -- shop-in-shops globally. Long term, we continue to believe that our men’s business represents a billion dollar revenue opportunity for Michael Kors. 
Turning to our international business. As announced in our press release this morning, we completed the acquisition of our Greater China license, and are extremely excited about the tremendous growth opportunity this market has to offer. We believe that by taking direct control of this market, we can better leverage our infrastructure across Asia, and make a greater impact on the expansion of our business in this region. 
As you know, we have been working diligently over the past several years to build the infrastructure, establish the brand and grow the acceptance of Michael Kors across Asia. We believe that we are on a strong trajectory with a rapidly growing following among Chinese, Japanese, Korean and Southeast Asian consumers. This makes it an ideal time for us to take direct control of the China operations, integrate it into our business and unlock the enormous potential in this market. For the most recent year, Michael Kors product was available in 97 company-operated and travel retail doors across Mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan, and the Greater China business generated nearly $200 million in revenue. Long term, we believe that the China business represents a $500 million revenue opportunity based on our assessment of the market and the growing demand for the Michael Kors brand. 
In addition, we are pleased to see the strong trends in our Korea business since we took the license in-house this past January. Customer demand for Michael Kors brand is growing, and we will continue to invest in this region through new store expansion. We currently have 36 retail stores and concession shops in South Korea, and believe we can ultimately expand to 50 locations generating revenues of approximately $100 million. 
Turning to other Asia regions. We are extremely pleased with the ongoing momentum in Japan as we continue to see double-digit revenue gains and growing brand awareness. We continue to believe that Japan will ultimately reach $300 million in revenue. In Hong Kong, where we established distribution operations to service duty-free retail locations and our Southeast Asian license operations, we see $100 million revenue opportunity as we continue to grow this business. Combined, our Asian markets, in total, represent a billion dollar opportunity for the company. 
In conclusion, Michael Kors remains a leader in the global luxury fashion market with multiple long-term growth opportunities, including expansion across Asia, the launch of our digital flagships worldwide and the continued development of our men’s business. In fiscal 2017, we expect our results to be challenged by a difficult retail environment pressured by weak traffic and tourism trends. We will respond by carefully managing our exposure to the U.S. wholesale channel, maintaining disciplined inventory controls and remaining committed to our relentless focus on designing world-class fashion product, driving brand engagement with compelling marketing programs and delivering a jet-set luxury shopping experience in our stores and our digital flagships. In addition, as our new $1 billion share repurchase program demonstrates, we're committed to enhancing shareholder value over the long term. 
Now let me turn it over to Joe for a detailed review of our fourth quarter financial results and our outlook for fiscal 2017."
143971118,337449444,993920,"Michael Kors Holdings Limited, 2016 Earnings Call, Jun 01, 2016",2016-06-01,"Earnings Calls","Capri Holdings Limited","Executives","Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased to report revenue and EPS results above our guidance. Total revenue grew 10.9% to $1.2 billion on a reported basis. On a constant-currency basis, total revenue grew 11.7% driven by increases acro",2000,"Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased to report revenue and EPS results above our guidance. Total revenue grew 10.9% to $1.2 billion on a reported basis. On a constant-currency basis, total revenue grew 11.7% driven by increases across the Americas, Europe and Asia, up [ph] 5.1%, 18.1% and 212.1%, respectively. As a reminder, our fiscal year 2016 is a 53-week period versus a 52-week period in the prior year. As such, the results of our fiscal 2016 fourth quarter and full year include approximately $34 million of additional retail sales. Comp sales calculation exclude the 53rd week. 
In our Retail segment, net sales increased 22.0% on a reported basis. In constant currency, retail net sales increased 23.4% driven primarily by the opening of 142 net new stores since the fourth quarter of last year and strong performance of our digital flagships. Comp sales increased 0.3% on a reported basis. In constant currency, comp sales increased 1.5%. The increase is attributable to the positive comps in Europe and Japan partially offset by a slight decrease in North America. For our U.S. digital flagships, sales contributed 380 basis points to our North American comp performance in the quarter on a constant-currency basis. In our Wholesale segment, net sales grew 3.5%. On a constant-currency basis, wholesale sales increased 4.0%, driven primarily by our footwear and accessories category as well as men's and growth in international markets. 
In our Licensing segment, revenue decreased 13.6% as expected due to lower sales of watches as well as lower revenue related to eyewear as we anniversary-ed our launch with Luxottica and the final quarter of shipments from Marchon last year. 
Gross margin declined 20 basis points to 58.2%, which included a negative foreign currency transaction impact of approximately 100 basis points. The decline in gross margin is primarily due to a 120 basis point decline in retail gross margins attributable to additional markdowns, largely offset by gross margin benefits related to changes in geographic and segment mix as we saw a 32.9% increase in sales from regions outside of the America and a 22% increase in retail net sales. 
Total operating expenses grew 20.9%. As a percentage of total revenue, total operating expenses increased 310 basis points to 37.8% primarily due to our investments in new stores, e-commerce and omnichannel capabilities, the build-out of our men's and Korea businesses, new shop-in-shops and infrastructure improvements as well as impairment charges related to retail and wholesale fixed assets. 
Income from operations was $244.1 million or 24% [ph] of total revenue as compared to 23.7% of total revenue in the same period last year. Retail operating margin declined 360 basis points due to the decline of retail gross margins as discussed earlier and a 240 basis point increase in operating expenses primarily due to higher depreciation related to the fixed asset write-off mentioned earlier as well as investments in our new stores and digital flagships. Wholesale operating margin declined 190 basis points primarily due to higher operating expenses related to the fixed asset write-off noted earlier. 
Licensing operating margin increased 80 basis points primarily due to lower advertising cost during the quarter, partially offset by higher cost associated with intellectual property protection. 
Income taxes were $69.2 million in the quarter, and our effective tax rate was 28.2% as compared to 29.4% in the same period last year. The decrease in our effective tax rate was primarily due to the increase in taxable income in certain of our non-U.S. subsidiaries, which are subject to lower statutory income tax rate. 
Net income was $177.0 million for the fourth quarter, and diluted earnings per share were $0.98. The unfavorable currency impact on EPS was $0.02 per share. 
Turning to our balance sheet. At the end of the quarter, cash and cash equivalents were $702.0 million. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 3.7 million shares totaling $200 million under our share repurchase program. Since the inception of this program in 2014, we have repurchased almost 32 million shares or 15% of our outstanding shares, totaling approximately $1.6 billion. As of April 2, 2016, the remaining availability under the company share repurchase program was $358.1 million. We are very pleased to announce that the company's Board of Directors authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase program, which replaces the remaining balance of the previous program authorized in October 2014. The new authorization further demonstrates our confidence in our long-term business outlook. We will continue to use the strength of our balance sheet and future cash flows to repurchase additional shares and drive value for our shareholders. 
Inventory increased 5.2% versus last year, representing a slower growth rate than total revenue in the fourth quarter. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $79.0 million, and are related to the build-out in new retail stores and shop-in-shops as well as investments in our distribution facilities, our corporate offices and other infrastructure improvements. We added 45 net new stores in the fourth quarter. We opened 2 locations in the Americas, 6 in Europe and 41 in Asia, which includes the 36 stores we assumed in South Korea, and closed 4 locations in Brazil. In addition, we expanded or relocated 3 stores and converted 136 wholesale doors into shop-in-shops globally. 
Before turning to our outlook for next year, let me provide you with some insight into the acquisition of the Greater China license, which was completed on May 31 for $500 million in cash, subject to certain adjustments. We have said earlier on that meaningful investment and dedicated resources will be required to develop the China business given the complexity of this market. We also indicated that once this business has reached a certain size and level of profitability, we will consider bringing it in-house. Following considerable evaluation, we determined that based upon the size of the operations, the level of brand recognition Michael Kors has reached in the platform that has been established, it is the right time to acquire the China business. This acquisition will enable us to leverage the infrastructure and the team to further expand our presence and meaningfully grow our business across Asia. We believe that Asia represents a billion dollar revenue opportunity, and with this acquisition, we are positioned to capitalize on the growth potential in the market. 
The Greater China business generated total revenue of $197 million last fiscal year, and had a network of 91 company-operated stores and 6 travel retail locations across China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan. For fiscal 2017, we expect the acquisition to contribute approximately $200 million to retail net sales, reflecting sales of [ph] a 10-month period following the closing, and to be neutral to earnings per share on a GAAP basis and accretive on a non-GAAP basis, excluding one-time acquisition cost. The acquisition is expected to be accretive beginning in fiscal 2018 and thereafter.  Overall, we believe that this strategic acquisition was the right decision for our company and for our long-term growth. 
Turning to our outlook. For the full fiscal year 2017, we expect total revenue to be flat versus the prior year. As we look across the businesses, we expect retail net sales to increase in the mid-teens percent -- percentage range for the year, driven by growth in our digital flagships and the new store openings, in addition to the acquisition of the China business. Comp sales are expected to decline in the low single digits. Wholesale sales are expected to decline in the high teens percentage range [ph]. As John discussed earlier, the North American retail environment remains highly promotional. We will be reducing inventory in this channel in order to protect our margin and brand image. We believe that this will lead to faster inventory returns of new product and a decrease in markdown activity, which will ultimately result in higher gross margins and improve the overall health of the business. 
The outlook for lower wholesale sales is also due to the integration of the China business. As a reminder, in 2016, wholesale sales, through our Greater China licensee, totaled $62.8 million. 
Lastly, we expect licensing revenue to decline in the mid-teens percentage range as a result of continued softness in the watch category and a decrease in licensing revenue related to the acquisition of the Greater China license. 
For fiscal 2016, licensing revenue from Greater China license totaled $7.6 million. By geography, we anticipate a high single digit decline in total revenue for the Americas region due to lower wholesale and licensing revenue. We expect continued revenue expansion in our international markets with a high single digit increase in Europe and a triple-digit increase in Asia. We expect gross margin expansion in 2017 of 110 to 140 basis points as we continue to benefit from changes in geographic and segment mix. This will be offset by an increase in operating expense. We expect deleverage [ph] on operating expense as we continue to invest in our long-term growth, including upgrading our CRM systems, launching our digital flagship in Europe, building infrastructure in our China and Korea businesses, expanding our men’s business and transitioning to our Venlo [ph] warehouse as we plan to operate 2 facilities until we fully transition to our new facility in early calendar 2017. 
In addition, we expect to incur $15 million of one-time transaction cost and other contingency payments related to the acquisition of our Greater China licensee and $3 million of one-time costs related to the closure of certain locations in Latin America. As a result, fiscal 2017 operating margin is expected to be approximately 21.5% on a non-GAAP basis, excluding the one-time cost i mentioned earlier. On a GAAP basis, operating margin is expected to be approximately 21%. We expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $4.56 to $4.64 for the year on a non-GAAP basis, excluding the one-time cost noted earlier, and $4.47 to $4.55 on a GAAP basis, including the one-time cost. This assumes a tax rate of approximately 21% [ph] and 171 million shares outstanding. Capital expenditures are expected to total approximately $250 million for the fiscal year 2017, and we'll focus on ongoing investments in global digital strategies and omnichannel capabilities, global retail expansion, including approximately 15 [ph] new stores in the Americas, 20 in Europe and 40 in Asia; the conversion of approximately 275 wholesale shop-in-shops globally; and the company's global distribution infrastructure, information systems and corporate facilities. 
For the first quarter, we expect total revenue to be between $940 million and $955 million, and a mid-single digit decrease in comps sales. We expect a decline in gross margin of approximately 100 basis points. We anticipate an increase in operating expense as we continue to invest in our international expansion, digital flagships and global infrastructure. Operating expenses as a percent of total revenue is expected to increase 690 to 740 basis points on a non-GAAP basis, excluding one-time cost I noted earlier, resulting in operating margin of approximately 17%. On a GAAP basis, including the one-time cost, operating expenses, as a percentage of total revenue, is expected to increase 880 basis points to 930 basis points, resulting in an operating margin of approximately 15%. 
We expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.70 to $0.74 on a non-GAAP basis, excluding the one-time cost noted earlier, and $0.62 to $0.66 on a GAAP basis, including the one-time cost. This assumes a tax rate of approximately 21% and 177 million shares outstanding. 
During fiscal 2017, we will be resetting our base in our North American wholesale business and expect to resume sales growth in fiscal 2018. As we reduce our lower-margin North American wholesale business and gain other margin benefits associated with favorable geographic and segment mix, we expect to see continued gross margin expansion in fiscal 2018. We continue to believe that we will be poised to deliver both sales and earnings growth over the long term. 
I will now turn the call back to John for closing remarks."

It seems like you're also working to differentiate product between your retail channel and your wholesale channel. Could you just expand on that strategy and your thinking there? And then lastly, looking at the China acquisition. How are you feeling about the composition and location of stores? Are you generally happy with the number of stores and the current locations? Or do you think there might be an opportunity to reposition some of the stores by area within Greater China?"

And again, for the broader group, I know we scheduled this call to be 1.5 hours, and I think you can understand why now with the acquisition of China and year end and a lot of strategic changes we're making, so I thought it",1017,"First off, thank you, Kimberly. And again, for the broader group, I know we scheduled this call to be 1.5 hours, and I think you can understand why now with the acquisition of China and year end and a lot of strategic changes we're making, so I thought it was a good idea to give the full time for people to ask questions. Kimberly, on your first question regarding our wholesale strategy, the majority of the wholesale decline will happen in North America. And as Joe indicated before, I think it's about [ph] $63 million of the wholesale decline belongs to the acquisition of China. And so you have to kind of factor that into the numbers. And let me just explain to you what our thinking is. Again, first off, we have built a very solid business with department stores, not only domestically, but internationally. We think the channel is a very strong channel across the world. Great banners that we operate our brand inside of. And we support them 100% in good times and in difficult times. That being said, what has happened in North America, in particular, and you're starting to see a little bit of it in Europe is that as mall traffic has declined, stores have taken an aggressive position on promotional activity to generate volume and traffic into their buildings. And we have seen that magnify over the last 12 months. And we believe that, that, long term, is not healthy for the Michael Kors brand. And as I've said to you before, and we just said it in the script, we grew our handbag business globally. I mean, so our customer -- that's in dollars, our customer continues to respond to the brand. I see constant communication from various press-related things about the brand is dead or losing its vibrancy, et cetera, and that just flat out not true. And along with that, we're shipping double-digit unit increases. So we think that, that's too many units going into the marketplace. And we believe that by us reducing the amount of product going into the wholesale channel, we will actually create a healthier environment for our department store customers and partners and ourselves. There'll be less product, there will be more demand, and that demand will be more full priced versus sale. And on a further add that many of you have the opportunity to come up and see our fall product offerings. We're really excited about that. Our own stores, our retail partners have let us know that we're heading in the right direction in terms of trend. I also mentioned to you we're the second or third largest handbag company in the world. So we have an obligation, and we have an authority to really set the tone for fashion and for luxury. And we're going to use that authority until we have 70 -- 750 company-owned stores, 100 stores under license. So we have an 850 store network globally that is incredibly positioned. And the power of that with what Michael and the design team are going to be delivering for fall season, we've already seen the beginning of that in spring, we think, is going to continue to propel the business forward. And we're very, very pleased about that. So we think the strategy that we're taking, while obviously reduces our revenue on the top line, is going to be much healthier for us. Joe indicated that we're actually going to have our gross margin expansion, and that's because as we look at geography and retail are kind of tilting, that's a better thing for us. So we just like the strategy altogether. I want to be 100% clear. We believe in our department store partners. We think they're doing a great job with our brand. And we want to continue to be one of the great assets that they have to help bring customers into their building. And we like their customers. We think they're terrific Kors loyalists. Secondly, in terms of the exclusively hours, the strategy there is to do 2 things: Number one, yes, to distinguish a bit between our freestanding stores and some of our department store shops around the world; and secondly, to be able to have product that could be promoted less quite frankly. And you're going to actually see even more of that coming for the fall season. And certain groups that will not be promoted both in our own stores and in the department stores environment as well. We know that the promotional activity is even more prevalent from a visibility standpoint for the customer because of digital. So we've got to take a different approach to how the customer sees our product and really stand behind the newness. We'll give that product an opportunity to develop and market behind that. And on your third question regarding China. Our license has built out an extraordinary network of stores. We are in the best locations, just like we are in the United States, just like we are in Europe. We sit next to the finest luxury brands from Europe with Vuitton or Prada or Gucci. We're right in the same shopping malls and same streets, et cetera. I would also say that we got lucky. We did not have a overdevelopment of Hong Kong, in particular, which, as you know, is struggling as a marketplace. So the good news for us is we only have a handful of locations there. So that presents an opportunity for the future, but it also really avoids a very big negative. As you know, many companies are suffering in that marketplace. Mainland China and Taiwan are double-digit comps. Just moving along very, very nicely. And the brand has tremendous opportunity to grow in those marketplaces. And lastly, just on that note. As you know, the Chinese are traveling all over the world. So again, even as we build out the business in the region, there's even more to come up for us across the globe with that customer. So thank you very much, Kimberly."

As you know, most of the locations that we're in today in our department store partners are shop-in-shops. And there are no shop-in-shop closings. So we are highly productive. Just like our freestanding stores, we're top 10 in almost every single mall around the world in terms of our productivity per square foot. We are in the same position and obviously, in certain categories, we're #1 in terms of department stores, we're #1 in terms of sales per square foot in those various department. So that's not an issue at all. The real issue for us is analyzing the amount of inventory that is being sold on sale versus full price. That's what we have to look at. And we believe that selling more product at full price is better for our brand image and better for our margins long term. So again, as Joe indicated earlier, this is a reset for us that will take probably 12, maybe a little longer at [ph] 15 months, to get through. But we ultimately believe that as a luxury fashion-led brand, we don't want it to be about price, we want it to be about new product introduction. And in terms of -- you asked about categories, I would say, the predominant reduction will be coming from our accessories category. That's where we see. As I said to you earlier, just too many units moving into the marketplace. Now, while we love the fact that consumers are responding to our products and buying more of it priced by lots and again, all of our consumer research shows that the brand engagement and the brand loyalty is at highest levels that it's ever been, in your analysis that you do annually indicate the same thing. So we just don't like the amount of product that's ending up out in the marketplace. So this is not an issue of doors or anything like that. This is really more an issue of having the right amount of product given where we want to get back to in terms of full price selling versus promotional selling."

Because again, many of the European competitors are reporting on a reported basis. But when you look at the constant currency, I think in Europe, in particular, we did better than most. That being said, we're definitely seeing the business stronger in -- as I mentioned last quarter, in Italy, Spain and in certain of the Eastern European markets. Our business is -- for example, in Russia, it's outstanding, but that's not in our comp, but I'm just telling you, it's very, very strong there. On the other hand, we are seeing, as many luxury companies have reported, our business in France after the terrorist attacks has been very difficult and continues to decline given the tourism decline in that marketplace. We have had difficulty in the U.K. that was driven primarily -- or initially by currency changes. That's now kind of changed a little bit given the -- we've got some issues. People are thinking about the Brexit, et cetera. So our business remains a bit of a challenge there. I would tell you overall in Europe, and I've seen some other luxury goods companies report this as well, we do see headwinds. Tourism into Europe is declining. There's a lot of macro issues in Europe. There was another terrorist alert that came out yesterday. So we believe that Europe, while still growth opportunities for, as Joe indicated in terms of region, it's going to be a bumpy road in 2017. Until there's some issues settled politically, we're not exactly sure where the FX is going to end up for the year. And so we're going to stick very close to that. Again, growth market for us, but I think there's going to be a few bumps as we get through the year."

And as long as the stock remains, in our opinion, and it's just our opinion, significantly undervalued, we will be aggressively in the marketplace over the next year taking advantage. We've taken out 15% of our shares, and we're going to keep going. We have the balance sheet and cash flow to continue to do that. So you can be very sure that we're going to be returning value to our shareholders, particularly at this time, and we think that's going to bare a lot of fruit when people understand that Michael Kors is here to stay, powerful business model, one of the most profitable companies in the market, and we'll continue to deliver great results."

And if you could give us some comments on your outlook for AUR in whole and by channel, that will be super helpful.

When we took this company public, and you heard me say this many, many times, we've said to you that North America would grow. It will eventually reach maturity. And that if that happens, Europe would come on. And if that happened, Asia would come on. And I think all of those things have played out as we have laid them out, with the exception of what's really happened in mall traffic in North America. I don't think any of us have the crystal ball to see that coming, and obviously, part of that is driven by the digital shift in the consumer behavior, and the other part of that is driven by -- in our case, and I know in some of our very, very valued department store partners cases. And it's not just North America because not calls focus on North America wholesale, but we have a lot of business around the world. Department stores in Europe are facing many challenges with traffic from tourism as well. And the second thing we said when we went public was that this company ultimately would be 70% 75% retail versus wholesale. Wholesale just grew faster than we had ever anticipated. And we enjoyed that. We think that's terrific, and we're going to continue to enjoy that. But we ultimately, first and foremost, are retailers. Ultimately, we believe that our store network, which will get to some thousand stores worldwide will be the cornerstone of our development and growth. And it will be somewhere between 65% and 75% retail and the balance will be wholesale. And as you look at China, China is -- Asia, Asia is basically all retail. Small wholesale business there with some Duty Free operators and a license -- small license business there. And in Europe, Europe is going to -- has always been a business that will grow more quickly in retail because there's just more opportunity for us to do that. So again, I don't think that should be any surprise. That's kind of what we have laid out initially. We just we're able to develop wholesale piece of it faster than the retail piece. In terms of SKUs, I'll go back to your first question. No, there's not going to be a change in SKU. And if anything, I think when many of you came through our showrooms, you saw the amount of product innovation that our design teams are delivering. It's really quite exciting. And I think it's what the market needs. I've been very vocal on the fact that I think the market has had a malaise in terms of design. I think the consumer needs to see something that's got more interest in terms of product and quality. And I think many of our competition is doing a great job. In particular, some of our European competitors are doing just an outstanding job with new product innovation. You'll see some additional things coming to bear very shortly on our website that will be exclusively on our website with products that we will be, quite frankly, building custom for consumers. But we think that, that's going to become even more of an issue as people look at what's in their wardrobe and how we curate that for them. So there's going to be actually more customization that we're going to look at on a go-forward basis, you'll see some of that will talk about that in the next call. In terms of AUR. AUR declined in both channels. And in our retail channel, it was a bit more driven by size of the bag than promotion. But, clearly, promotion added to the decline in AUR. And in the wholesale channel, it was higher than our own channel. And that's just because there's more activity in that channel by more people, and of course, there's tremendous amount of price matching that goes on. So that's really added to a bit of the chaos of the situation that's happening in that particular channel."

First, we believe that by reducing the amount of inventory that retail that's available for sale, it's going to raise the AUR. Secondly, we are taking the smaller bags and we're offering more fashion design into those products, and actually, offering higher price points. The strategy that Michael personally really came up with, and we think it's a brilliant strategy, because it's not just the price that she's interested in the smaller bags, it's the size. So we believe that we probably actually been slightly under charging and slightly under designing in terms of where -- she'll definitely pay somewhere between $200 and $300 for a crossbody, why can't we have more of them at the higher price point, and so you'll be seeing that coming to bear in the stores. And then also, we believe that one of the reasons why the predominant amount of that handbags that many of us are selling in that $200 to $350 range is because we really haven't been providing enough design to get the customer excited for higher price point product. And so that's coming, and so that will actually raise the AUR for fall season on the floor inside the stores. So we feel very good about that strategy. Reduced units, get AURs up, still being very competitive price points, because I don't want you think that we're having a complete shift in pricing. But we think that's the right thing to do. We think the customer's response that because you're going to see the value in the design of the product."

We believe that the North American handbag business is flat to down on -- low single digits in total. I know that, that's different from what some other people have reported, but that's just our belief. So we believe that the North American business, handbag business, about flat to down low single digits. And that's, I think, primarily because of the promoting that's going on. Obviously, units are up double digits, and I think it's for most of us. And by the way, that includes luxury players too, because I know many times, we have these conversations, there's only 2 other competitors that are referred to, but we see the same thing happening with multiple luxury companies, obviously, with the exclusion of Vuitton who doesn't operate in the sale environment. But many other companies are there, the amount that they're selling on sale is higher than the amount that they're selling at regular price this year versus last year. The -- we believe the macro handbag, luxury handbag market is relatively flat on a global basis, possibly up 1 point or 2. So -- and we believe that's going to be sort of the trend on a macro basis for the next year at least. And of course, you've sene that in the recent Alpha Gamma luxury report, which echo the same exact issues, with the exception of our point of view on the North American handbag market. We believe that there's softening that's continuing in the mall traffic. We've actually seen an acceleration of softening in mall traffic. And this is not just our stores, this is what we see from ShopperTrak, which is a company that we use -- that looks at our -- that's looks at not only ours, but other retailers numbers, so we compare ourselves to that on a pretty regular basis. So mall traffic continues to soften in North America. We do not see the tourism rebounding. So we're taking a slightly more pessimistic view of Q1 and Q2 for us. Q3 and Q4, we feel pretty optimistic about. And if you remember last year when we were sitting here at this time having this conversation, I know many people didn't believe that we're going to be able to do what we did. And I understand why, that's not a negative. But we did. We delivered on everything that we said we're going to do through [ph] the year, including the comps. In the back half of the year, we got some amazing things that are going to be happening for us. First and foremost, we're really seeing the e-commerce part of our business accelerate. You heard me -- we more than increased by over [ph] 50% our e-commerce sales this past year. And traffic remains strong, double-digit increases. And so what we need to have in place is this great CRM capability, which, today, we don't really have -- we have a fair CRM capability, but we're building out, it's going to be, as I said earlier in the call, world-class. And that, we think, is going to give us the ability to do a lot of things in the back half of the year, which we're going to talk about in our next conference call. Everything from the spoke up offering to curation, a specialty that we're going to be doing, and just the way we're able to engage with our customers. Second, is our new product initiatives. Our introductions are very strong. I think it's the best product that we've shown since I've been here with this company. And again, Michael and the design teams have really done a tremendous job featuring what I consider to be the highest levels of innovation in our company and in terms of the materials and silhouette, et cetera. So I think it's going to be powerful, and I think our customers are going to be extremely excited about the newness. Next is Koss ACCESS. Kors ACCESS is going to be a very big help for us. As you recall, we talked about 2 things constantly in the calls: North America and handbags. And we don't always remember we're a retail company, which I like to remind everybody on this call, we're a retail company; and secondly, we don't talk about the fact that watches have really, have tremendous impact on our comp store sales. I mean it's the #1 area that has hurt us in comp store sales over the last 2 years. And again, this is -- our partner, Fossil, terrific people, doing a great job for us, and it's really been -- because people have moved to iPhone and to some degree, iWatch, but I think it's really more the switch to that. So Kors ACCESS is going to be a really powerful new innovative opportunity for our sales associates to communicate, engage with our customers. And then the trackers are going to be great. You know we've got some competitors out there. And I'll say that Fitbit is a competitor of ours. And we think that we're going to have the most innovation in terms of fashion in a tracker any company in the world. And I'm being that strong about the statement. And we priced it from $95 to $150. We're going after this aggressively. And we think that's going to be an amazing opportunity for us, in particular, in the third quarter. And then lastly, we told you the launch of Wanderlust is always a big plus for us when we see that happen. Lots of television, a marketing campaign, [indiscernible] has done an amazing job with this new fragrance, and [indiscernible] has been a terrific partner with us. And lastly is going to be gifting. We did a great job last year with gifting. It really helped us in Q3. We told you about that. We've taken that to a whole new level for this year. So we -- this isn't full hockey stick, I don't want you to think of it that way, but we're going to have a very good third and fourth quarter in this company. Q2 will be okay. But Q3 and Q4 will be great. So thank you very much, Matt."

John, what is your thoughts from an industry and a company-specific strategy-wise regarding the reality of price matching? And also how mobile is really changing how the consumer shops, and how the path to purchase works in terms of multiple channels, I'm thinking about mobile. And then also, John, I know, we've been following a lot of the luxury companies, and there's been a pretty sharp diversion to, say, Hong Kong, Macau versus Mainland. Is that something you're seeing? And how are your thoughts on the real estate in terms of what you're thinking about, as a lot of people are focused on real productivity per [ph] point of store in Asia versus distribution growth?"

My opinion of price matching is that it's a race to the bottom. So I believe that those people who want to participate in that, as a general rule, will ultimately see their business decline. And I also kno",770,"Well, I'm going to start with the price matching. My opinion of price matching is that it's a race to the bottom. So I believe that those people who want to participate in that, as a general rule, will ultimately see their business decline. And I also know that many people think that, that's a way to protect their relationship with their customer. I think it's a way to devalue the relationship. It just basically means that they don't believe in, when they do have a sale or an offering for the customer, that it's illegitimate. They just offer anything at any time. So my personal opinion is it's a race to the bottom. I think mobile has definitely changed consumer shopping behavior. Everything from the way that people shop, and which is obviously hurting mall traffic because people -- we know they're beginning their journey online, and ultimately, we're still doing 90-plus percent of our business in North America in stores. So stores are still real. And while 1 day, I publicly said, we'll get the 25%, 30% of our business in e-commerce, we're nowhere near that today. But that being said, we have to be very cognizant that the consumer is starting and definitely creating her path to purchase on mobile, and we better be part of that and be good at it, and be influencing her through that journey. I want to note that we don't do the price matching thing, and our comps are, quite frankly, better than a lot of other people's comps who are doing all these types of things. So you can't continue to build your business, especially with the mobile view that tests your customer, it's all about price because that will ultimately just drive the AUR down, which will ultimately -- you can't sell enough units to make up to the dollars. It just doesn't work. But we do think that our new CRM groups that we're putting together here and the investments we're going to be making will give us the ability to really change the shopping experience. And Oliver, as you know, if you go to our Flat Iron [ph] store, you'll see Kors concierges up and live. It's a whole digital shopping experience with the customers that our sales associates are fully enabled with. We'll have 35 stores rolled out the next few months. And we're going to arm our customers with the ability to be the ultimate fashion stylist for their clients and be able to curate for them. And that's what people want. If you want to get away from price, it has to be product, it has to be innovation, and we believe strongly, it has to be curation. So that's our point of view on that. In terms of Hong Kong and Macau, as I said earlier, we got lucky. We have nice distribution in Macau. We're in some terrific locations. So there'll be no real estate changes in Macau. Obviously, our business is very difficult there and really not seeing any signs of any kind of recovery in that marketplace. Hong Kong, we do not have a large distribution there, a few points of distribution. Believe it or not, our Hong Kong business, I don't -- I can't 100% explain to you why, but over the last 60 days, it's actually showing signs of improvement. So I don't want to tell you that's a trend by any stretch of imagination, but what was terrible before is now just kind of bad. So we feel good about where we are. And I would tell you that we are looking at real estate in Hong Kong as an opportunity for the company, especially since rents have come down significantly since their peak. So we'll be cautious. We'll continue to view things as where is the consumer shopping. Ultimately, Hong Kong is going to come back. Is it a year from now, is it 2 years from now, is it 5 years from now? Nobody knows. But Hong Kong will become a place that's important. The only thing I would add to that is what I think many luxury companies are seeing is there is a movement of the people who are coming to Hong Kong and Macau now are a bit more coming from Tier 2, 3 and 4 cities. The Tier 1 customer, who is still the probably the biggest average per spend customer, is moving into clearly Europe, clearly Japan, clearly Korea. So the average transaction that many people are seeing in those markets is slightly down because of just the customer mix."

People are so engaged, whether it's Michael and Nina Agdal, and the glamour games that we put up, or whether it's the whole new campaign that we just shot in Mexico for summer and all the different videos, or if it's in the Mother's Day campaign, which was a huge success for us, with Alexander Ambrosia, or whether it's Lily Aldridge doing a whole sneaker campaign for us. So I think we're really good as a company. And our teams are excellent at developing content that is engaging. And it's exciting the customer and keeping them engaged with the brand. Maybe not actually shop from us, but I think they love being a part of the Michael Kors family. And so I think in today's world, you have to be there. I mean, look at our major competitors in Europe, and everyone's upping the game, whether it's fashion shows in Rio or [indiscernible] Castle or whatever the things are you have to understand that we're in business of exciting people.

First off, Omar, thank you for your questions, and thank you for your one comment that it is true that our -- the traffic issue is not a Michael Kors issue. This is an issue -- I don't know 1 retailer that I speak to hasn’t seen this happening. And",851,"Yes. First off, Omar, thank you for your questions, and thank you for your one comment that it is true that our -- the traffic issue is not a Michael Kors issue. This is an issue -- I don't know 1 retailer that I speak to hasn’t seen this happening. And Omar, I would first start by calling that traffic thing a behavioral change. And again, I think many times, we're in the first company o r the most honest company to come out and say, ""These traffic trends are starting to see in other places in the world."" So mall traffic is declining in Europe now. It's declining in the U.K. in particular. And I would tell you that in the most sophisticated digital markets is where you see the most mall traffic slowing. So we start out, and this is just our theory and just our hypothesis, that consumers who have high levels of digital product availability are shopping less in shopping malls. And U.K. is a perfect example. As Harris and Selfridges and House of Fraser and John Lewis all got better with e-commerce, there's just more business going there. And we know that because we do business with them. We see how much percentage-wise. The U.K, for us, has some of the highest levels of penetration with our department store partners anywhere else in the world. So somewhere between 25% and 35% of our business with those retailers comes from online. And they're the most sophisticated at collect and collect, they're the most sophisticated at same-day delivery service. They do it better than any department store in the world in the U.K. But that's affecting mall traffic. So we think that's only going to continue on because people are just going to get better. We'll be announcing shortly some cities in the United States or we'll be providing same-day service, and so on and so forth. And actually, we believe that one of the most important ways that we're going to compete globally is with delivery. And delivery, one of the things that we have, which many people were concerned about, about the amount of locations that we have, both in North America and internationally, is actually going to  be strength for us, because we will be able to offer same-day delivery. And unfortunately, probably for free. But that's going to be the new norm. And so we had to deal with that behavior. So what are we going to do to drive traffic into the stores? Well, first and foremost, we believe that creative marketing leads the way. So we have to inspire the customer with new product delivered in greater marketing. And I think our teams, I think we're world-class in -- if we're launching a new bag, building campaigns around that, that involve everything from Michael himself personally to certain celebrities that we make sure that the product appears on, to digital marketing campaigns and print campaigns. We're furthering that by being able to arm our sales associates with Kors concierge, which gives them the ability, and I just actually demonstrated yesterday, it's phenomenal, where they can talk directly 1 on 1, so it's not just a corporate communication, but now you got the sales associates in the store talking to their client directly to this new curation device platform that we've built that says, ""Not only does this bag come in, but here's the shoe and dress and the jewelry and the watch that's going to go with this. Why don't you come on in and let's have a conversation."" So we believe that this is going to be 1 on 1 dialogue with the customer. And we're really looking at it from the top of the funnel to the bottom of the funnel. We are not pulling back on our marketing and, in fact, we're increasing marketing. So part of the SG&A increase that you see increasing marketing. I made the decision a few months ago, even when we decided to reduce our wholesale business in North America, it would have been easier for us to go in and cut expenses all over the company and make up a lot of the gross profit dollars that we lost. But we made the decision that, that wasn't smart for us. That we're building a long-term company, we're building a long-term relationship, and we need to drive customers into the store and you have to spend money to do that with marketing. And I think you're going to see the fruits of that between our communication efforts, our CRM and then ultimately, Kors concierge. If it works the way we think it's going to work, we'll be able to drive traffic into the stores. Is it going to be positive traffic? I'm not sure, to be frank with you. I think that's probably wishful thinking. But I think we will be able to stay in the level that will help us have comp store increases. And again, we're getting excellent conversion rates inside the stores and we just think that's going to continue forward."

That's kind of over -- there will be a handful of select locations where we'll do that, but you'll be able to count those on your 2 hands. And there'll be more flagship-y type things. We just did it in London and, which happens to be working, thank God. But where we did them in more regional locations, it really didn't provide the uplift from a profitability standpoint that we were anticipating. So unless we see something changing on that, that will not be part of our strategy going forward. And in terms of outlets in North America, we're basically done at this point. I think there's 1 or 2 more that we're going to open and its over with. So that's pretty much worldwide also, but there'll be a handful that we'll open in a couple of locations, but we're pretty much finished out on that. And then over the next 2 years, maybe 3 years, we'll be finished with our global store expansion.

Good morning, and welcome to Michael Kors Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2016 Earnings Call. Reflecting on fiscal 2016, we achieved another record year with total revenue growth of 8%, reaching $4.7 billion, and an earnings per share increase",2686,"Thank you, Krystyna. Good morning, and welcome to Michael Kors Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2016 Earnings Call. Reflecting on fiscal 2016, we achieved another record year with total revenue growth of 8%, reaching $4.7 billion, and an earnings per share increase of 4% to $4.44 per share. On a constant currency basis, total revenue and EPS grew 12% and 8%, respectively. I'm proud of the entire Michael Kors team and what we have accomplished over the course of the year. 
Beyond delivering strong financial performance, we raised the level of fashion innovation and newness in our product assortments. Michael and the design team elevated our product offering with new trend-leading silhouettes, textures, colors and materials, which were met with a positive response from our customers. 
Our North American digital flagship business more than doubled in fiscal 2017. We also launched our digital flagship in Canada and developed a global platform that will enable us to launch our digital flagships across international markets. 
We opened a net total of 142 retail stores globally, 47 in the Americas and 95 internationally. We also opened several flagship stores in renowned luxury retail locations across the globe, including the Ginza district in Tokyo, Beijing and Stockholm with great success. More recently, we opened our largest flagship location in Europe on Regent Street in London, featuring our latest store design concept, and plan to open our Singapore flagship later this year. 
We have developed a platform to support accelerated growth in Asia. First, we transitioned our South Korean license in-house in January and have successfully integrated the region into our business. We also established our Hong Kong wholesale distribution operations, which enable us to provide even greater service and support to our Asian customers. 
In addition, we are pleased to announce that we have completed the acquisition of our Greater China license, which fits perfectly into our growth strategy in Asia. We believe that Asia will ultimately be a $1 billion market and that this acquisition is the cornerstone for our growth plan in this region. 
We accelerated the rollout of our menswear line with new and innovative designs in sportswear and leather goods. While we are still in the early stages, we are pleased with the strong momentum in this business as we expand our presence at retail and in the wholesale channel. This is another area of business that we believe will drive long-term growth for the company. 
Finally, we continued to make enhancements to our infrastructure in order to support our long-term sustainable growth. During the year, we took our North American e-commerce fulfillment operations in-house, enabling us to better and more efficiently service customers in this channel. We also further enhanced our omnichannel capabilities, allowing us to capture additional sales as our customers' shopping behaviors change. And to support our growth in Europe, we built out our distribution center in Venlo, Holland, with our e-commerce operations launching in midsummer this year and our operations for retail and wholesale going live in early calendar 2017. 
We ended 2016 on a strong note, with fourth quarter total revenues and EPS growth ahead of our expectations. Total revenue increased 11% on a reported basis and 12% on a constant currency basis, driven by growth in both our retail and wholesale channels as well as across geographies. Earnings per share increased 9% to $0.98 on a reported basis and grew 11% on a constant currency basis. 
While slower mall traffic trends, the decline in tourism in North America as well as certain European cities and FX headwinds all remained a challenge for the industry as a whole, we were able to deliver solid results, which we believe is a testament to our world-class design team, exceptional product offerings, integrated marketing campaigns and the lasting connection that we have fostered with our customers. 
Our retail business delivered solid growth across geographies, driven by strong double-digit sales increases in our digital flagships and new store openings. Our global comparable sales increased 0.3% on a reported basis. In constant currency, our comparable sales rose 1.5%, which was in line with our guidance and was primarily driven by strong performance in our accessories and footwear categories. 
While we saw a slight decline in North American comps on a constant currency basis in the fourth quarter, Europe comps increased in the mid-single digits, and comps in Japan rose in the strong double digits. Mall traffic in North America continued to decline during the quarter. However, we once again saw a significant increase in conversion rates in our own retail stores as customers responded favorably to our new product offerings. 
Sales in our digital flagships once again showed significant growth in the fourth quarter. We believe that our digital flagships represent a meaningful growth opportunity, and we will continue to expand this business globally as we launch in Europe this fall. 
We continued to build upon our omnichannel capabilities and remained focused on seamlessly integrating the customer shopping experience across all touch points as well as taking steps to enhance our mobile shopping experience. We look forward to seeing the benefit of these efforts over the coming year. 
We are currently undertaking a project to significantly elevate our CRM and data science capabilities. In parallel, we are investing in talent and technology in order to incorporate learning from the customer insights we are gaining. We will continue to capitalize on our CRM capabilities and Michael's voice to gain a competitive advantage by evolving our customer-centric marketing. 
In addition, data science-driven segmentation enables us to personalize Michael's message, allowing us to strengthen the relationship between our brand and our most loyal customers. We believe that having a deep understanding of our customer behavior allows us to better excite and engage the customer, introducing services and products from our lifestyle portfolio curated just for her. As you know, we have a strong and influential online presence as consumers turn to Michael Kors for fashion insights, and we continue to see our fan base grow across all social media platforms, further demonstrating the power of our brand. 
Sales in our wholesale business grew 4% for the quarter on a reported basis, which was ahead of our expectations. Europe wholesale sales were flat on a reported basis and grew 2% in constant currency, while in Asia, we saw significant growth of nearly 8x -- 18x to $27 million. 
In North America, the department store channel remained challenged. However, the new spring collection we introduced were well received, with strong sell-throughs in the fourth quarter. We believe that the North America retail environment remains highly promotional, which is impacting the long-term brand equity of Michael Kors. We will be actively decreasing our exposure to the wholesale channel by reducing inventory levels to focus on a higher level of full-priced sell-throughs and a lower level of markdowns. While this strategy is expected to result in a meaningful decrease in wholesale net sales in fiscal 2017, we believe that it is the right strategy for the overall health of our business long term as we protect our margins and brand equity. 
In our licensing segment, revenue declined during the quarter due to lower sales of watches as well as reduced sales in eyewear as we anniversaried our launch with Luxottica and the final quarter of shipments from Marchon last year. That said, we are pleased with the favorable response that we have seen to our new slim modern watch styles, particularly the Hartman and Jaryn case bodies, both of which are exceeding expectations. In addition, our updated jewelry offering featuring padlock motifs as well as our watch and jewelry gift set boxes also continued to perform well. 
In eyewear, our spring fashion styles, the new round Kendall and the Abela [ph] were met with strong response, and we are seeing positive sales momentum in our eyewear offerings globally. We remain a global trend leader in watches and jewelry with our entrance into the connected fashion accessories category. 
This fall, we will introduce our new wearable technology accessories line, beginning with MICHAEL KORS ACCESS display smartwatches. This launch is geared towards the fashion-focused consumer and features a smart timepiece that focuses on glamorous style and innovative design. MICHAEL KORS ACCESS combines the cutting-edge technology that our partner, Google, is known for with the chic and glamorous fashion aesthetics of the Michael Kors luxury brand. These smartwatches will be available in 2 styles: the Dylan and Bradshaw, with price points between $395 and $595. 
This is truly a unique accessory featuring an exclusive custom display dial experience, which you can change with just a swipe. With hundreds of different display options, you can set your watch face to a glittering pavé that complements your outfit by night and switch to a digital chronograph that shows your fitness stats at the gym the next morning. Certain watches will feature interchangeable wristbands and will be available for both men and women. 
Powered by Google's Android Wear operating system, the touchscreen display smartwatches include social media updates, text, phone call and email alerts, app notifications, smart health from Google Now, voice control of device and services via Ok Google and, of course, built-in fitness tracking. 
As part of our unified wearable strategy, we are also launching 3 styles of smart jewelry: the Crosby, Reed [ph] and Thompson [ph], available in multiple colors, platings and in a variety of bands. These modern styles are designed to give our customer a fitness tracker that is fashionable and that she will want to wear every day either alone or as a complement to her jewelry. Smart jewelry will feature activity tracking, sleep monitoring and linked remote control functionality and will be priced from $95 to $145. 
Initially, the wearable technology will be a small piece of our overall business in terms of revenue. However, as I've said in the past, based on our previous success in watches and jewelry, we believe that we can quickly become a fashion leader in this category. Long term, the wearable technology category will become a pivotal component of our watch and jewelry business. 
In addition, we are pleased to announce the fall debut of a new fragrance for women called Wanderlust [ph]. The new scent will have global appeal evoking infinite desire for adventure, romance and discovery. The new fragrance line will initially be offered exclusively in our North America resale stores before becoming available globally in both our retail stores and through our wholesale partners. We will be supporting the launch with a compelling marketing campaign, which includes print, TV and social media, featuring Lily Aldridge and Wouter Peelen. We believe this new collection will allow us to capitalize on the growing momentum in fragrance and beauty and further increase our penetration in this category. 
Turning to our product categories. We saw growth in our accessories category led by new handbag groups introduced this spring, including our denim styles, the quilted Sloan shoulder bag, our Savannah satchel and Hayley tote. In addition, our backpacks continued to resonate well with customers. 
Total accessory sales on a retail basis grow at low double digits globally. In North America, we saw weakness in the category in the wholesale channel. However, we experienced strong double-digit growth in accessories in our own retail stores. While the momentum in our small bags, crossbodies and small leather goods as well as promotional activity continued to impact AUR in the quarter, units sold increased double digits once again, which indicates continued demand for our luxury product offering. 
We also saw another solid quarter for growth in our footwear business as Michael Kors has become a dominant brand in this category. We offered a broad array of styles, with performance led by the strength in fashion, active footwear as well as espadrilles and casual sandals, including our MK slide and warm platform styles. Customers also responded well to new designs detailing, particularly the perforated floral designs of the Olivia active slip-on and denim styles of Ollie high-top sneaker and Darci espadrille. 
We are extremely pleased with the performance of our men's sportswear and leather goods business, which is showing strong momentum. The men's collection embodies effortless style with a modern edge for the confident, connected and adventurous Michael Kors man. While men's is still a small portion of our overall revenue, I'm confident that this will be an integral part of our business as we evolve into a leading men's luxury brand. 
During the year, we opened 117 shop-in-shops globally. In addition, we extended our men's presence at retail with the opening of 2 stand-alone stores as well as through the addition of our men's offering in 9 of our existing stores in North America, Europe and Asia. During fiscal 2017, we plan to open approximately 10 retail locations and 150 men's shops -- shop-in-shops globally. Long term, we continue to believe that our men's business represents a $1 billion revenue opportunity for Michael Kors. 
Turning to our international business. As announced in our press release this morning, we completed the acquisition of our Greater China license and are extremely excited about the tremendous growth opportunity this market has to offer. We believe that by taking direct control of this market, we can better leverage our infrastructure across Asia and make a greater impact on the expansion of our business in this region. 
As you know, we have been working diligently over the past several years to build the infrastructure, establish the brand and grow the acceptance of Michael Kors across Asia. We believe that we are on a strong trajectory with a rapidly growing following among Chinese, Japanese, Korean and Southeast Asian consumers. This makes it an ideal time for us to take direct control of the China operations, integrate it into our business and unlock the enormous potential in this market. 
For the most recent year, Michael Kors product was available in 97 company-operated and travel retail doors across Mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan, and the Greater China business generated nearly $200 million in revenue. Long term, we believe that the China business represents a $500 million revenue opportunity based on our assessment of the market and the growing demand for the Michael Kors brand. 
In addition, we are pleased to see the strong trends in our Korea business since we took the license in-house in the -- this past January. Customer demand for Michael Kors brand is growing, and we will continue to invest in this region through new store expansion. We currently have 36 retail stores and concession shops in South Korea and believe we can ultimately expand to 50 locations, generating revenues of approximately $100 million. 
Turning to other Asia regions. We are extremely pleased with the ongoing momentum in Japan as we continue to see double-digit revenue gains and growing brand awareness. We continue to believe that Japan will ultimately reach $300 million in revenue. In Hong Kong, where we established distribution operations to service duty-free retail locations and our Southeast Asian licensed operations, we see a $100 million revenue opportunity as we continue to grow this business. Combined, our Asian markets in total represent a $1 billion opportunity for the company. 
In conclusion, Michael Kors remains a leader in the global luxury fashion market, with multiple long-term growth opportunities, including expansion across Asia, the launch of our digital flagships worldwide and the continued development of our men's business. In fiscal 2017, we expect our results to be challenged by a difficult retail environment pressured by weak traffic and tourism trends. We will respond by carefully managing our exposure to the U.S. wholesale channel, maintaining disciplined inventory controls and remaining committed to our relentless focus on designing world-class fashion product, driving brand engagement with compelling marketing programs and delivering a jet-set luxury shopping experience in our stores and our digital flagships. In addition, as our new $1 billion share repurchase program demonstrates, we are committed to enhancing shareholder value over the long term. 
Now let me turn it over to Joe for a detailed review of our fourth quarter financial results and our outlook for fiscal 2017."
143971118,337449444,994080,"Michael Kors Holdings Limited, 2016 Earnings Call, Jun 01, 2016",2016-06-01,"Earnings Calls","Capri Holdings Limited","Executives","Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased to report revenue and EPS results above our guidance. Total revenue grew 10.9% to $1.2 billion on a reported basis.

We are pleased to report revenue and EPS results above our guidance. Total revenue grew 10.9% to $1.2 billion on a reported basis. On a constant currency basis, total revenue grew 11.7%, driven by increases across the Americas, Europe and Asia of 5.1%, 18.1% and 212.1%, respectively. As a reminder, our fiscal year 2016 is a 53-week period versus a 52-week period in the prior year. As such, the results of our fiscal 2016 fourth quarter and full year include approximately $34 million of additional retail sales. Comp sale calculations exclude the 53rd week. 
In our retail segment, net sales increased 22.0% on a reported basis. In constant currency, retail net sales increased 23.4%, driven primarily by the opening of 142 net new stores since the fourth quarter of last year and strong performance of our digital flagships. Comp sales increased 0.3% on a reported basis. In constant currency, comp sales increased 1.5%. The increase is attributable to the positive comps in Europe and Japan, partially offset by a slight decrease in North America. Our U.S. digital flagship sales contributed 380 basis points to our North American comp performance in the quarter on a constant currency basis. 
In our wholesale segment, net sales grew 3.5%. On a constant currency basis, wholesale sales increased 4.0%, driven primarily by our footwear and accessories category as well as men's and growth in international markets. 
In our licensing segment, revenue decreased 13.6% as expected due to lower sales of watches as well as lower revenue related to eyewear as we anniversaried our launch with Luxottica and the final quarter of shipments from Marchon last year. 
Gross margin declined 20 basis points to 58.2%, which included a negative foreign currency transaction impact of approximately 100 basis points. The decline in gross margin is primarily due to a 120 basis point decline in retail gross margins attributable to additional markdowns, largely offset by gross margin benefits related to changes in geographic and segment mix as we saw a 32.9% increase in sales from regions outside of the America and a 22% increase in retail net sales. 
Total operating expenses grew 20.9%. As a percentage of total revenue, total operating expenses increased 310 basis points to 37.8% primarily due to our investments in new stores, e-commerce and omnichannel capabilities, the buildout of our men's and Korea businesses, new shop-in-shops and infrastructure improvements as well as impairment charges related to retail and wholesale fixed assets. 
Income from operations was $244.1 million or 20.4% of total revenue as compared to 23.7% of total revenue in the same period last year. Retail operating margin declined 360 basis points due to the decline of retail gross margins, as discussed earlier, and a 240 basis point increase in operating expenses primarily due to higher depreciation related to the fixed asset write-off mentioned earlier as well as investments in our new stores and digital flagships. Wholesale operating margin declined 190 basis points primarily due to higher operating expenses related to the fixed asset write-off noted earlier. 
Licensing operating margin increased 80 basis points primarily due to lower advertising costs during the quarter, partially offset by higher costs associated with intellectual property protection. 
Income taxes were $69.2 million in the quarter, and our effective tax rate was 28.2% as compared to 29.4% in the same period last year. The decrease in our effective tax rate was primarily due to the increase in taxable income in certain of our non-U.S. subsidiaries, which are subject to lower statutory income tax rates. 
Net income was $177.0 million for the fourth quarter, and diluted earnings per share were $0.98. The unfavorable currency impact on EPS was $0.02 per share. 
Turning to our balance sheet. At the end of the quarter, cash and cash equivalents were $702.0 million. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 3.7 million shares totaling $200 million under our share repurchase program. Since the inception of this program in 2014, we have repurchased almost 32 million shares or 15% of our outstanding shares, totaling approximately $1.6 billion. As of April 2, 2016, the remaining availability under the company's share repurchase program was $358.1 million. 
We are very pleased to announce that the company's Board of Directors authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase program, which replaces the remaining balance of the previous program authorized in October 2014. The new authorization further demonstrates our confidence in our long-term business outlook. We will continue to use the strength of our balance sheet and future cash flows to repurchase additional shares and drive value for our shareholders. 
Inventory increased 5.2% versus last year, representing a slower growth rate than total revenue in the fourth quarter. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $79.0 million and were related to the buildout of new retail stores and shop-in-shops as well as investments in our distribution facilities, our corporate offices and other infrastructure improvements. 
We added 45 net new stores in the fourth quarter. We opened 2 locations in the Americas, 6 in Europe and 41 in Asia, which includes the 36 stores we assumed in South Korea, and closed 4 locations in Brazil. In addition, we expanded or relocated 3 stores and converted 136 wholesale doors into shop-in-shops globally. 
Before turning to our outlook for next year, let me provide you with some insight into the acquisition of the Greater China license, which was completed on May 31 for $500 million in cash subject to certain adjustments. We had said earlier on that meaningful investment and dedicated resources would be required to develop the China business given the complexity of this market. We also indicated that once this business had reached a certain size and level of profitability, we would consider bringing it in-house. 
Following considerable evaluation, we determined that based upon the size of the operations, the level of brand recognition Michael Kors has reached and the platform that has been established, it is the right time to acquire the China business. This acquisition will enable us to leverage the infrastructure and the team to further expand our presence and meaningfully grow our business across Asia. We believe that Asia represents a $1 billion revenue opportunity, and with this acquisition, we are positioned to capitalize on the growth potential in the market. 
The Greater China business generated total revenue of $197 million last fiscal year and had a network of 91 company-operated stores and 6 travel retail locations across China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan. For fiscal 2017, we expect the acquisition to contribute approximately $200 million to retail net sales, reflecting sales for the 10-month period following the closing and to be neutral to earnings per share on a GAAP basis and accretive on a non-GAAP basis, excluding onetime acquisition costs. The acquisition is expected to be accretive beginning in fiscal 2018 and thereafter. Overall, we believe that this strategic acquisition was the right decision for our company and for our long-term growth. 
Turning to our outlook. For the full fiscal year 2017, we expect total revenue to be flat versus the prior year. As we look across the businesses, we expect retail net sales to increase in the mid-teens percentage range for the year, driven by growth in our digital flagships and new store openings in addition to the acquisition of the China business. Comp sales are expected to decline in the low single digits. Wholesale sales are expected to decline in the high-teens percentage range. 
As John discussed earlier, the North American retail environment remains highly promotional. We will be reducing inventory in this channel in order to protect our margins and brand image. We believe that this will lead to faster inventory returns of new product and a decrease in markdown activity, which will ultimately result in higher gross margins and improve the overall health of the business. 
The outlook for lower wholesale sales is also due to the integration of the China business. As a reminder, in 2016, wholesale sales through our Greater China licensee totaled $62.8 million. 
Lastly, we expect licensing revenue to decline in the mid-teens percentage range as a result of continued softness in the watch category and a decrease in licensing revenue related to the acquisition of the Greater China license. 
For fiscal 2016, licensing revenue from Greater China license totaled $7.6 million. By geography, we anticipate a high single-digit decline in total revenue for the Americas region due to lower wholesale and licensing revenue. We expect continued revenue expansion in our international markets with a high single-digit increase in Europe and a triple-digit increase in Asia. We expect gross margin expansion in 2017 of 110 to 140 basis points as we continue to benefit from changes in geographic and segment mix. This will be offset by an increase in operating expense. 
We expect deleverage in -- on operating expense as we continue to invest in our long-term growth, including upgrading our CRM systems, launching our digital flagship in Europe, building infrastructure in our China and Korea businesses, expanding our men's business and transitioning to our Venlo warehouse as we plan to operate 2 facilities until we fully transition to our new facility in early calendar 2017. 
In addition, we expect to incur $15 million of onetime transaction costs and other contingency payments related to the acquisition of our Greater China licensee and $3 million of onetime costs related to the closure of certain locations in Latin America. 
As a result, fiscal 2017 operating margin is expected to be approximately 21.5% on a non-GAAP basis, excluding the onetime costs mentioned earlier. On a GAAP basis, operating margin is expected to be approximately 21%. We expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $4.56 to $4.64 for the year on a non-GAAP basis, excluding the onetime costs noted earlier, and $4.47 to $4.55 on a GAAP basis, including the onetime costs. This assumes a tax rate of approximately 21% and 171 million shares outstanding. 
Capital expenditures are expected to total approximately $250 million for the fiscal year 2017 and will focus on ongoing investments in global digital strategies and omnichannel capabilities; global retail expansion, including approximately 15 new stores in the Americas, 20 in Europe and 40 in Asia; the conversion of approximately 275 wholesale shop-in-shops globally; and the company's global distribution infrastructure, information systems and corporate facilities. 
For the first quarter, we expect total revenue to be between $940 million and $955 million and a mid-single-digit decrease in comp sales. We expect a decline in gross margin of approximately 100 basis points. We anticipate an increase in operating expense as we continue to invest in our international expansion, digital flagships and global infrastructure. Operating expenses as a percent of total revenue is expected to increase 690 to 740 basis points on a non-GAAP basis, excluding the onetime costs I noted earlier, resulting in operating margin of approximately 17%. On a GAAP basis, including the onetime costs, operating expenses as a percentage of total revenue is expected to increase 880 basis points to 930 basis points, resulting in an operating margin of approximately 15%. 
We expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.70 to $0.74 on a non-GAAP basis, excluding the onetime costs noted earlier, and $0.62 to $0.66 on a GAAP basis, including the onetime costs. This assumes a tax rate of approximately 21% and 177 million shares outstanding. 
During fiscal 2017, we will be resetting our base in our North America wholesale business and expect to resume sales growth in fiscal 2018. As we reduce our lower-margin North American wholesale business and gain other margin benefits associated with favorable geographic and segment mix, we expect to see continued gross margin expansion in fiscal 2018. We continue to believe that we will be poised to deliver both sales and earnings growth over the long term. 
I will now turn the call back to John for closing remarks."

We have enormous potential to build our Asia business with the acquisition of our Greater China license, in addition to an expansion in South Korea, Japan and Southeast Asia, which, combined, represents a $1 billion market opportunity. 
We are extremely pleased with the growing momentum of our men's business and remain confident that this has the long-term potential to be a $1 billion business.

And the -- as Joe indicated before, I think it's about $63 million of the wholesale decline belongs to the acquisition of China, and so you have to kind of factor that into the numbers. And let me just explain to you what our thinking is. Again, first off, we have built a very solid business with department stores, not only domestically but internationally. We think the channel is a very strong channel across the world, great banners that we operate our brand inside of. And we support them 100% in good times and in difficult times. That being said, what has happened in North America in particular, and you're starting to see a little bit of it in Europe, is that as mall traffic has declined, stores have taken an aggressive position on promotional activity to generate volume and traffic into their buildings. And we have seen that magnify over the last 12 months, and we believe that, that long term is not healthy for the Michael Kors brand. And as I've said to you before and we just said it in the script, we grew our handbag business globally. I mean, that's -- so our customer -- that's in dollars. Our customer continues to respond to the brand. I see constant communication from various press-related things about the brand is dead or losing its vibrancy, et cetera, and that's just flat out not true. And along with that, we're shipping double-digit unit increases. So we think that that's too many units going into the marketplace. And we believe that by us reducing the amount of product going into the wholesale channel, we will actually create a healthier environment for our department store customers and partners and ourselves. There'll be less product, there'll be more demand, and that demand will be more at full price versus sale. And I want to further add that many of you have the opportunity to come up and see our fall product offerings. We're really excited about that. Our own stores, our retail partners have let us know that we're heading in the right direction in terms of trend. I also mentioned to you we're the second or third largest handbag company in the world. So we have an obligation, and we have an authority to really set the tone for fashion and for luxury. And we're going to use that authority until we have 70 -- 750 company-owned stores, 100 stores that are licensed. So we have an 850-store network globally that is incredibly positioned. And the power of that, with what Michael and the design team are going to be delivering for fall season, we've already seen the beginning of that in spring, we think, is going to continue to propel the business forward. And we're very, very pleased about that. So we think the strategy that we're taking, while obviously reduces our revenue on the top line, is going to be much healthier for us. Joe indicated that we're actually going to have our gross margin expansion, and that's because, as we look at geography and retail kind of tilting, that's a better thing for us. So we just like the strategy altogether. I want to be 100% clear: we believe in our department store partners, we think they're doing a great job with our brand, and we want to continue to be one of the great assets that they have to help bring customers into their building. And we like their customers. We think they're terrific Kors loyalists. Secondly, in terms of the Exclusively Ours, the strategy there is to do 2 things: number one, yes, to distinguish a bit between our freestanding stores and some of our department store shops around the world; and secondly, to be able to have product that could be promoted less, quite frankly. And you're going to actually see even more of that coming for the fall season and certain groups that will not be promoted both in our own stores and in the department store environment as well. We know that the promotional activity is even more prevalent from a visibility standpoint for the customer because of digital. So we've got to take a different approach to how the customer sees our product and really stand behind the newness. We'll give that product an opportunity to develop and market behind that. And on your third question regarding China, we have -- our license has built out an extraordinary network of stores. We are in the best locations, just like we are in the United States, just like we are in Europe. We sit next to the finest luxury brands from Europe, whether it's Vuitton or Prada or Gucci. We're right in the same shopping malls and same streets, et cetera. I would also say that we got lucky. We did not have a overdevelopment of Hong Kong, in particular, which, as you know, is struggling as a marketplace. So the good news for us is we only have a handful of locations there. So that presents an opportunity for the future, but it also really avoids a very big negative. As you know, many companies are suffering in that marketplace. Mainland China and Taiwan are double-digit comps. Just moving along very, very nicely. And the brand has tremendous opportunity to grow in those marketplaces. And lastly, just on that note, as you know, the Chinese are traveling all over the world. So again, even as we build out the business in the region, there's even more to come for us across the globe with that customer. So thank you very much, Kimberly, and great questions."

Could you may be parse out a little bit more in North America? What you're seeing in terms of the account base? Are you closing doors or is it just a start to pull back across several categories? And then if you could just maybe speak a little bit more in detail on the wholesale side. What are you assuming in terms of some of the category [indiscernible]?

As you know, most of the locations that we're in today in our department store partners are shop-in-shops. And there are no shop-in-shop closings. So we are highly productive. Just like our freestanding stores, we're top 10 in almost every single mall around the world in terms of our productivity per square foot. We're in the same position, and obviously, in certain categories, we're #1 in terms of -- in department stores. We're #1 in terms of sales per square foot in those various departments. So that's not an issue at all. The real issue for us is analyzing the amount of inventory that is being sold on sale versus full price. That's what we have to look at. And we believe that selling more product at full price is better for our brand image and better for our margins long term. So again, as Joe indicated earlier, this is a reset for us that will take probably 12, maybe a little longer about 15 months to get through. But we ultimately believe that as a luxury fashion-led brand, we don't want it to be about price, we want it to be about new product introduction. And in terms of -- you asked about categories. I would say, the predominant reduction will be coming from our accessories category. That's where we see, as I said to you earlier, that just too many units moving into the marketplace. Now while we love the fact that consumers are responding to our product and buying more of it priced by lot -- and again, all of our consumer research shows that the brand engagement and the brand loyalty is at highest levels that it's ever been, and your analysis that you do annually indicate the same thing. So we just -- we don't like the amount of product that's ending up out in the marketplace. So this is not an issue of doors or anything like that. This is really more an issue of having the right amount of product given where we want to get back to in terms of full price selling versus promotional selling."

Erinn, obviously, we had a good quarter from a comp store standpoint, I think, globally compared to many of our competitors. I think we were close to best-in-class, because, again, remember, many of the European competitors are reporting on a reported basis. But when you really look at the constant currency, I think in Europe, in particular, we did better than most. That being said, we're definitely seeing the business stronger in -- as I mentioned in the last quarter, Italy and spain, and in certain of the Eastern European markets. Our business is -- for example, in Russia, is outstanding. Now that's not in our comp, but I'm just telling you, it's very, very strong there. On the other hand, we are seeing, as many luxury companies have reported, our business in the -- in France after the terrorist attacks has been very difficult and continues to decline given the tourism decline in that marketplace. We have had difficulty in the U.K. that was driven primarily -- or initially by currency changes. That's now kind of changed a little bit given that we got some issues that people are thinking about with Brexit, et cetera. So our business remains a bit of a challenge there. I would tell you, overall, in Europe, and I've seen some other luxury goods companies report this as well, we do see headwinds. Tourism into Europe is declining. There's a lot of macro issues in Europe. There was another terrorism alert that came out yesterday. So we believe that Europe, while it's still growth opportunities for us, as Joe indicated in terms of region, it's going to be a bumpy road in 2017. Until there is some issues settled politically, we're not exactly sure where the FX is going to end up for the year. And so we're going to stick very close to that. Again, growth market for us, but it's -- I think there's going to be a few bumps as we get through the year."

In terms of buyback, we really don't guide in terms of what we do. As you know, we tell you what the authorized shares -- or what the authorized amount is. We basically are opportunistically buying, and so we have never provided guidance as to when and how much we're going to buy."

We also understand that even our operating margins, even at 21.5%, I think of the third best in the luxury category of any luxury retailer in the world. We have a powerful business model that's generating tremendous amount of cash, and we have multiple growth opportunities. And as long as the stock remains, in our opinion, and it's just our opinion, significantly undervalued, we will be aggressively in the marketplace over the next year taking advantage. We've taken out 15% of our shares, and we're going to keep going. We have the balance sheet and cash flow to continue to do that. So you can be very sure that we're going to be returning value to our shareholders, particularly at this time, and we think that's going to bare a lot of fruit when people understand that Michael Kors is here to stay, powerful business model, one of the most profitable companies in the market, and we will continue to deliver great results."

And if you could give us some comments on your outlook for AUR in whole and by channel that will be super helpful.

When we took this company public, and you heard me say this many, many times, we said to you that North America would grow. It will eventually reach maturity. And that -- if that happens, Europe would come on. And if that happened, Asia would come on. And I think all of those things have played out as we have laid them out, with the exception of what's really happened in mall traffic in North America. I don't think any of us have the crystal ball to see that coming and, obviously, part of that is driven by the digital shift in the consumer behavior, and the other part of that is driven by -- in our case, and I know in some of our very, very valued department store partners cases -- and by the way, when I use that word department store, it's not just North America because not everyone has [indiscernible] focus on North America wholesale, but we have a lot of business around the world. Department stores in Europe are facing many challenges with traffic from tourism as well. So -- and the second thing we said when we went public was that this company ultimately would be 70%, 75% retail versus wholesale. Wholesale just grew faster than we had ever anticipated. And we enjoyed that. We think that's terrific, and we're going to continue to enjoy that. But that's -- we ultimately, first and foremost, are retailers. Ultimately, we believe that our store network, which will get to some thousand stores worldwide, will be the cornerstone of our development and growth. And it will be somewhere between 65% and 75% retail and the balance will be wholesale. And as you look at China, China is -- I mean -- sorry, Asia. Asia is basically all retail. Small wholesale business there with some Duty Free operators and a license business -- small license business there. And in Europe, Europe is going to -- has always been a business that will grow more quickly in retail because there's just more opportunity for us to do that. So again, I don't think that should be any surprise. That's kind of what we had laid out initially. We just were able to develop wholesale piece of it faster than the retail piece. In terms of SKUs, I'll go back to your first question. No, there's not going to be really any change in SKU. And if anything, I think when -- many of you came through our showrooms, you saw the amount of product innovation that our design teams are delivering is really quite exciting. And I think it's what the market needs. I've been very vocal on the fact that I think the market has had a malaise in terms of design. I think that the consumer needs to see something that's got more interest in terms of product and quality. And I think many of our competition is doing a great job. In particular, some of our European competitors are doing just an outstanding job with new product innovation. You'll see some additional things coming to bear very shortly on our website that will be exclusively on our website with products that we will be, quite frankly, building custom for consumers, but we think that that's going to become even more of an issue as people look at what's in their wardrobe and how we curate that for them. So there's going to be actually more customization that we're going to look at on a go-forward basis. You'll see some of that [indiscernible]. We'll talk about that in the next call. In terms of AUR, AUR declined in both channels. And in our retail channel, it was a bit more driven by size of bag than promotion, but clearly, promotion added to the decline in AUR. And in the wholesale channel, it was higher than our own channel. And that's just because there is more activity in that channel by more people and, of course, there's tremendous amount of price matching that goes on. So that's really added to a bit of the chaos of the situation that's happening in that particular channel. So thank you very much, Randy."

I think AUR is actually going to increase, and we told you -- again, I apologize, I don't remember if you were in the showroom walk through or not, but we said that AUR, we are actually focused on that, and we're doing that through kind of 3 things. First, we believe that by reducing the amount of inventory at retail that's available for sale, it's going to raise the AUR. Secondly, we are taking the smaller bags and we're offering more fashion design into those products, and actually offering higher price points. It was a strategy that Michael personally really came up with, and we think it's a brilliant strategy because it's not just the price that she's interested in the smaller bags, it's the size. So we believe that we probably actually been slightly under charging and slightly under designing in terms of where -- she'll definitely pay somewhere between $200 and $300 for a crossbody. Why can't we have more of them at the higher price point? And we -- so that you'll be seeing that coming to bear in the stores. And then also, we believe that one of the reasons why the predominant amount of handbags that many of us are selling are in that $300 to $350 range is because we really haven't been providing enough design to get the customer excited for higher price point product. And so that's coming -- and so that will actually raise the AUR for fall season on the floor inside the stores. So we feel very good about that strategy. Reduced units get AURs up, still being very competitive price points, because I don't want you think that we're having a complete shift in pricing, but we think that's the right thing to do, and we think the customer's response that because she's going to see the value in the design of the product."

Let me start with the industry. We believe that the North American handbag business is flat to down -- high -- sorry, low single digits in total.

We believe that the North American handbag business is flat to down -- high -- sorry, low single digits in total. I know that that's different from what some other people have reported, but that's just our belief. So we believe that the North American business, handbag business is about flat to down low single digits. And that's, I think, primarily because of the promoting that's going on. Obviously, units are up double digits, and I think it's for most of us. In -- and by the way, that includes luxury players too, because I know, many times, we have these conversations. There's only 2 other competitors that are referred to, but we see the same thing happening with multiple luxury companies, obviously, with the exclusion of Vuitton who doesn't operate in the sale environment, but many other companies are there. The amount that they're selling on sale is higher than the amount that they're selling at regular price this year versus last year. The -- we believe the macro handbag, luxury handbag market is relatively flat on a global basis, possibly up 1 point or 2. So -- and we believe that's going to be sort of the trend on a macro basis for the next year at least. And of course, you've sene that in the recent Altagamma-Bain luxury report, which echoed the same exact issues, with the exception of our point of view on the North American handbag market. We believe that there's softening that's continuing in mall traffic. We've actually seen an acceleration of softening in mall traffic. And this is not just our stores, this is what we see from ShopperTrak, which is a company that we use -- that looks at our -- that's looks at not only ours but other retailers numbers. So we compare ourselves to that on a pretty regular basis. So mall traffic continues to soften in North America. We do not see the tourism rebounding. So we're taking a slightly more pessimistic view of Q1 and Q2 for us. Q3 and Q4, we feel pretty optimistic about. And if you remember last year when we were sitting here at this time having this conversation, I know many people didn't believe we were going to be able to do what we did. And I understand why that's not a negative. But we did. We delivered on everything that we said we were going to do through the year, including the comps. In the back half of the year, we got some amazing things that are going to be happening for us. First and foremost, we're really seeing the e-commerce part of our business accelerate. You heard me -- we more than increased by over 50% our e-commerce sales this past year. And traffic remains strong, double-digit increases. And so what we need to have in place is this great CRM capability, which, today, we don't really have -- we have a fair CRM capability, but we're building out -- it's going to be, as I said earlier in the call, world-class. And that, we think, is going to give us the ability to do a lot of things in the back half of the year, which we're going to talk about in our next conference call. Everything from the spoke up offerings to curation, a specialty that we're going to be doing, and just the way we're able to engage with our customer. Second is our new product initiatives. Our introductions are very strong. I think it's the best product that we've shown since at least I've been here with this company. And again, Michael and the design teams have really done a tremendous job featuring what I consider to be the highest levels of innovation in our company and in terms of the materials and the silhouette, et cetera. So I think it's going to be powerful, and I think our customers are going to be extremely excited about the newness. Next is Kors ACCESS. Kors ACCESS is going to be a very big help for us. As you recall, we talk about 2 things constantly in those calls, North America and handbags. And we don't always remember we're a retail company, which I'd like to remind everybody on this call. We're a retail company. And secondly, we don't talk about the fact that watches have really -- have tremendous impact on our comp store sales. I mean, this is the #1 area that has hurt us in comp store sales over the last 2 years. And again, this is -- our partner, at Fossil, terrific people, doing a great job for us, and it's really been -- because people have moved to the iPhone and, to some degree, iWatch, but I think it's really more the switch to that. So Kors ACCESS is going to be a really powerful new innovative opportunity for our sales associates to communicate, engage with our customer. And then the trackers are going to be great. You know we've got some competitors out there. And I'll say that Fitbit is a competitor of ours, and we think that we're going to have the most innovation in terms of fashion in a tracker, any company in the world. And I'm being that strong about the statement. And we priced it from $95 to $150. We're going after this aggressively, and we think that's going to be an amazing opportunity for us, in particular, in the third quarter. And then lastly, we told you the launch of Wanderlust is always a big plus for us when we see that happen. Lots of television, marketing campaigns. Lauder has done an amazing job with this new fragrance with us, and Lauder has been just a terrific partner with us. And lastly, is going to be gifting. We did a great job last year with gifting and it really helped us in Q3. We told you about that. We've taken that to a whole new level for this year. So we -- this isn't full hockey stick, I don't want you to think of it that way, but we're going to have a very good third and fourth quarter in this company. Q2 will be okay, but Q3 and Q4 will be great. So thank you very much, Matt."

John, what is your thoughts from an industry and a company-specific strategy-wise regarding the reality of price matching? And also how mobile is really changing how the consumer shops, and how the path to purchase works in terms of multiple channels and thinking about mobile. And then also, John, I know, we've been following a lot of the luxury companies, and there's been a pretty sharp diversion to, say, Hong Kong, Macau versus Mainland. Is that something you're seeing? And how are your thoughts on the real estate in terms of what you're thinking about, as a lot of people are focused on real productivity per point of store in Asia versus distribution growth?"

And I also kno",775,"Well, I'm going to start with the price matching. My opinion of price matching is that it's a race to the bottom. So I believe that those people who want to participate in that, as a general rule, will ultimately see their business decline. And I also know that many people think that that's a way to protect their relationship with their customer. I think it's a way to devalue the relationship. It just basically means that they don't believe in -- when they do have a sale or an offering for the customer that it's illegitimate, they just offer anything at any time. So my personal opinion is it's a race to the bottom. I think mobile has definitely changed consumer shopping behavior. Everything from the way that people shop and -- which is obviously hurting mall traffic, because people -- we know they're beginning their journey online and ultimately -- we're still doing 90-plus percent of our business in North America in stores. So stores are still real. And while 1 day, I publicly said, we'll get 25%, 30% of our business in e-commerce, we're nowhere near that today. But that being said, we have to be very cognizant that consumer is starting and definitely creating her path to purchase on mobile, and we better be a part of that and be good at it and be influencing her through that journey. I want to note that we don't do the price matching thing, and our comps are, quite frankly, better than a lot of other people's comps who are doing all these types of things. So you can't continue to build your business, especially with the mobile view that tests your customer. It's all about price because that will ultimately just drive the AUR down, which will ultimately -- you can't sell enough units to make up for the dollars. It just doesn't work. But we do think that our new CRM groups that we're putting together here and the investments we're going to be making will give us the ability to really change the shopping experience. And Oliver, as you know, if you go onto our Flat Iron store, you'll see Kors concierges is up and live. It's a whole digital shopping experience with the customers that our sales associates are fully enabled with. We'll have 35 stores rolled out the next few months. And we're going to arm our customers with the ability to be the ultimate fashion stylist for their clients and be able to curate for them. And that's what people want. If you want to get away from price, it has to be product, it has to be innovation, and we believe strongly, it has to be curation. So that's our point of view on that. In terms of Hong Kong and Macau, as I said earlier, we got lucky. We have nice distribution in Macau. We're in some terrific locations. So there'll be no real estate changes in Macau. Obviously, our business is very difficult there and really not seeing any signs of any kind of recovery in that marketplace. Hong Kong, we do not have a large distribution there, a few points of distribution. Believe it or not, our Hong Kong business, I don't -- I can't 100% explain to you why, but over the last 60 days, it's actually showing signs of improvement. So I don't want to tell you that's a trend by any stretch of the imagination, but what was terrible before is now just kind of bad. So we feel good about where we are. And I would tell you that we are looking at real estate in Hong Kong as an opportunity for the company, especially since rents have come down significantly since their peak. So we'll be cautious. We'll continue to view things as where is the consumer shopping. Ultimately, Hong Kong is going to come back. Is it a year from now, is it 2 years from now, is it 5 years from now? Nobody knows, but Hong Kong will become a place that is important. The only thing I would add to that is what I think many luxury companies are seeing is there is a movement of the people who are coming to Hong Kong and Macau now are a bit more coming from Tier 2, 3 and 4 cities. The Tier 1 customer, who is still the -- probably the biggest average per spend customer, is moving into clearly Europe, clearly Japan, clearly Korea. So the average transaction that many people are seeing in those markets is slightly down because of just the customer mix."

And I know that people think that -- the Michael Kors brand is whatever. And as -- we look at the engagement, the following, it's driven by Michael's voice, first and foremost. I mean, people are so engaged with the -- whether it's Michael and Nina Agdal, and the glamour games that we put up, or whether it's the whole new campaign that we just shot in Mexico for summer and all the different videos, or if it's the Mother's Day campaign, which was a huge success for us, with Alessandra Ambrosio, or whether it's Lily Aldridge doing a whole sneaker campaign for us. So I think we're really good as a company. And our teams are excellent at developing content that is engaging. And it's exciting the customer and keeping them engaged with the brand. They may not actually shop from that, but I think they love being a part of the Michael Kors family. And so I think in today's world, you have to be there. I mean, look at our major competitors in Europe, and everyone is upping the game, whether it's fashion shows in Rio or Blenheim Castle, or whatever the things are, you have to understand that we're in the business of exciting people. And that's fun, quite frankly. That's the fun part about what we get to do hear everyday. Products, first, but quite frankly, marketing and brand and exciting and engaging the customers, second.

First off, Omar, thank you for your questions, and thank you for your one comment that it is true that our -- the traffic issue is not a Michael Kors issue. This is an issue  -- I don't know one retailer that I speak to who isn't seeing this happenin",865,"Yes. First off, Omar, thank you for your questions, and thank you for your one comment that it is true that our -- the traffic issue is not a Michael Kors issue. This is an issue  -- I don't know one retailer that I speak to who isn't seeing this happening. And Omar, I would first start by calling the traffic thing a behavioral change. And again, I think many times that we're the first company or the most honest company to come out and say, ""These traffic trends are starting to see in other places in the world."" So mall traffic is declining in Europe now. It's declining in the U.K., in particular. And I would tell you that in the most sophisticated digital markets is where you see the most mall traffic slowing. So we start out, and this is just our theory and just our hypothesis, that consumers who have high levels of digital product availability are shopping less in shopping malls. And U.K. is a perfect example. As Harris and Selfridges and House of Fraser and John Lewis all got better with e-commerce, there's just more business going there, and we know that because we do business with them. We see how much percentage-wise. The U.K., for us, has some of the highest levels of penetration with our department store partners anywhere else in the world. So somewhere between 25% and 35% of our business with those retailers comes from online. And they're the most sophisticated at click and collect, they're the most sophisticated at same-day delivery service. They do it better than any department store in the world -- in the U.K. But that's affecting mall traffic. So we think that's only going to continue on because people are just going to get better. We'll be announcing shortly some cities in the United States where we'll be providing same-day service, and so on and so forth. And actually, we believe that one of the most important ways that we're going to compete globally is with delivery. And delivery, one of the things that we have, which many people were concerned about, are the amount of locations that we have, both in North America and internationally. It's actually going to be a strength for us, because we will be able to offer same-day delivery. And unfortunately, probably for free. But that's going to be the new norm. And so we have to deal with that behaviorally. So what are we going to do to drive traffic into the stores? Well, first and foremost, we believe that creative marketing leads the way. So we have to inspire the customer with new product delivered in creative marketing. And again, I think our teams -- I think we're world-class in -- if we're launching a new bag, building campaigns around that, that involve everything from Michael himself personally to certain celebrities that we make sure that the product appears on, to digital marketing campaigns and print campaigns. We're furthering that by being able to arm our sales associates with Kors concierge, which gives them the ability, and I just actually saw it demonstrated yesterday and it's phenomenal, where they can talk directly one on one. So it's not just a corporate communication, but now you got the sales associate in the store talking to their client directly through this new curation device platform that we've built that says, ""Not only does this bag commits, but here is the shoe and the dress and the jewelry that -- and the watch that's going to go with this. Why don't you come on in and let's have a conversation."" So we believe that this is going to be one on one dialogue with the customer. And we're really looking at it from the top of the funnel to the bottom of the funnel. We are not pulling back on our marketing and, in fact, we're increasing marketing. So part of the SG&A increase that you see is an increase in marketing. I made the decision a few months ago, even when we decided to reduce our wholesale business in North America, it would have been easy for us to go in and cut expenses all over the company and make up a lot of the gross profit dollars that we lost. But we made the decision that, that wasn't smart for us that we were building a long-term company, we're building a long-term relationship, and we need to drive customers into the store and you have to spend money to do that with marketing. And I think you're going to see the fruits of that between our communication efforts, our CRM and then ultimately, Kors concierge. If it works the way we think it's going to work, we'll be able to drive traffic into the stores. Is it going to be positive traffic? I'm not sure, to be frank with you. I think that's probably wishful thinking. But I think we will be able to stay in a level that will help us have comp store increases. And again, we're getting excellent conversion rates inside the stores, and we just think that's going to continue forward."

Lindsay, I'll tell you about all the things that we really did well, and I'm going to tell you about some that didn't work as well for us. And expanding the stores, we did a handful of them. It really hasn't been a great return for us. So I would tell you that we're not going to do that. That's kind of over -- there will be a handful of select locations where we'll do that, but you'll be able to count those on your 2 hands. And there'll be more flagshipy type things. We just did it in London and -- which happens to be working, thank God. But where we did them in more regional locations, it really didn't provide the uplift from a profitability standpoint that we were anticipating. So unless we see something changing on that, that will not be part of our strategy going forward. And in terms of outlets in North America, we're basically done at this point. I think there is 1 or 2 more that we're going to open and its over with. So -- and that's pretty much worldwide also, but there'll be a handful that we'll open in a couple of locations, but we're pretty much finished out on that. And then over the next 2 years, maybe 3 years, we'll be finished with our global store expansion. I want to mention one other thing to -- that -- again, we remain a very highly productive on a sales per square foot basis, again, top -- usually in most centers -- usually in top 5, but -- let's it call top 10 in the world.

Once -- now that, that is complete, we will selectively be looking at other companies as we move forward.

Good morning, and welcome to Michael Kors Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2016 Earnings Call. Reflecting on fiscal 2016, we achieved another record year with total revenue growth of 8%, reaching $4.7 billion, and an earnings per share increase",2689,"Thank you, Krystyna. Good morning, and welcome to Michael Kors Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2016 Earnings Call. Reflecting on fiscal 2016, we achieved another record year with total revenue growth of 8%, reaching $4.7 billion, and an earnings per share increase of 4% to $4.44 per share. On a constant currency basis, total revenue and EPS grew 12% and 8%, respectively. I'm proud of the entire Michael Kors team and what we have accomplished over the course of the year. 
Beyond delivering strong financial performance, we raised the level of fashion innovation and newness in our product assortments. Michael and the design team elevated our product offering with new trend-leading silhouettes, textures, colors and materials, which were met with a positive response from our customers. 
Our North American digital flagship business more than doubled in fiscal 2017. We also launched our digital flagship in Canada and developed a global platform that will enable us to launch our digital flagships across international markets. 
We opened a net total of 142 retail stores globally, 47 in the Americas and 95 internationally. We also opened several flagship stores in renowned luxury retail locations across the globe, including the Ginza district in Tokyo, Beijing and Stockholm with great success. More recently, we opened our largest flagship location in Europe on Regent Street in London, featuring our latest store design concept, and plan to open our Singapore flagship later this year. 
We have developed a platform to support accelerated growth in Asia. First, we transitioned our South Korean license in-house in January and have successfully integrated the region into our business. We also established our Hong Kong wholesale distribution operations, which enable us to provide even greater service and support to our Asian customers. 
In addition, we are pleased to announce that we have completed the acquisition of our Greater China license, which fits perfectly into our growth strategy in Asia. We believe that Asia will ultimately be a billion dollar market and that this acquisition is the cornerstone for our growth plan in this region. 
We accelerated the rollout of our menswear line with new and innovative designs in sportswear and leather goods. While we are still in the early stages, we are pleased with the strong momentum in this business as we expand our presence at retail and in the wholesale channel. This is another area of business that we believe will drive long-term growth for the company. 
Finally, we continued to make enhancements to our infrastructure in order to support our long-term sustainable growth. During the year, we took our North American e-commerce fulfillment operations in-house, enabling us to better and more efficiently service customers in this channel. We also further enhanced our omnichannel capabilities, allowing us to capture additional sales as our customers' shopping behaviors change. And to support our growth in Europe, we built out our distribution center in Venlo, Holland, with our e-commerce operations launching in midsummer this year and our operations for retail and wholesale going live in early calendar 2017. 
We ended 2016 on a strong note, with fourth quarter total revenues and EPS growth ahead of our expectations. Total revenue increased 11% on a reported basis and 12% on a constant currency basis, driven by growth in both our retail and wholesale channels as well as across geographies. Earnings per share increased 9% to $0.98 on a reported basis and grew 11% on a constant currency basis. 
While slower mall traffic trends, the decline in tourism in North America as well as certain European cities and FX headwinds all remained a challenge for the industry as a whole, we were able to deliver solid results, which we believe is a testament to our world-class design team, exceptional product offerings, integrated marketing campaigns and the lasting connection that we have fostered with our customers. 
Our retail business delivered solid growth across geographies, driven by strong double-digit sales increases in our digital flagships and new store openings. Our global comparable sales increased 0.3% on a reported basis. In constant currency, our comparable sales rose 1.5%, which was in line with our guidance and was primarily driven by strong performance in our accessories and footwear categories. 
While we saw a slight decline in North American comps on a constant currency basis in the fourth quarter, Europe comps increased in the mid-single digits, and comps in Japan rose in the strong double digits. Mall traffic in North America continued to decline during the quarter. However, we once again saw a significant increase in conversion rates in our own retail stores as customers responded favorably to our new product offerings. 
Sales in our digital flagships once again showed significant growth in the fourth quarter. We believe that our digital flagships represent a meaningful growth opportunity, and we will continue to expand this business globally as we launch in Europe this fall. 
We continue to build upon our omnichannel capabilities and remained focused on seamlessly integrating the customer shopping experience across all touch points as well as taking steps to enhance our mobile shopping experience. We look forward to seeing the benefit of these efforts over the coming year. 
We are currently undertaking a project to significantly elevate our CRM and data science capabilities. In parallel, we are investing in talent and technology in order to incorporate learning from the customer insights we are gaining. We will continue to capitalize on our CRM capabilities and Michael's voice to gain a competitive advantage by evolving our customer-centric marketing. 
In addition, data science-driven segmentation enables us to personalize Michael's message, allowing us to strengthen the relationship between our brand and our most loyal customers. We believe that having a deep understanding of our customer behavior allows us to better excite and engage the customer, introducing services and products from our lifestyle portfolio curated just for her. As you know, we have a strong and influential online presence as consumers turn to Michael Kors for fashion insights, and we continue to see our fan base grow across all social media platforms, further demonstrating the power of our brand. 
Sales in our wholesale business grew 4% for the quarter on a reported basis, which was ahead of our expectations. Europe wholesale sales were flat on a reported basis and grew 2% in constant currency, while in Asia, we saw significant growth of nearly 8x -- 18x to $27 million. 
In North America, the department store channel remained challenged. However, the new spring collection we introduced were well received, with strong sell-throughs in the fourth quarter. We believe that the North America retail environment remains highly promotional, which is impacting the long-term brand equity of Michael Kors. We will be actively decreasing our exposure to the wholesale channel by reducing inventory levels to focus on a higher level of full-priced sell-throughs and a lower level of markdowns. While this strategy is expected to result in a meaningful decrease in wholesale net sales in fiscal 2017, we believe that it is the right strategy for the overall health of our business long term as we protect our margins and brand equity. 
In our licensing segment, revenue declined during the quarter due to lower sales of watches as well as reduced sales in eyewear as we anniversaried our launch with Luxottica and the final quarter of shipments from Marchon last year. That said, we are pleased with the favorable response that we have seen to our new slim modern watch styles, particularly the Hartman and Jaryn case bodies, both of which are exceeding expectations. In addition, our updated jewelry offering featuring padlock motifs as well as our watch and jewelry gift set boxes also continued to perform well. 
In eyewear, our spring fashion styles, the new round Kendall and the cat -- Abela [ph] were met with strong response, and we are seeing positive sales momentum in our eyewear offerings globally. We remain a global trend leader in watches and jewelry with our entrance into the connected fashion accessories category. 
This fall, we will introduce our new wearable technology accessories line, beginning with MICHAEL KORS ACCESS display watch -- smartwatches. This launch is geared towards the fashion-focused consumer and features a smart timepiece that focuses on glamorous style and innovative design. MICHAEL KORS ACCESS combines the cutting-edge technology that our partner, Google, is known for with the chic and glamorous fashion aesthetics of the Michael Kors luxury brand. These smartwatches will be available in 2 styles: the Dylan and Bradshaw, with price points between $395 and $595. 
This is truly a unique accessory featuring an exclusive custom display dial experience, which you can change with just a swipe. With hundreds of different display options, you can set your watch face to a glittering pavé that complements your outfit by night and switch to a digital chronograph that shows your fitness stats at the gym the next morning. Certain watches will feature interchangeable wristbands and will be available for both men and women. 
Powered by Google's Android Wear operating system, the touchscreen display smartwatches include social media updates, text, phone call and email alerts, app notifications, smart health from Google Now, voice control of device and services via Ok Google and, of course, built-in fitness tracking. 
As part of our unified wearable strategy, we are also launching 3 styles of smart jewelry: the Crosby, Reid [ph] and Thompson [ph], available in multiple colors, platings and in a variety of bands. These modern styles are designed to give our customer a fitness tracker that is fashionable and that she will want to wear every day either alone or as a complement to her jewelry. Smart jewelry will feature activity tracking, sleep monitoring and linked remote control functionality and will be priced from $95 to $145. 
Initially, the wearable technology will be a small piece of our overall business in terms of revenue. However, as I've said in the past, based on our previous success in watches and jewelry, we believe that we can quickly become a fashion leader in this category. Long term, the wearable technology category will become a pivotal component of our watch and jewelry business. 
In addition, we are pleased to announce the fall debut of a new fragrance for women called Wanderlust. The new scent will have global appeal evoking infinite desire for adventure, romance and discovery. The new fragrance line will initially be offered exclusively in our North America retail stores before becoming available globally in both our retail stores and through our wholesale partners. We will be supporting the launch with a compelling marketing campaign, which includes print, TV and social media, featuring Lily Aldridge and Wouter Peelen. We believe this new collection will allow us to capitalize on the growing momentum in fragrance and beauty and further increase our penetration in this category. 
Turning to our product categories. We saw growth in our accessories category led by new handbag groups introduced this spring, including our denim styles, the quilted Sloan shoulder bag, our Savannah satchel and Hayley tote. In addition, our backpacks continued to resonate well with customers. 
Total accessory sales on a retail basis grew at low double digits globally. In North America, we saw weakness in the category in the wholesale channel. However, we experienced strong double-digit growth in accessories in our own retail stores. While the momentum in our small bags, crossbodies and small leather goods as well as promotional activity continued to impact AUR in the quarter, units sold increased double digits once again, which indicates continued demand for our luxury product offering. 
We also saw another solid quarter for growth in our footwear business as Michael Kors has become a dominant brand in this category. We offered a broad array of styles, with performance led by the strength in fashion, active footwear as well as espadrilles and casual sandals, including our MK slide and Warren Platform styles. Customers also responded well to new designs detailing particularly the perforated floral designs of the Olivia active slip-on and denim styles of Ollie high-top sneaker and Darci espadrille. 
We are extremely pleased with the performance of our men's sportswear and leather goods business, which is showing strong momentum. The men's collection embodies effortless style with a modern edge for the confident, connected and adventurous Michael Kors man. While men's is still a small portion of our overall revenue, I'm confident that this will be an integral part of our business as we evolve into a leading men's luxury brand. 
During the year, we opened 117 shop-in-shops globally. In addition, we extended our men's presence at retail with the opening of 2 stand-alone stores as well as through the addition of our men's offering in 9 of our existing stores in North America, Europe and Asia. During fiscal 2017, we plan to open approximately 10 retail locations and 150 men's shops -- shop-in-shops globally. Long term, we continue to believe that our men's business represents a billion dollar revenue opportunity for Michael Kors. 
Turning to our international business. As announced in our press release this morning, we completed the acquisition of our Greater China license and are extremely excited about the tremendous growth opportunity this market has to offer. We believe that by taking direct control of this market, we can better leverage our infrastructure across Asia and make a greater impact on the expansion of our business in this region. 
As you know, we have been working diligently over the past several years to build the infrastructure, establish the brand and grow the acceptance of Michael Kors across Asia. We believe that we are on a strong trajectory with a rapidly growing following among Chinese, Japanese, Korean and Southeast Asian consumers. This makes it an ideal time for us to take direct control of the China operations, integrate it into our business and unlock the enormous potential in this market. 
For the most recent year, Michael Kors product was available in 97 company-operated and travel retail doors across Mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan, and the Greater China business generated nearly $200 million in revenue. Long term, we believe that the China business represents a $500 million revenue opportunity based on our assessment of the market and the growing demand for the Michael Kors brand. 
In addition, we are pleased to see the strong trends in our Korea business since we took the license in-house in the -- this past January. Customer demand for Michael Kors brand is growing, and we will continue to invest in this region through new store expansion. We currently have 36 retail stores and concession shops in South Korea and believe we can ultimately expand to 50 locations, generating revenues of approximately $100 million. 
Turning to other Asia regions. We are extremely pleased with the ongoing momentum in Japan as we continue to see double-digit revenue gains and growing brand awareness. We continue to believe that Japan will ultimately reach $300 million in revenue. In Hong Kong, where we established distribution operations to service duty-free retail locations and our Southeast Asian licensed operations, we see a $100 million revenue opportunity as we continue to grow this business. Combined, our Asian markets in total represent a billion dollar opportunity for the company. 
In conclusion, Michael Kors remains a leader in the global luxury fashion market, with multiple long-term growth opportunities, including expansion across Asia, the launch of our digital flagships worldwide and the continued development of our men's business. In fiscal 2017, we expect our results to be challenged by a difficult retail environment pressured by weak traffic and tourism trends. We will respond by carefully managing our exposure to the U.S. wholesale channel, maintaining disciplined inventory controls and remaining committed to our relentless focus on designing world-class fashion product, driving brand engagement with compelling marketing programs and delivering a jet-set luxury shopping experience in our stores and our digital flagships. In addition, as our new $1 billion share repurchase program demonstrates, we are committed to enhancing shareholder value over the long term. 
Now let me turn it over to Joe for a detailed review of our fourth quarter financial results and our outlook for fiscal 2017."
143971118,337449444,994305,"Michael Kors Holdings Limited, 2016 Earnings Call, Jun 01, 2016",2016-06-01,"Earnings Calls","Capri Holdings Limited","Executives","Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased to report revenue and EPS results above our guidance. Total revenue grew 10.9% to $1.2 billion on a reported basis. On a constant currency basis, total revenue grew 11.7%, driven by increases acr",1990,"Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased to report revenue and EPS results above our guidance. Total revenue grew 10.9% to $1.2 billion on a reported basis. On a constant currency basis, total revenue grew 11.7%, driven by increases across the Americas, Europe and Asia of 5.1%, 18.1% and 212.1%, respectively. As a reminder, our fiscal year 2016 is a 53-week period versus a 52-week period in the prior year. As such, the results of our fiscal 2016 fourth quarter and full year include approximately $34 million of additional retail sales. Comp sale calculations exclude the 53rd week. 
In our retail segment, net sales increased 22.0% on a reported basis. In constant currency, retail net sales increased 23.4%, driven primarily by the opening of 142 net new stores since the fourth quarter of last year and strong performance of our digital flagships. Comp sales increased 0.3% on a reported basis. In constant currency, comp sales increased 1.5%. The increase is attributable to the positive comps in Europe and Japan, partially offset by a slight decrease in North America. Our U.S. digital flagship sales contributed 380 basis points to our North American comp performance in the quarter on a constant currency basis. 
In our wholesale segment, net sales grew 3.5%. On a constant currency basis, wholesale sales increased 4.0%, driven primarily by our footwear and accessories category as well as men's and growth in international markets. 
In our licensing segment, revenue decreased 13.6% as expected due to lower sales of watches as well as lower revenue related to eyewear as we anniversaried our launch with Luxottica and the final quarter of shipments from Marchon last year. 
Gross margin declined 20 basis points to 58.2%, which included a negative foreign currency transaction impact of approximately 100 basis points. The decline in gross margin is primarily due to a 120 basis point decline in retail gross margins attributable to additional markdowns, largely offset by gross margin benefits related to changes in geographic and segment mix as we saw a 32.9% increase in sales from regions outside of the America and a 22% increase in retail net sales. 
Total operating expenses grew 20.9%. As a percentage of total revenue, total operating expenses increased 310 basis points to 37.8% primarily due to our investments in new stores, e-commerce and omnichannel capabilities, the buildout of our men's and Korea businesses, new shop-in-shops and infrastructure improvements as well as impairment charges related to retail and wholesale fixed assets. 
Income from operations was $244.1 million or 20.4% of total revenue as compared to 23.7% of total revenue in the same period last year. Retail operating margin declined 360 basis points due to the decline of retail gross margins, as discussed earlier, and a 240 basis point increase in operating expenses primarily due to higher depreciation related to the fixed asset write-off mentioned earlier as well as investments in our new stores and digital flagships. Wholesale operating margin declined 190 basis points primarily due to higher operating expenses related to the fixed asset write-off noted earlier. 
Licensing operating margin increased 80 basis points primarily due to lower advertising costs during the quarter, partially offset by higher costs associated with intellectual property protection. 
Income taxes were $69.2 million in the quarter, and our effective tax rate was 28.2% as compared to 29.4% in the same period last year. The decrease in our effective tax rate was primarily due to the increase in taxable income in certain of our non-U.S. subsidiaries, which are subject to lower statutory income tax rates. 
Net income was $177.0 million for the fourth quarter, and diluted earnings per share were $0.98. The unfavorable currency impact on EPS was $0.02 per share. 
Turning to our balance sheet. At the end of the quarter, cash and cash equivalents were $702.0 million. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 3.7 million shares totaling $200 million under our share repurchase program. Since the inception of this program in 2014, we have repurchased almost 32 million shares or 15% of our outstanding shares, totaling approximately $1.6 billion. As of April 2, 2016, the remaining availability under the company's share repurchase program was $358.1 million. 
We are very pleased to announce that the company's Board of Directors authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase program, which replaces the remaining balance of the previous program authorized in October 2014. The new authorization further demonstrates our confidence in our long-term business outlook. We will continue to use the strength of our balance sheet and future cash flows to repurchase additional shares and drive value for our shareholders. 
Inventory increased 5.2% versus last year, representing a slower growth rate than total revenue in the fourth quarter. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $79.0 million and were related to the buildout of new retail stores and shop-in-shops as well as investments in our distribution facilities, our corporate offices and other infrastructure improvements. 
We added 45 net new stores in the fourth quarter. We opened 2 locations in the Americas, 6 in Europe and 41 in Asia, which includes the 36 stores we assumed in South Korea, and closed 4 locations in Brazil. In addition, we expanded or relocated 3 stores and converted 136 wholesale doors into shop-in-shops globally. 
Before turning to our outlook for next year, let me provide you with some insight into the acquisition of the Greater China license, which was completed on May 31 for $500 million in cash subject to certain adjustments. We had said earlier on that meaningful investment and dedicated resources would be required to develop the China business given the complexity of this market. We also indicated that once this business had reached a certain size and level of profitability, we would consider bringing it in-house. 
Following considerable evaluation, we determined that based upon the size of the operations, the level of brand recognition Michael Kors has reached and the platform that has been established, it is the right time to acquire the China business. This acquisition will enable us to leverage the infrastructure and the team to further expand our presence and meaningfully grow our business across Asia. We believe that Asia represents a $1 billion revenue opportunity, and with this acquisition, we are positioned to capitalize on the growth potential in the market. 
The Greater China business generated total revenue of $197 million last fiscal year and had a network of 91 company-operated stores and 6 travel retail locations across China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan. For fiscal 2017, we expect the acquisition to contribute approximately $200 million to retail net sales, reflecting sales for the 10-month period following the closing and to be neutral to earnings per share on a GAAP basis and accretive on a non-GAAP basis, excluding onetime acquisition costs. The acquisition is expected to be accretive beginning in fiscal 2018 and thereafter. Overall, we believe that this strategic acquisition was the right decision for our company and for our long-term growth. 
Turning to our outlook. For the full fiscal year 2017, we expect total revenue to be flat versus the prior year. As we look across the businesses, we expect retail net sales to increase in the mid-teens percentage range for the year, driven by growth in our digital flagships and new store openings in addition to the acquisition of the China business. Comp sales are expected to decline in the low single digits. Wholesale sales are expected to decline in the high-teens percentage range. 
As John discussed earlier, the North American retail environment remains highly promotional. We will be reducing inventory in this channel in order to protect our margins and brand image. We believe that this will lead to faster inventory returns of new product and a decrease in markdown activity, which will ultimately result in higher gross margins and improve the overall health of the business. 
The outlook for lower wholesale sales is also due to the integration of the China business. As a reminder, in 2016, wholesale sales through [ph] our Greater China licensee totaled $62.8 million. 
Lastly, we expect licensing revenue to decline in the mid-teens percentage range as a result of continued softness in the watch category and a decrease in licensing revenue related to the acquisition of the Greater China license. 
For fiscal 2016, licensing revenue from Greater China license totaled $7.6 million. By geography, we anticipate a high single-digit decline in total revenue for the Americas region due to lower wholesale and licensing revenue. We expect continued revenue expansion in our international markets with a high single-digit increase in Europe and a triple-digit increase in Asia. We expect gross margin expansion in 2017 of 110 to 140 basis points as we continue to benefit from changes in geographic and segment mix. This will be offset by an increase in operating expense. 
We expect deleverage in -- on operating expense as we continue to invest in our long-term growth, including upgrading our CRM systems, launching our digital flagship in Europe, building infrastructure in our China and Korea businesses, expanding our men's business and transitioning to our Venlo warehouse as we plan to operate 2 facilities until we fully transition to our new facility in early calendar 2017. 
In addition, we expect to incur $15 million of onetime transaction costs and other contingency payments related to the acquisition of our Greater China licensee and $3 million of onetime costs related to the closure of certain locations in Latin America. 
As a result, fiscal 2017 operating margin is expected to be approximately 21.5% on a non-GAAP basis, excluding the onetime costs mentioned earlier. On a GAAP basis, operating margin is expected to be approximately 21%. We expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $4.56 to $4.64 for the year on a non-GAAP basis, excluding the onetime costs noted earlier, and $4.47 to $4.55 on a GAAP basis, including the onetime costs. This assumes a tax rate of approximately 21% and 171 million shares outstanding. 
Capital expenditures are expected to total approximately $250 million for the fiscal year 2017 and will focus on ongoing investments in global digital strategies and omnichannel capabilities; global retail expansion, including approximately 15 new stores in the Americas, 20 in Europe and 40 in Asia; the conversion of approximately 275 wholesale shop-in-shops globally; and the company's global distribution infrastructure, information systems and corporate facilities. 
For the first quarter, we expect total revenue to be between $940 million and $955 million and a mid-single-digit decrease in comp sales. We expect a decline in gross margin of approximately 100 basis points. We anticipate an increase in operating expense as we continue to invest in our international expansion, digital flagships and global infrastructure. Operating expenses as a percent of total revenue is expected to increase 690 to 740 basis points on a non-GAAP basis, excluding the onetime costs I noted earlier, resulting in operating margin of approximately 17%. On a GAAP basis, including the onetime costs, operating expenses as a percentage of total revenue is expected to increase 880 basis points to 930 basis points, resulting in an operating margin of approximately 15%. 
We expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.70 to $0.74 on a non-GAAP basis, excluding the onetime costs noted earlier, and $0.62 to $0.66 on a GAAP basis, including the onetime costs. This assumes a tax rate of approximately 21% and 177 million shares outstanding. 
During fiscal 2017, we will be resetting our base in our North America wholesale business and expect to resume sales growth in fiscal 2018. As we reduce our lower-margin North American wholesale business and gain other margin benefits associated with favorable geographic and segment mix, we expect to see continued gross margin expansion in fiscal 2018. We continue to believe that we will be poised to deliver both sales and earnings growth over the long term. 
I will now turn the call back to John for closing remarks."

We are extremely pleased with the growing momentum of our men's business and remain confident that this has the long-term potential to be a billion dollar business.

And again, for the broader group, I know we scheduled this call to be 1.5 hours, and I think you can understand why now with the acquisition of China and year-end and a lot of strategic changes we're making, so I thought it was a good idea to give the full time for people to ask questions. Kimberly, on your first question regarding our wholesale strategy, the majority of the wholesale decline will happen in North America. And the -- as Joe indicated before, I think it's about $63 million of the wholesale decline belongs to the acquisition of China, and so you have to kind of factor that into the numbers. And let me just explain to you what our thinking is. Again, first off, we have built a very solid business with department stores, not only domestically but internationally. We think the channel is a very strong channel across the world, great banners that we operate our brand inside of. And we support them 100% in good times and in difficult times. That being said, what has happened in North America in particular, and you're starting to see a little bit of it in Europe, is that as mall traffic has declined, stores have taken an aggressive position on promotional activity to generate volume and traffic into their buildings. And we have seen that magnify over the last 12 months, and we believe that, that long term is not healthy for the Michael Kors brand. And as I've said to you before and we just said it in the script, we grew our handbag business globally. I mean, that's -- so our customer -- that's in dollars. Our customer continues to respond to the brand. I see constant communication from various press-related things about the brand is dead or losing its vibrancy, et cetera, and that's just flat out not true. And along with that, we're shipping double-digit unit increases. So we think that that's too many units going into the marketplace. And we believe that by us reducing the amount of product going into the wholesale channel, we will actually create a healthier environment for our department store customers and partners and ourselves. There'll be less product, there'll be more demand, and that demand will be more at full price versus sale. And I want to further add that many of you have the opportunity to come up and see our fall product offerings. We're really excited about that. Our own stores, our retail partners have let us know that we're heading in the right direction in terms of trend. I also mentioned to you we're the second or third largest handbag company in the world. So we have an obligation, and we have an authority to really set the tone for fashion and for luxury. And we're going to use that authority and tone. We have 70 -- 750 company-owned stores, 100 stores that are licensed. So we have an 850-store network globally that is incredibly positioned. And the power of that, with what Michael and the design team are going to be delivering for fall season, we've already seen the beginning of that in spring, we think, is going to continue to propel the business forward. And we're very, very pleased about that. So we think the strategy that we're taking, while obviously reduces our revenue on the top line, it's going to be much healthier for us. Joe indicated that we're actually going to have our gross margin expansion, and that's because, as we look at geography and retail are kind of tilting, that's a better thing for us. So we just like the strategy altogether. I want to be 100% clear: we believe in our department store partners, we think they're doing a great job with our brand, and we want to continue to be one of the great assets that they have to help bring customers into their building. And we like their customers. We think they're terrific Kors loyalists. Secondly, in terms of the Exclusively Ours, the strategy there is to do 2 things: number one, yes, to distinguish a bit between our freestanding stores and some of our department store shops around the world; and secondly, to be able to have product that could be promoted less, quite frankly. And you're going to actually see even more of that coming for the fall season and certain groups that will not be promoted both in our own stores and in the department store environment as well. 
We know that the promotional activity is even more prevalent from a visibility standpoint for the customer because of digital. So we've got to take a different approach to how the customer sees our product and really stand behind the newness. We'll give that product an opportunity to develop and market behind that. And on your third question regarding China, we have -- our license has built out an extraordinary network of stores. We are in the best locations, just like we are in the United States, just like we are in Europe. We sit next to the finest luxury brands from Europe, whether it's Vuitton or Prada or Gucci. We're right in the same shopping malls and same streets, et cetera. I would also say that we got lucky. We did not have a overdevelopment of Hong Kong, in particular, which, as you know, is struggling as a marketplace. So the good news for us is we only have a handful of locations there. So that presents an opportunity for the future, but it also really avoids a very big negative. As you know, many companies are suffering in that marketplace. Mainland China and Taiwan are double-digit comps. Just moving along very, very nicely. And the brand has tremendous opportunity to grow in those marketplaces. And lastly, just on that note, as you know, the Chinese are traveling all over the world. So again, even as we build out the business in the region, there's even more to come for us across the globe with that customer. So thank you very much, Kimberly, and great questions."

As you know, most of the locations that we're in today in our department store partners are shop-in-shops. And there are no shop-in-shop closings. So we are highly productive. Just like our freestanding stores, we're top 10 in almost every single mall around the world in terms of our productivity per square foot. We're in the same position, and obviously, in certain categories, we're #1 in terms of -- in department stores. We're #1 in terms of sales per square foot in those various departments. So that's not an issue at all. The real issue for us is analyzing the amount of inventory that is being sold on sale versus full price. That's what we have to look at. And we believe that selling more product at full price is better for our brand image and better for our margins long term. So again, as Joe indicated earlier, this is a reset for us that will take probably 12, maybe a little longer about 15 months to get through. But we ultimately believe that as a luxury fashion-led brand, we don't want it to be about price, we want it to be about new product introduction. And in terms of -- you asked about categories. I would say, the predominant reduction will be coming from our accessories category. That's where we see, as I said to you earlier, that just too many units moving into the marketplace. Now while we love the fact that consumers are responding to our product and buying more of it by a lot, and again, all of our consumer research shows that the brand engagement and the brand loyalty is at highest levels that it's ever been, and your analysis that you do annually indicate the same thing. So we just -- we don't like the amount of product that's ending up out in the marketplace. So this is not an issue of doors or anything like that. This is really more an issue of having the right amount of product given where we want to get back to in terms of full price selling versus promotional selling."

Erinn, obviously, we had a good quarter from a comp store standpoint, I think, globally compared to many of our competitors. I think we were close to best-in-class, because, again, remember, many of the European competitors are reporting on a reported basis. But when you really look at the constant currency, I think in Europe, in particular, we did better than most. That being said, we're definitely seeing the business stronger in -- as I mentioned in the last quarter, Italy and Spain, and in certain of the Eastern European markets. Our business is -- for example, in Russia, is outstanding. Now that's not in our comp, but I'm just telling you, it's very, very strong there. On the other hand, we are seeing, as many luxury companies have reported, our business in the -- in France after the terrorist attacks has been very difficult and continues to decline given the tourism decline in that marketplace. We have had difficulty in the U.K. that was driven primarily -- or initially by currency changes. That's now kind of changed a little bit given that we got some issues that people are thinking about with Brexit, et cetera. So our business remains a bit challenged there. I would tell you, overall, in Europe, and I've seen some other luxury goods companies report this as well, we do see headwinds. Tourism into Europe is declining. There's a lot of macro issues in Europe. There was another terrorism alert that came out yesterday. So we believe that Europe, while it's still growth opportunities for us, as Joe indicated in terms of region, it's going to be a bumpy road in 2017. Until there is some issues settled politically, we're not exactly sure where the FX is going to end up for the year. And so we're going to stick very close to that. Again, growth market for us, but it's -- I think there's going to be a few bumps as we get through the year."

We have a powerful business model that's generating tremendous amount of cash, and we have multiple growth opportunities. And as long as the stock remains, in our opinion, and it's just our opinion, significantly undervalued, we will be aggressively in the marketplace over the next year taking advantage. We've taken out 15% of our shares, and we're going to keep going. We have the balance sheet and cash flow to continue to do that. So you can be very sure that we're going to be returning value to our shareholders, particularly at this time, and we think that's going to bare a lot of fruit when people understand that Michael Kors is here to stay, powerful business model, one of the most profitable companies in the market, and we will continue to deliver great results."

And if you could give us some comments on your outlook for AUR in whole and by channel that will be super helpful.

When we took this company public, and you've heard me say this many, many times, we said to you that North America would grow. It will eventually reach maturity. And that if that happened, Europe would come on and if that happened, Asia would come on. And I think all of those things have played out as we have laid them out, with the exception of what's really happened in mall traffic in North America. I don't think any of us have the crystal ball to see that coming and, obviously, part of that is driven by the digital shift in the consumer behavior, and the other part of that is driven by -- in our case, and I know in some of our very, very valued department store partners' cases -- and by the way, when I use that word, department store, it's not just North America because I know everybody on this call is focused on North America wholesale, but we have a lot of business around the world. The department stores in Europe are facing many challenges with traffic from tourism as well. So -- and the second thing we said when we went public was that this company ultimately would be 70%, 75% retail versus wholesale. Wholesale just grew faster than we had ever anticipated. And we enjoyed that. We think that's terrific, and we're going to continue to enjoy that. But that's -- we ultimately, first and foremost, are retailers. Ultimately, we believe that our store network, which will get to some 1,000 stores worldwide, will be the cornerstone of our development and growth. And it will be somewhere between 65% and 75% retail and the balance will be wholesale. And as you look at China, China is -- I mean -- sorry, Asia. Asia is basically all retail. Small wholesale business there with some Duty Free operators and a license business -- small license business there. And in Europe, Europe is going to -- has always been a business that will grow more quickly in retail because there's just more opportunity for us to do that. So again, I don't think that should be any surprise. That's kind of what we had laid out initially. We just were able to develop wholesale piece of it faster than the retail piece. In terms of SKUs, I'll go back to your first question. No, there's not going to be really any change in SKU. And if anything, I think when many of you came through our showrooms, you saw the amount of product innovation that our design teams are delivering is really quite exciting. And I think it's what the market needs. I've been very vocal on the fact that I think the market has had a malaise in terms of design. I think that the consumer needs to see something that's got more interest in terms of product and quality. And I think many of our competition is doing a great job. In particular, some of our European competitors are doing just an outstanding job with new product innovation. You'll see some additional things coming to bear very shortly on our website that will be exclusively on our website with products that we will be, quite frankly, building custom for consumers. We think that that's going to become even more of an issue as people look at what's in their wardrobe and how we curate that for them. So there's going to be actually more customization that we're going to look at on a go-forward basis. You'll see some of that be launched. We'll talk about that in the next call. In terms of AUR, AUR declined in both channels. And in our retail channel, it was a bit more driven by size of bag than promotion, but clearly, promotion added to the decline in AUR. And in the wholesale channel, it was higher than our own channel. And that's just because there is more activity in that channel by more people and, of course, there's tremendous amount of price matching that goes on. So that's really added to a bit of the chaos of the situation that's happening in that particular channel. So thank you very much, Randy."

I think AUR is actually going to increase, and we told you -- again, I apologize, I don't remember if you were in the showroom walk-through or not, but we said that AUR, we are actually focused on that, and we're doing that through kind of 3 things. First, we believe that by reducing the amount of inventory at retail that's available for sale, it's going to raise the AUR. Secondly, we are taking the smaller bags and we're offering more fashion design into those products, and actually offering higher price points. It was a strategy that Michael personally really came up with, and we think it's a brilliant strategy because it's not just the price that she's interested in the smaller bags, it's the size. So we believe that we probably actually been slightly under-charging and slightly under designing in terms of where -- she'll definitely pay somewhere between $200 and $300 for a crossbody. Why can't we have more of them at the higher price point? And we -- so that you'll be seeing that coming to bear in the stores. And then also, we believe that one of the reasons why the predominant amount of handbags that many of us are selling are in that $300 to $350 range is because we really haven't been providing enough design to get the customer excited for higher price point product. And so that's coming -- and so that will actually raise the AUR for fall season on the floor inside the stores. So we feel very good about that strategy. Reduced units get AURs up, still being very competitive price points, because I don't want you think that we're having a complete shift in pricing. But we think that's the right thing to do, and we think the customer's response that because she's going to see the value in the design of the product."

We would have made the kind of projection that we talked about, with 23%, 24%, had we not made this decision to reduce the wholesale inventories, we would have been kind of right there. So we made the decision that we're in this for the long term, as we've told everyone since we started this journey. We're building, as Joe mentioned before, our new distribution center in Venlo. We're developing a CRM team and systems here that are going to be world class, in our opinion. We're building out a web -- our e-commerce capabilities on platforms that we own quite frankly. These are not platforms that we're paying fees on, et cetera. we've decided to go the long-term route on all of our investments into this company because we think it's obviously one of the greatest fashion luxury companies in the world, and we'd rather do it the right way than to do it short term to create an extra basis point, 100 basis points in operating margin.

Let me start with the industry. We believe that the North American handbag business is flat to down -- high -- sorry, low single digits in total. I know that that's different from what some other people have reported, but that's",1062,"Sure. Very good questions. Let me start with the industry. We believe that the North American handbag business is flat to down -- high -- sorry, low single digits in total. I know that that's different from what some other people have reported, but that's just our belief. So we believe that the North American business, handbag business is about flat to down low single digits. And that's, I think, primarily because of the promoting that's going on. Obviously, units are up double digits, and I think it's for most of us. In -- and by the way, that includes luxury players too, because I know, many times, we have these conversations. There's only 2 other competitors that are referred to, but we see the same thing happening with multiple luxury companies, obviously, with the exclusion of Vuitton who doesn't operate in the sale environment, but many other companies are -- their amount that they're selling on sale is higher than the amount that they're selling at regular price this year versus last year. The -- we believe the macro handbag, luxury handbag market is relatively flat on a global basis, possibly up 1 point or 2. So -- and we believe that's going to be sort of the trend on a macro basis for the next year at least. And of course, you've seen that in the recent Altagamma-Bain luxury report, which echoed the same exact issues, with the exception of our point of view on the North American handbag market. We believe that there's softening that's continuing in mall traffic. We've actually seen an acceleration of softening in mall traffic. And this is not just our stores, this is what we see from ShopperTrak, which is a company that we use -- that looks at our -- that looks at not only ours but other retailers' numbers. So we compare ourselves to that on a pretty regular basis. So mall traffic continues to soften in North America. We do not see the tourism rebounding. So we're taking a slightly more pessimistic view of Q1 and Q2 for us. Q3 and Q4, we feel pretty optimistic about. And if you remember last year when we were sitting here at this time having this conversation, I know many people didn't believe we were going to be able to do what we did. And I understand why. That's not a negative. But we did. We delivered on everything that we said we were going to do through the year, including the comps. In the back half of the year, we got some amazing things that are going to be happening for us. First and foremost, we're really seeing the e-commerce part of our business accelerate. You heard me -- we more than increased by over 50% our e-commerce sales this past year. And traffic remains strong, double-digit increases. And so what we need to have in place is this great CRM capability, which, today, we don't really have -- we have a fair CRM capability, but we're building out -- it's going to be, as I said earlier in the call, world-class. And that, we think, is going to give us the ability to do a lot of things in the back half of the year, which we're going to talk about in our next conference call. Everything from bespoke up offerings to curation specialty that we're going to be doing, and just the way we're able to engage with our customer. Second is our new product initiatives. Our introductions are very strong. I think it's the best product that we've shown since at least I've been here with this company. And again, Michael and the design teams have really done a tremendous job featuring what I consider to be the highest levels of innovation in our company and in terms of the materials and the silhouettes, et cetera. So I think it's going to be powerful, and I think our customers are going to be extremely excited about the newness. Next is Kors ACCESS. Kors ACCESS is going to be a very big help for us. As you recall, we talk about 2 things constantly in these calls, North America and handbags. And we don't -- always remember we're a retail company, which I'd like to remind everybody on this call. We're a retail company. And secondly, we don't talk about the fact that watches have really had tremendous impact on our comp store sales. I mean, this is the #1 area that has hurt us in comp store sales over the last 2 years. And again, this is -- our partner, at Fossil, terrific people, doing a great job for us, and it's really been -- because people have moved to the iPhone and, to some degree, iWatch, but I think it's really more the switch to that. So Kors ACCESS is going to be a really powerful new innovative opportunity for our sales associates to communicate, engage with our customer. And then the trackers are going to be great. You know we've got some competitors out there. And I'll say that Fitbit is a competitor of ours, and we think that we're going to have the most innovation in terms of fashion in a tracker, any company in the world. And I'm being that strong about the statement. And we priced it from $95 to $150. We're going after this aggressively, and we think that's going to be an amazing opportunity for us, in particular, in the third quarter. And then lastly, we told you, before I forget, the launch of Wanderlust is always a big plus for us when we see that happen. Lots of television, marketing campaigns. Lauder has done an amazing job with this new fragrance with us, and Lauder has been just a terrific partner with us. And lastly, is going to be gifting. We did a great job last year with gifting and it really helped us in Q3. We told you about that. We've taken that to a whole new level for this year. So we -- this isn't full hockey stick, I don't want you to think of it that way, but we're going to have a very good third and fourth quarter in this company. Q2 will be okay, but Q3 and Q4 will be great. So thank you very much, Matt."

John, what is your thoughts from an industry and a company-specific strategy-wise regarding the reality of price matching? And also how mobile is really changing how the consumer shops, and how the path to purchase works in terms of multiple channels and thinking about mobile. And then also, John, I know, we've been following a lot of the luxury companies, and there's been a pretty sharp divergence between Hong Kong, Macau versus Mainland. Is that something you're seeing? And how are your thoughts on the real estate in terms of what you're thinking about, as a lot of people are focused on real productivity per point of store in Asia versus distribution growth?"

And I also kno",775,"Well, I'm going to start with the price matching. My opinion of price matching is that it's a race to the bottom. So I believe that those people who want to participate in that, as a general rule, will ultimately see their business decline. And I also know that many people think that that's a way to protect their relationship with their customer. I think it's a way to devalue the relationship. It just basically means that they don't believe in -- when they do have a sale or an offering for their customer that it's legitimate, they just offer anything at any time. So my personal opinion is it's a race to the bottom. I think mobile has definitely changed consumer shopping behavior. Everything from the way that people shop and -- which is obviously hurting mall traffic, because people -- we know they're beginning their journey online and ultimately -- we're still doing 90-plus percent of our business in North America in stores. So stores are still real. And while one day, I publicly said, we'll get 25%, 30% of our business in e-commerce, we're nowhere near that today. But that being said, we have to be very cognizant that consumer is starting and definitely creating her path to purchase on mobile, and we better be a part of that and be good at it and be influencing her through that journey. I want to note that we don't do the price matching thing, and our comps are, quite frankly, better than a lot of other people's comps who are doing all these types of things. So you can't continue to build your business, especially with the mobile view that says to your customer it's all about price because that will ultimately just drive the AUR down, which will ultimately -- you can't sell enough units to make up for the dollars. It just doesn't work. But we do think that our new CRM groups that we're putting together here and the investments we're going to be making will give us the ability to really change the shopping experience. And Oliver, as you know, if you go onto our Flatiron store, you'll see Kors Concierge is up and live. It's a whole digital shopping experience with the customers that our sales associates are fully enabled with. We'll have 35 stores rolled out the next few months. And we're going to arm our customers with the ability to be the ultimate fashion stylists for their clients and be able to curate for them. And that's what people want. If you want to get away from price, it has to be product, it has to be innovation, and we believe strongly, it has to be curation. So that's our point of view on that. In terms of Hong Kong and Macau, as I said earlier, we got lucky. We have nice distribution in Macau. We're in some terrific locations. So there'll be no real estate changes in Macau. Obviously, our business is very difficult there and really not seeing any signs of any kind of recovery in that marketplace. Hong Kong, we do not have a large distribution there, a few points of distribution. Believe it or not, our Hong Kong business, I don't -- I can't 100% explain to you why, but over the last 60 days, it's actually showing signs of improvement. So I don't want to tell you that's a trend by any stretch of the imagination, but what was terrible before is now just kind of bad. So we feel good about where we are. And I would tell you that we are looking at real estate in Hong Kong as an opportunity for the company, especially since rents have come down significantly since their peak. So we'll be cautious. We'll continue to view things as where is the consumer shopping. Ultimately, Hong Kong is going to come back. Is it a year from now, is it 2 years from now, is it 5 years from now? Nobody knows, but Hong Kong will become a place that is important. The only thing I would add to that is what I think many luxury companies are seeing is there is a movement of the people who are coming to Hong Kong and Macau now are a bit more coming from Tier 2, 3 and 4 cities. The Tier 1 customer, who is still the -- probably the biggest average per spend customer, is moving into clearly Europe, clearly Japan, clearly Korea. So the average transaction that many people are seeing in those markets is slightly down because of just the customer mix."

And what we believe is that we got to stimulate our customer, and I was just looking at some stats. Our Instagram following is up 95% in the quarter. 95%. It's incredible. And I know that people think that the Michael Kors brand is whatever. And as -- we look at the engagement, the following, it's driven by Michael's voice, first and foremost. I mean, people are so engaged with the -- whether it's Michael and Nina Agdal, and the glamour games that we put up, or whether it's the whole new campaign that we just shot in Mexico for summer and all the different videos, or if it's the Mother's Day campaign, which was a huge success for us, with Alessandra Ambrosio, or whether it's Lily Aldridge doing a whole sneaker campaign for us. So I think we're really good as a company. And our teams are excellent at developing content that is engaging. And it's exciting the customer and keeping them engaged with the brand. They may not actually shop from that, but I think they love being a part of the Michael Kors family. And so I think in today's world, you have to be there. I mean, look at our major competitors in Europe, and everyone is upping the game, whether it's fashion shows in Rio or Blenheim Castle, or whatever the -- Palace, excuse me -- whatever the things are, you have to understand that we're in the business of exciting people. And that's fun, quite frankly. That's the fun part about what we get to do here every day. Products, first, but quite frankly, marketing and brand and exciting and engaging the customers, second.

First off, Omar, thank you for your questions, and thank you for your one comment that it is true that our -- the traffic issue is not a Michael Kors issue. This is an issue -- I don't know one retailer that I speak to who isn't seeing this happening",866,"Yes. First off, Omar, thank you for your questions, and thank you for your one comment that it is true that our -- the traffic issue is not a Michael Kors issue. This is an issue -- I don't know one retailer that I speak to who isn't seeing this happening. And Omar, I would first start by calling the traffic thing a behavioral change. And again, I think many times that we're the first company or the most honest company to come out and say, ""These traffic trends, you're starting to see in other places in the world."" So mall traffic is declining in Europe now. It's declining in the U.K., in particular. And I would tell you that in the most sophisticated digital markets is where you see the most mall traffic slowing. So we start out, and this is just our theory and just our hypothesis, that consumers who have high levels of digital product availability are shopping less in shopping malls. And U.K. is a perfect example. As Harrods and Selfridges and House of Fraser and John Lewis all got better with e-commerce, there's just more business going there, and we know that because we do business with them. We see how much percentage-wise. The U.K., for us, has some of the highest levels of penetration with our department store partners anywhere else in the world. So somewhere between 25% and 35% of our business with those retailers comes from online. And they're the most sophisticated at click and collect, they're the most sophisticated at same-day delivery service. They do it better than any department store in the world -- in the U.K. But that's affecting mall traffic. So we think that's only going to continue on because people are just going to get better. We'll be announcing shortly some cities in the United States where we'll be providing same-day service, and so on and so forth. And actually, we believe that one of the most important ways that we're going to compete globally is with delivery. And delivery, one of the things that we have, which many people were concerned about, are the amount of locations that we have, both in North America and internationally. It's actually going to be a strength for us, because we will be able to offer same-day delivery. And unfortunately, probably for free. But that's going to be the new norm. And so we have to deal with that behaviorally. So what are we going to do to drive traffic into the stores? Well, first and foremost, we believe that creative marketing leads the way. So we have to inspire the customer with new product delivered in creative marketing. And again, I think our teams -- I think we're world-class in -- if we're launching a new bag, building campaigns around that, that involve everything from Michael himself personally to certain celebrities that we make sure that the product appears on, to digital marketing campaigns and print campaigns. We're furthering that by being able to arm our sales associates with Kors Concierge, which gives them the ability, and I just actually saw it demonstrated yesterday and it's phenomenal, where they can talk directly one on one. So it's not just a corporate communication, but now you got the sales associate in the store talking to their client directly through this new curation device platform that we've built that says, ""Not only does this bag commits [ph], but here is the shoe and the dress and the jewelry that -- and the watch that's going to go with this. Why don't you come on in and let's have a conversation."" So we believe that this is going to be one on one dialogue with the customer. And we're really looking at it from the top of the funnel to the bottom of the funnel. We are not pulling back on our marketing and, in fact, we're increasing marketing. So part of the SG&A increase that you see is an increase in marketing. I made the decision a few months ago, even when we decided to reduce our wholesale business in North America, it would have been easy for us to go in and cut expenses all over the company and make up a lot of the gross profit dollars that we lost. But we made the decision that, that wasn't smart for us that we were building a long-term company, we're building a long-term relationship, and we need to drive customers into the store and you have to spend money to do that with marketing. And I think you're going to see the fruits of that between our communication efforts, our CRM and then ultimately, Kors Concierge. If it works the way we think it's going to work, we'll be able to drive traffic into the stores. Is it going to be positive traffic? I'm not sure, to be frank with you. I think that's probably wishful thinking. But I think we will be able to stay at a level that will help us have comp store increases. And again, we're getting excellent conversion rates inside the stores, and we just think that's going to continue forward."

Lindsay, I'll tell you about all the things that we really did well, and I'm going to tell you about some that didn't work as well for us. And expanding the stores, we did a handful of them. It really hasn't been a great return for us. So I would tell you that we're not going to do that. That's kind of over with. There will be a handful of select locations where we'll do that, but you'll be able to count those on your 2 hands. And there'll be more flagship-y type things. We just did it in London and -- which happens to be working, thank God. But where we did them in more regional locations, it really didn't provide the uplift from a profitability standpoint that we were anticipating. So unless we see something changing on that, that will not be part of our strategy going forward. And in terms of outlets in North America, we're basically done at this point. I think there is 1 or 2 more that we're going to open and it’s over with. So -- and that's pretty much worldwide also, but there'll be a handful that we'll open in a couple of locations, but we're pretty much finished out on that. And then over the next 2 years, maybe 3 years, we'll be finished with our global store expansion. I want to mention one other thing too, that again, we remain a very highly productive on a sales per square foot basis, again, top -- usually in most centers, we're usually in top 5, but let's it call top 10 in the world.

We also opened several flagship stores in renowned luxury retail locations across the globe, including the Ginza district in Tokyo, Beijing and Stockholm with great success. More recently, we opened our largest flagship location in Europe on Regent Street in London, featuring our latest store design concept, and plan to open our Singapore flagship later this year. 
We have developed a platform to support accelerated growth in Asia. First, we transitioned our South Korean license in-house in January and have successfully integrated the region into our business. We also established our Hong Kong wholesale distribution operations, which enable us to provide even greater service and support to our Asian customers. 
In addition, we are pleased to announce that we have completed the acquisition of our Greater China license, which fits perfectly into our growth strategy in Asia. We believe that Asia will ultimately be a  billion dollar market and that this acquisition is the cornerstone for our growth plan in this region. 
We accelerated the rollout of our menswear line with new and innovative designs in sportswear and leather goods. While we are still in the early stages, we are pleased with the strong momentum in this business as we expand our presence at retail and in the wholesale channel. This is another area of business that we believe will drive long-term growth for the company. 
Finally, we continued to make enhancements to our infrastructure in order to support our long-term sustainable growth. During the year, we took our North American e-commerce fulfillment operations in-house, enabling us to better and more efficiently service customers in this channel. We also further enhanced our omnichannel capabilities, allowing us to capture additional sales as our customers' shopping behaviors change. And to support our growth in Europe, we built out our distribution center in Venlo, Holland, with our e-commerce operations launching in midsummer this year and our operations for retail and wholesale going live in early calendar 2017. 
We ended 2016 on a strong note, with fourth quarter total revenues and EPS growth ahead of our expectations. Total revenue increased 11% on a reported basis and 12% on a constant currency basis, driven by growth in both our retail and wholesale channels as well as across geographies. Earnings per share increased 9% to $0.98 on a reported basis and grew 11% on a constant currency basis. 
While slower mall traffic trends, the decline in tourism in North America as well as certain European cities and FX headwinds all remained a challenge for the industry as a whole, we were able to deliver solid results, which we believe is a testament to our world-class design team, exceptional product offerings, integrated marketing campaigns and the lasting connection that we have fostered with our customers. 
Our retail business delivered solid growth across geographies, driven by strong double-digit sales increases in our digital flagships and new store openings. Our global comparable sales increased 0.3% on a reported basis. In constant currency, our comparable sales rose 1.5%, which was in line with our guidance and was primarily driven by strong performance in our accessories and footwear categories. 
While we saw a slight decline in North American comps on a constant currency basis in the fourth quarter, Europe comps increased in the mid-single digits, and comps in Japan rose in the strong double digits. Mall traffic in North America continued to decline during the quarter. However, we once again saw a significant increase in conversion rates in our own retail stores as customers responded favorably to our new product offerings. 
Sales in our digital flagships once again showed significant growth in the fourth quarter. We believe that our digital flagships represent a meaningful growth opportunity, and we will continue to expand this business globally as we launch in Europe this fall. 
We continue to build upon our omnichannel capabilities and remained focused on seamlessly integrating the customer shopping experience across all touch points as well as taking steps to enhance our mobile shopping experience. We look forward to seeing the benefit of these efforts over the coming year. 
We are currently undertaking a project to significantly elevate our CRM and data science capabilities. In parallel, we are investing in talent and technology in order to incorporate learning from the customer insights we are gaining. We will continue to capitalize on our CRM capabilities and Michael's voice to gain a competitive advantage by evolving our customer-centric marketing. 
In addition, data science-driven segmentation enables us to personalize Michael's message, allowing us to strengthen the relationship between our brand and our most loyal customers. We believe that having a deep understanding of our customer behavior allows us to better excite and engage the customer, introducing services and products from our lifestyle portfolio curated just for her. As you know, we have a strong and influential online presence as consumers turn to Michael Kors for fashion insights, and we continue to see our fan base grow across all social media platforms, further demonstrating the power of our brand. 
Sales in our wholesale business grew 4% for the quarter on a reported basis, which was ahead of our expectations. Europe wholesale sales were flat on a reported basis and grew 2% in constant currency, while in Asia, we saw significant growth of nearly 8x -- 18x to $27 million. 
In North America, the department store channel remained challenged. However, the new spring collection we introduced were well received, with strong sell-throughs in the fourth quarter. We believe that the North America retail environment remains highly promotional, which is impacting the long-term brand equity of Michael Kors. We will be actively decreasing our exposure to the wholesale channel by reducing inventory levels to focus on a higher level of full-priced sell-throughs and a lower level of markdowns. While this strategy is expected to result in a meaningful decrease in wholesale net sales in fiscal 2017, we believe that it is the right strategy for the overall health of our business long term as we protect our margins and brand equity. 
In our licensing segment, revenue declined during the quarter due to lower sales of watches as well as reduced sales in eyewear as we anniversaried our launch with Luxottica and the final quarter of shipments from Marchon last year. That said, we are pleased with the favorable response that we have seen to our new slim modern watch styles, particularly the Hartman and Jaryn case bodies, both of which are exceeding expectations. In addition, our updated jewelry offering featuring padlock motifs as well as our watch and jewelry gift set boxes also continued to perform well. 
In eyewear, our spring fashion styles, the new round Kendall and the cat -- Abela [ph] were met with strong response, and we are seeing positive sales momentum in our eyewear offerings globally. We remain a global trend leader in watches and jewelry with our entrance into the connected fashion accessories category. 
This fall, we will introduce our new wearable technology accessories line, beginning with MICHAEL KORS ACCESS display watch -- smartwatches. This launch is geared towards the fashion-focused consumer and features a smart timepiece that focuses on glamorous style and innovative design. MICHAEL KORS ACCESS combines the cutting-edge technology that our partner, Google, is known for with the chic and glamorous fashion aesthetics of the Michael Kors luxury brand. These smartwatches will be available in 2 styles: the Dylan and Bradshaw, with price points between $395 and $595. 
This is truly a unique accessory featuring an exclusive custom display dial experience, which you can change with just a swipe. With hundreds of different display options, you can set your watch face to a glittering pavé that complements your outfit by night and switch to a digital chronograph that shows your fitness stats at the gym the next morning. Certain watches will feature interchangeable wristbands and will be available for both men and women. 
Powered by Google's Android Wear operating system, the touchscreen display smartwatches include social media updates, text, phone call and email alerts, app notifications, smart health from Google Now, voice control of device and services via Ok Google and, of course, built-in fitness tracking. 
As part of our unified wearable strategy, we are also launching 3 styles of smart jewelry: the Crosby, Reid [ph] and Thompson [ph], available in multiple colors, platings and in a variety of bands. These modern styles are designed to give our customer a fitness tracker that is fashionable and that she will want to wear every day either alone or as a complement to her jewelry. Smart jewelry will feature activity tracking, sleep monitoring and linked remote control functionality and will be priced from $95 to $145. 
Initially, the wearable technology will be a small piece of our overall business in terms of revenue. However, as I've said in the past, based on our previous success in watches and jewelry, we believe that we can quickly become a fashion leader in this category. Long term, the wearable technology category will become a pivotal component of our watch and jewelry business. 
In addition, we are pleased to announce the fall debut of a new fragrance for women called Wanderlust.  The new scent will have global appeal evoking infinite desire for adventure, romance and discovery. The new fragrance line will initially be offered exclusively in our North America retail stores before becoming available globally in both our retail stores and through our wholesale partners. We will be supporting the launch with a compelling marketing campaign, which includes print, TV and social media, featuring Lily Aldridge and Wouter Peelen. We believe this new collection will allow us to capitalize on the growing momentum in fragrance and beauty and further increase our penetration in this category. 
Turning to our product categories. We saw growth in our accessories category led by new handbag groups introduced this spring, including our denim styles, the quilted Sloan shoulder bag, our Savannah satchel and Hayley tote. In addition, our backpacks continued to resonate well with customers. 
Total accessory sales on a retail basis grew at low double digits globally. In North America, we saw weakness in the category in the wholesale channel. However, we experienced strong double-digit growth in accessories in our own retail stores. While the momentum in our small bags, crossbodies and small leather goods as well as promotional activity continued to impact AUR in the quarter, units sold increased double digits once again, which indicates continued demand for our luxury product offering. 
We also saw another solid quarter for growth in our footwear business as Michael Kors has become a dominant brand in this category. We offered a broad array of styles, with performance led by the strength in fashion, active footwear as well as espadrilles and casual sandals, including our MK slide and Warren Platform styles. Customers also responded well to new designs detailing particularly the perforated floral designs of the Olivia active slip-on and denim styles of Ollie high-top sneaker and Darci espadrille. 
We are extremely pleased with the performance of our men's sportswear and leather goods business, which is showing strong momentum. The men's collection embodies effortless style with a modern edge for the confident, connected and adventurous Michael Kors man. While men's is still a small portion of our overall revenue, I'm confident that this will be an integral part of our business as we evolve into a leading men's luxury brand. 
During the year, we opened 117 shop-in-shops globally. In addition, we extended our men's presence at retail with the opening of 2 stand-alone stores as well as through the addition of our men's offering in 9 of our existing stores in North America, Europe and Asia. During fiscal 2017, we plan to open approximately 10 retail locations and 150 men's shops -- shop-in-shops globally. Long term, we continue to believe that our men's business represents a  billion dollar revenue opportunity for Michael Kors. 
Turning to our international business. As announced in our press release this morning, we completed the acquisition of our Greater China license and are extremely excited about the tremendous growth opportunity this market has to offer. We believe that by taking direct control of this market, we can better leverage our infrastructure across Asia and make a greater impact on the expansion of our business in this region. 
As you know, we have been working diligently over the past several years to build the infrastructure, establish the brand and grow the acceptance of Michael Kors across Asia. We believe that we are on a strong trajectory with a rapidly growing following among Chinese, Japanese, Korean and Southeast Asian consumers. This makes it an ideal time for us to take direct control of the China operations, integrate it into our business and unlock the enormous potential in this market. 
For the most recent year, Michael Kors product was available in 97 company-operated and travel retail doors across Mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan, and the Greater China business generated nearly $200 million in revenue. Long term, we believe that the China business represents a $500 million revenue opportunity based on our assessment of the market and the growing demand for the Michael Kors brand. 
In addition, we are pleased to see the strong trends in our Korea business since we took the license in-house in the -- this past January. Customer demand for Michael Kors brand is growing, and we will continue to invest in this region through new store expansion. We currently have 36 retail stores and concession shops in South Korea and believe we can ultimately expand to 50 locations, generating revenues of approximately $100 million. 
Turning to other Asia regions. We are extremely pleased with the ongoing momentum in Japan as we continue to see double-digit revenue gains and growing brand awareness. We continue to believe that Japan will ultimately reach $300 million in revenue. In Hong Kong, where we established distribution operations to service duty-free retail locations and our Southeast Asian licensed operations, we see a $100 million revenue opportunity as we continue to grow this business. Combined, our Asian markets in total represent a  billion dollar opportunity for the company. 
In conclusion, Michael Kors remains a leader in the global luxury fashion market, with multiple long-term growth opportunities, including expansion across Asia, the launch of our digital flagships worldwide and the continued development of our men's business. In fiscal 2017, we expect our results to be challenged by a difficult retail environment pressured by weak traffic and tourism trends. We will respond by carefully managing our exposure to the U.S. wholesale channel, maintaining disciplined inventory controls and remaining committed to our relentless focus on designing world-class fashion product, driving brand engagement with compelling marketing programs and delivering a jet-set luxury shopping experience in our stores and our digital flagships. In addition, as our new $1 billion share repurchase program demonstrates, we are committed to enhancing shareholder value over the long term. 
Now let me turn it over to Joe for a detailed review of our fourth quarter financial results and our outlook for fiscal 2017."
143971118,337449444,994628,"Michael Kors Holdings Limited, 2016 Earnings Call, Jun 01, 2016",2016-06-01,"Earnings Calls","Capri Holdings Limited","Executives","Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased to report revenue and EPS results above our guidance. Total revenue grew 10.9% to $1.2 billion on a reported basis. On a constant currency basis, total revenue grew 11.7%, driven by increases acr",1990,"Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased to report revenue and EPS results above our guidance. Total revenue grew 10.9% to $1.2 billion on a reported basis. On a constant currency basis, total revenue grew 11.7%, driven by increases across the Americas, Europe and Asia of 5.1%, 18.1% and 212.1%, respectively. As a reminder, our fiscal year 2016 is a 53-week period versus a 52-week period in the prior year. As such, the results of our fiscal 2016 fourth quarter and full year include approximately $34 million of additional retail sales. Comp sale calculations exclude the 53rd week. 
In our retail segment, net sales increased 22.0% on a reported basis. In constant currency, retail net sales increased 23.4%, driven primarily by the opening of 142 net new stores since the fourth quarter of last year and strong performance of our digital flagships. Comp sales increased 0.3% on a reported basis. In constant currency, comp sales increased 1.5%. The increase is attributable to the positive comps in Europe and Japan, partially offset by a slight decrease in North America. Our U.S. digital flagship sales contributed 380 basis points to our North American comp performance in the quarter on a constant currency basis. 
In our wholesale segment, net sales grew 3.5%. On a constant currency basis, wholesale sales increased 4.0%, driven primarily by our footwear and accessories category as well as men's and growth in international markets. 
In our licensing segment, revenue decreased 13.6% as expected due to lower sales of watches as well as lower revenue related to eyewear as we anniversaried our launch with Luxottica and the final quarter of shipments from Marchon last year. 
Gross margin declined 20 basis points to 58.2%, which included a negative foreign currency transaction impact of approximately 100 basis points. The decline in gross margin is primarily due to a 120 basis point decline in retail gross margins attributable to additional markdowns, largely offset by gross margin benefits related to changes in geographic and segment mix as we saw a 32.9% increase in sales from regions outside of the America and a 22% increase in retail net sales. 
Total operating expenses grew 20.9%. As a percentage of total revenue, total operating expenses increased 310 basis points to 37.8% primarily due to our investments in new stores, e-commerce and omnichannel capabilities, the buildout of our men's and Korea businesses, new shop-in-shops and infrastructure improvements as well as impairment charges related to retail and wholesale fixed assets. 
Income from operations was $244.1 million or 20.4% of total revenue as compared to 23.7% of total revenue in the same period last year. Retail operating margin declined 360 basis points due to the decline of retail gross margins, as discussed earlier, and a 240 basis point increase in operating expenses primarily due to higher depreciation related to the fixed asset write-off mentioned earlier as well as investments in our new stores and digital flagships. Wholesale operating margin declined 190 basis points primarily due to higher operating expenses related to the fixed asset write-off noted earlier. 
Licensing operating margin increased 80 basis points primarily due to lower advertising costs during the quarter, partially offset by higher costs associated with intellectual property protection. 
Income taxes were $69.2 million in the quarter, and our effective tax rate was 28.2% as compared to 29.4% in the same period last year. The decrease in our effective tax rate was primarily due to the increase in taxable income in certain of our non-U.S. subsidiaries, which are subject to lower statutory income tax rates. 
Net income was $177.0 million for the fourth quarter, and diluted earnings per share were $0.98. The unfavorable currency impact on EPS was $0.02 per share. 
Turning to our balance sheet. At the end of the quarter, cash and cash equivalents were $702.0 million. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 3.7 million shares totaling $200 million under our share repurchase program. Since the inception of this program in 2014, we have repurchased almost 32 million shares or 15% of our outstanding shares, totaling approximately $1.6 billion. As of April 2, 2016, the remaining availability under the company's share repurchase program was $358.1 million. 
We are very pleased to announce that the company's Board of Directors authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase program, which replaces the remaining balance of the previous program authorized in October 2014. The new authorization further demonstrates our confidence in our long-term business outlook. We will continue to use the strength of our balance sheet and future cash flows to repurchase additional shares and drive value for our shareholders. 
Inventory increased 5.2% versus last year, representing a slower growth rate than total revenue in the fourth quarter. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $79.0 million and were related to the buildout of new retail stores and shop-in-shops as well as investments in our distribution facilities, our corporate offices and other infrastructure improvements. 
We added 45 net new stores in the fourth quarter. We opened 2 locations in the Americas, 6 in Europe and 41 in Asia, which includes the 36 stores we assumed in South Korea, and closed 4 locations in Brazil. In addition, we expanded or relocated 3 stores and converted 136 wholesale doors into shop-in-shops globally. 
Before turning to our outlook for next year, let me provide you with some insight into the acquisition of the Greater China license, which was completed on May 31 for $500 million in cash subject to certain adjustments. We had said earlier on that meaningful investment and dedicated resources would be required to develop the China business given the complexity of this market. We also indicated that once this business had reached a certain size and level of profitability, we would consider bringing it in-house. 
Following considerable evaluation, we determined that based upon the size of the operations, the level of brand recognition Michael Kors has reached and the platform that has been established, it is the right time to acquire the China business. This acquisition will enable us to leverage the infrastructure and the team to further expand our presence and meaningfully grow our business across Asia. We believe that Asia represents a $1 billion revenue opportunity, and with this acquisition, we are positioned to capitalize on the growth potential in the market. 
The Greater China business generated total revenue of $197 million last fiscal year and had a network of 91 company-operated stores and 6 travel retail locations across China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan. For fiscal 2017, we expect the acquisition to contribute approximately $200 million to retail net sales, reflecting sales for the 10-month period following the closing and to be neutral to earnings per share on a GAAP basis and accretive on a non-GAAP basis, excluding onetime acquisition costs. The acquisition is expected to be accretive beginning in fiscal 2018 and thereafter. Overall, we believe that this strategic acquisition was the right decision for our company and for our long-term growth. 
Turning to our outlook. For the full fiscal year 2017, we expect total revenue to be flat versus the prior year. As we look across the businesses, we expect retail net sales to increase in the mid-teens percentage range for the year, driven by growth in our digital flagships and new store openings in addition to the acquisition of the China business. Comp sales are expected to decline in the low single digits. Wholesale sales are expected to decline in the high-teens percentage range. 
As John discussed earlier, the North American retail environment remains highly promotional. We will be reducing inventory in this channel in order to protect our margins and brand image. We believe that this will lead to faster inventory returns of new product and a decrease in markdown activity, which will ultimately result in higher gross margins and improve the overall health of the business. 
The outlook for lower wholesale sales is also due to the integration of the China business. As a reminder, in 2016, wholesale sales through [ph] our Greater China licensee totaled $62.8 million. 
Lastly, we expect licensing revenue to decline in the mid-teens percentage range as a result of continued softness in the watch category and a decrease in licensing revenue related to the acquisition of the Greater China license. 
For fiscal 2016, licensing revenue from Greater China license totaled $7.6 million. By geography, we anticipate a high single-digit decline in total revenue for the Americas region due to lower wholesale and licensing revenue. We expect continued revenue expansion in our international markets with a high single-digit increase in Europe and a triple-digit increase in Asia. We expect gross margin expansion in 2017 of 110 to 140 basis points as we continue to benefit from changes in geographic and segment mix. This will be offset by an increase in operating expense. 
We expect deleverage in -- on operating expense as we continue to invest in our long-term growth, including upgrading our CRM systems, launching our digital flagship in Europe, building infrastructure in our China and Korea businesses, expanding our men's business and transitioning to our Venlo warehouse as we plan to operate 2 facilities until we fully transition to our new facility in early calendar 2017. 
In addition, we expect to incur $15 million of onetime transaction costs and other contingency payments related to the acquisition of our Greater China licensee and $3 million of onetime costs related to the closure of certain locations in Latin America. 
As a result, fiscal 2017 operating margin is expected to be approximately 21.5% on a non-GAAP basis, excluding the onetime costs mentioned earlier. On a GAAP basis, operating margin is expected to be approximately 21%. We expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $4.56 to $4.64 for the year on a non-GAAP basis, excluding the onetime costs noted earlier, and $4.47 to $4.55 on a GAAP basis, including the onetime costs. This assumes a tax rate of approximately 21% and 171 million shares outstanding. 
Capital expenditures are expected to total approximately $250 million for the fiscal year 2017 and will focus on ongoing investments in global digital strategies and omnichannel capabilities; global retail expansion, including approximately 15 new stores in the Americas, 20 in Europe and 40 in Asia; the conversion of approximately 275 wholesale shop-in-shops globally; and the company's global distribution infrastructure, information systems and corporate facilities. 
For the first quarter, we expect total revenue to be between $940 million and $955 million and a mid-single-digit decrease in comp sales. We expect a decline in gross margin of approximately 100 basis points. We anticipate an increase in operating expense as we continue to invest in our international expansion, digital flagships and global infrastructure. Operating expenses as a percent of total revenue is expected to increase 690 to 740 basis points on a non-GAAP basis, excluding the onetime costs I noted earlier, resulting in operating margin of approximately 17%. On a GAAP basis, including the onetime costs, operating expenses as a percentage of total revenue is expected to increase 880 basis points to 930 basis points, resulting in an operating margin of approximately 15%. 
We expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.70 to $0.74 on a non-GAAP basis, excluding the onetime costs noted earlier, and $0.62 to $0.66 on a GAAP basis, including the onetime costs. This assumes a tax rate of approximately 21% and 177 million shares outstanding. 
During fiscal 2017, we will be resetting our base in our North America wholesale business and expect to resume sales growth in fiscal 2018. As we reduce our lower-margin North American wholesale business and gain other margin benefits associated with favorable geographic and segment mix, we expect to see continued gross margin expansion in fiscal 2018. We continue to believe that we will be poised to deliver both sales and earnings growth over the long term. 
I will now turn the call back to John for closing remarks."

We have enormous potential to build our Asia business with the acquisition of our Greater China license, in addition to an expansion in South Korea, Japan and Southeast Asia, which, combined, represents a  billion dollar market opportunity. 
We are extremely pleased with the growing momentum of our men's business and remain confident that this has the long-term potential to be a  billion dollar business.

In addition, we will continue to expand our retail business both domestically and internationally through our global digital flagships and retail stores.

And again, for the broader group, I know we scheduled this call to be 1.5 hours, and I think you can understand why now with the acquisition of China and year-end and a lot of strategic changes we're making, so I thought it",1027,"First off, thank you, Kimberly. And again, for the broader group, I know we scheduled this call to be 1.5 hours, and I think you can understand why now with the acquisition of China and year-end and a lot of strategic changes we're making, so I thought it was a good idea to give the full time for people to ask questions. Kimberly, on your first question regarding our wholesale strategy, the majority of the wholesale decline will happen in North America. And the -- as Joe indicated before, I think it's about $63 million of the wholesale decline belongs to the acquisition of China, and so you have to kind of factor that into the numbers. And let me just explain to you what our thinking is. Again, first off, we have built a very solid business with department stores, not only domestically but internationally. We think the channel is a very strong channel across the world, great banners that we operate our brand inside of. And we support them 100% in good times and in difficult times. That being said, what has happened in North America in particular, and you're starting to see a little bit of it in Europe, is that as mall traffic has declined, stores have taken an aggressive position on promotional activity to generate volume and traffic into their buildings. And we have seen that magnify over the last 12 months, and we believe that, that long term is not healthy for the Michael Kors brand. And as I've said to you before and we just said it in the script, we grew our handbag business globally. I mean, that's -- so our customer -- that's in dollars. Our customer continues to respond to the brand. I see constant communication from various press-related things about the brand is dead or losing its vibrancy, et cetera, and that's just flat out not true. And along with that, we're shipping double-digit unit increases. So we think that that's too many units going into the marketplace. And we believe that by us reducing the amount of product going into the wholesale channel, we will actually create a healthier environment for our department store customers and partners and ourselves. There'll be less product, there'll be more demand, and that demand will be more at full price versus sale. And I want to further add that many of you have the opportunity to come up and see our fall product offerings. We're really excited about that. Our own stores, our retail partners have let us know that we're heading in the right direction in terms of trend. I also mentioned to you we're the second or third largest handbag company in the world. So we have an obligation, and we have an authority to really set the tone for fashion and for luxury. And we're going to use that authority and tone. We have 70 -- 750 company-owned stores, 100 stores that are licensed. So we have an 850-store network globally that is incredibly positioned. And the power of that, with what Michael and the design team are going to be delivering for fall season, we've already seen the beginning of that in spring, we think, is going to continue to propel the business forward. And we're very, very pleased about that. So we think the strategy that we're taking, while obviously reduces our revenue on the top line, it's going to be much healthier for us. Joe indicated that we're actually going to have our gross margin expansion, and that's because, as we look at geography and retail are kind of tilting, that's a better thing for us. So we just like the strategy altogether. I want to be 100% clear: we believe in our department store partners, we think they're doing a great job with our brand, and we want to continue to be one of the great assets that they have to help bring customers into their building. And we like their customers. We think they're terrific Kors loyalists. Secondly, in terms of the Exclusively Ours, the strategy there is to do 2 things: number one, yes, to distinguish a bit between our freestanding stores and some of our department store shops around the world; and secondly, to be able to have product that could be promoted less, quite frankly. And you're going to actually see even more of that coming for the fall season and certain groups that will not be promoted both in our own stores and in the department store environment as well. 
 We know that the promotional activity is even more prevalent from a visibility standpoint for the customer because of digital. So we've got to take a different approach to how the customer sees our product and really stand behind the newness. We'll give that product an opportunity to develop and market behind that. And on your third question regarding China, we have -- our license has built out an extraordinary network of stores. We are in the best locations, just like we are in the United States, just like we are in Europe. We sit next to the finest luxury brands from Europe, whether it's Vuitton or Prada or Gucci. We're right in the same shopping malls and same streets, et cetera. I would also say that we got lucky. We did not have a overdevelopment of Hong Kong, in particular, which, as you know, is struggling as a marketplace. So the good news for us is we only have a handful of locations there. So that presents an opportunity for the future, but it also really avoids a very big negative. As you know, many companies are suffering in that marketplace. Mainland China and Taiwan are double-digit comps. Just moving along very, very nicely. And the brand has tremendous opportunity to grow in those marketplaces. And lastly, just on that note, as you know, the Chinese are traveling all over the world. So again, even as we build out the business in the region, there's even more to come for us across the globe with that customer. So thank you very much, Kimberly, and great questions."

As you know, most of the locations that we're in today in our department store partners are shop-in-shops. And there are no shop-in-shop closings. So we are highly productive. Just like our freestanding stores, we're top 10 in almost every single mall around the world in terms of our productivity per square foot. We're in the same position, and obviously, in certain categories, we're #1 in terms of -- in department stores. We're #1 in terms of sales per square foot in those various departments. So that's not an issue at all. The real issue for us is analyzing the amount of inventory that is being sold on sale versus full price. That's what we have to look at. And we believe that selling more product at full price is better for our brand image and better for our margins long term. So again, as Joe indicated earlier, this is a reset for us that will take probably 12, maybe a little longer about 15 months to get through. But we ultimately believe that as a luxury fashion-led brand, we don't want it to be about price, we want it to be about new product introduction. And in terms of -- you asked about categories. I would say, the predominant reduction will be coming from our accessories category. That's where we see, as I said to you earlier, that just too many units moving into the marketplace. Now while we love the fact that consumers are responding to our product and buying more of it  by a lot, and again, all of our consumer research shows that the brand engagement and the brand loyalty is at highest levels that it's ever been, and your analysis that you do annually indicate the same thing. So we just -- we don't like the amount of product that's ending up out in the marketplace. So this is not an issue of doors or anything like that. This is really more an issue of having the right amount of product given where we want to get back to in terms of full price selling versus promotional selling."

Erinn, obviously, we had a good quarter from a comp store standpoint, I think, globally compared to many of our competitors. I think we were close to best-in-class, because, again, remember, many of the European competitors are reporting on a reported basis. But when you really look at the constant currency, I think in Europe, in particular, we did better than most. That being said, we're definitely seeing the business stronger in -- as I mentioned in the last quarter, Italy and Spain, and in certain of the Eastern European markets. Our business is -- for example, in Russia, is outstanding. Now that's not in our comp, but I'm just telling you, it's very, very strong there. On the other hand, we are seeing, as many luxury companies have reported, our business in the -- in France after the terrorist attacks has been very difficult and continues to decline given the tourism decline in that marketplace. We have had difficulty in the U.K. that was driven primarily -- or initially by currency changes. That's now kind of changed a little bit given that we got some issues that people are thinking about with Brexit, et cetera. So our business remains a bit challenged  there. I would tell you, overall, in Europe, and I've seen some other luxury goods companies report this as well, we do see headwinds. Tourism into Europe is declining. There's a lot of macro issues in Europe. There was another terrorism alert that came out yesterday. So we believe that Europe, while it's still growth opportunities for us, as Joe indicated in terms of region, it's going to be a bumpy road in 2017. Until there is some issues settled politically, we're not exactly sure where the FX is going to end up for the year. And so we're going to stick very close to that. Again, growth market for us, but it's -- I think there's going to be a few bumps as we get through the year."

We have a powerful business model that's generating tremendous amount of cash, and we have multiple growth opportunities. And as long as the stock remains, in our opinion, and it's just our opinion, significantly undervalued, we will be aggressively in the marketplace over the next year taking advantage. We've taken out 15% of our shares, and we're going to keep going. We have the balance sheet and cash flow to continue to do that. So you can be very sure that we're going to be returning value to our shareholders, particularly at this time, and we think that's going to bare a lot of fruit when people understand that Michael Kors is here to stay, powerful business model, one of the most profitable companies in the market, and we will continue to deliver great results."

When we took this company public, and you've heard me say this many, many times, we said to you that North America would grow. It will eventually reach maturity. And that  if that happened, Europe would come on and if that happened, Asia would come on. And I think all of those things have played out as we have laid them out, with the exception of what's really happened in mall traffic in North America. I don't think any of us have the crystal ball to see that coming and, obviously, part of that is driven by the digital shift in the consumer behavior, and the other part of that is driven by -- in our case, and I know in some of our very, very valued department store partners' cases -- and by the way, when I use that word, department store, it's not just North America because I know everybody on this call is focused on North America wholesale, but we have a lot of business around the world. The department stores in Europe are facing many challenges with traffic from tourism as well. So -- and the second thing we said when we went public was that this company ultimately would be 70%, 75% retail versus wholesale. Wholesale just grew faster than we had ever anticipated. And we enjoyed that. We think that's terrific, and we're going to continue to enjoy that. But that's -- we ultimately, first and foremost, are retailers. Ultimately, we believe that our store network, which will get to some 1,000 stores worldwide, will be the cornerstone of our development and growth. And it will be somewhere between 65% and 75% retail and the balance will be wholesale. And as you look at China, China is -- I mean -- sorry, Asia. Asia is basically all retail. Small wholesale business there with some Duty Free operators and a license business -- small license business there. And in Europe, Europe is going to -- has always been a business that will grow more quickly in retail because there's just more opportunity for us to do that. So again, I don't think that should be any surprise. That's kind of what we had laid out initially. We just were able to develop wholesale piece of it faster than the retail piece. In terms of SKUs, I'll go back to your first question. No, there's not going to be really any change in SKU. And if anything, I think when  many of you came through our showrooms, you saw the amount of product innovation that our design teams are delivering is really quite exciting. And I think it's what the market needs. I've been very vocal on the fact that I think the market has had a malaise in terms of design. I think that the consumer needs to see something that's got more interest in terms of product and quality. And I think many of our competition is doing a great job. In particular, some of our European competitors are doing just an outstanding job with new product innovation. You'll see some additional things coming to bear very shortly on our website that will be exclusively on our website with products that we will be, quite frankly, building custom for consumers.  We think that that's going to become even more of an issue as people look at what's in their wardrobe and how we curate that for them. So there's going to be actually more customization that we're going to look at on a go-forward basis. You'll see some of that be launched. We'll talk about that in the next call. In terms of AUR, AUR declined in both channels. And in our retail channel, it was a bit more driven by size of bag than promotion, but clearly, promotion added to the decline in AUR. And in the wholesale channel, it was higher than our own channel. And that's just because there is more activity in that channel by more people and, of course, there's tremendous amount of price matching that goes on. So that's really added to a bit of the chaos of the situation that's happening in that particular channel. So thank you very much, Randy."

I think AUR is actually going to increase, and we told you -- again, I apologize, I don't remember if you were in the showroom walk-through  or not, but we said that AUR, we are actually focused on that, and we're doing that through kind of 3 things. First, we believe that by reducing the amount of inventory at retail that's available for sale, it's going to raise the AUR. Secondly, we are taking the smaller bags and we're offering more fashion design into those products, and actually offering higher price points. It was a strategy that Michael personally really came up with, and we think it's a brilliant strategy because it's not just the price that she's interested in the smaller bags, it's the size. So we believe that we probably actually been slightly under-charging  and slightly under designing in terms of where -- she'll definitely pay somewhere between $200 and $300 for a crossbody. Why can't we have more of them at the higher price point? And we -- so that you'll be seeing that coming to bear in the stores. And then also, we believe that one of the reasons why the predominant amount of handbags that many of us are selling are in that $300 to $350 range is because we really haven't been providing enough design to get the customer excited for higher price point product. And so that's coming -- and so that will actually raise the AUR for fall season on the floor inside the stores. So we feel very good about that strategy. Reduced units get AURs up, still being very competitive price points, because I don't want you think that we're having a complete shift in pricing. But we think that's the right thing to do, and we think the customer's response that because she's going to see the value in the design of the product."

We would have made the kind of projection that we talked about, with 23%, 24%, had we not made this decision to reduce the wholesale inventories, we would have been kind of right there. So we made the decision that we're in this for the long term, as we've told everyone since we started this journey. We're building, as Joe mentioned before, our new distribution center in Venlo. We're developing a CRM team and systems here that are going to be world class, in our opinion. We're building out a web -- our e-commerce capabilities on platforms that we own quite frankly. These are not platforms that we're paying  fees on, et cetera. we've decided to go the long-term route on all of our investments into this company because we think it's obviously one of the greatest fashion luxury companies in the world, and we'd rather do it the right way than to do it short term to create an extra basis point, 100 basis points in operating margin.

Let me start with the industry. We believe that the North American handbag business is flat to down -- high -- sorry, low single digits in total. I know that that's different from what some other people have reported, but that's",1062,"Sure. Very good questions. Let me start with the industry. We believe that the North American handbag business is flat to down -- high -- sorry, low single digits in total. I know that that's different from what some other people have reported, but that's just our belief. So we believe that the North American business, handbag business is about flat to down low single digits. And that's, I think, primarily because of the promoting that's going on. Obviously, units are up double digits, and I think it's for most of us. In -- and by the way, that includes luxury players too, because I know, many times, we have these conversations. There's only 2 other competitors that are referred to, but we see the same thing happening with multiple luxury companies, obviously, with the exclusion of Vuitton who doesn't operate in the sale environment, but many other companies are -- their amount that they're selling on sale is higher than the amount that they're selling at regular price this year versus last year. The -- we believe the macro handbag, luxury handbag market is relatively flat on a global basis, possibly up 1 point or 2. So -- and we believe that's going to be sort of the trend on a macro basis for the next year at least. And of course, you've seen that in the recent Altagamma-Bain luxury report, which echoed the same exact issues, with the exception of our point of view on the North American handbag market. We believe that there's softening that's continuing in mall traffic. We've actually seen an acceleration of softening in mall traffic. And this is not just our stores, this is what we see from ShopperTrak, which is a company that we use -- that looks at our -- that looks at not only ours but other retailers' numbers. So we compare ourselves to that on a pretty regular basis. So mall traffic continues to soften in North America. We do not see the tourism rebounding. So we're taking a slightly more pessimistic view of Q1 and Q2 for us. Q3 and Q4, we feel pretty optimistic about. And if you remember last year when we were sitting here at this time having this conversation, I know many people didn't believe we were going to be able to do what we did. And I understand why. That's not a negative. But we did. We delivered on everything that we said we were going to do through the year, including the comps. In the back half of the year, we got some amazing things that are going to be happening for us. First and foremost, we're really seeing the e-commerce part of our business accelerate. You heard me -- we more than increased by over 50% our e-commerce sales this past year. And traffic remains strong, double-digit increases. And so what we need to have in place is this great CRM capability, which, today, we don't really have -- we have a fair CRM capability, but we're building out -- it's going to be, as I said earlier in the call, world-class. And that, we think, is going to give us the ability to do a lot of things in the back half of the year, which we're going to talk about in our next conference call. Everything from bespoke  up offerings to curation  specialty that we're going to be doing, and just the way we're able to engage with our customer. Second is our new product initiatives. Our introductions are very strong. I think it's the best product that we've shown since at least I've been here with this company. And again, Michael and the design teams have really done a tremendous job featuring what I consider to be the highest levels of innovation in our company and in terms of the materials and the silhouettes, et cetera. So I think it's going to be powerful, and I think our customers are going to be extremely excited about the newness. Next is Kors ACCESS. Kors ACCESS is going to be a very big help for us. As you recall, we talk about 2 things constantly in these calls, North America and handbags. And we don't -- always remember we're a retail company, which I'd like to remind everybody on this call. We're a retail company. And secondly, we don't talk about the fact that watches have really had  tremendous impact on our comp store sales. I mean, this is the #1 area that has hurt us in comp store sales over the last 2 years. And again, this is -- our partner, at Fossil, terrific people, doing a great job for us, and it's really been -- because people have moved to the iPhone and, to some degree, iWatch, but I think it's really more the switch to that. So Kors ACCESS is going to be a really powerful new innovative opportunity for our sales associates to communicate, engage with our customer. And then the trackers are going to be great. You know we've got some competitors out there. And I'll say that Fitbit is a competitor of ours, and we think that we're going to have the most innovation in terms of fashion in a tracker, any company in the world. And I'm being that strong about the statement. And we priced it from $95 to $150. We're going after this aggressively, and we think that's going to be an amazing opportunity for us, in particular, in the third quarter. And then lastly, we told you, before I forget, the launch of Wanderlust is always a big plus for us when we see that happen. Lots of television, marketing campaigns. Lauder has done an amazing job with this new fragrance with us, and Lauder has been just a terrific partner with us. And lastly, is going to be gifting. We did a great job last year with gifting and it really helped us in Q3. We told you about that. We've taken that to a whole new level for this year. So we -- this isn't full hockey stick, I don't want you to think of it that way, but we're going to have a very good third and fourth quarter in this company.

John, what is your thoughts from an industry and a company-specific strategy-wise regarding the reality of price matching? And also how mobile is really changing how the consumer shops, and how the path to purchase works in terms of multiple channels and thinking about mobile. And then also, John, I know, we've been following a lot of the luxury companies, and there's been a pretty sharp divergence between  Hong Kong, Macau versus Mainland. Is that something you're seeing? And how are your thoughts on the real estate in terms of what you're thinking about, as a lot of people are focused on real productivity per point of store in Asia versus distribution growth?"

My opinion of price matching is that it's a race to the bottom. So I believe that those people who want to participate in that, as a general rule, will ultimately see their business decline. And I also kno",775,"Well, I'm going to start with the price matching. My opinion of price matching is that it's a race to the bottom. So I believe that those people who want to participate in that, as a general rule, will ultimately see their business decline. And I also know that many people think that that's a way to protect their relationship with their customer. I think it's a way to devalue the relationship. It just basically means that they don't believe in -- when they do have a sale or an offering for their customer that it's legitimate, they just offer anything at any time. So my personal opinion is it's a race to the bottom. I think mobile has definitely changed consumer shopping behavior. Everything from the way that people shop and -- which is obviously hurting mall traffic, because people -- we know they're beginning their journey online and ultimately -- we're still doing 90-plus percent of our business in North America in stores. So stores are still real. And while one day, I publicly said, we'll get 25%, 30% of our business in e-commerce, we're nowhere near that today. But that being said, we have to be very cognizant that consumer is starting and definitely creating her path to purchase on mobile, and we better be a part of that and be good at it and be influencing her through that journey. I want to note that we don't do the price matching thing, and our comps are, quite frankly, better than a lot of other people's comps who are doing all these types of things. So you can't continue to build your business, especially with the mobile view that says to your customer it's all about price because that will ultimately just drive the AUR down, which will ultimately -- you can't sell enough units to make up for the dollars. It just doesn't work. But we do think that our new CRM groups that we're putting together here and the investments we're going to be making will give us the ability to really change the shopping experience. And Oliver, as you know, if you go onto our Flatiron  store, you'll see Kors Concierge is up and live. It's a whole digital shopping experience with the customers that our sales associates are fully enabled with. We'll have 35 stores rolled out the next few months. And we're going to arm our customers with the ability to be the ultimate fashion stylists for their clients and be able to curate for them. And that's what people want. If you want to get away from price, it has to be product, it has to be innovation, and we believe strongly, it has to be curation. So that's our point of view on that. In terms of Hong Kong and Macau, as I said earlier, we got lucky. We have nice distribution in Macau. We're in some terrific locations. So there'll be no real estate changes in Macau. Obviously, our business is very difficult there and really not seeing any signs of any kind of recovery in that marketplace. Hong Kong, we do not have a large distribution there, a few points of distribution. Believe it or not, our Hong Kong business, I don't -- I can't 100% explain to you why, but over the last 60 days, it's actually showing signs of improvement. So I don't want to tell you that's a trend by any stretch of the imagination, but what was terrible before is now just kind of bad. So we feel good about where we are. And I would tell you that we are looking at real estate in Hong Kong as an opportunity for the company, especially since rents have come down significantly since their peak. So we'll be cautious. We'll continue to view things as where is the consumer shopping. Ultimately, Hong Kong is going to come back. Is it a year from now, is it 2 years from now, is it 5 years from now? Nobody knows, but Hong Kong will become a place that is important. The only thing I would add to that is what I think many luxury companies are seeing is there is a movement of the people who are coming to Hong Kong and Macau now are a bit more coming from Tier 2, 3 and 4 cities. The Tier 1 customer, who is still the -- probably the biggest average per spend customer, is moving into clearly Europe, clearly Japan, clearly Korea. So the average transaction that many people are seeing in those markets is slightly down because of just the customer mix."

I mean, people are so engaged with the -- whether it's Michael and Nina Agdal, and the glamour games that we put up, or whether it's the whole new campaign that we just shot in Mexico for summer and all the different videos, or if it's the Mother's Day campaign, which was a huge success for us, with Alessandra Ambrosio, or whether it's Lily Aldridge doing a whole sneaker campaign for us. So I think we're really good as a company. And our teams are excellent at developing content that is engaging. And it's exciting the customer and keeping them engaged with the brand. They may not actually shop from that, but I think they love being a part of the Michael Kors family. And so I think in today's world, you have to be there. I mean, look at our major competitors in Europe, and everyone is upping the game, whether it's fashion shows in Rio or Blenheim Castle, or whatever the -- Palace, excuse me -- whatever the things are, you have to understand that we're in the business of exciting people. And that's fun, quite frankly. That's the fun part about what we get to do here every day. Products, first, but quite frankly, marketing and brand and exciting and engaging the customers, second.

First off, Omar, thank you for your questions, and thank you for your one comment that it is true that our -- the traffic issue is not a Michael Kors issue. This is an issue  -- I don't know one retailer that I speak to who isn't seeing this happenin",866,"Yes. First off, Omar, thank you for your questions, and thank you for your one comment that it is true that our -- the traffic issue is not a Michael Kors issue. This is an issue  -- I don't know one retailer that I speak to who isn't seeing this happening. And Omar, I would first start by calling the traffic thing a behavioral change. And again, I think many times that we're the first company or the most honest company to come out and say, ""These traffic trends, you're starting to see in other places in the world."" So mall traffic is declining in Europe now. It's declining in the U.K., in particular. And I would tell you that in the most sophisticated digital markets is where you see the most mall traffic slowing. So we start out, and this is just our theory and just our hypothesis, that consumers who have high levels of digital product availability are shopping less in shopping malls. And U.K. is a perfect example. As Harrods and Selfridges and House of Fraser and John Lewis all got better with e-commerce, there's just more business going there, and we know that because we do business with them. We see how much percentage-wise. The U.K., for us, has some of the highest levels of penetration with our department store partners anywhere else in the world. So somewhere between 25% and 35% of our business with those retailers comes from online. And they're the most sophisticated at click and collect, they're the most sophisticated at same-day delivery service. They do it better than any department store in the world -- in the U.K. But that's affecting mall traffic. So we think that's only going to continue on because people are just going to get better. We'll be announcing shortly some cities in the United States where we'll be providing same-day service, and so on and so forth. And actually, we believe that one of the most important ways that we're going to compete globally is with delivery. And delivery, one of the things that we have, which many people were concerned about, are the amount of locations that we have, both in North America and internationally. It's actually going to be a strength for us, because we will be able to offer same-day delivery. And unfortunately, probably for free. But that's going to be the new norm. And so we have to deal with that behaviorally. So what are we going to do to drive traffic into the stores? Well, first and foremost, we believe that creative marketing leads the way. So we have to inspire the customer with new product delivered in creative marketing. And again, I think our teams -- I think we're world-class in -- if we're launching a new bag, building campaigns around that, that involve everything from Michael himself personally to certain celebrities that we make sure that the product appears on, to digital marketing campaigns and print campaigns. We're furthering that by being able to arm our sales associates with Kors Concierge, which gives them the ability, and I just actually saw it demonstrated yesterday and it's phenomenal, where they can talk directly one on one. So it's not just a corporate communication, but now you got the sales associate in the store talking to their client directly through this new curation device platform that we've built that says, ""Not only does this bag commits [ph], but here is the shoe and the dress and the jewelry that -- and the watch that's going to go with this. Why don't you come on in and let's have a conversation."" So we believe that this is going to be one on one dialogue with the customer. And we're really looking at it from the top of the funnel to the bottom of the funnel. We are not pulling back on our marketing and, in fact, we're increasing marketing. So part of the SG&A increase that you see is an increase in marketing. I made the decision a few months ago, even when we decided to reduce our wholesale business in North America, it would have been easy for us to go in and cut expenses all over the company and make up a lot of the gross profit dollars that we lost. But we made the decision that, that wasn't smart for us that we were building a long-term company, we're building a long-term relationship, and we need to drive customers into the store and you have to spend money to do that with marketing. And I think you're going to see the fruits of that between our communication efforts, our CRM and then ultimately, Kors Concierge. If it works the way we think it's going to work, we'll be able to drive traffic into the stores. Is it going to be positive traffic? I'm not sure, to be frank with you. I think that's probably wishful thinking. But I think we will be able to stay at a level that will help us have comp store increases. And again, we're getting excellent conversion rates inside the stores, and we just think that's going to continue forward."

Lindsay, I'll tell you about all the things that we really did well, and I'm going to tell you about some that didn't work as well for us. And expanding the stores, we did a handful of them. It really hasn't been a great return for us. So I would tell you that we're not going to do that. That's kind of over with. There will be a handful of select locations where we'll do that, but you'll be able to count those on your 2 hands. And there'll be more flagship-y type things. We just did it in London and -- which happens to be working, thank God. But where we did them in more regional locations, it really didn't provide the uplift from a profitability standpoint that we were anticipating. So unless we see something changing on that, that will not be part of our strategy going forward. And in terms of outlets in North America, we're basically done at this point. I think there is 1 or 2 more that we're going to open and it’s over with. So -- and that's pretty much worldwide also, but there'll be a handful that we'll open in a couple of locations, but we're pretty much finished out on that. And then over the next 2 years, maybe 3 years, we'll be finished with our global store expansion.

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Michael Kors' first quarter 2017 earnings call. 
We are pleased to report that we once again exceeded our revenue and earnings per share expectations in the quarter. We drove strong double-digit growth in our North American digital flagships, further expanded our presence in Asia, continued to develop our men's business globally and expanded our luxury fashion product assortments. However, this progress was muted by the ongoing decline in mall traffic trends as well as the decrease in tourism, which negatively impacted our comparable store sales performance during the quarter. 
We remained intently focused on executing our multiple long-term growth strategies. Michael and our design teams are delivering exceptional fashion innovation for the Fall season, particularly in our accessories and footwear categories. We are also excited about the debut of the MICHAEL KORS ACCESS wearable technology line of watches and fitness trackers, which we believe represents a meaningful growth opportunity as we position ourselves to capitalize on this rapidly growing category. We continue to have many opportunities to build the Michael Kors brand and to generate excitement around our enhanced luxury product offerings. Our team has created a series of innovative, branded marketing initiative designed to deepen consumer engagement. For example, on National Sunglass Day, we've debuted our first-ever dedicated branded Snapchat lens. Snapchat users were able to virtually try on a pair of our best-selling Kendall sunglasses, while seeing the reflection of different jet-set locations on the actual lenses. This lens enabled us to capture the attention of our younger audience on Snapchat and garnered over 100 million views, including from a number of celebrity fans sharing snaps with their followers. 
On Instagram, we recently launched #InstaKors. This innovative new commerce program seamlessly takes fans from a curated Michael Kors social engagement to a Michael Kors shopping experience.

In late May, we launched our official Michael Kors site on the Line platform in Japan, which is the most used social communication platform in this market. To celebrate this launch, we teamed up with well-known illustrator, Yuri Surikya [ph], to create an exclusive character, DJ Michelle the Cat, and Line sticker pack featuring her in iconic Michael Kors products, which were available for free to all Line users for a limited time. 
We also held events in several stores in the region to celebrate in person with our fans. I'm pleased to say that we added 1 million followers on the platform within the first 2 days. 
This and other efforts have continue to expand our engaged social media followers. We believe that the hard work behind these numerous initiatives in our product and marketing positions us for long-term success. Our focus will remain centered on maintaining our leadership position in the global luxury market, while executing on multiple pillars for revenue growth. 
Now let's take a closer look at our first quarter results. Total revenue increased 0.2% reflecting increased sales from the acquisition of our China license strong growth in Japan and an increase in our Europe region, offset by a mid-single digit decline in our Americas region. Earnings per share were $0.83 on a reported basis. Excluding $11.3 million or $0.05 per share of onetime costs related to the acquisition of our Greater China license, earnings per share were $0.88, reflecting a 1.5% increase over the comparable period last year. In our Retail segment, comparable store sales decreased 7.4% due to a high single digit comp decrease in North America and a low double-digit decline in Europe. This was partially offset by a high single digit comp increase in Asia. Our North American digital flagships saw ongoing momentum during the quarter. Our digital flagship business posted strong double-digit comp growth and increased traffic as our innovative online marketing features continue to draw attention to the site, while our compelling product offerings entice our customers to shop. We believe that the digital channel represents a meaningful growth opportunity for our brand as consumers continue to transition to online shopping. We will continue to invest in our digital flagships strategy to ensure we are well positioned to further engage customers and capitalize on this shift in buying behavior. 
In the Americas, retail stores conversions increased at a double-digit rate once again. However, this was more than offset by the decrease in traffic. Our crossbodies and small leather goods style delivered mid-teens growth during the quarter. In addition, we continued to capitalize on athletic footwear trends with the compelling fashion offering, which led to strong sales growth in the quarter. The growth in these categories was more than offset by a low single digit decline in our handbag sales and a double-digit decrease in our watch sales. We believe that the decline in watches sales was consistent with the declines that are being seen in the overall fashion watch market. 
In our Europe region, we saw a high single digit increase in conversion rates, which was offset by reduced traffic in certain major markets. The region's most challenged by negative traffic was the Benelux region, France and the U.K. which we attribute to the uncertainty among consumers around Brexit and the decline in tourism resulting from terrorist attacks in France. 
Similar to the trends in our Americas regions, crossbodies, small leather goods and athletic footwear were top performers in our European stores, offset by lower handbag and watch sales. As mentioned in our previous call, we recently opened our largest flagship store on Regent Street in London. This store will serve to heighten Michael Kors' position as a leading global luxury brand across the pan-European market. In addition, we launched a partnership with McLaren-Honda in Europe, becoming the official lifestyle partner of the world championship Formula 1 team. Michael was on hand to launch the flagship store and announce our partnership with McLaren-Honda, which also provided a great opportunity for him to connect with our consumers and fans. 
In fact, following his visit, we had 76 million impressions on social media channel, illustrating the power of our brand in the European market. 
We plan to further expand our presence in Europe with the launch of digital flagships in 6 European countries beginning in the fall and in 16 countries in spring 2017.  These digital flagships will enable us to interact more directly with the European consumers on a continuous basis, broadening our reach and depending our engagement as well as allowing customers to shop Michael Kors' however and whenever they choose. 
Overall, we believe the Michael Kors remains a very strong brand in Europe with significant retail growth opportunities. 
Turning to Asia. Sales in the region increased 74% resulting from the addition of the China business as well as a high single digit comparable store sales increase in Japan. We were very pleased to see double-digit sales growth in both the China and South Korea regions. Looking ahead, we are excited about the upcoming opening of our flagship stores in Seoul and Singapore this fall. These locations will further establish Michael Kors as a global luxury brand in this region. Overall, we remain confident that Asia represents a significant long-term growth opportunity for the company. 
In our Wholesale segment, sales declined 7%. As anticipated, sales in the Americas region declined in the high single digits. As we have mentioned previously, we will prudently manage our business in this channel through disciplined inventory control and reduced promotional activity in order to protect our brand and margins.  In Europe, we saw a low single digit sales decline primarily due to a mix shift towards crossbodies and small leather goods, which carry a lower AUR. In Asia, the low single digit decline in sales was attributable to the shift of our China and South Korea business to our company-owned retail segment. 
Now turning to our product categories. While revenue on our accessories business declined, this was due to lower AURs resulting from the higher sales in crossbodies and small leather goods and increased promotional activity. Once again, overall accessories unit sales were up in the double digits reflecting strong consumer demand for our luxury products. We were particularly pleased with the strong response to new styles, including Savannah and Portia from our spring collection. Our footwear business performed well in the quarter, particularly our athletic styles. The new lightweight Amanda Trainer and Billy Trainer resonated well with customers as they are updates to our iconic style, such as the Keaton. We also saw strong response to newness in our Sando category driven by the Becky, Mirabelle, Sonja flat and Wesley mule styles. Finally, our men's category continues to deliver solid performance in the first quarter. We ended the quarter with 15 men's freestanding or side-by-side retail locations, and with approximately 200 sportswear and leather goods shop-in-shops with our wholesale partners. We are very excited as we continue to expand the breadth of Michael Kors men's customers that now visits our digital flagships at a location near them to shop for exciting product firsthand. During the quarter, our men's accessories business continue to exceed our internal plans both within our omnichannel retail and wholesale businesses. The success was largely driven by small leather goods, backpacks and messengers. As we look ahead, within the next 6 months, you will see an expanded presence of our men's accessories business within both our own stores and our global wholesale partners. 
Finally, we're excited to leverage our partnership with McLaren-Honda to create events with world-famous drivers, Fernando Alonso and Jenson Button, in select stores in Europe, connecting the jet-set image of Formula One with the Michael Kors man. This is one example of how our broadening strategy to expand our men's lifestyle presence in Europe. 
Turning to our Licensing segment. Sales declined during the quarter due to continued weakness in the watch category as the watch industry remains challenged overall in both the fashion and luxury segment. That said, we are excited to be entering the growing smartwatch category with the September launch of our MICHAEL KORS ACCESS collection. We are pleased to be teaming up with Google and utilizing their Android Wear operating system to run this truly unique accessory. The smartwatch will be available in 2 styles, each with thousands of different display options. The touchscreen device allows you to see your social media updates, text, emails and call alerts, use voice controls to access services via Ok Google, track your fitness and much more. Our smartwatches will be priced between $350 and $395. 
In addition, we will be debuting a line of smart jewelry priced from $95 to $145, offering her a fitness tracker and a sleep monitor as both fashionable and functional. 
To support the line of our -- of ACCESS, we will execute a comprehensive marketing campaign for the fall and holiday seasons across prints and social media with editorial coverage across key fashion and technology publication and featured placement on our social media channels. 
In addition, we will be debuting an advertising campaign at Spot Flights, the ACCESS line, and the product will also be featured as one of the must-have gifts for our holiday gift guide. 
Finally, we will be launching a new section on our website where customers can learn more about both the watches and the trackers and explore the styles and functions that the products offer. 
Our partnership with Google, in addition to our chic and cutting-edge product line and innovative marketing campaign, will position us to be the fashion leader in this high-growth category. 
During the first quarter, growth in our licenses fragrance business was driven by our gifting programs for Mother's Day and Father's Day as well as strengthening branding in international markets. As we mentioned last quarter, we are looking forward to launch of Wonderlust this fall, which we believe will be a new pillar in our fragrance collection and will drive further growth in this category. We were also pleased with the great response to our new eyewear offering both domestically and internationally during the quarter. Our retail performance in eyewear accelerated nicely during the quarter, which is a reflection of our enhanced design and strong partnership with Luxottica. In particular, our aviators and our popular Kendall and Elvia styles were big hits during the quarter. 
In conclusion, the Michael Kors brand remains strong, and we have multiple long-term growth opportunities across our product categories and regions. We remain intently focus on delivering fashion luxury products to our customers. In the Fall season, we will be introducing 18 new handbag groups globally. These new collections will feature seasonal colors, such as plum, moss green and brick red, with novelty design elements, including hardware, granite and paisley print patterns. In footwear, novelty details and new materials will play a big role in our fall offerings, with pearls, jewelry embellishments, velvet and flannel all featured prominently in the collection. In addition, we will be expanding our Rainville offering with updates such as tweed and quilted. To capitalize on our strong fashion secret trends, we'll be introducing 2 new styles, the Skull Trainer and the Puppy Sneaker. We also look forward to launch our digital flagship worldwide and the upcoming debut of both our MICHAEL KORS ACCESS line of wearable technology and our Wonderlust fragrance. In addition, we will continue to develop our men's business, which has a long-term potential to expand our business globally and to expand our business across Asia. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Joe for our financial reviews."

We are pleased to report that revenue and earnings per share results came in above our guidance. Total revenue grew 0.2% to $987.9 million. In our Retail segment, net sales increased 7.6% driven primarily by the opening of 221 net new stores since the first quarter of last year, including 145 stores associated with our recent acquisitions of Greater China and South Korea and the consolidation of our Latin American operations. Comp sales decreased 7.4% reflecting a high single digit comp decrease in North America and a low double-digit decline in Europe, partially offset by a high single digit comp increase in Asia and strong performance of our digital flagships. Our North American digital flagships sales contributed 210 basis points to our North American comp performance in the quarter. 
In our Wholesale segment, net sales declined 7.0% due to lower sales in our accessories and womenswear line, partially offset by increases in our men's and footwear businesses. As expected, we saw a high single digit decline in our wholesale business in the Americas region as we remain disciplined with the amount of inventory we flow into that channel. We also saw a low single digit decline in Europe as well as a low single digit decline in Asia, which primary reflects the shift of our Greater China and South Korea businesses to the Retail segment during the quarter. 
In our Licensing segment. Revenue decreased 20.9%. This was primarily due to the continued softness in the fashion watch category as well as lower revenues from our geographic licensing arrangements in Asia due to our recent acquisition of our licensee operations. Gross margin declined 130 basis points to 59.9%. The decline in gross margin is primarily due to a 480 basis point decline in retail gross margins attributable to additional markdowns, partially offset by an increase of 210 basis points in our wholesale gross margin, primarily attributable to favorable product mix and improve sourcing. We also saw a benefit from changes in geographic mix as we saw a 14.8% increase in sales from regions outside of the Americas. 
Total operating expenses grew 13.9% and increased 490 basis points to 40.9% of total revenue. The increase was primarily due to the inclusion of our businesses in Greater China, South Korea and Latin America; transaction cost associated with the acquisition of our Greater China business; our investment in new stores, e-commerce and omnichannel capabilities; new shop-in-shops and infrastructure improvements. Excluding $11.3 million of onetime cost related to the acquisition of the Greater China license during the quarter, total operating expense for the quarter grew 10.7% and was 39.8% of total revenue. Income from operations was $186.9 million or 18.9% of total revenue as compared to 25.2% of total revenue in the same period last year. Excluding the aforementioned onetime costs associated with the acquisition of Greater China license, income from operations was $198.2 million or 20.1% of total revenue. Retail operating margin was 11.8% compared to 23.1% in the prior year period. Our operating margin was impacted by the 480 basis point decrease in gross margin as described earlier. The decline was also due to a 310 basis point increase in operating expenses associated with higher retail store-related cost and depreciation related to new store openings, a 200 basis point negative impact associated with the forementioned transaction cost related to the acquisition of Greater China and a 140 basis point negative impact from the inclusion of our business in Greater China, South Korea and Latin America. We expect the inclusion of these international businesses to negatively impact our operating margin for the balance of the year. We anticipate that retail operating margin will benefit from the sequential improvement in the comp sales as well as higher gross margins in the back half of the year. 
Wholesale operating margin increased 150 basis points, primarily due to the aforementioned increase in wholesale gross margins, partially offset by a 60 [ph] basis points increase in operating expense primarily related to higher distribution, selling and depreciation and amortization expense. Licensing operating margin decreased 530 basis points primarily due to increased cost associated with intellectual property protection as well as increased depreciation expenses partially offset by lower advertising costs during the quarter. 
Income taxes were $39.3 million in the quarter, and our effective tax rate was 21.2% as compared to 29.4% in the same period last year. The decrease in our effective tax rate was primarily due to the favorable effect of certain global financing activities that we have undertaken as well as increase in taxable income in certain of our non-U.S. subsidiaries and state tax benefits that we recognize during the quarter. 
Net income was $147.1 million for the first quarter, and diluted earnings per share was $0.83. Excluding the aforementioned onetime cost, net income for the quarter was $156.0 million or $0.88 per diluted share. 
Turning to our balance sheet. At the end of the quarter, cash and cash equivalents were $337.1 million. Inventory was approximately the same as the prior year, even including the $36.1 million increase in inventory resulting from the recently acquired business in Greater China due to carefully -- careful inventory management and the anticipated decline in the Americas wholesale business. We ended the quarter with $248.6 million of debt, which was recorded within short-term debt on our consolidated balance sheet. That consisted of borrowings under the company's revolving credit facilities. The amount of future borrowings is approximately $749.4 million. 
During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 8.0 million shares, totaling $400.0 million under our share repurchase program, and we have another $600.0 million of availability remaining. This represents a 5% reduction in the share count further demonstrating our commitment to returning value to shareholders. 
As a result of the recently acquired business in Greater China, among other assets and liabilities acquired, as detailed in our 10Q, we added $400.4 million, $99.0 million and $92.3 million of reacquired rights, goodwill and deferred tax liabilities to our balance sheet, respectively. The reacquired rights will be amortized through March 31, 2041, for approximately $16 million per year as a noncash expense and depreciation and amortization. Included in the quarterly results is $1.4 million of noncash amortization of the reacquired rights. 
Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $46.9 million, and were related to the build-out of new retail stores and shop-in-shops as well as investments in our distribution facilities, our corporate offices, digital flagships and other infrastructure improvements. We added 103 net new stores in the first quarter. We opened 3 net locations in the Americas and 6 in Europe. We also assumed 94 stores in Greater China. In addition, we expanded or relocated 9 stores and converted 39 wholesale doors into shop-in-shops globally. 
Turning to our outlook. For the second quarter, we expect total revenue to be between $1.07 billion and $1.085 billion, and a mid-single digit decrease in comp sales. We expect an increase in gross margin of approximately 100 to 130 basis points, driven by favorable geographic and channel mix shift. We plan to continue to invest in our international expansion, digital flagships and global infrastructure, and therefore, expect operating expense as a percent of total revenue to increase 790 to 820 basis points resulting in an operating margin of approximately 17%. 
We expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.84 to $0.88. This assumes a tax rate of approximately 21% and 171 million shares outstanding. Despite the modest reduction in our comp sales outlook to a mid-single digit decline, we are maintaining our full year guidance based upon our first quarter results and our outlook for the remainder of the year. As a reminder, for the full fiscal year 2017, we expect total revenue to be flat versus the prior year. Operating margin is expected to be approximately 21.5%, excluding the $11.3 million of onetime transaction costs related to the acquisition of our Greater China licensee. We expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $4.56 to $4.64 for the year, excluding the onetime cost noted earlier. On a GAAP basis, we expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $4.51 to $4.59, inclusive of the $11.3 million of onetime transaction costs incurred in the first quarter. This assumes a tax rate of approximately 21% and 171 million shares outstanding. 
Our guidance reflects the expected benefit from the introduction of new fashion luxury products for fall, strong holiday gifting programs, our new Wonderlust fragrance, the launch of our European digital flagships and the debut of the MICHAEL KORS ACCESS wearable technology line, in addition to our continued expansion in Asia and growth in our men's business. We also plan to drive brand engagement with exciting new marketing programs and through our jet-set luxury shopping experience in both our stores and our digital flagships. 
Capital expenditures are expected to total approximately $250 million for fiscal 2017 and will focus on ongoing investments in global digital strategies and omnichannel capabilities, global retail expansion, including approximately 15 new stores in Americas, 20 in Europe and 40 in Asia, the conversion of approximately 215 wholesale shops -- wholesale shop-in-shops globally and the company's global distribution infrastructure, information systems and corporate facilities. 
In conclusion, we have several initiatives in place to drive improved performance in the second half of the year, and are confident that we can achieve our revenue and earnings per share guidance for fiscal 2017. Overall, we continue to believe that we will be poised to deliver both sales and earnings per share growth over the long term. 
I will now turn the call back to John for closing remarks."

I'm wondering if you can talk to us about your updated expectations for wholesale this year? And if we'll get to that negative high teens run rate perhaps in fiscal Q2? And then secondarily, Joe, I'm not sure I understood the comments about retail EBIT margin inflecting in the back half. Could you just go through that one more time for us?"

I think you're going to see the inflection of global -- really North American wholesale increase as we go through the quarters as we begin to pull back our exposure in that channel and further reduce also our promotional activit",422,"Sure. Thank you, Kimberly. I think you're going to see the inflection of global -- really North American wholesale increase as we go through the quarters as we begin to pull back our exposure in that channel and further reduce also our promotional activity. In particular, that's going to start in calendar Q1 of next year. We will be removing ourselves from all store couponing, and that's for all of our retail partners in the United States and in Canada. And also we will be removing ourselves from all of the department store, friends and family sales as well. We think that this is a critical for us to really do 3 things: Number one, to protect our brand image. As you know, that channel has become very promotional. And in fact is causing us difficulties in our own retail channel, which is why you see our gross margins declining, because we're really trying to meet certain pricing that's happening to be competitive. And we don't think that's the right thing to do for our brand going forward. Secondarily, we think it's creating confusion in the consumers' mind relative to the value of the Michael Kors brand when it's being seen so often on sale in so many different places. And third, mathematically, if you look at what's happened to our business, as I've stated in the call, we're shipping double-digits in terms of increases in products, but we're porting revenue declines, and that's predominantly driven by average order declining, and that's predominantly being driven by lower prices because of promotional activity. So you'll see that accelerate in the back half of the year, and you'll also see further wholesale declines next year as well. And we planned all of that. Even with that, we are expecting earnings per share growth for the company this year and next year as well, as well as modest revenue increases for the company next year. So we're going to navigate our way through this. We know we're doing the right thing for the brand long-term. We know the customer continues to resonate with Michael Kors. Our engagement rates with our followers are higher than they've ever been. Our consumer research shows that she's more engaged and has a higher propensity to want to buy the brand than she's ever been. We have to correct something that, we think, is actually having a negative long-term effect on the brand. And so that's how you'll see that kind of manifest itself through the balance of the year."

So we've done some things that we think will improve our retail margins, in particular, in North America in the back half of the year, and we're already starting to see a bit of that come through, last month, and a little bit beginning of this month. So we're pleased with the reaction that we're having. And the second issue is, you can see one of the biggest issues that affected us this past quarter and going to affect us next quarter is the increase in our G&A. And as we've said all along, much of that spending will start to get some of that behind us after Q2 for us, the European e-commerce operation will be up and running. Will begin to bring on parts of Venlo. Remember, we're going to run 2 distribution facilities for a period of time in Europe. And there are some other initiatives that we've got going on inside the company that, we think, is going to be able to have a positive effect, really from the back half of the year going forward on G&A. So I think that with forecasting, excluding the onetime charges of 21% -- 21.5% approximately, operating margin, we think, that's still one of the best-in-class in the industry. So we look forward to delivering all that for you and for our shareholders."

You're correct that we are all facing issues around traffic, and they're really driven by 2 things. First is mobile -- mobile because as people today are not only purchasing on mobile, but they're shopping on mobile. So we think that, that has to become one of our core competencies and leading platforms that we're going to really communicate and engage with our customers. There's a number of technologies that are coming to market from some of our partners at Facebook and Google that are going to enable us to really, on a geo targeting basis, be able to change the way that we market to our customers and get it much more ring-fenced in terms of how we can communicate. And then really try to tailor our offerings to that customer. We just started testing some of this, and the results have been quite extraordinary, with customers who might have actually been lapsed customers with us. Without even any special offers, I might add. It's just really how we communicate to them and how we tailor those different messages. So that's one of the first things we're looking at, it's not just e-commerce, but it's really mobile and how we're going to market with mobile. Secondly, I would say to you that we've launched something in about 35 of our stores that's just up and running and will be fully completed in the next 30 days-or-so. That's Kors Concierge where all of our sales associates are equipped with devices that they can, number one, kind of know everything about, what's happened with the customer from a transaction history standpoint, but even more importantly, be able to create an experience for them that's more lifestyle-driven and be able to create a curated fashion message for the individual customer. And the reason why that's important is, I want to remind you that, while we are a company that are predominant businesses in accessories, we're a lifestyle brand. And we do -- the 30% of our business in non-accessory type products print. And we actually think that one of the ways that we can increase traffic inside the stores is by changing some of our messaging to be a bit more about ready-to-wear, a bit more about footwear, et cetera. And we're seeing accelerated growth because of that in those catechistic. Now those aren't yet enough to offset what we've lost in really, remember, the #1 decline of our comp store sales is watches. The #1 area that's really hurting us the most when we look at our comp store decline, so we need to get some of these other categories to deliver at a higher rate than they've been in the past. We see digital marketing as being one of the critical ways to do that. And then really arming our jet-set selling associates with the right tools to engage with the customers both in-store and out of store. So I think that's the last piece that I would just like to say that's going to be important with Kors Concierge is going to give the ability for the sales associate who's standing inside of t he store, maybe not seeing the customer walk in during the daytime with the digital technology to be able to communicate directly with the customer during the day. So we're excited about what that holds for us. And again, hopefully also one of the big headwinds that we've all seen in the industry is tourism, specialty when you're a luxury brand like ourselves or some of the other fine companies that are here, as U.S.  fashion companies or European fashion companies. We're all suffering from the fact that people aren't traveling to the destinations, especially the major cities, the way that they were in the past. And we hope that as some of these currency headwinds settle down, consumers will get a little bit more comfortable by traveling a bit more."

Number one, Michael Kors still has a significant growth opportunity. We said that Asia could be $1 billion business for us, and we think that men's, over the long term, can also be $1 billion business for us. So even if our accessories business if they flat our growth very slightly, we think those 2 businesses, in terms of regional and our product, are going to be really exciting opportunities for us. So our #1 focus in terms of use of cash and managing the assets of the company to continue to grow our existing business, which we think we will have the capabilities of doing. Secondly, we think that share repurchase is absolutely going to continue to be a priority for us. We believe that our shares are -- can significantly undervalued get versus the marketplace. We think that the marketplace has more fear built into our stock price than actual reality of what our performance is. And so we will continue to be highly active. You saw we bought $400 million or 5% of our shares outstanding back in the quarter. I think that's a pretty powerful statement about what our company and our Board of Directors feels about the value of our shares. And then lastly, we are absolutely looking at M&A activity in the marketplace. We've built a powerful platform. When I said platform, I'm talking about the infrastructure of the company from our warehouse distribution to our -- we own our platforms for our digital systems. So we think that we will be able to layer onto that, and we will be very cautious and prudent at what we look at, but we do think we have opportunities to grow this business, especially with our strong cash flows and be able to use that in acquisition. And then lastly, we will potentially, one day, will get at dividends as well. So again, lots of good things happening at Michael Kors, and lots of -- we think opportunities for investors as we move forward."

So just curious if you guys would give us any color in our factory stores might be performing versus your retail stores?

As a first question, we don't break out factory versus full price. But I will tell you that as I think some of our other competitors have reported, factory traffic is down versus its historic levels, although not really that significantly. So it's not an area that we see as volatile as the full price. And really the full-price side, for us, the volatility as we talked about many times is happening major markets, whether it's New York, in South Florida, certain parts of Southern California. And you see this all with currency. So whether it's the Brazilian that hurt us down in the South Florida area, whether it's the Mexican peso that hurts us, certain parts of Southern California, whether it's the euro because we have close to $1 billion business and so European coming to New York is very important for us. Or in Europe where all of a sudden with this horrific atrocities that took place in France, certain Asian consumers are nervous about traveling to that marketplace. So those are big markets for us, and they're meaningful markets for us. And as we look across our fleet of stores where we're suffering the greatest is really in the tourist market. Where we have -- remember, where we're not heavily penetrated by tourist, actually, those markets relatively healthy with the local customers [indiscernible]. So that's kind of the state of what we see in that area. In terms of what we're expecting in transfer. Brian, we're really not, for the time being. I've done this for a few times in my life. And somehow, when things go away, you just don't see all of a sudden transfer to another place. What we are expecting is our average order -- or average consumer purchase to increase, and we expect that to increase substantially. Again, we are looking to actually sell less units. So hopefully, when I'm on this call with you at this time next year, we will be happy to be telling you that we're selling less units into the marketplace. And dollars, we will more than make up by increasing average order value, which is where we need to get back to, and we're going to work very hard. You heard me say that we're going to remove ourselves from all coupons, from all friends and family sales, that will happen in -- starting in February. That's a very, very big statement on Michael Kors part to show that we believe in our brand, we believe in the quality and the design that Michael and our teams are putting forward, and we believe that, as the leading American luxury fashion brand, we have an obligation to give our consumers the right vision on our product and not one that is driven by promotion and sale activities."

We -- this industry has evolved over the past few years to accelerated promotional activity. And we know that, that's the absolute wrong thing to do for a business over the long term. And so we have put in fairly significant plans, declines in certain areas of the business. One of them obviously being wholesale. But we also have things that are going to offset that. So we have regional -- remember, this is in North America or actually United States and Canada conversation that we're having, and we have significant businesses in Europe. We have significant business and growing rapidly in Asia, which we think will continue to offset the declines that we're planning in United States and Canada as it relates of the wholesale piece. And additionally, we have new product categories that we're entering, men's, in particular, which we think will also help offset this. So I don't want you to think that they don't understand that there will be decline in certain categories because of less promotional activity. We absolutely understand that, believe that, and quite frankly, want that because we want to ship less units at lower prices that's not the way to ultimately build a luxury business."

We just -- with the pounds moving around everywhere -- very rapidly, we have not seen the tourism return to certain key markets for us yet the way that we hopefully expect that to come back. So we're being cautious to the balance of the year. The overall market is going to continue to grow for us. And again, we see that as a very healthy market for us. But we just want to plan this cautiously. We also, again, don’t want to put too much inventory in the stores and start to create any kind of a situation where consumers would see the accelerated markdown. Some of the European department stores have begun to do certain things that we think is not healthy for the long-term state of their industry. As you know, the U.K. has started Black Friday. There's different things going on in certain marketplaces that begin to look and smell a little bit about like the U.S, not anywhere near as dramatic, but they're struggling as well with low traffic in the stores and difficult performance. So we want to be very careful. Again, remember, as we hopefully continue to shoot for 21.5% operating margin, which we think puts us as one of the best-in-class, we have an aggressive share repurchase program, we are forecasting earnings per share growth in the company. We have ways to get through this that don't have to put us in a position where comp store sales is the single most important thing that we have to do. We'd rather manage our brand through this what we consider to be difficult times, deliver great results for our shareholders and make sure that our balance sheet stays very, very clean and grow for the future."

We, obviously, were disappointed, and we came in, in the high single digits, it's approximately 7%. And that was really caused by what happened to us in Europe. We were anticipating kind of a decline of the level in North American comps. So we weren't surprised by what happened. And really, we knew that this quarter was going to be a highly promotional quarter for the entire Retail segment in North America. And I think we, unfortunately, were right. The amount of promotional activity from many of the people who carry our line was at its all-time high, and we have to compete to be able to move our inventories during that period of time. So when you do that, it just lowers your average order value, and we just can't keep up with, even though our transactions -- our conversion was up double-digit. So again, that's the whole cycle that we're working to get ourselves out of come spring season, and really rebalance the brand from where it was previously. In terms of the question regarding the increase in sales for next year, that's really a function of, as I've said before, we're going to grow our men's business, we're going to grow our business in Asia, and our business in Europe is going to continue to grow. So that will offset our plan to decline in the North American marketplace even with the reduction of department stores inventory. We are not planning on reducing doors in the department stores today. Again, even with our reduction with most of our accounts, we're still one of the highest productivity lines on the floor today in terms of sales per square foot. So while we have less product there, and I think ultimately, they will also experience a higher order value, which will hopefully balance out some of the reduction in inventory, we're still a very important line for these stores to carry, in not only accessories but footwear and women's ready-to-wear and watches and in fragrance. So I think it's just balancing it and getting it to a point where it's about less about promotion and more about full price selling."

And as you know, we think we've got one of the best products in the marketplace. So we're competing in a different arena. We're competing against some very significant competitors, being Apple and Samsung and et cetera. But we think with our partnership with Google and the fact that we believe that we've got a product that's better looking from a fashion standpoint and the consumer research that we've done, in particular, with female customer, bearing out absolutely she wants something that's exciting looking and not quite as just tech-looking, so more fashion in its nature. So you're going to see it. It will arrive in the next few weeks, September 1 is when the launch begins. But the marketing campaign behind it is absolutely extraordinary. Our team has done, I think, one of the best jobs in the industry in terms of putting together the messaging around it. I think it's going to offset the decline that we saw in where the watch business before. This was a higher price item even though are very competitively priced at $350 to $395, it's still higher priced than at $225, $250 current watch. So this is going to take more time for the consumer to get comfortable with it. I think we'll see it accelerate modestly through Q2, and then into Q3 or calendar Q4, I think we'll see some very nice lift from this. And by the way, it's not only in our own stores. It's in our current department store partners. And this is a global launch, so the initiative is massive. We're really excited about the smart jewelry. I might say that we're competitively priced at $95 to $145. You can assume with the competitors are out there. And we don't think anyone is doing the type of assortment that we've done. There will be major outpost in our partners' locations as well as in on our own stores. We see this as a very, very big gifting opportunity during the holiday season. And we think this is going to give us a pretty significant lift in our own stores as well as our partners. So good things to come on that front and we're pleased with technology partnerships and execution that has been developed. As it relates to the crossbody and SLG, we've lapsed it. We started lapsing it's already. And you heard me say in the call earlier, we still are seeing double-digit increases in this. I would tell you that there's 2 things I think going on: Number one, I think we are absolutely on trend as it relates to this category. It's clearly still what's driving the accessories business is just from a fashion standpoint. Smaller bags and heavily driven by crossbodies. And secondly, I think we have a deeper base of a younger customer than some of our cost competitors that's driven by some of the marketing initiatives we have, it's driven just buy history of our fashion leadership. So that has a category that we think that's going to continue right through the holiday season. You're going to see this new collection that we're offering that will go up on our website and exclusive on our stores, called Sloan Select, Sloan handbooks, which is one of our best-selling bag, and this will be an opportunity where people will be able to customize their own bags with multiple different options. We also have the new Scout camera bag, which is also a with our in-stacks exclusive that we'll have in our stores for the holiday season. Again, this is something that no one is really doing in the fashion business. So all these initiatives they're driven around some of the smaller bags. That being said, very, very pleased. Some of the new products just hit last week in our stores, 8 of the 18 new groups that I talked to you about, I'm pleased take a look at the that Brooklyn. We've got a winner, we've got one that is the new bag it's really starting to take in the strong. We've had the highest sell-throughs of the new group that we've seen in over 2 years in a weeks time. So I brought you all up here to show you the showrooms. You may remember that was 1 of our key groups. Our influencer campaign launches on it. We're really feeling good about what's happening there. Lastly, in terms of the inventories. We've already started to wind on the inventories in the wholesale channel. Additionally, as you saw the saw the promotional activities, the retailers are getting their inventories in line. We do not expect there to be any inventory issues in our own channels with the retailers for the Fall season. That doesn't mean they're not going to be promotional, I can't tell you what they're going to do and not do given the traffic situation. But in terms of inventory, there'll be a significant amount of less inventory in the retail channel of Michael Kors products.

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Michael Kors First Quarter 2017 Earnings Call.We are pleased to report that we once again exceeded our revenue and earnings per share expectations in the quarter. We drove strong double-digit growth",2282,"Thank you, Joe. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Michael Kors First Quarter 2017 Earnings Call.
We are pleased to report that we once again exceeded our revenue and earnings per share expectations in the quarter. We drove strong double-digit growth in our North American digital flagships, further expanded our presence in Asia, continued to develop our men's business globally and expanded our luxury fashion product assortments. However, this progress was muted by the ongoing decline in mall traffic trends as well as the decrease in tourism, which negatively impacted our comparable store sales performance during the quarter.
We remained intently focused on executing our multiple long-term growth strategies. Michael and our design teams are delivering exceptional fashion innovation for the fall season, particularly in our accessories and footwear categories. We are also excited about the debut of the MICHAEL KORS ACCESS wearable technology line of watches and fitness trackers, which we believe represents a meaningful growth opportunity as we position ourselves to capitalize on this rapidly growing category.
We continue to have many opportunities to build the Michael Kors brand and to generate excitement around our enhanced luxury product offerings. Our team has created a series of innovative, branded marketing initiative designed to deepen consumer engagement. For example, on National Sunglass Day, we debuted our first-ever dedicated branded Snapchat lens. Snapchat users were able to virtually try on a pair of our best-selling Kendall sunglasses, while seeing the reflection of different jet-set locations on the actual lenses. This lens enabled us to capture the attention of our younger audience on Snapchat and garnered over 100 million views, including from a number of celebrity fans sharing snaps with their followers.
On Instagram, we recently launched #InstaKors. This innovative new commerce program seamlessly takes fans from a curated Michael Kors social engagement to a Michael Kors shopping experience. By clicking a link on our profile, followers are able to easily shop for their favorite items from our Instagram feed. #InstaKors makes it much easier for our customers to shop the styles they love in a way that is fun and interactive.
In late May, we launched our official Michael Kors site on the Line platform in Japan, which is the most used social communication platform in this market. To celebrate this launch, we teamed up with well-known illustrator, Yurie Sekiya, to create an exclusive character, DJ Michelle the Cat, and Line sticker pack featuring her in iconic Michael Kors products, which were available for free to all Line users for a limited time.
We also held events in several stores in the region to celebrate in person with our fans. I'm pleased to say that we added 1 million followers on the platform within the first 2 days.
These and other efforts have continued to expand our engaged social media followers. We believe that the hard work behind these numerous initiatives in our product and marketing positions us for long-term success. Our focus will remain centered on maintaining our leadership position in the global luxury market, while executing on multiple pillars for revenue growth.
Now let's take a closer look at our first quarter results. Total revenue increased 0.2% reflecting increased sales from the acquisition of our China license, strong growth in Japan and an increase in our Europe region, offset by a mid-single digit decline in our Americas region. Earnings per share were $0.83 on a reported basis. Excluding $11.3 million or $0.05 per share of onetime costs related to the acquisition of our Greater China license, earnings per share were $0.88, reflecting a 1.5% increase over the comparable period last year.
In our retail segment, comparable store sales decreased 7.4% due to a high single-digit comp decrease in North America and a low double-digit decline in Europe. This was partially offset by a high single-digit comp increase in Asia. Our North American digital flagships saw ongoing momentum during the quarter. Our digital flagship business posted strong double-digit comp growth and increased traffic as our innovative online marketing features continue to draw attention to the site, while our compelling product offerings entice our customers to shop. We believe that the digital channel represents a meaningful growth opportunity for our brand as consumers continue to transition to online shopping. We will continue to invest in our digital flagship strategy to ensure we are well positioned to further engage customers and capitalize on this shift in buying behavior.
In the Americas, retail stores conversions increased at a double-digit rate once again. However, this was more than offset by the decrease in traffic. Our crossbodies and small leather goods style delivered mid-teens growth during the quarter. In addition, we continued to capitalize on athletic footwear trends with a compelling fashion offering, which led to strong sales growth in the quarter. The growth in these categories was more than offset by a low single-digit decline in our handbag sales and a double-digit decrease in our watch sales. We believe that the decline in watches sales was consistent with the declines that are being seen in the overall fashion watch market.
In our Europe region, we saw a high single-digit increase in conversion rates, which was offset by reduced traffic in certain major markets. The region's most challenged by negative traffic were the Benelux region, France and the U.K., which we attribute to the uncertainty among consumers around Brexit and the decline in tourism resulting from terrorist attacks in France.
Similar to the trends in our Americas regions, crossbodies, small leather goods and athletic footwear were top performers in our European stores, offset by lower handbag and watch sales. As mentioned on our previous call, we recently opened our largest flagship store on Regent Street in London. This store will serve to heighten Michael Kors' position as a leading global luxury brand across the Pan-European market. In addition, we launched a partnership with McLaren-Honda in Europe, becoming the official lifestyle partner of the world championship Formula 1 team. Michael was on hand to launch the flagship store and announce our partnership with McLaren-Honda, which also provided a great opportunity for him to connect with our consumers and fans. In fact, following his visit, we had 76 million impressions on social media channels, illustrating the power of our brand in the European market.
We plan to further expand our presence in Europe with the launch of digital flagships in 6 European countries beginning in the fall and in 16 countries in spring 2017. These digital flagships will enable us to interact more directly with the European consumers on a continuous basis, broadening our reach and depending our engagement as well as allowing customers to shop Michael Kors however and whenever they choose.  Overall, we believe the Michael Kors remains a very strong brand in Europe with significant retail growth opportunity.
Turning to Asia. Sales in the region increased 74% resulting from the addition of the China business as well as a high single-digit comparable store sales increase in Japan. We were very pleased to see double-digit sales growth in both the China and South Korea regions. Looking ahead, we are excited about the upcoming opening of our flagship stores in Seoul and Singapore this fall. These locations will further establish Michael Kors as a global luxury brand in this region. Overall, we remain confident that Asia represents a significant long-term growth opportunity for the company.
In our wholesale segment, sales declined 7%. As anticipated, sales in the Americas region declined in the high single digits. As we have mentioned previously, we will prudently manage our business in this channel through disciplined inventory control and reduced promotional activity in order to protect our brand and margins. In Europe, we saw a low single-digit sales decline primarily due to a mix shift towards crossbodies and small leather goods, which carry a lower AUR. In Asia, the low single-digit decline in sales was attributable to the shift of our China and South Korea business to our company-owned retail segment.
Now turning to our product categories. While revenue on our accessories business declined, this was due to lower AURs resulting from the higher sales in crossbodies and small leather goods and increased promotional activity. Once again, overall accessories unit sales were up in the double digits reflecting strong consumer demand for our luxury product. We were particularly pleased with the strong response to new styles, including Savannah and Portia from our spring collection. Our footwear business performed well in the quarter, particularly our athletic styles. The new lightweight Amanda Trainer and Billie Trainer resonated well with customers as they are updates to our iconic style, such as the Keaton. We also saw strong response to newness in our sandal category driven by the Becky, Mirabel, Sonya Flat and Wesley mule styles.
Finally, our men's category continues to deliver solid performance in the first quarter. We ended the quarter with 15 men's freestanding or side-by-side retail locations, and with approximately 200 sportswear and leather goods shop-in-shops with our wholesale partners. We are very excited as we continue to expand the breadth of Michael Kors men's customers that now visit our digital flagships and a location near them to shop for exciting product firsthand. During the quarter, our men's accessories business continued to exceed our internal plans both within our omnichannel retail and wholesale businesses. The success was largely driven by small leather goods, backpacks and messengers. As we look ahead, within the next 6 months, you will see an expanded presence of our men's accessories business within both our own stores and our global wholesale partners.
Finally, we're excited to leverage our partnership with McLaren-Honda to create events with world-famous drivers, Fernando Alonso and Jenson Button, in select stores in Europe, connecting the jet-set image of Formula 1 with the Michael Kors man. This is one example of how our broadening strategy to expand our men's lifestyle presence in Europe.
Turning to our licensing segment. Sales declined during the quarter due to continued weakness in the watch category, as the watch industry remains challenged overall in both the fashion and luxury segment. That said, we are excited to be entering the growing smartwatch category with the September launch of our MICHAEL KORS ACCESS collection. We are pleased to be teaming up with Google and utilizing their Android Wear operating system to run this truly unique accessory. The smartwatch will be available in 2 styles, each with thousands of different display options. The touchscreen device allows you to see your social media updates, text, emails and call alerts, use voice controls to access services via Ok Google, track your fitness and much more. Our smartwatches will be priced between $350 and $395.
In addition, we will be debuting a line of smart jewelry priced from $95 to $145, offering her a fitness tracker and a sleep monitor as both fashionable and functional.
To support the line of our -- of ACCESS, we will execute a comprehensive marketing campaign for the fall and holiday seasons across prints and social media with editorial coverage across key fashion and technology publication and featured placement on our social media channels.
In addition, we will be debuting an advertising campaign at Spot Flights, the ACCESS line, and the product will also be featured as one of the must-have gifts for our holiday gift guide.
Finally, we will be launching a new section on our website, where customers can learn more about both the watches and the trackers and explore the styles and functions that the products offer.
Our partnership with Google, in addition to our chic and cutting-edge product line and innovative marketing campaign, will position us to be the fashion leader in this high-growth category.
During the first quarter, growth in our license fragrance business was driven by our gifting programs for Mother's Day and Father's Day as well as strengthening branding in international markets. As we mentioned last quarter, we are looking forward to the launch of Wonderlust this fall, which we believe will be a new pillar in our fragrance collection and will drive further growth in this category.
We were also pleased with the great response to our new eyewear offering both domestically and internationally during the quarter. Our retail performance in eyewear accelerated nicely during the quarter, which is a reflection of our enhanced design and strong partnership with Luxottica. In particular, our aviators and our popular Kendall and Eliba styles were big hits during the quarter.
In conclusion, the Michael Kors brand remains strong, and we have multiple long-term growth opportunities across our product categories and regions. We remain intently focused on delivering fashion luxury product to our customers. In the fall season, we will be introducing 18 new handbag groups globally. These new collections will feature seasonal colors, such as plum, moss green and brick red, with novelty design elements, including hardware, granite and paisley print patterns.
In footwear, novelty details and new materials will play a big role in our fall offerings, with pearls, jewel embellishments, velvet and flannel all featured prominently in the collection. In addition, we will be expanding our rain boots offering with updates such as tweed and quilted. To capitalize on our strong fashion secret trend, we will be introducing 2 new styles, the Skull Trainer and the Puppy Sneaker. We also look forward to launch our digital flagships worldwide and the upcoming debut of both our MICHAEL KORS ACCESS line of wearable technology and our Wonderlust fragrance. In addition, we will continue to develop our men's business, which has a long-term potential to expand our business globally and to expand our business across Asia.
With that, I'll turn it over to Joe for our financial reviews."

We are pleased to report that revenue and earnings per share results came in above our guidance. Total revenue grew 0.2% to $987.9 million. In our retail segment, net sales increased 7.6%, driven primarily by the opening of 221 net new stores since the first quarter of last year, including 145 stores associated with our recent acquisitions of Greater China and South Korea and the consolidation of our Latin American operations.
Comp sales decreased 7.4% reflecting a high single-digit comp decrease in North America and a low double-digit decline in Europe, partially offset by a high single-digit comp increase in Asia and strong performance of our digital flagships. Our North American digital flagships sales contributed 210 basis points to our North American comp performance in the quarter.
In our wholesale segment, net sales declined 7.0% due to lower sales in our accessories and womenswear line, partially offset by increases in our men's and footwear businesses. As expected, we saw a high single-digit decline in our wholesale business in the Americas region as we remain disciplined with the amount of inventory we flow into that channel. We also saw a low single-digit decline in Europe as well as a low single-digit decline in Asia, which primary reflects the shift of our Greater China and South Korea businesses to the retail segment during the quarter.
In our licensing segment, revenue decreased 20.9%. This was primarily due to the continued softness in the fashion watch category as well as lower revenues from our geographic licensing arrangements in Asia due to our recent acquisition of our licensee operations. Gross margin declined 130 basis points to 59.9%. The decline in gross margin is primarily due to a 480 basis point decline in retail gross margins attributable to additional markdowns, partially offset by an increase of 210 basis points in our wholesale gross margin, primarily attributable to favorable product mix and improved sourcing. We also saw a benefit from changes in geographic mix as we saw a 14.8% increase in sales from regions outside of the Americas.
Total operating expense grew 13.9% and increased 490 basis points to 40.9% of total revenue. The increase was primarily due to the inclusion of our businesses in Greater China, South Korea and Latin America; transaction cost associated with the acquisition of our Greater China business; our investment in new stores, e-commerce and omnichannel capabilities; new shop-in-shops and infrastructure improvements. Excluding $11.3 million of onetime cost related to the acquisition of our Greater China license during the quarter, total operating expense for the quarter grew 10.7% and was 39.8% of total revenue.
Income from operations was $186.9 million or 18.9% of total revenue as compared to 25.2% of total revenue in the same period last year. Excluding the aforementioned onetime costs associated with the acquisition of Greater China license, income from operations was $198.2 million or 20.1% of total revenue.
Retail operating margin was 11.8% compared to 23.1% in the prior year period. Our operating margin was impacted by the 480 basis point decrease in gross margin as described earlier. The decline was also due to a 310 basis point increase in operating expenses associated with higher retail store-related cost and depreciation related to new store openings, a 200 basis point negative impact associated with the forementioned transaction cost related to the acquisition of Greater China and a 140 basis point negative impact from inclusion of our business in Greater China, South Korea and Latin America. We expect the inclusion of these international businesses to negatively impact our operating margin for the balance of the year. We anticipate that retail operating margin will benefit from the sequential improvement in the comp sales as well as higher gross margins in the back half of the year.
Wholesale operating margin increased 150 basis points, primarily due to the aforementioned increase in wholesale gross margins partially offset by a 60 basis point increase in operating expense primarily related to higher distribution, selling and depreciation and amortization expense. Licensing operating margin decreased 530 basis points primarily due to increased cost associated with intellectual property protection as well as increased depreciation expenses partially offset by lower advertising costs during the quarter. 
Income taxes were $39.3 million in the quarter, and our effective tax rate was 21.2% as compared to 29.4% in the same period last year. The decrease in our effective tax rate was primarily due to the favorable effect of certain global financing activities that we have undertaken as well as increase in taxable income in certain of our non-U.S. subsidiaries and state tax benefits that we recognized during the quarter.
Net income was $147.1 million for the first quarter, and diluted earnings per share was $0.83. Excluding the aforementioned onetime cost, net income for the quarter was $156.0 million or $0.88 per diluted share.
Turning to our balance sheet. At the end of the quarter, cash and cash equivalents were $337.1 million. Inventory was approximately the same as the prior year, even including the $36.1 million increase in inventory resulting from the recently acquired business in Greater China due to carefully -- careful inventory management and the anticipated decline in the Americas wholesale business. We ended the quarter with $248.6 million of debt, which was recorded within short-term debt on our consolidated balance sheet. The debt consisted of borrowings under the company's revolving credit facilities. The amount of available for future borrowings is approximately $749.4 million.
During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 8.0 million shares, totaling $400.0 million under our share repurchase program, and we have another $600.0 million of availability remaining. This represents a 5% reduction in the share count further demonstrating our commitment to returning value to shareholders.
As a result of the recently acquired business in Greater China, among other assets and liabilities acquired, as detailed in our 10-Q, we added $400.4 million, $99.0 million and $92.3 million of reacquired rights, goodwill and deferred tax liabilities to our balance sheet, respectively. The reacquired rights will be amortized through March 31, 2041, or approximately $16 million per year as a noncash expense and depreciation and amortization. Included in the quarterly results is $1.4 million of noncash amortization of the reacquired rights.
Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $46.9 million, and were related to the build-out of new retail stores and shop-in-shops as well as investments in our distribution facilities, our corporate offices, digital flagships and other infrastructure improvements. We added 103 net new stores in the first quarter. We opened 3 net locations in the Americas and 6 in Europe. We also assumed 94 stores in Greater China. In addition, we expanded or relocated 9 stores and converted 39 wholesale doors into shop-in-shops globally.
Turning to our outlook. For the second quarter, we expect total revenue to be between $1.07 billion and $1.085 billion, and a mid-single-digit decrease in comp sales. We expect an increase in gross margin of approximately 100 to 130 basis points, driven by favorable geographic and channel mix shift. We plan to continue to invest in our international expansion, digital flagships and global infrastructure, and therefore, expect operating expense as a percent of total revenue to increase 790 to 820 basis points resulting in an operating margin of approximately 17%.
We expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.84 to $0.88. This assumes a tax rate of approximately 21% and 171 million shares outstanding. Despite the modest reduction in our comp sales outlook to a mid-single-digit decline, we are maintaining our full year guidance based upon our first quarter results and our outlook for the remainder of the year. As a reminder, for the full fiscal year 2017, we expect total revenue to be flat versus the prior year. Operating margin is expected to be approximately 21.5%, excluding the $11.3 million of onetime transaction costs related to the acquisition of our Greater China licensee. We expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $4.56 to $4.64 for the year, excluding the onetime cost noted earlier. On a GAAP basis, we expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $4.51 to $4.59, inclusive of the $11.3 million of onetime transaction costs incurred in the first quarter. This assumes a tax rate of approximately 21% and 171 million shares outstanding.
Our guidance reflects the expected benefit from the introduction of new fashion luxury products for fall, strong holiday gifting programs, our new Wonderlust fragrance, the launch of our European digital flagships and the debut of the MICHAEL KORS ACCESS wearable technology line, in addition to our continued expansion in Asia and growth in our men's business. We also plan to drive brand engagement with exciting new marketing programs and through our jet-set luxury shopping experience in both our stores and our digital flagships.
Capital expenditures are expected to total approximately $250 million for fiscal 2017 and we'll focus on ongoing investments in global digital strategies and omnichannel capabilities, global retail expansion, including approximately 15 new stores in Americas, 20 in Europe and 40 in Asia, the conversion of approximately 215 wholesale shops -- wholesale shop-in-shops globally and the company's global distribution infrastructure, information systems and corporate facilities.
In conclusion, we have several initiatives in place to drive improved performance in the second half of the year, and are confident that we can achieve our revenue and earnings per share guidance for fiscal 2017. Overall, we continue to believe that we will be poised to deliver both sales and earnings per share growth over the long-term.
I will now turn the call back to John for closing remarks."

Thank you, Kimberly. Yes, I think you're going to see the inflection of global -- really North American wholesale increase as we go through the quarters as we begin to pull back our exposure in that channel and further reduce also our promotional activity, in particular, that's going to start in calendar Q1 of next year. We will be removing ourselves from all store couponing, and that's for all of our retail partners in the United States and in Canada. And also we will be removing ourselves from all of the department store, friends and family sales as well. We think that this is a critical for us to really do 3 things. Number one, to protect our brand image. As you know, that channel has become very promotional. And in fact is causing us difficulties in our own retail channel, which is why you see our gross margins declining, because we're really trying to meet certain pricing that's happening to be competitive. And we don't think that's the right thing to do for our brand going forward. Secondarily, we think it's creating confusion in the consumers' mind relative to the value of the Michael Kors brand when it's been seen so often on sale in so many different places. And third, mathematically, if you look at what's happened to our business, as I've stated in the call, we're shipping double-digits in terms of increases in products, but we're reporting revenue declines, and that's predominantly driven by average order declining, and that's predominantly being driven by lower prices because of promotional activity. So you'll see that accelerate in the back half of the year, and you will also see further wholesale declines next year as well. And we planned all of that. Even with that, we are expecting earnings per share growth for the company this year and next year as well, as well as modest revenue increases for the company next year. So we're going to navigate our way through this. We know we're doing the right thing for the brand long-term. We know the customer continues to resonate with Michael Kors. Our engagement rates with our followers are higher than they've ever been. Our consumer research shows that she's more engaged and has a higher propensity to want to buy the brand than she's ever been. We have to correct something that we think is actually having a negative long-term effect on the brand. And so that's how you'll see that kind of manifest itself through the balance of the year."

And the second issue is, you can see one of the biggest issues that affected us this past quarter and is going to affect us next quarter is the increase in our G&A. And as we said all along, much of that spending will start to get some of that behind us after Q2 for us. The European e-commerce operations will be up and running. We'll begin to bring on parts of Venlo. Remember, we're going to run 2 distribution facilities for a period of time in Europe. And there's some other initiatives that we've got going on inside the company that we think is going to be able to have a positive effect, really from the back half of the year going forward on G&A. So I think that again with forecasting, excluding the onetime charges of 21% -- 21.5% approximately, operating margin, we think, that's still best in -- one of the best-in-class in the entire industry. So we look forward to delivering on that for you and for our shareholders."

143971118,376518511,1032837,"Michael Kors Holdings Limited, Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Aug 10, 2016",2016-08-10,"Earnings Calls","Capri Holdings Limited","Executives","Sure. Thank you, Omar. You're correct that we are all facing issues around traffic, and they're really driven by 2 things. First is mobile. [indiscernible] mobile because as people today are not only purchasing on mobile, but they're shopping on mobile. S",668,"Sure. Thank you, Omar. You're correct that we are all facing issues around traffic, and they're really driven by 2 things. First is mobile. [indiscernible] mobile because as people today are not only purchasing on mobile, but they're shopping on mobile. So we think that, that has to become one of our core competencies and leading platforms that we are going to really communicate and engage with our customers. There's a number of technologies that are coming to market from some of our partners at Facebook and Google that are going to enable us to really, on a geo-targeting basis, be able to change the way that we market to our customers and get it much more ring-fenced in terms of how we can communicate, and then really try to tailor our offerings to that customer. We've just started testing some of this, and the results have been quite extraordinary, with customers who might have actually been lapsed customers with us. Without even any special offers, I might add. It's just really how we communicate to them and how we tailor those different messages. So that's one of the first things that we're looking at is it's not just e-commerce, but it's really mobile and how we're going to market with mobile. Secondly, I would say to you that we've launched something in about 35 of our stores, that's just up and running and it will be fully completed in the next kind of 30 days-or-so. And that's Kors Concierge, where all of our sales associates are equipped with devices that they can, number one, kind of know everything about what's happened with the customer from a transaction history standpoint, but even more importantly be able to create an experience for them that's more lifestyle-driven and be able to create a curated fashion message for the individual customer. And the reason why that's important is, I want to remind you that while we are a company that are predominant businesses in accessories, we're a lifestyle brand. And we do 30% of our business in nonaccessory-type products. And we actually think that one of the ways that we can increase traffic inside the stores is by changing some of our messaging to be a bit more about ready-to-wear, a bit more about footwear, et cetera. And we're seeing accelerated growth because of that in those categories. Now those aren't yet enough to offset what we've lost in -- really, remember, the #1 decline of our comp store sales is watches. It's the #1 area that's really hurting us the most when we look at our comp store decline. So we need to get some of these other categories to deliver at a higher rate than they've been in the past. We see digital marketing as being one of the critical ways to do that. And then really arming our jet-set selling associates with the right tools to engage with the customer both in-store and out of store. So I think that's the last piece that I would just like to say that's going to be important with Kors Concierge. It is going to give the ability for the sales associate, who's standing inside of the store and maybe not seeing a customer walk in during the daytime with the digital -- with the technology to be able to communicate directly with the customer during the day. So we're excited about what that holds for us. And again, hopefully also one of the big headwinds that we've all seen in the industry is tourism, especially when you're a luxury brand like ourselves or some of the other fine companies that are here, as U.S. fashion companies or European fashion companies. We're all suffering from the fact that people aren't traveling to the destinations, especially the major cities, the way that they were in the past. And we hope that as some of these currency headwinds settle down, consumers will get a little bit more comfortable by traveling a bit more."

Number one, Michael Kors still has a significant growth opportunity. We said that Asia could be $1 billion business for us, and we think that men's over the long term can also be $1 billion business for us. So even if our accessories business stays flat or grows very slightly, we think those 2 businesses, in terms of regional and/or product, are going to be really exciting opportunities for us. So our #1 focus in terms of the use of cash and managing the assets of the company to continue to grow our existing business, which we think we will have the capabilities of doing. Secondly, we think that share repurchase is absolutely going to continue to be a priority for us. We believe that our shares are -- can significantly undervalued versus the marketplace. We think that the marketplace has more fear built into our stock price than actual reality of what our performance is. And so we will continue to be highly active. You saw we bought $400 million or 5% of our shares outstanding back in the quarter. I think that's a pretty powerful statement about what our company and our Board of Directors feels about the value of our shares. And then lastly, we are absolutely looking at M&A activity in the marketplace. We've built a powerful platform. When I say platform, I'm talking about the infrastructure of the company from our warehouse distribution to our -- we own our platforms for our digital systems. So we think that we will be able to layer onto that, and we will be very cautious and prudent at what we look at. But we do think we have opportunities to grow this business, especially with our strong cash flows and be able to use that in acquisition. And then lastly, we will potentially, one day, will get at dividends as well. So again, lots of good things happening at Michael Kors and lots of -- we think opportunity for investors as we move forward."

As to first question, we don't break out factory versus full price. But I will tell you that as I think some of our other competitors have reported, factory traffic is down versus its historic levels, although not really that significantly. So it's not an area that we see as volatile as the full price side. And really the full price side, for us, the volatility as we've talked about many times is happening in major markets, whether it's New York, in South Florida, certain parts of Southern California. And you see this all with currency. So whether it's the Brazilian that hurt us down in the South Florida area, whether it's the Mexican peso that hurts us certain parts of Southern California, whether it was the euro because we have close to $1 billion business and so Europeans coming to New York is very important for us, or in Europe where all of a sudden with these horrific atrocities that took place in France now, certain Asian consumers are nervous about traveling to that marketplace. So those are big markets for us, and they're meaningful markets for us. And as we look across our fleet of stores, where we're suffering the greatest is really in the tourist markets. Where we have -- where we're not heavily penetrated by tourists, actually those markets are relatively healthy with the local customers inside there. So that's kind of the state of what we see in that area. In terms of what we're expecting in transfer, Brian, we're really not for the time being. I've done this for a few times in my life. And somehow, when things go away, you don't just see an all of a sudden transfer to another place. What we are expecting is our average order -- or average consumer purchase to increase, and we expect that to increase substantially. Again, we are looking to actually sell less units. So hopefully, when I'm on this call with you at this time next year, we will be happy to be telling you that we're selling less units into the marketplace. And dollars, we will more than make up by increasing average order value, which is where we need to get back to, and we're going to work very hard. You heard me say that we're going to remove ourselves from all coupons, from all friends and family sales, that will happen in -- starting in February. That's a very, very big statement on Michael Kors part to show that we believe in our brand, we believe in the quality and the design that Michael and our teams are putting forward. And we believe that, as the leading American luxury fashion brand, we have an obligation to give our consumers the right vision on our product and not one that's driven by promotion and sale activities."

We -- this industry has evolved over the past few years to accelerated promotional activity. And we know that, that's the absolute wrong thing to do for a business over the long term. And so we have put in fairly significant plans, declines in certain areas of the business. One of them obviously being wholesale. But we also have things that are going to offset that. So we have regional growth, because remember this is in North America or actually United States and Canada conversation that we're having, and we have significant businesses in Europe. We have significant business and growing rapidly in Asia, which we think will continue to offset the declines that we're planning in United States and Canada as it relates to the wholesale piece. And additionally, we have new product categories that we're entering, men's in particular, which we think will also help offset this. So I don't want you to think that we don't understand that there will be decline in certain categories because of less promotional activity. We absolutely understand that, believe that, and quite frankly want that, because we want to ship less units at lower prices that is not the way to ultimately build a luxury business."

We just -- with the pounds moving around every -- very rapidly, we have not seen the tourism return to certain key markets for us yet the way that we hopefully expect that to come back. So we're being cautious through the balance of the year. The overall market is going to continue to grow for us. And again, we see it as a very healthy market for us. But we just want to plan this cautiously. We also, again, don’t want to put too much inventory in the stores and start to create any kind of a situation, where consumers would see the accelerated markdown. Some of the European department stores have begun to do certain things that we think is not healthy for the long-term state of their industry. As you know, the U.K. has started Black Friday. There's different things going on in certain marketplaces that begin to look and smell a little bit about -- like the U.S, not anywhere near as dramatic, but they're struggling as well with low traffic in the stores and difficult performance. So we want to be very careful. Again, remember, as we hopefully continue to shoot for 21.5% operating margin, which we think puts us as one of the best-in-class, we have an aggressive share repurchase program. We are forecasting earnings per share growth in the company. We have ways to get through this that don't have to put us in a position where comp store sales is the single-most important thing that we have to do. We'd rather manage our brand through this what we consider to be difficult time, deliver great results for our shareholders and make sure that our balance sheet stays very, very clean and grow for the future."

We, obviously, were disappointed, and we came in, in the high single digits. It's approximately 7%. And that was really caused by what happened to us in Europe. We were anticipating kind of a decline of the level in North American comps. So we weren't surprised by what happened. And really, we knew that this quarter was going to be a highly promotional quarter for the entire retail segment in North America. And I think we, unfortunately, were right. The amount of promotional activity from many of the people who carry our line was at its all-time high, and we have to compete to be able to move our inventories during that period of time. So when you do that, it just lowers your average order value, and you just -- you can't keep up with, even though our transactions -- our conversion was up double-digit. So again, that's the whole cycle that we're going to get ourselves out of come the spring season, and really rebalance the brand from where it was previously. In terms of the question regarding the increase in sales for next year, that's really a function of -- as I've said before, we're going to grow our men's business. We're going to grow our business in Asia. And our business in Europe is going to continue to grow. So that will offset our planned decline in the North American marketplace even with the reduction of the department stores inventory. We are not planning on reducing doors in the department stores today. Again, even with our reduction with most of our accounts, we're still one of the highest productivity lines on the floor today in terms of sales per square foot. So while we will less product there, and I think ultimately, they will also experience a higher order value, which will hopefully balance out some of the reduction in inventory. We're still a very important line for these stores to carry in not only accessories but in footwear and women's ready-to-wear and watches and in fragrance. So I think it's just balancing it and getting it to a point where it's about -- less about promotion and more about full price selling."

And as you know, we think we've got one of the best products in the marketplace. So we're competing in a different arena. We're competing against some very significant competitors, being Apple and Samsung and et cetera. But we think we -- with our partnership with Google and the fact that we believe that we've got a product that's better looking from a fashion standpoint and the consumer research that we've done, in particular, with female customer, bearing out absolutely she wants something that's exciting looking and not quite as just tech-looking, so more fashion in its nature. So you're going to see it. It will arrive in the next few weeks, September 1 is when the launch begins. And the marketing campaign behind it is absolutely extraordinary. Our team has done, I think, one of the best jobs in the industry in terms of putting together the messaging around it. I don't think it's going to offset the decline that we saw in -- where the watch business before -- was before. This was a higher priced item. Even though, we're very competitively priced at $350 to $395, it's still higher priced than at $225 to $250 current watch. So this is going to take more time for the consumer to get comfortable with it. I think we'll see it accelerate modestly through Q2, and then into Q3 or calendar Q4. I think we'll see some very nice lift from this. And by the way, it's not only in our own stores, it's in our current department store partners. And this is a global launch. So the initiative is massive. We're really excited about the smart jewelry. I might say that we're very competitively priced at $95 to $145. You can assume who the competitors are out there. And we don't think anyone is doing the type of assortments that we've done. There will be major outposts in our partners' locations as well as in our own stores. We see this as a very, very big gifting opportunity during the holiday season. And we think this is going to give us a pretty significant lift in our own stores as well as our partners. So good things to come on that front, and we're pleased with technology partnership and execution that has been developed. As it relates to the crossbody and SLG, we've lapsed it. We started lapsing it already. And you heard me say on the call earlier, we still are seeing double-digit increases in this. I would tell you that there's 2 things I think going on. Number one, I think we are absolutely on trend as it relates to this category. It's clearly still what's driving the accessories business is just from a fashion standpoint. Smaller bags and heavily driven by crossbodies. And secondly, I think we have a deeper base of a younger customer than at some of our other competitors, that's driven by some of the marketing initiatives we have. It's driven just by history of our fashion leadership. So that has a better category that we think is going to continue right through the holiday season. You're going to see this new collection that we're offering that will go up on our website and exclusive in our stores, called Sloan Select of our Sloan -- current Sloan handbag, which is one of our best-selling bag. And this will be an opportunity where people will be able to customize their own bag with multiple different options. We also have the new Scout camera bag, which is a -- it goes along with our in-stacks exclusive that we'll have in our stores for the holiday season. Again, this is something that no one else is really doing in the fashion business. So there's all these initiatives, but they're driven around some of the smaller bags. That being said, very, very pleased. Some of the new products just hit last week in our stores, 8 of the 18 new groups that I talked to you about. I'm pleased, go take a look at Brooklyn. We got a winner. We've got one that's -- that's the new bag with grommets. It's really starting to kick-in strong. We've had the highest sell-throughs of the new group that we've seen in over 2 years in a weeks' time. So I brought you all up here to show you the showrooms. You may remember that was one of our key groups. Our influencer campaign launches on it. We're really feeling good about what's happening there. Lastly, in terms of the inventories. We've already started to wind down the inventories in the wholesale channel. Additionally, as you saw the promotional activities, the retailers are getting their inventories in line. We do not expect there to be any inventory issues in our own channels with the retailers for the fall seasons. That doesn't mean they're not going to be promotional. I can't tell you what they're going to do and not do given the traffic situation. But in terms of inventory, there'll be a significant amount of less inventory in the retail channel of Michael Kors product. And we think that's a good thing and we'll hopefully improve the health and image of our brand with the consumer as it relates to price.
I'd like to thank everybody for joining us today, and we look forward to talking to you for our next earnings call. Thank you very much. Have a great day."

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Michael Kors First Quarter 2017 Earnings Call.We are pleased to report that we once again exceeded our revenue and earnings per share expectations in the quarter. We drove strong double-digit growth",2285,"Thank you, Joe. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Michael Kors First Quarter 2017 Earnings Call.
We are pleased to report that we once again exceeded our revenue and earnings per share expectations in the quarter. We drove strong double-digit growth in our North American digital flagships, further expanded our presence in Asia, continued to develop our men's business globally and expanded our luxury fashion product assortments. However, this progress was muted by the ongoing decline in mall traffic trends as well as the decrease in tourism, which negatively impacted our comparable store sales performance during the quarter.
We remained intently focused on executing our multiple long-term growth strategies. Michael and our design teams are delivering exceptional fashion innovation for the fall season, particularly in our accessories and footwear categories. We are also excited about the debut of the MICHAEL KORS ACCESS wearable technology line of watches and fitness trackers, which we believe represents a meaningful growth opportunity as we position ourselves to capitalize on this rapidly growing category.
We continue to have many opportunities to build the Michael Kors brand and to generate excitement around our enhanced luxury product offerings. Our team has created a series of innovative, branded marketing initiatives designed to deepen consumer engagement. For example, on National Sunglass Day, we debuted our first-ever dedicated branded Snapchat lens. Snapchat users were able to virtually try on a pair of our best-selling Kendall sunglasses, while seeing the reflection of different jet-set locations on the actual lenses. This lens enabled us to capture the attention of our younger audience on Snapchat and garnered over 100 million views, including from a number of celebrity fans sharing snaps with their followers.
On Instagram, we recently launched #InstaKors. This innovative new commerce program seamlessly takes fans from a curated Michael Kors social engagement to a Michael Kors shopping experience. By clicking a link on our profile, followers are able to easily shop for their favorite items from our Instagram feed. #InstaKors makes it much easier for our customers to shop the styles they love in a way that is fun and interactive.
In late May, we launched our official Michael Kors site on the Line platform in Japan, which is the most used social communication platform in this market. To celebrate this launch, we teamed up with well-known illustrator, Yurie Sekiya, to create an exclusive character, DJ Michelle the Cat, and Line sticker pack featuring her in iconic Michael Kors products, which were available for free to all Line users for a limited time.
We also held events in several stores in the region to celebrate in person with our fans. I'm pleased to say that we added 1 million followers on the platform within the first 2 days.
These and other efforts have continued to expand our engaged social media followers. We believe that the hard work behind these numerous initiatives in our product and marketing positions us for long-term success. Our focus will remain centered on maintaining our leadership position in the global luxury market, while executing on multiple pillars for revenue growth.
Now let's take a closer look at our first quarter results. Total revenue increased 0.2% reflecting increased sales from the acquisition of our China license, strong growth in Japan and an increase in our Europe region, offset by a mid-single digit decline in our Americas region. Earnings per share were $0.83 on a reported basis. Excluding $11.3 million or $0.05 per share of onetime costs related to the acquisition of our Greater China license, earnings per share were $0.88, reflecting a 1.5% increase over the comparable period last year.
In our retail segment, comparable store sales decreased 7.4% due to a high single-digit comp decrease in North America and a low double-digit decline in Europe. This was partially offset by a high single-digit comp increase in Asia. Our North American digital flagships saw ongoing momentum during the quarter. Our digital flagship business posted strong double-digit comp growth and increased traffic as our innovative online marketing features continue to draw attention to the site, while our compelling product offerings entice our customers to shop. We believe that the digital channel represents a meaningful growth opportunity for our brand as consumers continue to transition to online shopping. We will continue to invest in our digital flagship strategy to ensure we are well positioned to further engage customers and capitalize on this shift in buying behavior.
In the Americas, retail stores conversions increased at a double-digit rate once again. However, this was more than offset by the decrease in traffic. Our crossbodies and small leather goods styles delivered mid-teens growth during the quarter. In addition, we continued to capitalize on athletic footwear trends with a compelling fashion offering, which led to strong sales growth in the quarter. The growth in these categories was more than offset by a low single-digit decline in our handbag sales and a double-digit decrease in our watch sales. We believe that the decline in watches sales was consistent with the declines that are being seen in the overall fashion watch market.
In our Europe region, we saw a high single-digit increase in conversion rates, which was offset by reduced traffic in certain major markets. The regions most challenged by negative traffic were the Benelux region, France and the U.K., which we attribute to the uncertainty among consumers around Brexit and the decline in tourism resulting from terrorist attacks in France.
Similar to the trends in our Americas regions, crossbodies, small leather goods and athletic footwear were top performers in our European stores, offset by lower handbag and watch sales. As mentioned on our previous call, we recently opened our largest flagship store on Regent Street in London. This store will serve to heighten Michael Kors' position as a leading global luxury brand across the Pan-European market. In addition, we launched a partnership with McLaren-Honda in Europe, becoming the official lifestyle partner of the world championship Formula 1 team. Michael was on hand to launch the flagship store and announce our partnership with McLaren-Honda, which also provided a great opportunity for him to connect with our consumers and fans. In fact, following his visit, we had 76 million impressions on social media channels, illustrating the power of our brand in the European market.
We plan to further expand our presence in Europe with the launch of digital flagships in 6 European countries beginning in the fall and in 16 countries in spring 2017. These digital flagships will enable us to interact more directly with the European consumers on a continuous basis, broadening our reach and depending our engagement as well as allowing customers to shop Michael Kors however and whenever they choose. Overall, we believe that Michael Kors remains a very strong brand in Europe with significant retail growth opportunity.
Turning to Asia. Sales in the region increased 74% resulting from the addition of the China business as well as a high single-digit comparable store sales increase in Japan. We were very pleased to see double-digit sales growth in both the China and South Korea regions. Looking ahead, we are excited about the upcoming opening of our flagship stores in Seoul and Singapore this fall. These locations will further establish Michael Kors as a global luxury brand in this region. Overall, we remain confident that Asia represents a significant long-term growth opportunity for the company.
In our wholesale segment, sales declined 7%. As anticipated, sales in the Americas region declined in the high single digits. As we have mentioned previously, we will prudently manage our business in this channel through disciplined inventory control and reduced promotional activity in order to protect our brand and margins. In Europe, we saw a low single-digit sales decline primarily due to a mix shift towards crossbodies and small leather goods, which carry a lower AUR. In Asia, the low single-digit decline in sales was attributable to the shift of our China and South Korea business to our company-owned retail segment.
Now turning to our product categories. While revenue in our accessories business declined, this was due to lower AURs resulting from the higher sales in crossbodies and small leather goods and increased promotional activity. Once again, overall accessories unit sales were up in the double digits reflecting strong consumer demand for our luxury product. We were particularly pleased with the strong response to new styles, including Savannah and Portia from our spring collection. Our footwear business performed well in the quarter, particularly our athletic styles. The new lightweight Amanda Trainer and Billie Trainer resonated well with customers as they are updates to our iconic styles, such as the Keaton. We also saw strong response to newness in our sandal category driven by the Becky, Mirabel, Sonya Flat and Westley Mule styles.
Finally, our men's category continues to deliver solid performance in the first quarter. We ended the quarter with 15 men's freestanding or side-by-side retail locations, and with approximately 200 sportswear and leather goods shop-in-shops with our wholesale partners. We are very excited as we continue to expand the breadth of Michael Kors men's customers that now visit our digital flagships and a location near them to shop our exciting product firsthand. During the quarter, our men's accessories business continued to exceed our internal plans both within our omnichannel retail and wholesale businesses. The success was largely driven by small leather goods, backpacks and messengers. As we look ahead, within the next 6 months, you will see an expanded presence of our men's accessories business within both our own stores and our global wholesale partners.
Finally, we're excited to leverage our partnership with McLaren-Honda to create events with world-famous drivers, Fernando Alonso and Jenson Button, in select stores in Europe, connecting the jet-set image of Formula 1 with the Michael Kors man. This is one example of how our broadening strategy to expand our men's lifestyle presence in Europe.
Turning to our licensing segment. Sales declined during the quarter due to continued weakness in the watch category, as the watch industry remains challenged overall in both the fashion and luxury segment. That said, we are excited to be entering the growing smartwatch category with the September launch of our MICHAEL KORS ACCESS collection. We are pleased to be teaming up with Google and utilizing their Android Wear operating system to run this truly unique accessory. The smartwatch will be available in 2 styles, each with thousands of different display options. The touchscreen device allows you to see your social media updates, text, emails and call alerts, use voice controls to access services via Ok Google, track your fitness and much more. Our smartwatches will be priced between $350 and $395.
In addition, we will be debuting a line of smart jewelry priced from $95 to $145, offering her a fitness tracker and a sleep monitor as both fashionable and functional.
To support the line of our -- of ACCESS, we will execute a comprehensive marketing campaign for the fall and holiday seasons across print and social media with editorial coverage across key fashion and technology publications and featured placement on our social media channels.
In addition, we will be debuting an advertising campaign at Spot Flights [ph], the ACCESS line, and the product will also be featured as one of the must-have gifts for our holiday gift guide.
Finally, we will be launching a new section on our website, where customers can learn more about both the watches and the trackers and explore the styles and functions that the products offer.
Our partnership with Google, in addition to our chic and cutting-edge product line and innovative marketing campaign, will position us to be the fashion leader in this high-growth category.
During the first quarter, growth in our license fragrance business was driven by our gifting programs for Mother's Day and Father's Day as well as strengthening branding in international markets. As we mentioned last quarter, we are looking forward to the launch of Wonderlust this fall, which we believe will be a new pillar in our fragrance collection and will drive further growth in this category.
We were also pleased with the great response to our new eyewear offering both domestically and internationally during the quarter. Our retail performance in eyewear accelerated nicely during the quarter, which is a reflection of our enhanced design and strong partnership with Luxottica. In particular, our aviators and our popular Kendall and Abela styles were big hits during the quarter.
In conclusion, the Michael Kors brand remains strong, and we have multiple long-term growth opportunities across our product categories and regions. We remain intently focused on delivering fashion luxury product to our customers. In the fall season, we will be introducing 18 new handbag groups globally. These new collections will feature seasonal colors, such as plum, moss green and brick red, with novelty design elements, including hardware, grommet and paisley print patterns.
In footwear, novelty details and new materials will play a big role in our fall offerings, with pearls, jewel embellishments, velvet and flannel all featured prominently in the collection. In addition, we will be expanding our rain boot offering with updates such as tweed and quilting. To capitalize on our strong fashion seeker trend, we will be introducing 2 new styles, the Scout Trainer and the Poppy Sneaker. We also look forward to the launch our digital flagships worldwide and the upcoming debut of both our MICHAEL KORS ACCESS line of wearable technology and our Wonderlust fragrance. In addition, we will continue to develop our men's business, which has a long term potential to expand our business globally and to expand our business across Asia.
With that, I'll turn it over to Joe for our financial reviews."

We are pleased to report that revenue and earnings per share results came in above our guidance. Total revenue grew 0.2% to $987.9 million. In our retail segment, net sales increased 7.6%, driven primarily by the opening of 221 net new stores since the first quarter of last year, including 145 stores associated with our recent acquisitions of Greater China and South Korea and the consolidation of our Latin American operations.
Comp sales decreased 7.4% reflecting a high single-digit comp decrease in North America and a low double-digit decline in Europe, partially offset by a high single-digit comp increase in Asia and strong performance of our digital flagships. Our North American digital flagships' sales contributed 210 basis points to our North American comp performance in the quarter.
In our wholesale segment, net sales declined 7.0% due to lower sales in our accessories and womenswear line, partially offset by increases in our men's and footwear businesses. As expected, we saw a high single-digit decline in our wholesale business in the Americas region as we remain disciplined with the amount of inventory we flow into that channel. We also saw a low single-digit decline in Europe as well as a low single-digit decline in Asia, which primarily reflects the shift of our Greater China and South Korea businesses to the retail segment during the quarter.
In our licensing segment, revenue decreased 20.9%. This was primarily due to the continued softness in the fashion watch category as well as lower revenues from our geographic licensing arrangements in Asia due to our recent acquisition of our licensee operations. Gross margin declined 130 basis points to 59.9%. The decline in gross margin is primarily due to a 480 basis point decline in retail gross margins attributable to additional markdowns, partially offset by an increase of 210 basis points in our wholesale gross margin, primarily attributable to favorable product mix and improved sourcing. We also saw a benefit from changes in geographic mix as we saw a 14.8% increase in sales from regions outside of the Americas.
Total operating expense grew 13.9% and increased 490 basis points to 40.9% of total revenue. The increase was primarily due to the inclusion of our businesses in Greater China, South Korea and Latin America; transaction costs associated with the acquisition of our Greater China business; our investment in new stores, e-commerce and omnichannel capabilities; new shop-in-shops and infrastructure improvements. Excluding $11.3 million of onetime costs related to the acquisition of our Greater China license during the quarter, total operating expense for the quarter grew 10.7% and were 39.8% of total revenue.
Income from operations was $186.9 million or 18.9% of total revenue as compared to 25.2% of total revenue in the same period last year. Excluding the aforementioned onetime costs associated with the acquisition of Greater China license, income from operations was $198.2 million or 20.1% of total revenue.
Retail operating margin was 11.8% compared to 23.1% in the prior year period. Our operating margin was impacted by the 480 basis point decrease in gross margin as described earlier. The decline was also due to a 310 basis point increase in operating expenses associated with higher retail store-related costs and depreciation related to new store openings, a 200 basis point negative impact associated with the aforementioned transaction costs related to the acquisition of Greater China and a 140 basis point negative impact from inclusion of our business in Greater China, South Korea and Latin America. We expect the inclusion of these international businesses to negatively impact our operating margin for the balance of the year. We anticipate that retail operating margin will benefit from the sequential improvement in the comp sales as well as higher gross margins in the back half of the year.
Wholesale operating margin increased 150 basis points, primarily due to the aforementioned increase in wholesale gross margins partially offset by a 60 basis point increase in operating expense primarily related to higher distribution, selling and depreciation and amortization expense. Licensing operating margin decreased 530 basis points primarily due to increased costs associated with intellectual property protection as well as increased depreciation expenses partially offset by lower advertising costs during the quarter. 
Income taxes were $39.3 million in the quarter, and our effective tax rate was 21.2% as compared to 29.4% in the same period last year. The decrease in our effective tax rate was primarily due to the favorable effect of certain global financing activities that we have undertaken as well as increase in taxable income in certain of our non-U.S. subsidiaries and state tax benefits that we recognized during the quarter.
Net income was $147.1 million for the first quarter, and diluted earnings per share was $0.83. Excluding the aforementioned onetime costs, net income for the quarter was $156.0 million or $0.88 per diluted share.
Turning to our balance sheet. At the end of the quarter, cash and cash equivalents were $337.1 million. Inventory was approximately the same as the prior year, even including the $36.1 million increase in inventory resulting from the recently acquired business in Greater China due to carefully -- careful inventory management and the anticipated decline in the Americas wholesale business. 
We ended the quarter with $248.6 million of debt, which was recorded within short-term debt on our consolidated balance sheet. The debt consisted of borrowings under the company's revolving credit facilities. The amount of available for future borrowings is approximately $749.4 million.
During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 8.0 million shares, totaling $400.0 million under our share repurchase program, and we have another $600.0 million of availability remaining. This represents a 5% reduction in the share count further demonstrating our commitment to returning value to shareholders.
As a result of the recently acquired business in Greater China, among other assets and liabilities acquired, as detailed in our 10-Q, we added $400.4 million, $99.0 million and $92.3 million of reacquired rights, goodwill and deferred tax liabilities to our balance sheet, respectively. The reacquired rights will be amortized through March 31, 2041, or approximately $16 million per year as a noncash expense and depreciation and amortization. Included in the quarterly results is $1.4 million of noncash amortization of the reacquired rights.
Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $46.9 million, and were related to the build-out of new retail stores and shop-in-shops as well as investments in our distribution facilities, our corporate offices, digital flagships and other infrastructure improvements. We added 103 net new stores in the first quarter. We opened 3 net locations in the Americas and 6 in Europe. We also assumed 94 stores in Greater China. In addition, we expanded or relocated 9 stores and converted 39 wholesale doors into shop-in-shops globally.
Turning to our outlook. For the second quarter, we expect total revenue to be between $1.07 billion and $1.085 billion, and a mid-single-digit decrease in comp sales. We expect an increase in gross margin of approximately 100 to 130 basis points, driven by favorable geographic and channel mix shift. We plan to continue to invest in our international expansion, digital flagships and global infrastructure, and therefore, expect operating expense as a percent of total revenue to increase 790 to 820 basis points resulting in an operating margin of approximately 17%.
We expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.84 to $0.88. This assumes a tax rate of approximately 21% and 171 million shares outstanding. Despite the modest reduction in our comp sales outlook to a mid-single-digit decline, we are maintaining our full year guidance based upon our first quarter results and our outlook for the remainder of the year. As a reminder, for the full fiscal year 2017, we expect total revenue to be flat versus the prior year. Operating margin is expected to be approximately 21.5%, excluding the $11.3 million of onetime transaction costs related to the acquisition of our Greater China licensee. We expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $4.56 to $4.64 for the year, excluding the onetime cost noted earlier. On a GAAP basis, we expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $4.51 to $4.59, inclusive of the $11.3 million of onetime transaction costs incurred in the first quarter. This assumes a tax rate of approximately 21% and 171 million shares outstanding.
Our guidance reflects the expected benefit from the introduction of new fashion luxury products for fall, strong holiday gifting programs, our new Wonderlust fragrance, the launch of our European digital flagships and the debut of the MICHAEL KORS ACCESS wearable technology line, in addition to our continued expansion in Asia and growth in our men's business. We also plan to drive brand engagement with exciting new marketing programs and through our jet-set luxury shopping experience in both our stores and our digital flagships.
Capital expenditures are expected to total approximately $250 million for fiscal 2017 and we'll focus on ongoing investments in global digital strategies and omnichannel capabilities, global retail expansion, including approximately 15 new stores in Americas, 20 in Europe and 40 in Asia, the conversion of approximately 215 wholesale shops -- wholesale shop-in-shops globally and the company's global distribution infrastructure, information systems and corporate facilities.
In conclusion, we have several initiatives in place to drive improved performance in the second half of the year, and are confident that we can achieve our revenue and earnings per share guidance for fiscal 2017. Overall, we continue to believe that we will be poised to deliver both sales and earnings per share growth over the long-term.

I think on the last earnings call, you suggested a high-teens decline in global wholesale. We're only seeing about a 7% decline in the quarter. Perhaps there's some seasonality there. I'm wondering if you can talk to us about your updated expectations for wholesale this year. And if we'll get to that negative high-teens run rate perhaps in fiscal Q2? And then secondarily, Joe, I'm not sure I understood the comments about retail EBIT margin inflecting in the back half. Could you just go through that one more time for us?"

Yes, I think you're going to see the inflection of global -- really North American wholesale, increase as we go through the quarters as we begin to pull back our exposure in that channel and further reduce also our promotional a",424,"Sure. Thank you, Kimberly. Yes, I think you're going to see the inflection of global -- really North American wholesale, increase as we go through the quarters as we begin to pull back our exposure in that channel and further reduce also our promotional activity, in particular, that's going to start in calendar Q1 of next year. We will be removing ourselves from all store couponing, and that's for all of our retail partners in the United States and in Canada. And also we will be removing ourselves from all of the department store friends and family sales as well. We think that this is a critical for us to really do 3 things. Number one, to protect our brand image. As you know, that channel has become very promotional. And, in fact, is causing us difficulties in our own retail channel, which is why you see our gross margins declining, because we're really trying to meet certain pricing that's happening to be competitive. And we don't think that's the right thing to do for our brand going forward. Secondarily, we think it's creating confusion in the consumer's mind relative to the value of the Michael Kors brand when it's being seen so often on sale in so many different places. And third, mathematically, if you look at what's happened to our business, as I've stated in the call, we're shipping double-digits in terms of increases in product, but we're reporting revenue declines, and that's predominantly driven by average order declining, and that's predominantly being driven by lower prices because of promotional activity. So you'll see that accelerate in the back half of the year, and you will also see further wholesale declines next year as well. And we planned all of that. Even with that, we are expecting earnings per share growth for the company this year and next year as well, as well as modest revenue increases for the company next year. So we're going to navigate our way through this. We know we're doing the right thing for the brand long-term. We know the customer continues to resonate with Michael Kors. Our engagement rates with our followers are higher than they've ever been. Our consumer research shows that she's more engaged and has a higher propensity to want to buy the brand than she's ever been. We have to correct something that we think is actually having a negative long-term effect on the brand. And so that's how you'll see that kind of manifest itself through the balance of the year."

Number one, as Joe said, we're going to have an increase in gross margin in the back half of the year. Part of that is a mix shift. And part of it's also, we are going up against when all this kind of promoting, et cetera start to happen. So we've done some things that we think will improve our retail margins, in particular, in North America in the back half of the year, and we're already starting to see a little bit of that come through last month and a little bit beginning in this month. So we're pleased with the direction that we're heading. And the second issue is, you can see one of the biggest issues that affected us this past quarter and is going to affect us next quarter is the increase in our G&A. And as we've said all along, much of that spending -- we'll start to get some of that behind us after Q2 for us. The European e-commerce operations will be up and running. We'll begin to bring on parts of Venlo. Remember, we're going to run 2 distribution facilities for a period of time in Europe. And there's some other initiatives that we've got going on inside the company that we think is going to be able to have a positive effect, really from the back half of the year going forward on G&A. So I think that, again, we're forecasting, excluding the onetime charges of 21% -- 21.5% approximately, operating margin, we think, that's still best in -- one of the best-in-class in the entire industry. So we look forward to delivering on that for you and for our shareholders."

You're correct that we are all facing issues around traffic, and they're really driven by 2 things. First is mobile. I would use the word mobile because as people today are not only purchasing on mobile, but they're shopping on mobi",670,"Sure. Thank you, Omar. You're correct that we are all facing issues around traffic, and they're really driven by 2 things. First is mobile. I would use the word mobile because as people today are not only purchasing on mobile, but they're shopping on mobile. So we think that, that has to become one of our core competencies and leading platforms that we are going to really communicate and engage with our customers. There's a number of technologies that are coming to market from some of our partners at Facebook and Google that are going to enable us to really, on a geo-targeting basis, be able to change the way that we market to our customers and get it much more ring-fenced in terms of how we can communicate, and then really try to tailor our offerings to that customer. We've just started testing some of this, and the results have been quite extraordinary, with customers who might have actually been lapsed customers with us. Without even any special offers, I might add. It's just really how we communicate to them and how we tailor those different messages. So that's one of the first things that we're looking at is, it's not just e-commerce, but it's really mobile and how we're going to market with mobile. Secondly, I would say to you that we've launched something in about 35 of our stores, that's just up and running and it will be fully completed in the next kind of 30 days-or-so. And that's Kors Concierge, where all of our sales associates are equipped with devices that they can, number one, kind of know everything about what's happened with the customer from a transaction history standpoint, but even more importantly be able to create an experience for them that's more lifestyle-driven and be able to create a curated fashion message for the individual customer. And the reason why that's important is, I want to remind you that while we are a company that our predominant businesses in accessories, we're a lifestyle brand. And we do 30% of our business in nonaccessory-type products. And we actually think that one of the ways that we can increase traffic inside the stores is by changing some of our messaging to be a bit more about ready-to-wear, a bit more about footwear, et cetera. And we're seeing accelerated growth because of that in those categories. Now those aren't yet enough to offset what we've lost in -- really, remember, the #1 decline of our comp store sales is watches. It's the #1 area that's really hurting us the most when we look at our comp store declines. So we need to get some of these other categories to deliver at a higher rate than they've been in the past. We see digital marketing as being one of the critical ways to do that. And then really arming our jet-set selling associates with the right tools to engage with the customer both in-store and out-of-store. So I think that's the last piece that I would just like to say that's going to be important with Kors Concierge. It is going to give the ability for the sales associate, who's standing inside of the store and maybe not seeing a customer walk in during the daytime with the digital -- with the technology to be able to communicate directly with the customer during the day. So we're excited about what that holds for us. And again, hopefully also one of the big headwinds that we've all seen in the industry is tourism, especially when you're a luxury brand like ourselves or some of the other fine companies that are here, as U.S. fashion companies or European fashion companies. We're all suffering from the fact that people aren't traveling to the destinations, especially the major cities, the way that they were in the past. And we hope that as some of these currency headwinds settle down, consumers will get a little bit more comfortable by traveling a bit more."

Number one, Michael Kors still has a significant growth opportunity. We've said that Asia could be $1 billion business for us, and we think that men's over the long term can also be $1 billion business for us. So even if our accessories business stays flat or grows very slightly, we think those 2 businesses, in terms of regional and/or product, are going to be really exciting opportunities for us. So our #1 focus in terms of use of cash and management of the assets of the company is to continue to grow our existing business, which we think we will have the capabilities of doing. Secondly, we think that share repurchase is absolutely going to continue to be a priority for us. We believe that our shares are -- can significantly undervalued versus the marketplace. We think that the marketplace has more fear built into our stock price than actual reality of what our performance is. And so we will continue to be highly active. You saw we bought $400 million or 5% of our shares outstanding back in the quarter. I think that's a pretty powerful statement about what our company and our Board of Directors feels about the value of our shares. And then lastly, we are absolutely looking at M&A activity in the marketplace. We've built a powerful platform. When I say platform, I'm talking about the infrastructure of the company from our warehouse distribution to our -- we own our platforms for our digital systems. So we think that we will be able to layer onto that, and we will be very cautious and prudent at what we look at. But we do think we have opportunities to grow this business, especially with our strong cash flows and be able to use that in acquisition. And then lastly, we will potentially, one day, we'll get at dividends as well. So again, lots of good things happening at Michael Kors and lots of -- we think opportunity for investors as we move forward."

As to first question, we don't break out factory versus full price. But I will tell you that as I think some of our other competitors have reported, factory traffic is down versus its historic levels, although not really that significantly. So it's not an area that we see as volatile as the full price side. And really the full price side, for us, the volatility as we've talked about many times is happening in major markets, whether it's New York, South Florida, certain parts of Southern California. And you see this all with currency. So whether it's the Brazilians that hurt us down in South Florida area, whether it's the Mexican peso that hurts us certain parts of Southern California, whether it was the euro because, as you know, we have close to $1 billion business and so Europeans coming to New York were very important for us, or in Europe where all of a sudden with these horrific atrocities that took place in France now, certain Asian consumers are nervous about traveling to that marketplace. So those are big markets for us, and they're meaningful markets for us. And as we look across our fleet of stores, where we're suffering the greatest is really in the tourist markets. Where we have -- where we're not heavily penetrated by tourists, actually those markets are relatively healthy with the local customers inside there. So that's kind of the state of what we see in that area. In terms of what we're expecting in transfer, Brian, we're really not for the time being. I've done this for a few times in my life. And somehow, when things go away, you don't just see an all of a sudden transfer to another place. What we are expecting is our average order -- or average consumer purchase to increase, and we expect that to increase substantially. Again, we are looking to actually sell less units. So hopefully, when I'm on this call with you at this time next year, we will be happy to be telling you that we're selling less units into the marketplace. And dollars, we will more than make up by increasing average order value, which is where we need to get back to, and we're going to work very hard. You heard me say that we're going to remove ourselves from all coupons, from all friends and family sales, that will happen in -- starting in February. That's a very, very big statement on Michael Kors part to show that we believe in our brand, we believe in the quality and the design that Michael and our teams are putting forward. And we believe that, as the leading American luxury fashion brand, we have an obligation to give our consumers the right vision on our product and not one that's driven by promotion and sale activities."

We -- this industry has evolved over the past few years to accelerated promotional activity. And we know that, that's the absolute wrong thing to do for a business over the long term. And so we have put in fairly significant plans, declines in certain areas of the business. One of them obviously being wholesale. But we also have things that are going to offset that. So we have regional growth, because remember this is a North America or actually United States and Canada conversation that we're having, and we have significant businesses in Europe. We have significant business and growing rapidly in Asia, which we think will continue to offset the declines that we're planning in United States and Canada as it relates to the wholesale piece. And additionally, we have new product categories that we're entering, men's in particular, which we think will also help offset this. So I don't want you to think that we don't understand that there will be a decline in certain categories because of less promotional activity. We absolutely understand that, believe that, and quite frankly want that, because we want to ship less units at lower prices -- that is not the way to ultimately build a luxury business."

So we're being cautious through the balance of the year. The overall market is going to continue to grow for us. And again, we see it as a very healthy market for us. But we just want to plan this cautiously. We also, again, don’t want to put too much inventory in the stores and start to create any kind of a situation, where consumers would see accelerated markdowns. Some of the European department stores have begun to do certain things that we think is not healthy for the long-term state of their industry. As you know, the U.K. has started Black Friday. There's different things going on in certain marketplaces that begin to look and smell a little bit about -- like the U.S, not anywhere near as dramatic, but they're struggling as well with low traffic in the stores and difficult performance. So we want to be very careful. Again, remember, as we hopefully continue to shoot for 21.5% operating margin, which we think puts us as one of the best-in-class, we have an aggressive share repurchase program. We are forecasting earnings per share growth in the company. We have ways to get through this that don't have to put us in a position where comp store sales is the single-most important thing that we have to do.

First of all, John, as you think about the North American comp, which you said was down high singles versus last quarter I think was down about 1%. Could you talk about what actually was the incremental negative driver quarter-to-quarter? And my second question is I think you mentioned that even though you're expecting wholesale to be down a lot or to be down again next year in terms of revenue as you pull shipments out of the channel. Could you tell us, is there a certain number of wholesale doors that you plan to exit? Or is this just sort of tightening up inventories? And also you mentioned that you thought sales would be up for the total company even though wholesale would be under pressure. I was just curious where you were looking for growth?"

Lindsay, as you may recall, we had guided to a mid-single decline in comp for the quarter. We, obviously, were disappointed, and we came in, in the high single digits. It's approximately 7%. And that was really caused by what happened to us in Europ",386,"Sure. Lindsay, as you may recall, we had guided to a mid-single decline in comp for the quarter. We, obviously, were disappointed, and we came in, in the high single digits. It's approximately 7%. And that was really caused by what happened to us in Europe. We were anticipating kind of a decline of the level in North American comps. So we weren't surprised by what happened. And really, we knew that this quarter was going to be a highly promotional quarter for the entire retail segment in North America. And I think we, unfortunately, were right. The amount of promotional activity from many of the people who carry our line was at its all-time high, and we had to compete to be able to move our inventories during that period of time. So when you do that, it just lowers your average order value, and you just -- you can't keep up with, even though our transactions -- our conversion was up double-digit. So again, that's the whole cycle that we're going to get ourselves out of come the spring season, and really rebalance the brand from where it was previously. In terms of the question regarding the increase in sales for next year, that's really a function of -- as I've said before, we're going to grow our men's business. We're going to grow our business in Asia. And our business in Europe is going to continue to grow. So that will offset our planned decline in the North American marketplace even with the reduction of the department stores' inventory. We are not planning on reducing doors in the department stores today. Again, even with our reduction with most of our accounts, we're still one of the highest productivity lines on their floor today in terms of sales per square foot. So while we will have less product there, and I think ultimately, they will also experience a higher order value, which will hopefully balance out some of the reduction in inventory. We're still a very important line for these stores to carry in not only accessories but in footwear and women's ready-to-wear and watches and in fragrance. So I think it's just balancing it and getting it to a point where it's about -- less about promotion and more about full price selling."

Also can you just brief us on the crossbody SLG and when you anniversary that? And what's happening with that with respect to the comp store sales we should monitor? And just a final question. You've been really great at managing your inventory. But as you said, promotions are at an all-time high when you look across retail, should we be concerned that this will impact holiday for everybody as consumers see some really higher percentages off at competitors and you can't really control that? So I'm just wanting to hear your thoughts on what our guidance assumes for that and your thoughts on the industry at large as we look forward to that?"

So we're competing in a different arena. We're competing against some very significant c",930,"Sure. Number one, the watch part of our ACCESS launch, we're extremely excited about. And as you know, we think we've got one of the best products in the marketplace. So we're competing in a different arena. We're competing against some very significant competitors, being Apple and Samsung and et cetera. But we think we've -- with our partnership with Google and the fact that we believe that we've got a product that's better looking from a fashion standpoint and the consumer research that we've done, in particular, with the female customer, is bearing out absolutely she wants something that's exciting-looking and not quite as just tech-looking, so more fashion in its nature. So you're going to see it. It will arrive in the next few weeks, September 1 is when the launch begins. And the marketing campaign behind it is absolutely extraordinary. Our team has done, I think, one of the best jobs in the industry in terms of putting together the messaging around it. I don't think it's going to offset the decline that we saw in -- where the watch business before -- was before. This was a higher priced item. Even though, we're very competitively priced at $350 to $395, it's still higher priced than at $225 to $250 current watch. So this is going to take more time for the consumer to get comfortable with it. I think we'll see it accelerate modestly through Q2, and then into Q3 or calendar Q4. I think we'll see some very nice lift from this. And by the way, it's not only in our own stores, it's in our current department store partners. And this is a global launch. So the initiative is massive. We're really excited about the smart jewelry. I might say that we're very competitively priced at $95 to $145. You can assume who the competitors are out there. And we don't think anyone is doing the type of assortment that we've done. There will be major outposts in our partners' locations as well as in our own stores. We see this as a very, very big gifting opportunity during the holiday season. And we think this is going to give us a pretty significant lift in our own stores as well as our partners. So good things to come on that front, and we're pleased with technology partnership and execution and how that's being developed. As it relates to the crossbody and SLG, we've lapsed it. We started lapsing it already. And you heard me say on the call earlier, we still are seeing double-digit increases in this. I would tell you that there's 2 things I think going on. Number one, I think we are absolutely on trend as it relates to this category. It's clearly still what's driving the accessories business is -- it's just from a fashion standpoint. Smaller bags and heavily driven by crossbodies. And secondly, I think we have a deeper base of a younger customer than at some of our other competitors, that's driven by some of the marketing initiatives we have. It's driven just by our history of our fashion leadership. So that has a better category that we think is going to continue right through the holiday season. You're going to see this new collection that we're offering that will go up on our website and exclusive in our stores, called Sloan Select, off our Sloan -- current Sloan handbag, which is one of our best-selling bags. And this will be an opportunity where people will be able to customize their own bag with multiple different options. We also have the new Scout camera bag, which is a -- it goes along with our in-stacks exclusive that we'll have in our stores for the holiday season. Again, this is something that no one else is really doing in the fashion business. So there's all these initiatives, but they're driven around some of the smaller bags. That being said, very, very pleased. Some of the new product just hit last week in our stores, 8 of the 18 new groups that I talked to you about. I'm pleased, go take a look at Brooklyn. We got a winner. We've got one that's -- that's the new bag with grommets. It's really starting to kick-in strong. We've had the highest sell-throughs of a new group that we've seen in over 2 years in a week's time. So I brought you all up here to show you the showrooms. You may remember that was one of our key groups. Our influencer campaign launches on it. We're really feeling good about what's happening there. Lastly, in terms of the inventories. We've already started to wind down the inventories in the wholesale channel. Additionally, as you saw the promotional activities, the retailers are getting their inventories in line. We do not expect there to be any inventory issues in our own channels with the retailers for the fall seasons. That doesn't mean they're not going to be promotional. I can't tell you what they're going to do and not do given the traffic situations. But in terms of inventory, there'll be a significant amount of less inventory in the retail channel of Michael Kors product. And we think that's a good thing and we'll hopefully improve the health and image of our brand with the consumer as it relates to price.
I'd like to thank everybody for joining us today, and we look forward to talking to you for our next earnings call. Thank you very much. Have a great day."

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Michael Kors First Quarter 2017 Earnings Call.We are pleased to report that we once again exceeded our revenue and earnings per share expectations in the quarter. We drove strong double-digit growth",2285,"Thank you, Joe. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Michael Kors First Quarter 2017 Earnings Call.
We are pleased to report that we once again exceeded our revenue and earnings per share expectations in the quarter. We drove strong double-digit growth in our North American digital flagships, further expanded our presence in Asia, continued to develop our men's business globally and expanded our luxury fashion product assortments. However, this progress was muted by the ongoing decline in mall traffic trends as well as the decrease in tourism, which negatively impacted our comparable store sales performance during the quarter.
We remained intently focused on executing our multiple long-term growth strategies. Michael and our design teams are delivering exceptional fashion innovation for the fall season, particularly in our accessories and footwear categories. We are also excited about the debut of the MICHAEL KORS ACCESS wearable technology line of watches and fitness trackers, which we believe represents a meaningful growth opportunity as we position ourselves to capitalize on this rapidly growing category.
We continue to have many opportunities to build the Michael Kors brand and to generate excitement around our enhanced luxury product offerings. Our team has created a series of innovative, branded marketing initiatives designed to deepen consumer engagement. For example, on National Sunglass Day, we debuted our first-ever dedicated branded Snapchat lens. Snapchat users were able to virtually try on a pair of our best-selling Kendall sunglasses, while seeing the reflection of different jet-set locations on the actual lenses. This lens enabled us to capture the attention of our younger audience on Snapchat and garnered over 100 million views, including from a number of celebrity fans sharing snaps with their followers.
On Instagram, we recently launched #InstaKors. This innovative new commerce program seamlessly takes fans from a curated Michael Kors social engagement to a Michael Kors shopping experience. By clicking a link on our profile, followers are able to easily shop for their favorite items from our Instagram feed. #InstaKors makes it much easier for our customers to shop the styles they love in a way that is fun and interactive.
In late May, we launched our official Michael Kors site on the Line platform in Japan, which is the most used social communication platform in this market. To celebrate this launch, we teamed up with well-known illustrator, Yurie Sekiya, to create an exclusive character, DJ Michelle the Cat, and Line sticker pack featuring her in iconic Michael Kors products, which were available for free to all Line users for a limited time.
We also held events in several stores in the region to celebrate in person with our fans. I'm pleased to say that we added 1 million followers on the platform within the first 2 days.
These and other efforts have continued to expand our engaged social media followers. We believe that the hard work behind these numerous initiatives in our product and marketing positions us for long-term success. Our focus will remain centered on maintaining our leadership position in the global luxury market, while executing on multiple pillars for revenue growth.
Now let's take a closer look at our first quarter results. Total revenue increased 0.2% reflecting increased sales from the acquisition of our China license, strong growth in Japan and an increase in our Europe region, offset by a mid-single digit decline in our Americas region. Earnings per share were $0.83 on a reported basis. Excluding $11.3 million or $0.05 per share of onetime costs related to the acquisition of our Greater China license, earnings per share were $0.88, reflecting a 1.5% increase over the comparable period last year.
In our retail segment, comparable store sales decreased 7.4% due to a high single-digit comp decrease in North America and a low double-digit decline in Europe. This was partially offset by a high single-digit comp increase in Asia. Our North American digital flagships saw ongoing momentum during the quarter. Our digital flagship business posted strong double-digit comp growth and increased traffic as our innovative online marketing features continue to draw attention to the site, while our compelling product offerings entice our customers to shop. We believe that the digital channel represents a meaningful growth opportunity for our brand as consumers continue to transition to online shopping. We will continue to invest in our digital flagship strategy to ensure we are well positioned to further engage customers and capitalize on this shift in buying behavior.
In the Americas, retail stores conversions increased at a double-digit rate once again. However, this was more than offset by the decrease in traffic. Our crossbodies and small leather goods styles delivered mid-teens growth during the quarter. In addition, we continued to capitalize on athletic footwear trends with a compelling fashion offering, which led to strong sales growth in the quarter. The growth in these categories was more than offset by a low single-digit decline in our handbag sales and a double-digit decrease in our watch sales. We believe that the decline in watches sales was consistent with the declines that are being seen in the overall fashion watch market.
In our Europe region, we saw a high single-digit increase in conversion rates, which was offset by reduced traffic in certain major markets. The regions most challenged by negative traffic were the Benelux region, France and the U.K., which we attribute to the uncertainty among consumers around Brexit and the decline in tourism resulting from terrorist attacks in France.
Similar to the trends in our Americas regions, crossbodies, small leather goods and athletic footwear were top performers in our European stores, offset by lower handbag and watch sales. As mentioned on our previous call, we recently opened our largest flagship store on Regent Street in London. This store will serve to heighten Michael Kors' position as a leading global luxury brand across the Pan-European market. In addition, we launched a partnership with McLaren-Honda in Europe, becoming the official lifestyle partner of the world championship Formula 1 team. Michael was on hand to launch the flagship store and announce our partnership with McLaren-Honda, which also provided a great opportunity for him to connect with our consumers and fans. In fact, following his visit, we had 76 million impressions on social media channels, illustrating the power of our brand in the European market.
We plan to further expand our presence in Europe with the launch of digital flagships in 6 European countries beginning in the fall and in 16 countries in spring 2017. These digital flagships will enable us to interact more directly with the European consumers on a continuous basis, broadening our reach and depending our engagement as well as allowing customers to shop Michael Kors however and whenever they choose. Overall, we believe that Michael Kors remains a very strong brand in Europe with significant retail growth opportunity.
Turning to Asia. Sales in the region increased 74% resulting from the addition of the China business as well as a high single-digit comparable store sales increase in Japan. We were very pleased to see double-digit sales growth in both the China and South Korea regions. Looking ahead, we are excited about the upcoming opening of our flagship stores in Seoul and Singapore this fall. These locations will further establish Michael Kors as a global luxury brand in this region. Overall, we remain confident that Asia represents a significant long-term growth opportunity for the company.
In our wholesale segment, sales declined 7%. As anticipated, sales in the Americas region declined in the high single digits. As we have mentioned previously, we will prudently manage our business in this channel through disciplined inventory control and reduced promotional activity in order to protect our brand and margins. In Europe, we saw a low single-digit sales decline primarily due to a mix shift towards crossbodies and small leather goods, which carry a lower AUR. In Asia, the low single-digit decline in sales was attributable to the shift of our China and South Korea business to our company-owned retail segment.
Now turning to our product categories. While revenue in our accessories business declined, this was due to lower AURs resulting from the higher sales in crossbodies and small leather goods and increased promotional activity. Once again, overall accessories unit sales were up in the double digits reflecting strong consumer demand for our luxury product. We were particularly pleased with the strong response to new styles, including Savannah and Portia from our spring collection. Our footwear business performed well in the quarter, particularly our athletic styles. The new lightweight Amanda Trainer and Billie Trainer resonated well with customers as they are updates to our iconic styles, such as the Keaton. We also saw strong response to newness in our sandal category driven by the Becky, Mirabel, Sonya Flat and Westley Mule styles.
Finally, our men's category continues to deliver solid performance in the first quarter. We ended the quarter with 15 men's freestanding or side-by-side retail locations, and with approximately 200 sportswear and leather goods shop-in-shops with our wholesale partners. We are very excited as we continue to expand the breadth of Michael Kors men's customers that now visit our digital flagships and a location near them to shop our exciting product firsthand. During the quarter, our men's accessories business continued to exceed our internal plans both within our omnichannel retail and wholesale businesses. The success was largely driven by small leather goods, backpacks and messengers. As we look ahead, within the next 6 months, you will see an expanded presence of our men's accessories business within both our own stores and our global wholesale partners.
Finally, we're excited to leverage our partnership with McLaren-Honda to create events with world-famous drivers, Fernando Alonso and Jenson Button, in select stores in Europe, connecting the jet-set image of Formula 1 with the Michael Kors man. This is one example of how our broadening strategy to expand our men's lifestyle presence in Europe.
Turning to our licensing segment. Sales declined during the quarter due to continued weakness in the watch category, as the watch industry remains challenged overall in both the fashion and luxury segment. That said, we are excited to be entering the growing smartwatch category with the September launch of our MICHAEL KORS ACCESS collection. We are pleased to be teaming up with Google and utilizing their Android Wear operating system to run this truly unique accessory. The smartwatch will be available in 2 styles, each with thousands of different display options. The touchscreen device allows you to see your social media updates, text, emails and call alerts, use voice controls to access services via Ok Google, track your fitness and much more. Our smartwatches will be priced between $350 and $395.
In addition, we will be debuting a line of smart jewelry priced from $95 to $145, offering her a fitness tracker and a sleep monitor as both fashionable and functional.
To support the line of our -- of ACCESS, we will execute a comprehensive marketing campaign for the fall and holiday seasons across print and social media with editorial coverage across key fashion and technology publications and featured placement on our social media channels.
In addition, we will be debuting an advertising campaign at Spot Flights [ph], the ACCESS line, and the product will also be featured as one of the must-have gifts for our holiday gift guide.
Finally, we will be launching a new section on our website, where customers can learn more about both the watches and the trackers and explore the styles and functions that the products offer.
Our partnership with Google, in addition to our chic and cutting-edge product line and innovative marketing campaign, will position us to be the fashion leader in this high-growth category.
During the first quarter, growth in our license fragrance business was driven by our gifting programs for Mother's Day and Father's Day as well as strengthening branding in international markets. As we mentioned last quarter, we are looking forward to the launch of Wonderlust this fall, which we believe will be a new pillar in our fragrance collection and will drive further growth in this category.
We were also pleased with the great response to our new eyewear offering both domestically and internationally during the quarter. Our retail performance in eyewear accelerated nicely during the quarter, which is a reflection of our enhanced design and strong partnership with Luxottica. In particular, our aviators and our popular Kendall and Abela styles were big hits during the quarter.
In conclusion, the Michael Kors brand remains strong, and we have multiple long-term growth opportunities across our product categories and regions. We remain intently focused on delivering fashion luxury product to our customers. In the fall season, we will be introducing 18 new handbag groups globally. These new collections will feature seasonal colors, such as plum, moss green and brick red, with novelty design elements, including hardware, grommet and paisley print patterns.
In footwear, novelty details and new materials will play a big role in our fall offerings, with pearls, jewel embellishments, velvet and flannel all featured prominently in the collection. In addition, we will be expanding our rain boot offering with updates such as tweed and quilting. To capitalize on our strong fashion seeker trend, we will be introducing 2 new styles, the Scout Trainer and the Poppy Sneaker. We also look forward to the launch our digital flagships worldwide and the upcoming debut of both our MICHAEL KORS ACCESS line of wearable technology and our Wonderlust fragrance. In addition, we will continue to develop our men's business, which has a long term potential to expand our business globally and to expand our business across Asia.
With that, I'll turn it over to Joe for our financial reviews."

We are pleased to report that revenue and earnings per share results came in above our guidance. Total revenue grew 0.2% to $987.9 million. In our retail segment, net sales increased 7.6%, driven primarily by the opening of 221 net new stores since the first quarter of last year, including 145 stores associated with our recent acquisitions of Greater China and South Korea and the consolidation of our Latin American operations.
Comp sales decreased 7.4% reflecting a high single-digit comp decrease in North America and a low double-digit decline in Europe, partially offset by a high single-digit comp increase in Asia and strong performance of our digital flagships. Our North American digital flagships' sales contributed 210 basis points to our North American comp performance in the quarter.
In our wholesale segment, net sales declined 7.0% due to lower sales in our accessories and womenswear line, partially offset by increases in our men's and footwear businesses. As expected, we saw a high single-digit decline in our wholesale business in the Americas region as we remain disciplined with the amount of inventory we flow into that channel. We also saw a low single-digit decline in Europe as well as a low single-digit decline in Asia, which primarily reflects the shift of our Greater China and South Korea businesses to the retail segment during the quarter.
In our licensing segment, revenue decreased 20.9%. This was primarily due to the continued softness in the fashion watch category as well as lower revenues from our geographic licensing arrangements in Asia due to our recent acquisition of our licensee operations. Gross margin declined 130 basis points to 59.9%. The decline in gross margin is primarily due to a 480 basis point decline in retail gross margins attributable to additional markdowns, partially offset by an increase of 210 basis points in our wholesale gross margin, primarily attributable to favorable product mix and improved sourcing. We also saw a benefit from changes in geographic mix as we saw a 14.8% increase in sales from regions outside of the Americas.
Total operating expense grew 13.9% and increased 490 basis points to 40.9% of total revenue. The increase was primarily due to the inclusion of our businesses in Greater China, South Korea and Latin America; transaction costs associated with the acquisition of our Greater China business; our investment in new stores, e-commerce and omnichannel capabilities; new shop-in-shops and infrastructure improvements. Excluding $11.3 million of onetime costs related to the acquisition of our Greater China license during the quarter, total operating expense for the quarter grew 10.7% and were 39.8% of total revenue.
Income from operations was $186.9 million or 18.9% of total revenue as compared to 25.2% of total revenue in the same period last year. Excluding the aforementioned onetime costs associated with the acquisition of Greater China license, income from operations was $198.2 million or 20.1% of total revenue.
Retail operating margin was 11.8% compared to 23.1% in the prior year period. Our operating margin was impacted by the 480 basis point decrease in gross margin as described earlier. The decline was also due to a 310 basis point increase in operating expenses associated with higher retail store-related costs and depreciation related to new store openings, a 200 basis point negative impact associated with the aforementioned transaction costs related to the acquisition of Greater China and a 140 basis point negative impact from inclusion of our business in Greater China, South Korea and Latin America. We expect the inclusion of these international businesses to negatively impact our operating margin for the balance of the year. We anticipate that retail operating margin will benefit from the sequential improvement in the comp sales as well as higher gross margins in the back half of the year.
Wholesale operating margin increased 150 basis points, primarily due to the aforementioned increase in wholesale gross margins partially offset by a 60 basis point increase in operating expense primarily related to higher distribution, selling and depreciation and amortization expense. Licensing operating margin decreased 530 basis points primarily due to increased costs associated with intellectual property protection as well as increased depreciation expenses partially offset by lower advertising costs during the quarter. 
Income taxes were $39.3 million in the quarter, and our effective tax rate was 21.2% as compared to 29.4% in the same period last year. The decrease in our effective tax rate was primarily due to the favorable effect of certain global financing activities that we have undertaken as well as increase in taxable income in certain of our non-U.S. subsidiaries and state tax benefits that we recognized during the quarter.
Net income was $147.1 million for the first quarter, and diluted earnings per share was $0.83. Excluding the aforementioned onetime costs, net income for the quarter was $156.0 million or $0.88 per diluted share.
Turning to our balance sheet. At the end of the quarter, cash and cash equivalents were $337.1 million. Inventory was approximately the same as the prior year, even including the $36.1 million increase in inventory resulting from the recently acquired business in Greater China due to carefully -- careful inventory management and the anticipated decline in the Americas wholesale business. 
We ended the quarter with $248.6 million of debt, which was recorded within short-term debt on our consolidated balance sheet. The debt consisted of borrowings under the company's revolving credit facilities. The amount of available for future borrowings is approximately $749.4 million.
During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 8.0 million shares, totaling $400.0 million under our share repurchase program, and we have another $600.0 million of availability remaining. This represents a 5% reduction in the share count further demonstrating our commitment to returning value to shareholders.
As a result of the recently acquired business in Greater China, among other assets and liabilities acquired, as detailed in our 10-Q, we added $400.4 million, $99.0 million and $92.3 million of reacquired rights, goodwill and deferred tax liabilities to our balance sheet, respectively. The reacquired rights will be amortized through March 31, 2041, or approximately $16 million per year as a noncash expense and depreciation and amortization. Included in the quarterly results is $1.4 million of noncash amortization of the reacquired rights.
Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $46.9 million, and were related to the build-out of new retail stores and shop-in-shops as well as investments in our distribution facilities, our corporate offices, digital flagships and other infrastructure improvements. We added 103 net new stores in the first quarter. We opened 3 net locations in the Americas and 6 in Europe. We also assumed 94 stores in Greater China. In addition, we expanded or relocated 9 stores and converted 39 wholesale doors into shop-in-shops globally.
Turning to our outlook. For the second quarter, we expect total revenue to be between $1.07 billion and $1.085 billion, and a mid-single-digit decrease in comp sales. We expect an increase in gross margin of approximately 100 to 130 basis points, driven by favorable geographic and channel mix shift. We plan to continue to invest in our international expansion, digital flagships and global infrastructure, and therefore, expect operating expense as a percent of total revenue to increase 790 to 820 basis points resulting in an operating margin of approximately 17%.
We expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.84 to $0.88. This assumes a tax rate of approximately 21% and 171 million shares outstanding. Despite the modest reduction in our comp sales outlook to a mid-single-digit decline, we are maintaining our full year guidance based upon our first quarter results and our outlook for the remainder of the year. As a reminder, for the full fiscal year 2017, we expect total revenue to be flat versus the prior year. Operating margin is expected to be approximately 21.5%, excluding the $11.3 million of onetime transaction costs related to the acquisition of our Greater China licensee. We expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $4.56 to $4.64 for the year, excluding the onetime cost noted earlier. On a GAAP basis, we expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $4.51 to $4.59, inclusive of the $11.3 million of onetime transaction costs incurred in the first quarter. This assumes a tax rate of approximately 21% and 171 million shares outstanding.
Our guidance reflects the expected benefit from the introduction of new fashion luxury products for fall, strong holiday gifting programs, our new Wonderlust fragrance, the launch of our European digital flagships and the debut of the MICHAEL KORS ACCESS wearable technology line, in addition to our continued expansion in Asia and growth in our men's business. We also plan to drive brand engagement with exciting new marketing programs and through our jet-set luxury shopping experience in both our stores and our digital flagships.
Capital expenditures are expected to total approximately $250 million for fiscal 2017 and we'll focus on ongoing investments in global digital strategies and omnichannel capabilities, global retail expansion, including approximately 15 new stores in Americas, 20 in Europe and 40 in Asia, the conversion of approximately 215 wholesale shops -- wholesale shop-in-shops globally and the company's global distribution infrastructure, information systems and corporate facilities.
In conclusion, we have several initiatives in place to drive improved performance in the second half of the year, and are confident that we can achieve our revenue and earnings per share guidance for fiscal 2017. Overall, we continue to believe that we will be poised to deliver both sales and earnings per share growth over the long-term.
I will now turn the call back to John for closing remarks."

And then secondarily, Joe, I'm not sure I understood the comments about retail EBIT margin inflecting in the back half. Could you just go through that one more time for us?"

Thank you, Kimberly. Yes, I think you're going to see the inflection of global -- really North American wholesale, increase as we go through the quarters as we begin to pull back our exposure in that channel and further reduce also our promotional activity, in particular, that's going to start in calendar Q1 of next year. We will be removing ourselves from all store couponing, and that's for all of our retail partners in the United States and in Canada. And also we will be removing ourselves from all of the department store friends and family sales as well. We think that this is a critical for us to really do 3 things. Number one, to protect our brand image. As you know, that channel has become very promotional. And, in fact, is causing us difficulties in our own retail channel, which is why you see our gross margins declining, because we're really trying to meet certain pricing that's happening to be competitive. And we don't think that's the right thing to do for our brand going forward. Secondarily, we think it's creating confusion in the consumer's mind relative to the value of the Michael Kors brand when it's being seen so often on sale in so many different places. And third, mathematically, if you look at what's happened to our business, as I've stated in the call, we're shipping double-digits in terms of increases in product, but we're reporting revenue declines, and that's predominantly driven by average order declining, and that's predominantly being driven by lower prices because of promotional activity. So you'll see that accelerate in the back half of the year, and you will also see further wholesale declines next year as well. And we planned all of that. Even with that, we are expecting earnings per share growth for the company this year and next year as well, as well as modest revenue increases for the company next year. So we're going to navigate our way through this. We know we're doing the right thing for the brand long-term. We know the customer continues to resonate with Michael Kors. Our engagement rates with our followers are higher than they've ever been. Our consumer research shows that she's more engaged and has a higher propensity to want to buy the brand than she's ever been. We have to correct something that we think is actually having a negative long-term effect on the brand. And so that's how you'll see that kind of manifest itself through the balance of the year."

Number one, as Joe said, we're going to have an increase in gross margin in the back half of the year. Part of that is a mix shift. And part of it's also, we are going up against when all this kind of promoting, et cetera start to happen. So we've done some things that we think will improve our retail margins, in particular, in North America in the back half of the year, and we're already starting to see a little bit of that come through last month and a little bit beginning in this month. So we're pleased with the direction that we're heading. And the second issue is, you can see one of the biggest issues that affected us this past quarter and is going to affect us next quarter is the increase in our G&A. And as we've said all along, much of that spending -- we'll start to get some of that behind us after Q2 for us. The European e-commerce operations will be up and running. We'll begin to bring on parts of Venlo. Remember, we're going to run 2 distribution facilities for a period of time in Europe. And there's some other initiatives that we've got going on inside the company that we think is going to be able to have a positive effect, really from the back half of the year going forward on G&A. So I think that, again, we're forecasting, excluding the onetime charges of 21% -- 21.5% approximately, operating margin, we think, that's still best in -- one of the best-in-class in the entire industry. So we look forward to delivering on that for you and for our shareholders."

You're correct that we are all facing issues around traffic, and they're really driven by 2 things. First is mobile. I would use the word mobile because as people today are not only purchasing on mobile, but they're shopping on mobi",670,"Sure. Thank you, Omar. You're correct that we are all facing issues around traffic, and they're really driven by 2 things. First is mobile. I would use the word mobile because as people today are not only purchasing on mobile, but they're shopping on mobile. So we think that, that has to become one of our core competencies and leading platforms that we are going to really communicate and engage with our customers. There's a number of technologies that are coming to market from some of our partners at Facebook and Google that are going to enable us to really, on a geo-targeting basis, be able to change the way that we market to our customers and get it much more ring-fenced in terms of how we can communicate, and then really try to tailor our offerings to that customer. We've just started testing some of this, and the results have been quite extraordinary, with customers who might have actually been lapsed customers with us. Without even any special offers, I might add. It's just really how we communicate to them and how we tailor those different messages. So that's one of the first things that we're looking at is, it's not just e-commerce, but it's really mobile and how we're going to market with mobile. Secondly, I would say to you that we've launched something in about 35 of our stores, that's just up and running and it will be fully completed in the next kind of 30 days-or-so. And that's Kors Concierge, where all of our sales associates are equipped with devices that they can, number one, kind of know everything about what's happened with the customer from a transaction history standpoint, but even more importantly be able to create an experience for them that's more lifestyle-driven and be able to create a curated fashion message for the individual customer. And the reason why that's important is, I want to remind you that while we are a company that our predominant businesses in accessories, we're a lifestyle brand. And we do 30% of our business in nonaccessory-type products. And we actually think that one of the ways that we can increase traffic inside the stores is by changing some of our messaging to be a bit more about ready-to-wear, a bit more about footwear, et cetera. And we're seeing accelerated growth because of that in those categories. Now those aren't yet enough to offset what we've lost in -- really, remember, the #1 decline of our comp store sales is watches. It's the #1 area that's really hurting us the most when we look at our comp store declines. So we need to get some of these other categories to deliver at a higher rate than they've been in the past. We see digital marketing as being one of the critical ways to do that. And then really arming our jet-set selling associates with the right tools to engage with the customer both in-store and out-of-store. So I think that's the last piece that I would just like to say that's going to be important with Kors Concierge. It is going to give the ability for the sales associate, who's standing inside of the store and maybe not seeing a customer walk in during the daytime with the digital -- with the technology to be able to communicate directly with the customer during the day. So we're excited about what that holds for us. And again, hopefully also one of the big headwinds that we've all seen in the industry is tourism, especially when you're a luxury brand like ourselves or some of the other fine companies that are here, as U.S. fashion companies or European fashion companies. We're all suffering from the fact that people aren't traveling to the destinations, especially the major cities, the way that they were in the past. And we hope that as some of these currency headwinds settle down, consumers will get a little bit more comfortable by traveling a bit more."

Number one, Michael Kors still has a significant growth opportunity. We've said that Asia could be $1 billion business for us, and we think that men's over the long term can also be $1 billion business for us. So even if our accessories business stays flat or grows very slightly, we think those 2 businesses, in terms of regional and/or product, are going to be really exciting opportunities for us. So our #1 focus in terms of use of cash and management of the assets of the company is to continue to grow our existing business, which we think we will have the capabilities of doing. Secondly, we think that share repurchase is absolutely going to continue to be a priority for us. We believe that our shares are -- can significantly undervalued versus the marketplace. We think that the marketplace has more fear built into our stock price than actual reality of what our performance is. And so we will continue to be highly active. You saw we bought $400 million or 5% of our shares outstanding back in the quarter. I think that's a pretty powerful statement about what our company and our Board of Directors feels about the value of our shares. And then lastly, we are absolutely looking at M&A activity in the marketplace. We've built a powerful platform. When I say platform, I'm talking about the infrastructure of the company from our warehouse distribution to our -- we own our platforms for our digital systems. So we think that we will be able to layer onto that, and we will be very cautious and prudent at what we look at. But we do think we have opportunities to grow this business, especially with our strong cash flows and be able to use that in acquisition. And then lastly, we will potentially, one day, we'll get at dividends as well. So again, lots of good things happening at Michael Kors and lots of -- we think opportunity for investors as we move forward."

Wondering, you talked about the tourism, a lot of focus on the factory outlets, and particularly this earnings cycle. So just curious if you guys would give us any color on how your factory stores might be performing versus your retail stores?

As to first question, we don't break out factory versus full price. But I will tell you that as I think some of our other competitors have reported, factory traffic is down versus its historic levels, although not really that significantly. So it's not an area that we see as volatile as the full price side. And really the full price side, for us, the volatility as we've talked about many times is happening in major markets, whether it's New York, South Florida, certain parts of Southern California. And you see this all with currency. So whether it's the Brazilians that hurt us down in South Florida area, whether it's the Mexican peso that hurts us certain parts of Southern California, whether it was the euro because, as you know, we have close to $1 billion business and so Europeans coming to New York were very important for us, or in Europe where all of a sudden with these horrific atrocities that took place in France now, certain Asian consumers are nervous about traveling to that marketplace. So those are big markets for us, and they're meaningful markets for us. And as we look across our fleet of stores, where we're suffering the greatest is really in the tourist markets. Where we have -- where we're not heavily penetrated by tourists, actually those markets are relatively healthy with the local customers inside there. So that's kind of the state of what we see in that area. In terms of what we're expecting in transfer, Brian, we're really not for the time being. I've done this for a few times in my life. And somehow, when things go away, you don't just see an all of a sudden transfer to another place. What we are expecting is our average order -- or average consumer purchase to increase, and we expect that to increase substantially. Again, we are looking to actually sell less units. So hopefully, when I'm on this call with you at this time next year, we will be happy to be telling you that we're selling less units into the marketplace. And dollars, we will more than make up by increasing average order value, which is where we need to get back to, and we're going to work very hard. You heard me say that we're going to remove ourselves from all coupons, from all friends and family sales, that will happen in -- starting in February. That's a very, very big statement on Michael Kors part to show that we believe in our brand, we believe in the quality and the design that Michael and our teams are putting forward. And we believe that, as the leading American luxury fashion brand, we have an obligation to give our consumers the right vision on our product and not one that's driven by promotion and sale activities."

We -- this industry has evolved over the past few years to accelerated promotional activity. And we know that, that's the absolute wrong thing to do for a business over the long term. And so we have put in fairly significant plans, declines in certain areas of the business. One of them obviously being wholesale. But we also have things that are going to offset that. So we have regional growth, because remember this is a North America or actually United States and Canada conversation that we're having, and we have significant businesses in Europe. We have significant business and growing rapidly in Asia, which we think will continue to offset the declines that we're planning in United States and Canada as it relates to the wholesale piece. And additionally, we have new product categories that we're entering, men's in particular, which we think will also help offset this. So I don't want you to think that we don't understand that there will be a decline in certain categories because of less promotional activity. We absolutely understand that, believe that, and quite frankly want that, because we want to ship less units at lower prices -- that is not the way to ultimately build a luxury business."

So we're being cautious through the balance of the year. The overall market is going to continue to grow for us. And again, we see it as a very healthy market for us. But we just want to plan this cautiously. We also, again, don’t want to put too much inventory in the stores and start to create any kind of a situation, where consumers would see accelerated markdowns. Some of the European department stores have begun to do certain things that we think is not healthy for the long-term state of their industry. As you know, the U.K. has started Black Friday. There's different things going on in certain marketplaces that begin to look and smell a little bit about -- like the U.S, not anywhere near as dramatic, but they're struggling as well with low traffic in the stores and difficult performance. So we want to be very careful. Again, remember, as we hopefully continue to shoot for 21.5% operating margin, which we think puts us as one of the best-in-class, we have an aggressive share repurchase program. We are forecasting earnings per share growth in the company. We have ways to get through this that don't have to put us in a position where comp store sales is the single-most important thing that we have to do.

We also think that we have categories that are coming into the store that are slightly higher margin, and that's through some initiatives that we've done from a manufacturing standpoint. And you saw some of that show up in our wholesale margins as well. So we've got a number of initiatives that we think will really help to improve that.

And my second question is I think you mentioned that even though you're expecting wholesale to be down a lot or to be down again next year in terms of revenue as you pull shipments out of the channel. Could you tell us, is there a certain number of wholesale doors that you plan to exit? Or is this just sort of tightening up inventories?

We, obviously, were disappointed, and we came in, in the high single digits. It's approximately 7%. And that was really caused by what happened to us in Europe. We were anticipating kind of a decline of the level in North American comps. So we weren't surprised by what happened. And really, we knew that this quarter was going to be a highly promotional quarter for the entire retail segment in North America. And I think we, unfortunately, were right. The amount of promotional activity from many of the people who carry our line was at its all-time high, and we had to compete to be able to move our inventories during that period of time. So when you do that, it just lowers your average order value, and you just -- you can't keep up with, even though our transactions -- our conversion was up double-digit. So again, that's the whole cycle that we're going to get ourselves out of come the spring season, and really rebalance the brand from where it was previously. In terms of the question regarding the increase in sales for next year, that's really a function of -- as I've said before, we're going to grow our men's business. We're going to grow our business in Asia. And our business in Europe is going to continue to grow. So that will offset our planned decline in the North American marketplace even with the reduction of the department stores' inventory. We are not planning on reducing doors in the department stores today. Again, even with our reduction with most of our accounts, we're still one of the highest productivity lines on their floor today in terms of sales per square foot. So while we will have less product there, and I think ultimately, they will also experience a higher order value, which will hopefully balance out some of the reduction in inventory. We're still a very important line for these stores to carry in not only accessories but in footwear and women's ready-to-wear and watches and in fragrance. So I think it's just balancing it and getting it to a point where it's about -- less about promotion and more about full price selling."

Also can you just brief us on the crossbody SLG and when you anniversary that? And what's happening with that with respect to the comp store sales we should monitor? And just a final question. You've been really great at managing your inventory. But as you said, promotions are at an all-time high when you look across retail, should we be concerned that this will impact holiday for everybody as consumers see some really higher percentages off at competitors and you can't really control that?

And as you know, we think we've got one of the best products in the marketplace. So we're competing in a different arena. We're competing against some very significant competitors, being Apple and Samsung and et cetera. But we think we've -- with our partnership with Google and the fact that we believe that we've got a product that's better looking from a fashion standpoint and the consumer research that we've done, in particular, with the female customer, is bearing out absolutely she wants something that's exciting-looking and not quite as just tech-looking, so more fashion in its nature. So you're going to see it. It will arrive in the next few weeks, September 1 is when the launch begins. And the marketing campaign behind it is absolutely extraordinary. Our team has done, I think, one of the best jobs in the industry in terms of putting together the messaging around it. I don't think it's going to offset the decline that we saw in -- where the watch business before -- was before. This was a higher priced item. Even though, we're very competitively priced at $350 to $395, it's still higher priced than at $225 to $250 current watch. So this is going to take more time for the consumer to get comfortable with it. I think we'll see it accelerate modestly through Q2, and then into Q3 or calendar Q4. I think we'll see some very nice lift from this. And by the way, it's not only in our own stores, it's in our current department store partners. And this is a global launch. So the initiative is massive. We're really excited about the smart jewelry. I might say that we're very competitively priced at $95 to $145. You can assume who the competitors are out there. And we don't think anyone is doing the type of assortment that we've done. There will be major outposts in our partners' locations as well as in our own stores. We see this as a very, very big gifting opportunity during the holiday season. And we think this is going to give us a pretty significant lift in our own stores as well as our partners. So good things to come on that front, and we're pleased with technology partnership and execution and how that's being developed. As it relates to the crossbody and SLG, we've lapsed it. We started lapsing it already. And you heard me say on the call earlier, we still are seeing double-digit increases in this. I would tell you that there's 2 things I think going on. Number one, I think we are absolutely on trend as it relates to this category. It's clearly still what's driving the accessories business is -- it's just from a fashion standpoint. Smaller bags and heavily driven by crossbodies. And secondly, I think we have a deeper base of a younger customer than at some of our other competitors, that's driven by some of the marketing initiatives we have. It's driven just by our history of our fashion leadership. So that has a better category that we think is going to continue right through the holiday season. You're going to see this new collection that we're offering that will go up on our website and exclusive in our stores, called Sloan Select, off our Sloan -- current Sloan handbag, which is one of our best-selling bags. And this will be an opportunity where people will be able to customize their own bag with multiple different options. We also have the new Scout camera bag, which is a -- it goes along with our in-stacks exclusive that we'll have in our stores for the holiday season. Again, this is something that no one else is really doing in the fashion business. So there's all these initiatives, but they're driven around some of the smaller bags. That being said, very, very pleased. Some of the new product just hit last week in our stores, 8 of the 18 new groups that I talked to you about. I'm pleased, go take a look at Brooklyn. We got a winner. We've got one that's -- that's the new bag with grommets. It's really starting to kick-in strong. We've had the highest sell-throughs of a new group that we've seen in over 2 years in a week's time. So I brought you all up here to show you the showrooms. You may remember that was one of our key groups. Our influencer campaign launches on it. We're really feeling good about what's happening there. Lastly, in terms of the inventories. We've already started to wind down the inventories in the wholesale channel. Additionally, as you saw the promotional activities, the retailers are getting their inventories in line. We do not expect there to be any inventory issues in our own channels with the retailers for the fall seasons. That doesn't mean they're not going to be promotional. I can't tell you what they're going to do and not do given the traffic situations. But in terms of inventory, there'll be a significant amount of less inventory in the retail channel of Michael Kors product. And we think that's a good thing and we'll hopefully improve the health and image of our brand with the consumer as it relates to price.
I'd like to thank everybody for joining us today, and we look forward to talking to you for our next earnings call. Thank you very much. Have a great day."

I am joining you today from Tokyo, which is a market that we believe has great opportunity for the growth of the Michael Kors brand. Now turning to",1485,"Thank you, Joe. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Michael Kors' Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Call. I am joining you today from Tokyo, which is a market that we believe has great opportunity for the growth of the Michael Kors brand. 
Now turning to a review of our second quarter performance. Our results exceeded our expectations in the second quarter. We continue to deliver innovative luxury fashion products and expanded our brand footprint worldwide. We were extremely pleased with the successful launch of our MICHAEL KORS ACCESS wearable technology line of watches and fitness trackers as well as the debut of our Wonderlust fragrance. In addition, we were pleased with the great response to our new fall handbag collections, which exceeded our expectations. Our new iconic Mercer collection, emerged as a global bestseller and our Brooklyn [ph] collection set the fashion tone for the season with the introduction of granite hardware detailing. We also achieved strong sales growth in our menswear business during the quarter, and we continue to see this category as an area of future growth for the company. 
In North America, our digital flagships continue to deliver double-digit sales increases, and we were pleased with the successful launch of our European digital flagships. In addition, we seamlessly completed the integration of our recently acquired business in Greater China. This region represents a strong growth opportunity for the company. I am very proud of the work our team has done to deliver on the strategies. I believe these accomplishments set the stage for future growth. 
Let me now turn to a review of our quarterly results. For the second quarter, total revenue reached $1.1 billion and earnings per share was $0.95, both of which came ahead of our expectations. [indiscernible] comparable store sales decreased 5.4%. While our comps in North America decreased in the mid-single digit range for the quarter, overall, we were pleased to see sequential improvement driven by our strong fashion product offerings. 
Turning to our international business. We were disappointed in our results in Europe, which saw low double-digit comp decline. In Asia, we saw a mid-single digit comp increase. Please note that our comp in this region currently reflects only Japan as the remainder of our Asia business is not yet included in the comp base. 
Our North American digital flagships continued to perform well during the quarter with strong double-digit comp growth. We expect the momentum in our digital flagships to continue as we further invest in growing this channel. 
In the Americas, retail stores conversion rates increased in the high single digit range, which was offset by a continued decline in traffic. As I mentioned earlier, we saw positive response to our new handbag collections, women's small leather goods, Michael Kors ACCESS smartwatches and fitness trackers, Wonderlust fragrance and our men's bag and small leather goods. The growth of these categories was more than offset by a decrease in our handbag sales and a double-digit decline in our watch sales. 
In Europe, traffic continue to decline in certain major markets. We believe that the softness in this business was due to continued consumer uncertainty related to Brexit and the lingering concern following the terrorist attacks in Belgium, France and Germany as well as other geopolitical issues. That said, we continue to believe that the Michael Kors brand remains strong in Europe. 
We are committed to investing in our digital flagship strategy to ensure we are positioned to capture the growth opportunity in this region. To that end, we launched our digital flagship businesses in the U.K. and Germany at the end of the quarter and we have since launched digital flagships in France, Switzerland, Spain and Italy. While it is still very early days for each of these businesses, are pleased to have completed the launches and now have the platforms in place that will enable us to deepen our engagement with our consumers in these countries. We also plan to have e-commerce capabilities in 16 additional European countries in spring of 2017. 
In our Asia region, we saw increase in sales of 96%. This was driven by the addition of the China business as well as a mid-single digit comparable store sales increase in Japan. We were very pleased to see strong sales growth in China as our store network expands and our brand awareness increases. 
Looking ahead, we continue to believe that Asia represents a significant growth opportunity for the company and will ultimately reach $1 billion in revenue. 
Turning to our Wholesale segment. Revenues declined 18%. In the Americas, we saw a decline of 22%. We are strategically reducing our sell-in to department stores in order to protect our brand and margins in this channel through disciplined inventory control and reduced promotional activity, which has impacted our sales in this segment. We expect this trend will continue through the remainder of this year as we reduce both inventory flow and promotions. 
In Europe, we saw a 3% increase in wholesale sales. This growth is lower than historical trends as we are being negatively impacted by a mix shift towards crossbodies and small leather goods, which carry a lower AUR. This is the same fashion trend that started more than a year ago in North America. We anticipate this trend will continue to impact our wholesale sales in this region for the balance of the year. 
In Asia, the 43% decline in wholesale sales was primarily attributed to the shift of China and South Korea businesses to our company-owned Retail segment. 
In our men's business, we delivered solid performance in the second quarter, and we ended the quarter with 244 sportswear and leather goods shop-in-shops within our wholesale doors globally. Our North American and European wholesale partners remain excited to have a major new designer menswear line to offer to their customers and we are confident that our men's business will be an important contributor to our future wholesale growth. 
In our Licensing segment, revenue declined during the quarter as we continue to see softness in the fashion watch category. That said, performance in our MICHAEL KORS ACCESS smartwear collection as well as our fitness trackers, which debuted in September, are exceeding our expectations. Importantly, our ACCESS product line is engaging both our loyal watch customers as well as attracting new customers in a younger demographic. Our Bradshaw [ph] and Dylan smartwatches in signature rose gold, gold, and silver platings are quickly becoming our most popular styles. The launch was supported by a significant marketing campaign across our global print, digital and social platforms. We also simultaneously created interactive experiences both on our digital, flagship and in-store to educate and excite consumers bringing the category and its benefits to life. To keep the momentum going through holiday, we will continue to roll out a comprehensive marketing program across print and social media. And we'll be featuring the product as one of our must-have gifts in our holiday gift guide. We also saw strong response to the debut of our Wonderlust fragrance, which came in ahead of plan during the quarter. We believe that this new pillar in our fragrance collection will drive further growth in this category going forward. 
In conclusion, our focus remains on executing on our multiple pillars for revenue growth, while maintaining our leadership position in the global luxury market, consistently delivering innovative fashion products to our customers and enhancing consumer engagement with the brand worldwide. 
Our key new handbag groups are performing very well. Our consumers respond favorably to the seasonal colors and novelty design elements featured in the collection. We're also seeing continued growth in our women's active shoe assortment and are encouraged by the initial results we have seen from the rollout of our men's offerings, both of which are key areas of growth for the company. 
We are also pleased with the strong momentum in our digital flagships, and we look forward to launching in Japan and China as well as additional countries in Europe within the next year. 
While there were some accomplishments that we were pleased with the during the quarter, our results continue to be impacted by the ongoing decline in mall traffic, the reduction in tourism in certain major cities and our strategic decision to reduce sell-in of inventory in the U.S. wholesale channel. We are in the process of rebalancing our business to increase the average transaction value in our retail stores as well as in our wholesale channel, and reduce the total number of units sold in the marketplace in North America. While these actions will result in short-term revenue declines, we believe they will enhance our brand equity over the long term. We will use this rebalancing as an opportunity to emphasize and extend other categories in our lifestyle portfolio products as well as to expand our business internationally. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Joe to review our financials."

Total revenue was $1.09 billion compared to $1.13 billion in the prior year quarter. In our Retail segment, net sales increased 12.1% driven primarily by the addition of 198 net new stores since the second quarter last year, including 137 stores associated with our recent acquisitions of Greater China and South Korea. 
Comp stores -- comp sales decreased 5.4% reflecting a mid-single digit comp decrease in North America and a low double-digit decline in Europe, partially offset by a mid-single digit comp increase in Asia and strong performance of our digital flagships. Our North American digital flagships sales contributed 270 basis points to our North American comp performance in the quarter. 
In our Wholesale segment, net sales declined 18.4% due to lower sales in our accessories, womenswear and footwear businesses, partially offset by an increase in our men's business. We saw a 22% decline in our wholesale business in the Americas region as we remain disciplined with the amount of inventory we have shipped into that channel. We also saw a single-digit increase in our European sales. In addition, we had a decrease in Asia, which primarily reflects the shift of our Greater China and South Korean businesses to the Retail segment during the quarter. 
In our Licensing segment, revenue decreased 10.2%. This was primarily due to the continued softness of the fashion watch and jewelry categories as well as lower revenues from our geographic licensing arrangement in Asia as a result of our recent acquisitions of our licensee operations. 
Gross margin expanded 40 basis points to 59.2% due to a favorable channel mix shift towards the Retail segment. Gross margin increased 80 basis points in our Wholesale segment primarily due to a change in the geographic mix. Gross margin declined 250 basis points in the Retail segment attributable to higher markdowns as compared to last year. 
Total operating expense grew 12.7%, and increased 590 basis points to 40.5% of total revenue. The increase was primarily due to the inclusion of our businesses in Greater China and South Korea, our investment in new stores, e-commerce and omnichannel capabilities, new shop-in-shops and the infrastructure improvements. 
Income from operations was $203.7 million, or 18.7% of total revenue as compared to 24.2% of total revenue in the same period last year. 
Retail operating margin was 11.7% compared to 18.8% in the prior year period. Operating margin was negatively impacted by 170 basis points from the inclusion of our newly acquired Greater China and Korea businesses, and by 90 basis points due to a noncash asset impairment charge. Operating margin was also negatively impacted by the 250 basis point decrease in gross margin that I described earlier. 
Operating expense as a percentage of sales was higher due to continued investments in our business, including retail store-related costs and depreciation expense associated with new store openings as well as continued costs related to building our digital flagship platforms. We expect the inclusion of these international businesses, which currently carry a lower operating margin to negatively impact our operating margin for the balance of the year. Somewhat offsetting the compression from Greater China and Korea is a sequential improvement in gross margin from the first half of the year to the second half, and leveraging of our fixed operating expenses as we grow the retail revenues in the second half. For the second half of the year, we anticipate that the Retail segment operating margin to be approximately 20%. 
Wholesale operating margin was 27.0% compared to 28.3% in the prior year period. This was largely the result of a 210 basis point increase in operating expenses as a percent of revenue due to deleverage. This was partially offset by the aforementioned 80 basis point increase in our wholesale gross margins. 
Licensing operating margin was 31.2% compared to 37.7% in the prior year period. This was primarily due to increased costs associated with advertising as well as increased depreciation expense. 
Income taxes were $41.9 million in the quarter, and our effective tax rate was 20.7% as compared to 28.9% in the same period last year. The decrease in our effective tax rate was primarily due to [Audio Gap] $160.9 million for the second quarter and diluted earnings per share was $0.95. This compares to net income of $193.1 million or $1.01 per share -- per diluted share in the second quarter of fiscal 2016. 
Turning to our balance sheet. At the end of the quarter, cash and cash equivalents were $186.4 million. Inventory decreased 2.5% compared to the prior year due to careful inventory management and the anticipated decline in the U.S. wholesale business. 
We ended the quarter with $384.4 million of debt, which was recorded within short-term debt on a consolidated balance sheet. The debt consisted of borrowings under the company's revolving credit facilities. The amount available for future borrowings is approximately $615.9 million. 
During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 5 million shares totaling $250 million under our share repurchase program and have another $350 million of availability remaining on our most recent $1 billion authorization. This most recent share repurchase further demonstrate the company's commitment to returning value to shareholders and our confidence in our long-term growth potential. 
Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $52.3 million and were related to the build-out of new retail shops and shop-in-shops as well as investments in our distribution facilities, our corporate offices, digital flagships and other infrastructure improvements. We added 16 net new stores and converted 54 wholesale doors in the shop-in-shops globally in the second quarter. 
Overall, Michael Kors remains a leader in the fashion luxury marketplace. That said, our business has become increasingly challenged by macro factors that exist globally, including weakness in consumer spending. While we are excited about the strong response to new products across categories, we see a continuation of soft traffic trends and aggressive promotional activity in the U.S. market. Globally, our brand acceptance remains strong, but we are seeing weeklies into tourism, trends, geopolitical issues and foreign currency fluctuations that contributes to top line pressure. Given these macro factors, we are reducing our fiscal 2017 revenue expectation to approximately $4.55 billion and expect a mid-single digit decrease in comp sales. Gross margin is now expected to be approximately 60%, modestly below our initial expectation as we anticipate that our reduced European sales outlook will result in a less favorable benefit from geographic mix than we initially anticipated. In addition, we expect operating expense as a percent of total revenue to be approximately 39.5%. These assumptions result in an operating margin of approximately 20.7%, excluding the $11.3 million in onetime transaction costs related to the acquisition of our Greater China licensee. On a GAAP basis, we expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $4.32 to $4.38, inclusive of the $11.3 million of onetime transaction cost. We expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $4.37 to $4.43 for the year, excluding the onetime cost noted earlier. This assumes a tax rate of approximately 21% and 169.5 million shares outstanding. 
For the third quarter, we expect total revenue to be between $1.365 billion and $1.38 billion, and a mid-single digit decrease in comp sales. We expect gross margin of approximately 60.5% driven by favorable geographic and channel mix shift. We plan to continue to invest in our international expansion, digital flagships and global infrastructure, and therefore, expect operating expense as a percent of total revenue to be approximately 35.5% resulting in an operating margin of approximately 25%. We expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.61 to $1.65. This assumes a tax rate of approximately 21% and 166.5 million weighted average shares outstanding. 
Capital expenditures are expected to total approximately $250 million for the fiscal year 2017. And we will focus on ongoing investments in global digital strategies and omnichannel capabilities, global retail expansion, including approximately 15 new stores in the Americas, 25 in Europe and 30 in Asia; the conversion of approximately 215 wholesale shop-in-shops globally; and the company's global distribution infrastructure information systems and corporate facilities. 
In conclusion, we remain focused on the initiatives that we had in place to drive sequential improvement in our business in the second half of fiscal 2017 and sales and earnings growth over the long term. 
I will now turn the call back to John for closing remarks."

And then Joe I just wanted to follow up on the margin commentary. I'm wondering if you can talk to us about how we should think about Retail segment margins over the medium term? Where do you expect them to land? And wholesale margins over the medium term, where do you think they end up normalizing?"

There's 2 separate things that are going on for us, we believe, in the total retail environment. First is no question, in North America, we probably suffer worst than many of our competitors because we have a very large international",792,"Thank you, Kimberly. There's 2 separate things that are going on for us, we believe, in the total retail environment. First is no question, in North America, we probably suffer worst than many of our competitors because we have a very large international business that we had some very nice growth with, in particular, European tourists coming to the United States and South American tourists coming to United States, to a degree people from Mexico as well. So most of that business has declined dramatically and we have not seen any return, and it's getting probably closer to the bottom. But there's still more headwinds in there, obviously, not as volatile as it was 12 months ago. So we're really looking at that as one issue that we have to deal with. And the second issue is in North America, there's been a very, very strong amount of promotional activities generated from competitors and certain other channels of distribution. So we, and I'm going to address the second one first, we've announced that starting on February 1, we're really focused on reducing the amount of promotional activity that we're going to be involved in as a brand. We think that's the right thing to do for the health of the business. Once again, this past quarter, we saw a mid-single digit increases in our overall accessories business in units. So once again, customers buying Michael Kors, that's not the issue. The issue is that the price of our sale has been degraded and it's been degraded because of promotional activity. We believe that if we focus on average transaction value and get that up and less on the unit, amount of unit transactions, we're our going to have a healthier business. So to that end, our best-selling handbag group this Fall season is Mercer, which we commented about in our remarks earlier. And that product, by the way, is not in promotion anywhere. So we set it out as a nonpromotional item and it is working, it's working really well in every channel of distribution for us. So it shows that the customer is absolutely willing to pay when they understand that things can't be put on promotional regular basis. We will have for the spring seasons 5 groups that will not only fit into that same category, so they will be excluded even from the authorized sale periods that we will have in Michael Kors. So we're going to be focused on average transaction value and how we get tath up. But at the same point in time, those groups will be approximately, on a medium-sized handbags, $295, which we think is a really key price points. And we know it's a key price point, we know she's responding and responding in very large quantities. So we think we can create amazing luxury product with fashion sensibility and deliver to her at a price point that something she's going to find compelling. So we believe that, that will be a number 1 for us.. Number two, again, the active footwear category has been something that's been explosive for us and we're getting great traction in that category. And then third, we're very pleased what's happening with our smartwatch business. We are probably the #2 clear out in the marketplace today, clearly, with Apple being #1 and the response has been extraordinary. We are selling out of product. We're actually, in a position where we're not able to fulfill all the demand that's happening around the globe. So we think those combination of factors will begin to really start to impact the business as we head through the calendar fourth quarter, our fiscal third quarter and then into first quarter. So that all being said, you know that we've reduced our wholesale shipments in preparation of this. So that's one of the reasons why we've revised our guidance, I think we have a better handle on where that's all going to land now. And I think the brand will be in a much better position to grow from there. And then lastly is our men's business, which as we commented earlier, we're very pleased with the initial results both on a sportswear and I think we're being a little surprised on how successful the leather piece of the business is. It's really taking off very quickly and we're trying to capitalize and moving that into more locations even worse, in our own chain where we might not already -- or we might to be putting the full assortment of men's in. So we still see opportunity for growth, and that will absolutely be in our projections for next year. So we're feeling good about that. I'll turn it over to Joe now."

We also will have to wait until we get through again, calendar fourth quarter, which will be a very big gifting opportunity for us to see how this really impacts the sales. We also have other products that are going to be launched right behind the smartwatch. And so we think that there's going to be more technology innovation coming into this category. And I think you heard me say before that we think long-term, the fashion watch category will be revolutionized and may even ultimately eat into the whole tracker market, as you know, it today, where watches will have the same capabilities as tracker, so you can have a smartwatch and then you can have watches that will just have less functionality and not be quite as expensive. we're very excited. I want to thank our partners, both Fossil and Google for everything that they've done to make this such a successful launch for the company and not just domestically, but worldwide. These watches are selling all over the world and so I think we're just at the very beginning of something that's exciting. And the last thing, I would say, is we're -- people are coming into the store who we've never seen before, who have been reading about this either from bloggers or seeing them to our social campaigns, and it absolutely drawing a new and different customer to our stores. So we're terribly excited about that. And even kind of leads into this fun little collaboration that we're doing with Fuji on the instack [ph] cameras that they just hit the stores, and they really doing extremely well as well.

I think we've been very good as a company in terms of managing inventory. I think the biggest issue for us is, we want to continue to produce newness. That's what's going to keep the customer and engage and excited with our brand, and we've always done that. The issue for us is really more about getting the transaction value back up because when the customer sees our products and not just our products, even with our competitors, the things are constantly being put on sale, you loose a credibility with that customer, that they you should see something new and want to buy it than that we just wait until an event happens. So I think that's going to be our major focus next year. It won't be an easy task, I don't want to mislead you with stuff something that happens overnight. But if you really care about your brand long-term and you believe that having less units in the marketplace and a higher transaction value is a long-term strategy, then we believe we'll be successful."

It's going be a little hard to answer that question because there was I think 3 or 4 in there e. Let me take a stab at it though. We are looking to have AUR increase somewhere in the 10% to 15% range. So I think that's the first place to start. And that's been about the degradation that has taken place over the past let's call it 12 months. And I think I've commented to you all before, too, not only our unit sales up in our own stores and in our department store partners, but our actual consumers who -- new consumers coming to the brand is up as well. So again, we -- between that, between our brand awareness studies, et cetera, we don't see an issue that there's a health of the brand issue, people are buying, more people are engaged, more people are actually coming to our company through our own websites and our partners' website. So that's not the issue. The issue is that when you look at all that and then you got, let's say, on the highside 15% AUR decline, that really -- you can't make up that difference. So that would be our goal. So that would kind of put the units down to that kind of number, somewhere between the 10% and 15%, and then we hope we make that up with AUR. And we're going to do that in my earlier answer to Kimberly, not just to the fact that we're going to limit exit deference and family sales and all those types of things. But also, really creating a different sense of excitement around the value of the product. Again, we know she is buying crossbodies and tote, et cetera, from us and she believes that, that's a handbag when she buys it. She didn't say, well, I only bought a small bag because I have less money, that's what the fashion is today. We believe that we can create some excitement with her, especially in medium-sized bags at a higher AUR than what we're currently selling but still with great value for her, and very, very consistent with where we've been as a brand overall. That $300 handbag price point for us has been a very strong price point and we' d like to see a greater amount of our mix shift go that area, and so that's why I said we'll have these 5 groups in the spring season that we're terribly truly excited about. And should really generate some significant volume if the Mercer collection particulars an indication of what we've seen happening."

Kors Concierge is in a limited amount of the stores right now, and literally, it's only been up for about, I think, 3 or 4 weeks. You might -- you may have seen it in there about 60 days ago or so but the full capabilities of it is really not available for the sales associates until just a few weeks ago. So it's too early to tell what and how that's going to impact the transactions inside the stores. But very clearly, it will give the selling associates the ability to see the full breadth of the product that's available through not only our e-commerce capabilities, but it will also give them a view of all the product that inside the chain in stores. And most importantly, it gives them the capability as you probably have seen of really being a styling consultant and wardrobing the customer in multiple different ways that are all selected from Michael, himself, personally and our design teams and how they see people being put together. So we think it's an incredible tool that sales associates are going to be able to really engage with our customers with. And you combine that with some of the geo-targeting technology that's available from some of our partners, and we're able to have much more targeted communications with the local customer, I'm talking local, it might be 5 blocks of a store if in your New York city or might be within 2 or 3, 4 miles of a stores here out [indiscernible]. So we think that given the technology capabilities, the clientele capabilities and now the styling capabilities, it's going to give our sales associates a lot more to work with, with the customer. And today, that's really what it's all about. You heard us talk earlier, our conversion rates in the stores continue to rise. So again, customers, when they come to the door are engaging with us, that's not the problem. The problem is how do we get them in and and and we're hoping this technology as well as some things that we're coupling with that are going to be helpful for us. We're also piloting Quicken collect, which is a limited amount of the stores, just went live a few days ago. So that capability will be in place also, which is another reason to have our customers come into our stores and engage with our sales associates. So of these heavily thing that we've been doing from a technology standpoint, debate this is were really going to be in place to start to reap the benefits of those investments."

Lindsay, the destock that's happening is really starting to happen now because the retailers need to reduce their inventories in light of what our new policy is going to be during. They obviously are lowering their sales plans because their current model is to do more business with promotional activity, so that's in conflict or contrast to what we think is the right thing to do going forward. And again, there's been nothing but complete cooperation from everyone of our retail partners in the United States, but we're a significant part of them and of their businesses. So they need to rightsize their inventories accordingly and we're in complete support of that. So sell-throughs are pretty similar to were they've been historically, but remember all the promotional activity is going on as we speak. So none of that's change, and none of that will change until the end of January. So we're expecting a fairly promotional holiday season but once we get beyond that, we're feeling that we've got a different way of looking at how the business can be built. And we're hoping that, that's going to be looked upon at a very positively by our consumer."

Joe indicated that we've got 270 point basis -- basis point increase driven by the e-commerce. So our e-commerce traffic is up strong double digits. We're seeing the same thing happen in Europe. The minute you turn on e-commerce and, as I said to you before, we're very pleased with what's happening so far, it impacts the full priced business. So we think that part of this is a shift to our own e-commerce sites. And part of it is obviously people, in general, shopping less in the mall channel just because of all the activity that goes on, on e-commerce sites around North America and now you're starting to see the same thing happen in many larger European countries as well."

We believe that the North American handbag business is roughly flat, may be up a couple of points in total. And we don't see that trend changing much. So I think that as it relates to us, we obviously have a fairly large market share in that category. And our growth rate in handbags in North America will be low single digit if we do our job right. That will be more in dollars than in units. So that's how we view that. And then the watch category, we do believe that the decline is going to lessen. As I said earlier, we've already seen that when you add the combined smartwatch and fashion watch categories together. And we don't know how much that will stop declining but there are some very good indication there. We clearly need to have other categories working inside of our store. If you take those 2 categories and say, 1 may still be in the, let's pretend it's high single-digit decline and one is flattish to up a few points, we need other categories to work and you're going to be seeing that happen. We're certainly taking the shoe areas inside of our stores and making them significantly larger. Also by the way, the shoe business has been positively impacted by our e-commerce because we're able to have wider assortments online and sales associates are able to do sense, to company -- to customers' homes by virtue of the breadth that we have online. And some of that category could be a very nice increase for us. We'll be making some announcements about some jewelry on the next call, some strategies that we have around jewelry for our around freestanding stores and that we think is also going to be very nice additional category of business for us. So we're going to be looking at other things. And then of course, men's has great opportunity for us. So we're taking certain stores, and that will be a next round of test for us. That currently have, we believe, space to add the menswear to and its full capacity, so that would be Tysons' corner [ph] and Aventura, Toronto, there's going to be a handful of stores that we believe we can add menswear to in their existing footprint. And that could be additional volume for us. So our goal would be, for next year, to see our North American comps kind of flatten out and have comp store increases in our international business. And so we do see growth, and that will be driven by, in certain cases, in our international markets, more in handbag where we can grow market share and in our North American markets where will come from some other categories. So I hope that helpful."

Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Michael Kors' second quarter 2017 earnings call. I am joining you today from Tokyo, which is a market that we believe has great opportunity for the growth of the Michael Kors brand. 
Now turning to a review of our second quarter performance. Our results exceeded our expectations in the second quarter. We continued to deliver innovative luxury fashion product and expanded our brand footprint worldwide. We were extremely pleased with the successful launch of our MICHAEL KORS ACCESS wearable technology line of watches and fitness trackers as well as the debut of our Wonderlust fragrance. In addition, we were pleased with the great response to our new fall handbag collections, which exceeded our expectations. Our new iconic Mercer collection, emerged as a global bestseller and our Brooklyn collection set the fashion tone for the season with the introduction of Grommet hardware detailing. We also achieved strong sales growth in our menswear business during the quarter, and we continued to see this category as an area of future growth for the company. 
In North America, our digital flagships continued to deliver double-digit sales increases, and we were pleased with the successful launch of our European digital flagships. In addition, we seamlessly completed the integration of our recently acquired business in Greater China. This region represents a strong growth opportunity for the company. I am very proud of the work our team has done to deliver on these strategies. I believe these accomplishments set the stage for future growth. 
Let me now turn to a review of our quarterly results. For the second quarter, total revenue reached $1.1 billion and earnings per share was $0.95, both of which came ahead of our expectations. [indiscernible] comparable store sales decreased 5.4%. While our comps in North America decreased in the mid-single digit range for the quarter, overall, we were pleased to see sequential improvement driven by our strong fashion product offerings. 
Turning to our international business. We were disappointed in our results in Europe, which saw low double-digit comp decline. In Asia, we saw a mid-single digit comp increase. Please note that our comp in this region currently reflects only Japan as the remainder of our Asia business is not yet included in the comp base. 
Our North American digital flagships continued to perform well during the quarter with strong double-digit comp growth. We expect the momentum in our digital flagships to continue as we further invest in growing this channel. 
In the Americas, retail stores conversion rates increased in the high single-digit range, which was offset by a continued decline in traffic. As I mentioned earlier, we saw positive response to our new handbag collections, women's small leather goods, Michael Kors ACCESS smartwatches and fitness trackers, Wonderlust fragrance and our men's bags and small leather goods. The growth of these categories was more than offset by a decrease in our handbag sales and a double-digit decline in our watch sales. 
In Europe, traffic continued to decline in certain major markets. We believe that the softness in this business was due to continued consumer uncertainty related to Brexit and the lingering concern following the terrorist attacks in Belgium, France and Germany as well as other geopolitical issues. That said, we continued to believe that the Michael Kors brand remains strong in Europe. 
We are committed to investing in our digital flagship strategy to ensure we are positioned to capture the growth opportunity in this region. To that end, we launched our digital flagship businesses in the U.K. and Germany at the end of the quarter and we have since launched digital flagships in France, Switzerland, Spain and Italy. While it is still very early days for each of these businesses, we are pleased to have completed the launches and now have the platforms in place that will enable us to deepen our engagement with our consumers in these countries. We also plan to have e-commerce capabilities in 16 additional European countries in spring of 2017. 
In our Asia region, we saw increases in sales of 96%. This was driven by the addition of the China business as well as a mid-single digit comparable store sales increase in Japan. We were very pleased to see strong sales growth in China as our store network expands and our brand awareness increases. 
Looking ahead, we continue to believe that Asia represents a significant growth opportunity for the company and will ultimately reach $1 billion in revenue. 
Turning to our Wholesale segment. Revenues declined 18%. In the Americas, we saw a decline of 22%. We are strategically reducing our sell-in to department stores in order to protect our brand and margins in this channel through disciplined inventory control and reduced promotional activity, which has impacted our sales in this segment. We expect this trend will continue through the remainder of this year as we reduce both inventory flow and promotions. 
In Europe, we saw a 3% increase in wholesale sales. This growth is lower than historical trends as we are being negatively impacted by a mix shift towards crossbodies and small leather goods, which carry a lower AUR. This is the same fashion trend that started more than 1 year ago in North America. We anticipate this trend will continue to impact our wholesale sales in this region for the balance of the year. 
In Asia, the 43% decline in wholesale sales was primarily attributed to the shift of China and South Korea businesses to our company-owned Retail segment. 
In our men's business, we delivered solid performance in the second quarter, and we ended the quarter with 244 sportswear and leather goods shop-in-shops within our wholesale doors globally. Our North American and European wholesale partners remain excited to have a major new designer menswear line to offer to their customers. And we are confident that our men's business will be an important contributor to our future wholesale growth. 
In our Licensing segment, revenue declined during the quarter as we continued to see softness in the fashion watch category. That said, performance in our MICHAEL KORS ACCESS smartwear collection as well as our fitness trackers, which debuted in September, are exceeding our expectations. Importantly, our ACCESS product line is engaging both our loyal watch customers as well as attracting new customers in a younger demographic. Our Bradshaw and Dylan smartwatches in signature rose gold, gold, and silver platings are quickly becoming our most popular styles. The launch was supported by a significant marketing campaign across our global print, digital and social platforms. We also simultaneously created interactive experiences both on our digital, flagship and in-store to educate and excite consumers bringing the category and its benefits to life. To keep the momentum going through holiday, we will continue to roll out a comprehensive marketing program across print and social media. And we'll be featuring the product as one of our must-have gifts in our holiday gift guide. We also saw strong response to the debut of our Wonderlust fragrance, which came in ahead of plan during the quarter. We believe that this new pillar in our fragrance collection will drive further growth in this category going forward. 
In conclusion, our focus remains on executing on our multiple pillars for revenue growth, while maintaining our leadership position in the global luxury market, consistently delivering innovative fashion products to our customers and enhancing consumer engagement with the brand worldwide. 
Our key new handbag groups are performing very well. Our consumers respond favorably to the seasonal colors and novelty design elements featured in the collection. We're also seeing continued growth in our women's active shoe assortment and are encouraged by the initial results we have seen from the rollout of our men's offerings, both of which are key areas of growth for the company. 
We are also pleased with the strong momentum in our digital flagships, and we look forward to launching in Japan and China as well as additional countries in Europe within the next year. 
While there were some accomplishments that we were pleased with the during the quarter, our results continued to be impacted by the ongoing decline in mall traffic, the reduction in tourism in certain major cities and our strategic decision to reduce sell-in of inventory in the U.S. wholesale channel. We are in the process of rebalancing our business to increase the average transaction value in our retail stores as well as in our wholesale channel, and reduce the total number of units sold in the marketplace in North America. While these actions will result in short-term revenue declines, we believe they will enhance our brand equity over the long term. We will use this rebalancing as an opportunity to emphasize and extend other categories in our lifestyle portfolio products as well as to expand our business internationally. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Joe to review our financials."

Total revenue was $1.09 billion compared to $1.13 billion in the prior year quarter. In our Retail segment, net sales increased 12.1% driven primarily by the addition of 198 net new stores since the second quarter of last year, including 137 stores associated with our recent acquisitions of Greater China and South Korea. 
Comp stores -- comp sales decreased 5.4% reflecting a mid-single digit comp decrease in North America and a low double-digit decline in Europe, partially offset by a mid-single digit comp increase in Asia and strong performance of our digital flagships. Our North American digital flagship sales contributed 270 basis points to our North American comp performance in the quarter. 
In our Wholesale segment, net sales declined 18.4% due to lower sales in our accessories, womenswear and footwear businesses, partially offset by an increase in our men's business. We saw a 22% decline in our wholesale business in the Americas region as we remain disciplined with the amount of inventory we have shipped into that channel. We also saw a single-digit increase in our European sales. In addition, we had a decrease in Asia, which primarily reflects the shift of our Greater China and South Korean businesses to the Retail segment during the quarter. 
In our Licensing segment, revenue decreased 10.2%. This was primarily due to the continued softness of the fashion watch and jewelry categories as well as lower revenues from our geographic licensing arrangement in Asia as a result of our recent acquisitions of our licensee operations. 
Gross margin expanded 40 basis points to 59.2% due to a favorable channel mix shift towards the Retail segment. Gross margin increased 80 basis points in our Wholesale segment primarily due to a change in the geographic mix. Gross margin declined 250 basis points in the Retail segment attributable to higher markdowns as compared to last year. 
Total operating expense grew 12.7%, and increased 590 basis points to 40.5% of total revenue. The increase was primarily due to the inclusion of our businesses in Greater China and South Korea, our investment in new stores, e-commerce and omnichannel capabilities, new shop-in-shops and the infrastructure improvements. 
Income from operations was $203.7 million, or 18.7% of total revenue as compared to 24.2% of total revenue in the same period last year. 
Retail operating margin was 11.7% compared to 18.8% in the prior year period. Operating margin was negatively impacted by 170 basis points from the inclusion of our newly acquired Greater China and Korea businesses, and by 90 basis points due to a noncash asset impairment charge. Operating margin was also negatively impacted by the 250 basis point decrease in gross margin that I described earlier. 
Operating expense as a percentage of sales was higher due to continued investments in our business, including retail store-related costs and depreciation expense associated with new store openings as well as continued costs relating to building our digital flagship platforms. We expect the inclusion of these international businesses, which currently carry a lower operating margin to negatively impact our operating margin for the balance of the year. Somewhat offsetting the compression from Greater China and Korea is a sequential improvement in gross margin from the first half of the year to the second half, and leveraging of our fixed operating expenses as we grow the retail revenues in the second half. For the second half of the year, we anticipate that the Retail segment operating margin to be approximately 20%. 
Wholesale operating margin was 27.0% compared to 28.3% in the prior year period. This was largely the result of a 210 basis point increase in operating expenses as a percent of revenue due to deleverage. This was partially offset by the aforementioned 80 basis point increase in our wholesale gross margins. 
Licensing operating margin was 31.2% compared to 37.7% in the prior year period. This was primarily due to increased costs associated with advertising as well as increased depreciation expense. 
Income taxes were $41.9 million in the quarter, and our effective tax rate was 20.7% as compared to 28.9% in the same period last year. The decrease in our effective tax rate was primarily due to [Audio Gap] $160.9 million for the second quarter and diluted earnings per share was $0.95. This compares to net income of $193.1 million or $1.01 per share -- per diluted share in the second quarter of fiscal 2016. 
Turning to our balance sheet. At the end of the quarter, cash and cash equivalents were $186.4 million. Inventory decreased 2.5% compared to the prior year due to careful inventory management and the anticipated decline in the U.S. wholesale business. 
We ended the quarter with $384.4 million of debt, which was recorded within short-term debt on a consolidated balance sheet. The debt consisted of borrowings under the company's revolving credit facilities. The amount available for future borrowings is approximately $615.9 million. 
During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 5 million shares totaling $250 million under our share repurchase program and have another $350 million of availability remaining on our most recent $1 billion authorization. This most recent share repurchase further demonstrates the company's commitment to returning value to shareholders and our confidence in our long-term growth potential. 
Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $52.3 million and were related to the build-out of new retail shops and shop-in-shops as well as investments in our distribution facilities, our corporate offices, digital flagships and other infrastructure improvements. We added 16 net new stores and converted 54 wholesale doors in the shop-in-shops globally in the second quarter. 
Overall, Michael Kors remains a leader in the fashion luxury marketplace. That said, our business has become increasingly challenged by macro factors that exist globally, including weakness in consumer spending. While we are excited about the strong response to new product across categories, we see a continuation of soft traffic trends and aggressive promotional activity in the U.S. market. Globally, our brand acceptance remains strong, but we are seeing weakness in tourism, trends, geopolitical issues and foreign currency fluctuations that contributed to top line pressure. Given these macro factors, we are reducing our fiscal 2017 revenue expectation to approximately $4.55 billion and expect a mid-single digit decrease in comp sales. Gross margin is now expected to be approximately 60%, modestly below our initial expectation as we anticipate that our reduced European sales outlook will result in a less favorable benefit from geographic mix than we initially anticipated. In addition, we expect operating expense as a percent of total revenue to be approximately 39.5%. These assumptions result in an operating margin of approximately 20.7%, excluding the $11.3 million in onetime transaction costs related to the acquisition of our Greater China licensee. On a GAAP basis, we expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $4.32 to $4.38, inclusive of the $11.3 million of onetime transaction cost. We expect diluted earnings per share to be in a range of $4.37 to $4.43 for the year, excluding the onetime cost noted earlier. This assumes a tax rate of approximately 21% and 169.5 million shares outstanding. 
For the third quarter, we expect total revenue to be between $1.365 billion and $1.38 billion, and a mid-single digit decrease in comp sales. We expect gross margin of approximately 60.5% driven by favorable geographic and channel mix shift. We plan to continue to invest in our international expansion, digital flagships and global infrastructure, and therefore, expect operating expense as a percent of total revenue to be approximately 35.5% resulting in an operating margin of approximately 25%. We expect diluted earnings per share to be in a range of $1.61 to $1.65. This assumes a tax rate of approximately 21% and 166.5 million weighted average shares outstanding. 
Capital expenditures are expected to total approximately $250 million for the fiscal year 2017. And we will focus on ongoing investments in global digital strategies and omnichannel capabilities, global retail expansion, including approximately 15 new stores in the Americas, 25 in Europe and 30 in Asia; the conversion of approximately 215 wholesale shop-in-shops globally; and the company's global distribution infrastructure information systems and corporate facilities. 
In conclusion, we remain focused on the initiatives that we had in place to drive sequential improvement in our business in the second half of fiscal 2017 and sales and earnings growth over the long term. 
I will now turn the call back to John for closing remarks."

We will also be focused on helping our customers find the perfect gift for everyone in their lives through a number of jet-set in-store personal shopping events. Our Michael Kors stores will certainly be the place to be this holiday season.

And then Joe, I just wanted to follow up on the margin commentary. I'm wondering if you can talk to us about how we should think about Retail segment margins over the medium term? Where do you expect them to land? And wholesale margins over the medium term, where do you think they end up normalizing?"

There's 2 separate things that are going on for us, we believe, in the total retail environment.

There's 2 separate things that are going on for us, we believe, in the total retail environment. First, there's no question, in North America, we probably suffer worst than many of our competitors because we have a very large international business that we had some very nice growth with, in particular, European tourists coming to the United States and South American tourists coming to the United States, to a degree people from Mexico as well. So most of that business has declined dramatically and we have not seen any return, and it's getting probably closer to the bottom. But there's still more headwinds in there, and obviously, not as volatile as it was 12 months ago. So we're really looking at that as one issue that we have to deal with. And the second issue is in North America, there's been a very, very strong amount of promotional activities generated from competitors and from certain other channels of distribution. So we -- and I'm going to address the second one first. We've, as you know, announced that starting on February 1, we're really focused on reducing the amount of promotional activity that we're going to be involved in as a brand. We think that's the right thing to do for the health of the business. Once again, this past quarter, we saw a mid-single digit increases in our overall accessories business in units. So once again, customers buying Michael Kors, that's not the issue. The issue is that the price of our sale has been denigrated and it's been denigrated because of promotional activity. We believe that, that if we focus on average transaction value and get that up and less on the unit, amount of unit transactions, we're going to have a healthier business. So to that end, our best-selling handbag group this Fall season is Mercer, which we commented about in our remarks earlier. And that product, by the way, is not on promotion anywhere. So we set it out as a nonpromotional item and it is working. It's working really well in every channel of distribution for us. So it shows that the customer is absolutely willing to pay when they understand that things can't be put on promotional on a regular basis. We will have for the spring season 5 groups that will not only fit into that same category, so they will be excluded even from the authorized sale periods that we will have in Michael Kors. So we're going to be focused on average transaction value and how we get that up. But at the same point in time, those groups will be approximately, on a medium-sized handbag, $295, which we think is a really key price points. And we know it's a key price point. We know she's responding and responding in very large quantities. So we think we can create amazing luxury product with fashion sensibility and deliver to her at a price point that, that is something that she's going to find compelling. So we believe that, that will be a number 1 driver for us. Number two, again, the active footwear category has been something that's been explosive for us and we're getting great traction in that category. And third, we're very pleased with what's happening with our smartwatch business. We are probably the #2 player out in the marketplace today, clearly, with Apple being #1 and the response has been extraordinary. We are selling out a product. We're actually in a position where we're not able to fill all the demand that is happening around the globe. And so we think those combination of factors will begin to really start to impact the business as we head through the calendar fourth quarter, our fiscal third quarter and then into first quarter. That all being said, you know that we've reduced our wholesale shipments in preparation of this. And so that's one of the reasons why we've revised our guidance, as I think, we have a better handle on where that's all going to land now. And I think the brand will be in a much better position to grow from there. And then lastly is our men's business, which as we commented earlier, we're very pleased with the initial results both on a sportswear. And I think we're being a little surprised on how successful the leather piece of the business is. It's really taking off very quickly and we're trying to capitalize and moving that into more locations even doors, in our own chain, where we might not already -- or we might not be putting the full assortment of men's in. So we still see opportunity for growth, and that will absolutely be in our projections for next year. So we're feeling good about that. I'll turn it over to Joe now."

But they are making a significant dent in the decline. And we're just, I think we are in a situation where we can't fill all the demand right now, so we really don't need how high is high. We also will have to wait until we get through again, calendar fourth quarter, which will be a very big gifting opportunity for us to see how this really impacts the sales. We also have other products that are going to be launched right behind the smartwatch. And so we think that there's going to be more technology innovation coming into this category. And I think you heard me say before that we think long-term, the fashion watch category will be revolutionized and may even ultimately eat into the whole tracker market, as you know it today, where watches will have the same capabilities as tracker, so you can have a smartwatch and then you can have watches that will just have less functionality and not be quite as expensive. So we're very excited. I want to thank our partners, both Fossil and Google for everything that they've done to make this such a successful launch for the company and not just domestically, but worldwide. These watches are selling all over the world and so I think we're just at the very beginning of something that's exciting. And the last thing, I would say, is we're bringing -- people are coming into the store who we've never seen before, who have been reading about this either from bloggers or seeing them through our social campaigns, and it absolutely is drawing a new and different customer to our stores. So we're terribly excited about that. And it even kind of leads into this fun little collaboration that we're doing with Fuji on the Instax cameras, they just hit the stores, and they really doing extremely well as well. So again we're always have been -- Michael has always been focused being a company that leads from a modernity standpoint and we think this just further add credence to what we're doing with the customer with these products."

I think what is important for us in terms of, again, I think you've seen the way we've managed inventory from the days that we were growing it double-digit to now where we've slower growth. I think we've been very good as a company in terms of managing inventory. I think the biggest issue for us is, we want to continue to introduce newness. That's what's going to keep the customer and engage and excited with our brand, and we've always done that. The issue for us is really more about getting the transaction value back up because when the customer sees our product and not just our products, even with our competitors, the things are constantly being put on sale, you lose credibility with that customer, that they you should see something new and want to buy it and not just wait until an event happens. So I think that's going to be our major focus next year. It won't be an easy task, I don't want to mislead you, it's not something that happens overnight. But if you really care about your brand long-term and you believe that having less units in the marketplace and a higher transaction value is a long-term strategy, then we believe we'll be successful."

So I think that'",448,"Okay, Randy, first off, good afternoon. It's going be a little hard to answer that question because there was I think 3 or 4 in there. Let me take a stab at it though. We are looking to have AUR increase somewhere in the 10% to 15% range. So I think that's the first place to start. And that's been about the degradation that has taken place over the past let's call it 12 months. And I think I've commented to you all before, too, not only our unit sales up in our own stores and in our department store partners, but our actual consumers who -- new consumers coming to the brand is up as well. So again, we -- between that, between our brand awareness studies, et cetera, we don't see an issue that there's a health of the brand issue, more people are buying it, more people are engaged, more people are actually coming to our company through our own websites and our partners' websites. So that's not the issue. The issue is that when you look at all that and then you got, let's say, on the high side 15% AUR decline, that really -- you can't make up that difference. So that would be our goal. So that would kind of put the units down to that kind of number, somewhere between the 10% and 15%, and then we hope we'd make that up with AUR. And we're going to do that in my earlier answer to Kimberly, not just through the fact that we're going to limit -- exit the friends and family sales and all those types of things. But also, really creating a different sense of excitement around the value of the product. Again, we know she is buying crossbodies and tote, et cetera, from us and she believes that, that's a handbag when she buys it. She didn't say, well, I only bought a small bag because I have less money, that's what the fashion is today. We believe that we can create some excitement with her, especially in medium-sized bags at a higher AUR than what we're currently selling but still with great value for her, and very, very consistent with where we've been as a brand overall. That $300 handbag price point for us has been a very strong price point and we'd like to see a greater amount of our mix shift go that area, and so that's why I said we'll have these 5 groups in the spring season that we're terribly excited about and should really generate some significant volume if the Mercer collection in particular is any indication of what we've seen happening."

And we do think that in North America, we're starting to see some signs of, I won't call it the bottom, but some signs of the precipitous declines starting to level off slightly. That's obviously being tempered by what we're seeing in Europe, which has been very difficult over the last 2 quarters. So we got to get that straightened out.

Kors Concierge is in a limited amount of the stores right now, and literally, it's only been up for about, I think, 3 or 4 weeks.

Kors Concierge is in a limited amount of the stores right now, and literally, it's only been up for about, I think, 3 or 4 weeks. You might -- you may have seen it in there about 60 days ago or so but the full capabilities of it were really not available for the sales associates until just a few weeks ago. So it's too early to tell what and how that's going to impact the transactions inside the stores. But very clearly, it will give the selling associates the ability to see the full breadth of the product that's available through not only our e-commerce capabilities, but it will also give them a view of all the product that inside the chain in stores. And most importantly, it gives them the capability, as you probably have seen, of really being a styling consultant and wardrobing the customer in multiple different ways that are all selected from Michael, himself, personally, and our design teams and how they see people being put together. So we think it's an incredible tool that sales associates are going to be able to really engage with their customers with. And you combine that with some of the geo-targeting technology that's available from some of our partners, and we're able to have much more targeted communications with the local customer, when I'm talking local, it might be 5 blocks of a store if in your New York City or might be within 2 or 3, 4 miles of a stores out in Manhasset [ph], Long Island. So we think that given the technology capabilities, the clientele-end capabilities and now the styling capabilities, it's going to give our sales associates a lot more to work with, with the customer. And today, that's really what it's all about. You heard us talk earlier, our conversion rates in the stores continue to rise. So again, customers, when they come to the door are engaging with us, that's not the problem. The problem is how do we get them in and again we're hoping this technology as well as some things that we're coupling with that are going to be helpful for us. We're also piloting click and collect, which is a limited amount of the stores, just went live a few days ago. So that capability will be in place also, which is another reason to have our customers come into our stores and engage with our sales associates. So of this heavy lifting that we've been doing from a technology standpoint, the great new is we're really going to be in place to start to reap the benefits of those investments."

Lindsay, the destock that's happening is really starting to happen now because the retailers need to reduce their inventories in light of what our new policy is going to be during. They obviously are lowering their sales plans because their current model is to do more business with promotional activity, so that's in conflict or contrast to what we think is the right thing to do going forward. And again, there's been nothing but complete cooperation from every one of our retail partners in the United States, but we're a significant part of them and of their businesses. So they need to rightsize their inventories accordingly and we're in complete support of that. So sell-throughs are pretty similar to where they've been historically, but remember all the promotional activity is going on as we speak. So none of that's change, and none of that will change until the end of January. So we're expecting a fairly promotional holiday season but once we get beyond that, we're feeling that we've got a different way of looking at how the business can be built. And we're hoping that, that's going to be looked upon at a very positively by our consumer."

Joe indicated that we've got a 270 point basis -- basis point increase driven by the e-commerce. So our e-commerce traffic is up strong double digits. We're seeing the same thing happen in Europe. The minute you turn on e-commerce and, as I said to you before, we're very pleased with what's happening so far, it impacts the full priced business. So we think that part of this is a shift to our own e-commerce sites. And part of it is obviously people, in general, shopping less in the mall channel just because of all the activity that goes on, on e-commerce sites around North America and now you're starting to see the same thing happen in many larger European countries as well."

We believe that the North American handbag business is roughly flat, may be up a couple of points in total. And we don't see that trend changing much. So I think that as it relates to us, we obviously have a fairly large market share in that category. And our growth rate in handbags in North America will be low single digit if we do our job right. And that will be more in dollars than in units. So that's how we view that. 
And then the watch category, we do believe that the decline is going to lessen. As I said earlier, we've already seen that when you add the combined smartwatch and fashion watch categories together. And we don't know how much that will stop declining but there are some very good indications there. 
We clearly need to have other categories working inside of our store. If you take those 2 categories and say, 1 may still be in the, let's pretend it's high single-digit decline and one is flattish to up a few points, we need other categories to work and you're going to be seeing that happen. We're certainly taking the shoe areas inside of our stores and making them significantly larger. Also by the way, the shoe business has been positively impacted by our e-commerce because we're able to have wider assortments online and sales associates are able to do sends, to company -- to customers' homes by virtue of the breadth that we have online. And some of that category could be a very nice increase for us. We'll be making some announcements about some jewelry on the next call, some strategies that we have around jewelry for our around freestanding stores and that we think is also going to be very nice additional category of business for us. So we're going to be looking at other things. And then of course, men's has great opportunity for us. So we're taking certain stores, and that will be a next round of tests for us, that currently have, we believe, space to add the menswear to in its full capacity, so that would be Tyson's Corner and Aventura, Toronto, there's going to be a handful of stores that we believe we can add menswear to in their existing footprint. And that could be additional volume for us. So our goal would be, for next year, to see our North American comps kind of flatten out and have comp store increases in our international business. And so we do see growth, and that will be driven by, in certain cases, in our international markets, more in handbag where we can grow market share and in our North American markets where will come from some other categories. So I hope that helpful."

Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Michael Kors' second quarter 2017 earnings call. I am joining you today from Tokyo, which is a market that we believe has great opportunity for the growth of the Michael Kors brand. 
Now turning to a review of our second quarter performance. Our results exceeded our expectations in the second quarter. We continued to deliver innovative luxury fashion product and expanded our brand footprint worldwide. We were extremely pleased with the successful launch of our MICHAEL KORS ACCESS wearable technology line of watches and fitness trackers as well as the debut of our Wonderlust fragrance. In addition, we were pleased with the great response to our new fall handbag collections, which exceeded our expectations. Our new iconic Mercer collection, emerged as a global bestseller and our Brooklyn collection set the fashion tone for the season with the introduction of Grommet hardware detailing. We also achieved strong sales growth in our menswear business during the quarter, and we continued to see this category as an area of future growth for the company. 
In North America, our digital flagships continued to deliver double-digit sales increases, and we were pleased with the successful launch of our European digital flagships. In addition, we seamlessly completed the integration of our recently acquired business in Greater China. This region represents a strong growth opportunity for the company. I am very proud of the work our team has done to deliver on these strategies. I believe these accomplishments set the stage for future growth. 
Let me now turn to a review of our quarterly results. For the second quarter, total revenue reached $1.1 billion and earnings per share was $0.95, both of which came in ahead of our expectations. [indiscernible] comparable store sales decreased 5.4%. While our comps in North America decreased in the mid-single digit range for the quarter, overall, we were pleased to see sequential improvement driven by our strong fashion product offerings. 
Turning to our international business. We were disappointed in our results in Europe, which saw low double-digit comp decline. In Asia, we saw a mid-single digit comp increase. Please note that our comp in this region currently reflects only Japan as the remainder of our Asia business is not yet included in the comp base. 
Our North American digital flagships continued to perform well during the quarter with strong double-digit comp growth. We expect the momentum in our digital flagships to continue as we further invest in growing this channel. 
In the Americas, retail stores' conversion rates increased in the high single-digit range, which was offset by a continued decline in traffic. As I mentioned earlier, we saw positive response to our new handbag collections, women's small leather goods, Michael Kors ACCESS smartwatches and fitness trackers, Wonderlust fragrance and our men's bags and small leather goods. The growth of these categories was more than offset by a decrease in our handbag sales and a double-digit decline in our watch sales. 
In Europe, traffic continued to decline in certain major markets. We believe that the softness in this business was due to continued consumer uncertainty related to Brexit and the lingering concern following the terrorist attacks in Belgium, France and Germany as well as other geopolitical issues. That said, we continued to believe that the Michael Kors brand remains strong in Europe. 
We are committed to investing in our digital flagship strategy to ensure we are positioned to capture the growth opportunity in this region. To that end, we launched our digital flagship businesses in the U.K. and Germany at the end of the quarter and we have since launched digital flagships in France, Switzerland, Spain and Italy. While it is still very early days for each of these businesses, we are pleased to have completed the launches and now have the platforms in place that will enable us to deepen our engagement with our consumers in these countries. We also plan to have e-commerce capabilities in 16 additional European countries in spring of 2017. 
In our Asia region, we saw increases in sales of 96%. This was driven by the addition of the China business as well as a mid-single digit comparable store sales increase in Japan. We were very pleased to see strong sales growth in China as our store network expands and our brand awareness increases. 
Looking ahead, we continue to believe that Asia represents a significant growth opportunity for the company and will ultimately reach $1 billion in revenue. 
Turning to our Wholesale segment. Revenues declined 18%. In the Americas, we saw a decline of 22%. We are strategically reducing our sell-in to department stores in order to protect our brand and margins in this channel through disciplined inventory control and reduced promotional activity, which has impacted our sales in this segment. We expect this trend will continue through the remainder of this year as we reduce both inventory flow and promotions. 
In Europe, we saw a 3% increase in wholesale sales. This growth is lower than historical trends as we are being negatively impacted by a mix shift towards crossbodies and small leather goods, which carry a lower AUR. This is the same fashion trend that started more than 1 year ago in North America. We anticipate this trend will continue to impact our wholesale sales in this region for the balance of the year. 
In Asia, the 43% decline in wholesale sales was primarily attributed to the shift of China and South Korea businesses to our company-owned Retail segment. 
In our men's business, we delivered solid performance in the second quarter, and we ended the quarter with 244 sportswear and leather goods shop-in-shops within our wholesale doors globally. Our North American and European wholesale partners remain excited to have a major new designer menswear line to offer to their customers. And we are confident that our men's business will be an important contributor to our future wholesale growth. 
In our Licensing segment, revenue declined during the quarter as we continued to see softness in the fashion watch category. That said, performance in our MICHAEL KORS ACCESS smartwear collection as well as our fitness trackers, which debuted in September, are exceeding our expectations. Importantly, our ACCESS product line is engaging both our loyal watch customers as well as attracting new customers in a younger demographic. Our Bradshaw and Dylan smartwatches in signature rose gold, gold, and silver platings are quickly becoming our most popular styles. The launch was supported by a significant marketing campaign across our global print, digital and social platforms. We also simultaneously created interactive experiences both on our digital, flagship and in-store to educate and excite consumers bringing the category and its benefits to life. To keep the momentum going through holiday, we will continue to roll out a comprehensive marketing program across print and social media. And we'll be featuring the product as one of our must-have gifts in our holiday gift guide. We also saw strong response to the debut of our Wonderlust fragrance, which came in ahead of plan during the quarter. We believe that this new pillar in our fragrance collection will drive further growth in this category going forward. 
In conclusion, our focus remains on executing on our multiple pillars for revenue growth, while maintaining our leadership position in the global luxury market, consistently delivering innovative fashion products to our customers and enhancing consumer engagement with the brand worldwide. 
Our key new handbag groups are performing very well. Our consumers respond favorably to the seasonal colors and novelty design elements featured in the collection. We're also seeing continued growth in our women's active shoe assortment and are encouraged by the initial results we have seen from the rollout of our men's offerings, both of which are key areas of growth for the company. 
We are also pleased with the strong momentum in our digital flagships, and we look forward to launching in Japan and China as well as additional countries in Europe within the next year. 
While there were some accomplishments that we were pleased with the during the quarter, our results continued to be impacted by the ongoing decline in mall traffic, the reduction in tourism in certain major cities and our strategic decision to reduce sell-in of inventory in the U.S. wholesale channel. We are in the process of rebalancing our business to increase the average transaction value in our retail stores as well as in our wholesale channel, and reduce the total number of units sold in the marketplace in North America. While these actions will result in short-term revenue declines, we believe they will enhance our brand equity over the long term. We will use this rebalancing as an opportunity to emphasize and extend other categories in our lifestyle portfolio of products as well as to expand our business internationally. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Joe to review our financials."

Total revenue was $1.09 billion compared to $1.13 billion in the prior year quarter. In our Retail segment, net sales increased 12.1% driven primarily by the addition of 198 net new stores since the second quarter of last year, including 137 stores associated with our recent acquisitions of Greater China and South Korea. 
Comp stores -- comp sales decreased 5.4% reflecting a mid-single digit comp decrease in North America and a low double-digit decline in Europe, partially offset by a mid-single digit comp increase in Asia and strong performance of our digital flagships. Our North American digital flagship sales contributed 270 basis points to our North American comp performance in the quarter. 
In our Wholesale segment, net sales declined 18.4% due to lower sales in our accessories, womenswear and footwear businesses, partially offset by an increase in our men's business. We saw a 22% decline in our wholesale business in the Americas region as we remain disciplined with the amount of inventory we have shipped into that channel. We also saw a single-digit increase in our European sales. In addition, we had a decrease in Asia, which primarily reflects the shift of our Greater China and South Korean businesses to the Retail segment during the quarter. 
In our Licensing segment, revenue decreased 10.2%. This was primarily due to the continued softness of the fashion watch and jewelry categories as well as lower revenues from our geographic licensing arrangement in Asia as a result of our recent acquisitions of our licensee operations. 
Gross margin expanded 40 basis points to 59.2% due to a favorable channel mix shift towards the Retail segment. Gross margin increased 80 basis points in our Wholesale segment primarily due to a change in the geographic mix. Gross margin declined 250 basis points in the Retail segment attributable to higher markdowns as compared to last year. 
Total operating expense grew 12.7%, and increased 590 basis points to 40.5% of total revenue. The increase was primarily due to the inclusion of our businesses in Greater China and South Korea, our investment in new stores, e-commerce and omnichannel capabilities, new shop-in-shops and the infrastructure improvements. 
Income from operations was $203.7 million, or 18.7% of total revenue as compared to 24.2% of total revenue in the same period last year. 
Retail operating margin was 11.7% compared to 18.8% in the prior year period. Operating margin was negatively impacted by 170 basis points from the inclusion of our newly acquired Greater China and Korea businesses, and by 90 basis points due to a noncash asset impairment charge. Operating margin was also negatively impacted by the 250 basis point decrease in gross margin that I described earlier. 
Operating expense as a percentage of sales was higher due to continued investments in our business, including retail store-related costs and depreciation expense associated with new store openings as well as continued costs relating to building our digital flagship platforms. We expect the inclusion of these international businesses, which currently carry a lower operating margin to negatively impact our operating margin for the balance of the year. Somewhat offsetting the compression from Greater China and Korea is a sequential improvement in gross margin from the first half of the year to the second half, and leveraging of our fixed operating expenses as we grow the retail revenues in the second half. For the second half of the year, we anticipate that the Retail segment operating margin to be approximately 20%. 
Wholesale operating margin was 27.0% compared to 28.3% in the prior year period. This was largely the result of a 210 basis point increase in operating expenses as a percent of revenue due to deleverage. This was partially offset by the aforementioned 80 basis point increase in our wholesale gross margins. 
Licensing operating margin was 31.2% compared to 37.7% in the prior year period. This was primarily due to increased costs associated with advertising as well as increased depreciation expense. 
Income taxes were $41.9 million in the quarter, and our effective tax rate was 20.7% as compared to 28.9% in the same period last year. The decrease in our effective tax rate was primarily due to [Audio Gap] $160.9 million for the second quarter and diluted earnings per share was $0.95. This compares to net income of $193.1 million or $1.01 per share -- per diluted share in the second quarter of fiscal 2016. 
Turning to our balance sheet. At the end of the quarter, cash and cash equivalents were $186.4 million. Inventory decreased 2.5% compared to the prior year due to careful inventory management and the anticipated decline in the U.S. wholesale business. 
We ended the quarter with $384.4 million of debt, which was recorded within short-term debt on a consolidated balance sheet. The debt consisted of borrowings under the company's revolving credit facilities. The amount available for future borrowings is approximately $615.9 million. 
During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 5 million shares totaling $250 million under our share repurchase program and have another $350 million of availability remaining on our most recent $1 billion authorization. This most recent share repurchase further demonstrates the company's commitment to returning value to shareholders and our confidence in our long-term growth potential. 
Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $52.3 million and were related to the build-out of new retail shops and shop-in-shops as well as investments in our distribution facilities, our corporate offices, digital flagships and other infrastructure improvements. We added 16 net new stores and converted 54 wholesale doors in the shop-in-shops globally in the second quarter. 
Overall, Michael Kors remains a leader in the fashion luxury marketplace. That said, our business has become increasingly challenged by macro factors that exist globally, including weakness in consumer spending. While we are excited about the strong response to new product across categories, we see a continuation of soft traffic trends and aggressive promotional activity in the U.S. market. Globally, our brand acceptance remains strong, but we are seeing weakness in tourism, trends, geopolitical issues and foreign currency fluctuations that contribute to top line pressure. Given these macro factors, we are reducing our fiscal 2017 revenue expectation to approximately $4.55 billion and expect a mid-single digit decrease in comp sales. Gross margin is now expected to be approximately 60%, modestly below our initial expectation as we anticipate that our reduced European sales outlook will result in a less favorable benefit from geographic mix than we initially anticipated. In addition, we expect operating expense as a percent of total revenue to be approximately 39.5%. These assumptions result in an operating margin of approximately 20.7%, excluding the $11.3 million in onetime transaction costs related to the acquisition of our Greater China licensee. On a GAAP basis, we expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $4.32 to $4.38, inclusive of the $11.3 million of onetime transaction costs. We expect diluted earnings per share to be in a range of $4.37 to $4.43 for the year, excluding the onetime cost noted earlier. This assumes a tax rate of approximately 21% and 169.5 million shares outstanding. 
For the third quarter, we expect total revenue to be between $1.365 billion and $1.38 billion, and a mid-single digit decrease in comp sales. We expect gross margin of approximately 60.5% driven by favorable geographic and channel mix shift. We plan to continue to invest in our international expansion, digital flagships and global infrastructure, and therefore, expect operating expense as a percent of total revenue to be approximately 35.5% resulting in an operating margin of approximately 25%. We expect diluted earnings per share to be in a range of $1.61 to $1.65. This assumes a tax rate of approximately 21% and 166.5 million weighted average shares outstanding. 
Capital expenditures are expected to total approximately $250 million for the fiscal year 2017. And we will focus on ongoing investments in global digital strategies and omnichannel capabilities, global retail expansion, including approximately 15 new stores in the Americas, 25 in Europe and 30 in Asia; the conversion of approximately 215 wholesale shop-in-shops globally; and the company's global distribution infrastructure information systems and corporate facilities. 
In conclusion, we remain focused on the initiatives that we had in place to drive sequential improvement in our business in the second half of fiscal 2017 and sales and earnings growth over the long term. 
I will now turn the call back to John for closing remarks."

We are also excited about our holiday season as we expect to continue to benefit from the recent new handbag collection launches, the MICHAEL KORS ACCESS wearable technology line and our new Wonderlust fragrance. In addition, we have strong holiday gifting programs, including the Michael Kors Fuji Instax collaboration and our launch of the custom Kors experience on our digital flagship where customers can create their own personalized handbags and small leather goods with monograms, stickers, charms, keychains and interchangeable flaps. We plan to drive brand engagement with exciting new marketing programs positioning Michael Kors as the gifting destination this holiday season. Our #GiveKorsCampaign featuring model Taylor Hill will be comprised of a robust gifting experience across our digital flagships and catalogs as well as social, email and print marketing campaigns. We will also be focused on helping our customers find the perfect gift for everyone in their lives through a number of jet-set in-store personal shopping events. Our Michael Kors stores will certainly be the place to be this holiday season. 
Despite the expected impact on our near-term results from the previously mentioned macro challenges, we remain confident in our ability to drive long-term growth and increase shareholder value.

And then Joe, I just wanted to follow up on the margin commentary. I'm wondering if you can talk to us about how we should think about Retail segment margins over the medium term? Where do you expect them to land? And wholesale margins over the medium term, where do you think they end up normalizing?"

There's 2 separate things that are going on for us, we believe, in the total retail environment. First, there's no question, in North America, we probably suffered worse than many of our competitors because we have a very large intern",809,"Thank you, Kimberly. There's 2 separate things that are going on for us, we believe, in the total retail environment. First, there's no question, in North America, we probably suffered worse than many of our competitors because we have a very large international business that we have had some very nice growth with, in particular, European tourists coming to the United States and South American tourists coming to the United States, to a degree people from Mexico as well. So most of that business has declined dramatically and we have not seen any return, and it's getting probably closer to the bottom. But there's still more headwinds in there, and obviously, not as volatile as it was 12 months ago. So we're really looking at that as one issue that we have to deal with. And the second issue is in North America, there's been a very, very strong amount of promotional activities generated from competitors and from certain other channels of distribution. So we -- and I'm going to address the second one first. We've, as you know, announced that starting on February 1, we're really focused on reducing the amount of promotional activity that we're going to be involved in as a brand. We think that's the right thing to do for the health of the business. Once again, this past quarter, we saw a mid-single digit increases in our overall accessories business in units. So once again, customers buying Michael Kors, that's not the issue. The issue is that the price of our sale has been denigrated and it's been denigrated because of promotional activity. We believe that, that if we focus on average transaction value and get that up and less on the unit, amount of unit transactions, we're going to have a healthier business. So to that end, our best-selling handbag group this Fall season is Mercer, which we commented about in our remarks earlier. And that product, by the way, is not on promotion anywhere. So we set it out as a nonpromotional item and it is working. It's working really well in every channel of distribution for us. So it shows that the customer is absolutely willing to pay when they understand that things can't be put on promotion on a regular basis. We will have for the spring season 5 groups that will not only fit into that same category, so they will be excluded even from the authorized sale periods that we will have in Michael Kors. So we're going to be focused on average transaction value and how we get that up. But at the same point in time, those groups will be approximately, on a medium-sized handbag, $295, which we think is a really key price point. And we know it's a key price point. We know she's responding and responding in very large quantities. So we think we can create amazing luxury product with fashion sensibility and deliver to her at a price point that, that is something that she's going to find compelling. So we believe that, that will be a number 1 driver for us. Number two, again, the active footwear category has been something that's been explosive for us and we're getting great traction in that category. And third, we're very pleased with what's happening with our smartwatch business. We are probably the #2 player out in the marketplace today, clearly, with Apple being #1 and the response has been extraordinary. We are selling out a product. We're actually in a position where we're not able to fill all the demand that is happening around the globe. And so we think those combination of factors will begin to really start to impact the business as we head through the calendar fourth quarter, our fiscal third quarter and then into first quarter. That all being said, you know that we've reduced our wholesale shipments in preparation of this. And so that's one of the reasons why we've revised our guidance, as I think, we have a better handle on where that's all going to land now. And I think the brand will be in a much better position to grow from there. And then lastly is our men's business, which as we commented earlier, we're very pleased with the initial results both on a sportswear. And I think we're being a little surprised on how successful the leather piece of the business is. It's really taking off very quickly and we're trying to capitalize and moving that into more locations even doors, in our own chain, where we might not already -- or we might not be putting the full assortment of men's in. So we still see opportunity for growth, and that will absolutely be in our projections for next year. So we're feeling good about that. I'll turn it over to Joe now."

But they are making a significant dent in the decline. And we're just, I think we are in a situation where we can't fill all the demand right now, so we really don't need how high is high. We also will have to wait until we get through again, calendar fourth quarter, which will be a very big gifting opportunity for us to see how this really impacts the sales. We also have other products that are going to be launched right behind the smartwatch. And so we think that there's going to be more technology and innovation coming into this category. And I think you heard me say before that we think long-term, the fashion watch category will be revolutionized and may even ultimately eat into the whole tracker market, as you know it today, where watches will have the same capabilities as trackers, so you can have a smartwatch and then you can have watches that will just have less functionality and not be quite as expensive. So we're very excited. I want to thank our partners, both Fossil and Google for everything that they've done to make this such a successful launch for the company and not just domestically, but worldwide. These watches are selling all over the world and so I think we're just at the very beginning of something that's exciting. And the last thing, I would say, is we're bringing -- people are coming into the store who we've never seen before, who have been reading about this either from bloggers or seeing it through our social campaigns, and it absolutely is drawing a new and different customer to our stores. So we're terribly excited about that. And it even kind of leads into this fun little collaboration that we're doing with Fuji on the Instax cameras, they just hit the stores, and they really doing extremely well, as well. So again we're always have been -- Michael has always been focused being a company that leads from a modernity standpoint and we think this just further add credence to what we're doing with the customer with these products."

I think what is important for us in terms of, again, I think you've seen the way we've managed inventory from the days that we were growing it double-digit to now where we've got slower growth. I think we've been very good as a company in terms of managing inventory. I think the biggest issue for us is, we want to continue to introduce newness. That's what's going to keep the customer and engage and excited with our brand, and we've always done that. The issue for us is really more about getting the transaction value back up because when the customer sees our product and not just our products, even with our competitors, the things are constantly being put on sale, you lose a credibility with that customer, that they you should see something new and want to buy it and not just wait until an event happens. So I think that's going to be our major focus next year. It won't be an easy task, I don't want to mislead you, it's not something that happens overnight. But if you really care about your brand long-term and you believe that having less units in the marketplace and a higher transaction value is a long-term strategy, then we believe we'll be successful."

So I think that'",449,"Okay, Randy, first off, good afternoon. It's going be a little hard to answer that question because there was I think 3 or 4 in there. Let me take a stab at it though. We are looking to have AUR increase somewhere in the 10% to 15% range. So I think that's the first place to start. And that's been about the degradation that has taken place over the past let's call it 12 months. And I think I've commented to you all before, too, not only are unit sales up in our own stores and in our department store partners, but our actual consumers who -- new consumers coming to the brand is up as well. So again, we -- between that, between our brand awareness studies, et cetera, we don't see an issue that there's a health of the brand issue, more people are buying it, more people are engaged, more people are actually coming to our company through our own websites and our partners' websites. So that's not the issue. The issue is that when you look at all that and then you got, let's say, on the high side 15% AUR decline, that really -- you can't make up that difference. So that would be our goal. So that would kind of put the units down to that kind of number, somewhere between the 10% and 15%, and then we hope we'd make that up with AUR. And we're going to do that in my earlier answer to Kimberly, not just through the fact that we're going to limit -- exit the friends and family sales and all those types of things. But also, really creating a different sense of excitement around the value of the product. Again, we know she is buying crossbodies and totes, et cetera, from us and she believes that, that's a handbag when she buys it. She didn't say, well, I only bought a small bag because I have less money, that's what the fashion is today. We believe that we can create some excitement with her, especially in medium-sized bags at a higher AUR than what we're currently selling but still with great value for her, and very, very consistent with where we've been as a brand overall. That $300 handbag price point for us has been a very strong price point and we'd like to see a greater amount of our mix shift go into that area, and so that's why I said we'll have these 5 groups in the spring season that we're terribly excited about and should really generate some significant volume if the Mercer collection in particular is any indication of what we've seen happen."

That's obviously being tempered by what we're seeing in Europe, which has been very difficult over the last 2 quarters. So we got to get that straightened out.

Kors Concierge is in a limited amount of the stores right now, and literally, it's only been up for about, I think, 3 or 4 weeks. You might -- you may have seen it in there about 60 days ago or so but the full capabilities of it were really not available for the sales associates until just a few weeks ago. So it's too early to tell what and how that's going to impact the transactions inside the stores. But very clearly, it will give the selling associate the ability to see the full breadth of the product that's available through not only our e-commerce capabilities, but it will also give them a view of all the product that inside the chain in stores. And most importantly, it gives them the capability, as you probably have seen, of really being a styling consultant and wardrobing the customer in multiple different ways that are all selected from Michael, himself, personally, and our design teams and how they see people being put together. So we think it's an incredible tool that sales associates are going to be able to really engage with their customers with. And you combine that with some of the geo-targeting technology that's available from some of our partners, and we're able to have much more targeted communication with the local customer, when I'm talking local, it might be 5 blocks of a store if in your New York City or might be within 2 or 3, 4 miles of a stores out in Manhasset, Long Island. So we think that given the technology capabilities, the clientele-end capabilities and now the styling capabilities, it's going to give our sales associates a lot more to work with, with the customer. And today, that's really what it's all about. You heard us talk earlier, our conversion rates in the stores continue to rise. So again, customers, when they come through the door are engaging with us, that's not the problem. The problem is how do we get them in and again we're hoping this technology as well as some things that we're coupling with that are going to be helpful for us. We're also piloting click and collect, which is a limited amount of the stores, just went live a few days ago. So that capability will be in place also, which is another reason to have our customers come into our stores and engage with our sales associates. So all this heavy lifting that we've been doing from a technology standpoint, the great news is we're really going to be in place to start to reap the benefits of those investments."

Lindsay, the destock that's happening is really starting to happen now because the retailers need to reduce their inventories in light of what our new policy is going to be. They obviously are lowering their sales plans because their current model is to do more business with promotional activity, so that's in conflict or contrast to what we think is the right thing to do going forward. And again, there's been nothing but complete cooperation from every one of our retail partners in the United States, but we're a significant part of many of their businesses. So they need to rightsize their inventories accordingly and we're in complete support of that. So sell-throughs are pretty similar to where they've been historically, but remember all the promotional activity is going on as we speak. So none of that's changed, and none of that will change until the end of January. So we're expecting a fairly promotional holiday season. But once we get beyond that, we're feeling that we've got a different way of looking at how the business can be built. And we're hoping that, that's going to be looked upon at in very positive way by our end consumer."

Joe indicated that we've got a 270 point basis -- basis point increase driven by the e-commerce. So our e-commerce traffic is up strong double digits. We're seeing the same thing happen in Europe. The minute you turn on e-commerce and, as I said to you before, we're very pleased with what's happening so far, it impacts the full price business. So we think that part of this is a shift to our own e-commerce sites. And part of it is obviously people, in general, shopping less in the mall channel just because of all the activity that goes on, on e-commerce sites around North America and now you're starting to see the same thing happen in many large European countries as well."

We believe that the North American handbag business is roughly flat, may be up a couple of points in total. And we don't see that trend changing much. So I think that as it relates to us, we obviously have a fairly large market share in that category. And our growth rate in handbags in North America will be low single digit if we do our job right. And that will be more in dollars than in units. So that's how we view that. 
And then the watch category, we do believe that the decline is going to lessen. As I said earlier, we've already seen that when you add the combined smartwatch and fashion watch categories together. And we don't know how much that will stop declining but there are some very good indications there. 
We clearly need to have other categories working inside of our store. If you take those 2 categories and say, 1 may still be in the, let's pretend it's high single-digit decline and one is flattish to up a few points, we need other categories to work and you're going to be seeing that happen. We're certainly taking the shoe areas inside of our stores and making them significantly larger. Also by the way, the shoe business has been positively impacted by our e-commerce because we're able to have wider assortments online and sales associates are able to do sends, to company -- to customers' homes by virtue of the breadth that we have online. And some of that category could be a very nice increase for us. We'll be making some announcements about some jewelry on the next call, some strategies that we have around jewelry for our own freestanding stores and that we think is also going to be very nice additional category of business for us. So we're going to be looking at other things. And then of course, men's has great opportunity for us. So we're taking certain stores, and that will be a next round of tests for us, that currently have, we believe, space to add the menswear to in its full capacity, so that would be a Tyson's Corner and Aventura, Toronto, there's going to be a handful of stores that we believe we can add menswear to in their existing footprint. And that could be additional volume for us. So our goal would be, for next year, to see our North American comps kind of flatten out and have comp store increases in our international business. And so we do see growth, and that will be driven by, in certain cases, in our international markets, more in handbag where we can grow market share and in our North American markets where it will come from some other categories. So I hope that's helpful."

Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Michael Kors' second quarter 2017 earnings call. I am joining you today from Tokyo, which is a market that we believe has great opportunity for the growth of the Michael Kors brand. Now turning to",1485,"Thank you, Joe. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Michael Kors' second quarter 2017 earnings call. I am joining you today from Tokyo, which is a market that we believe has great opportunity for the growth of the Michael Kors brand. 
Now turning to a review of our second quarter performance. Our results exceeded our expectations in the second quarter. We continued to deliver innovative luxury fashion product and expanded our brand footprint worldwide. We were extremely pleased with the successful launch of our MICHAEL KORS ACCESS wearable technology line of watches and fitness trackers as well as the debut of our Wonderlust fragrance. In addition, we were pleased with the great response to our new fall handbag collections, which exceeded our expectations. Our new iconic Mercer collection, emerged as a global bestseller and our Brooklyn collection set the fashion tone for the season with the introduction of Grommet hardware detailing. We also achieved strong sales growth in our menswear business during the quarter, and we continued to see this category as an area of future growth for the company. 
In North America, our digital flagships continued to deliver double-digit sales increases, and we were pleased with the successful launch of our European digital flagships. In addition, we seamlessly completed the integration of our recently acquired business in Greater China. This region represents a strong growth opportunity for the company. I am very proud of the work our team has done to deliver on these strategies. I believe these accomplishments set the stage for future growth. 
Let me now turn to a review of our quarterly results. For the second quarter, total revenue reached $1.1 billion and earnings per share was $0.95, both of which came in ahead of our expectations. [indiscernible] comparable store sales decreased 5.4%. While our comps in North America decreased in the mid-single digit range for the quarter, overall, we were pleased to see sequential improvement driven by our strong fashion product offerings. 
Turning to our international business. We were disappointed in our results in Europe, which saw low double-digit comp decline. In Asia, we saw a mid-single digit comp increase. Please note that our comp in this region currently reflects only Japan as the remainder of our Asia business is not yet included in the comp base. 
Our North American digital flagships continued to perform well during the quarter with strong double-digit comp growth. We expect the momentum in our digital flagships to continue as we further invest in growing this channel. 
In the Americas, retail stores' conversion rates increased in the high single-digit range, which was offset by a continued decline in traffic. As I mentioned earlier, we saw positive response to our new handbag collections, women's small leather goods, Michael Kors ACCESS smartwatches and fitness trackers, Wonderlust fragrance and our men's bags and small leather goods. The growth of these categories was more than offset by a decrease in our handbag sales and a double-digit decline in our watch sales. 
In Europe, traffic continued to decline in certain major markets. We believe that the softness in this business was due to continued consumer uncertainty related to Brexit and the lingering concern following the terrorist attacks in Belgium, France and Germany as well as other geopolitical issues. That said, we continued to believe that the Michael Kors brand remains strong in Europe. 
We are committed to investing in our digital flagship strategy to ensure we are positioned to capture the growth opportunity in this region. To that end, we launched our digital flagship businesses in the U.K. and Germany at the end of the quarter and we have since launched digital flagships in France, Switzerland, Spain and Italy. While it is still very early days for each of these businesses, we are pleased to have completed the launches and now have the platforms in place that will enable us to deepen our engagement with our consumers in these countries. We also plan to have e-commerce capabilities in 16 additional European countries in spring of 2017. 
In our Asia region, we saw increases in sales of 96%. This was driven by the addition of the China business as well as a mid-single digit comparable store sales increase in Japan. We were very pleased to see strong sales growth in China as our store network expands and our brand awareness increases. 
Looking ahead, we continue to believe that Asia represents a significant growth opportunity for the company and will ultimately reach $1 billion in revenue. 
Turning to our Wholesale segment. Revenues declined 18%. In the Americas, we saw a decline of 22%. We are strategically reducing our sell-in to department stores in order to protect our brand and margins in this channel through disciplined inventory control and reduced promotional activity, which has impacted our sales in this segment. We expect this trend will continue through the remainder of this year as we reduce both inventory flow and promotions. 
In Europe, we saw a 3% increase in wholesale sales. This growth is lower than historical trends as we are being negatively impacted by a mix shift towards crossbodies and small leather goods, which carry a lower AUR. This is the same fashion trend that started more than 1 year ago in North America. We anticipate this trend will continue to impact our wholesale sales in this region for the balance of the year. 
In Asia, the 43% decline in wholesale sales was primarily attributed to the shift of China and South Korea businesses to our company-owned Retail segment. 
In our men's business, we delivered solid performance in the second quarter, and we ended the quarter with 244 sportswear and leather goods shop-in-shops within our wholesale doors globally. Our North American and European wholesale partners remain excited to have a major new designer menswear line to offer to their customers. And we are confident that our men's business will be an important contributor to our future wholesale growth. 
In our Licensing segment, revenue declined during the quarter as we continued to see softness in the fashion watch category. That said, performance in our MICHAEL KORS ACCESS smartwear collection as well as our fitness trackers, which debuted in September, are exceeding our expectations. Importantly, our ACCESS product line is engaging both our loyal watch customers as well as attracting new customers in a younger demographic. Our Bradshaw and Dylan smartwatches in signature rose gold, gold, and silver platings are quickly becoming our most popular styles. The launch was supported by a significant marketing campaign across our global print, digital and social platforms. We also simultaneously created interactive experiences both on our digital, flagship and in-store to educate and excite consumers bringing the category and its benefits to life. To keep the momentum going through holiday, we will continue to roll out a comprehensive marketing program across print and social media. And we'll be featuring the product as one of our must-have gifts in our holiday gift guide. We also saw strong response to the debut of our Wonderlust fragrance, which came in ahead of plan during the quarter. We believe that this new pillar in our fragrance collection will drive further growth in this category going forward. 
In conclusion, our focus remains on executing on our multiple pillars for revenue growth, while maintaining our leadership position in the global luxury market, consistently delivering innovative fashion products to our customers and enhancing consumer engagement with the brand worldwide. 
Our key new handbag groups are performing very well. Our consumers respond favorably to the seasonal colors and novelty design elements featured in the collection. We're also seeing continued growth in our women's active shoe assortment and are encouraged by the initial results we have seen from the rollout of our men's offerings, both of which are key areas of growth for the company. 
We are also pleased with the strong momentum in our digital flagships, and we look forward to launching in Japan and China as well as additional countries in Europe within the next year. 
While there were some accomplishments that we were pleased with the during the quarter, our results continued to be impacted by the ongoing decline in mall traffic, the reduction in tourism in certain major cities and our strategic decision to reduce sell-in of inventory in the U.S. wholesale channel. We are in the process of rebalancing our business to increase the average transaction value in our retail stores as well as in our wholesale channel, and reduce the total number of units sold in the marketplace in North America. While these actions will result in short-term revenue declines, we believe they will enhance our brand equity over the long term. We will use this rebalancing as an opportunity to emphasize and extend other categories in our lifestyle portfolio of products as well as to expand our business internationally. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Joe to review our financials."

Total revenue was $1.09 billion compared to $1.13 billion in the prior year quarter. In our Retail segment, net sales increased 12.1% driven primarily by the addition of 198 net new stores since the second quarter of last year, including 137 stores associated with our recent acquisitions of Greater China and South Korea. 
Comp stores -- comp sales decreased 5.4% reflecting a mid-single digit comp decrease in North America and a low double-digit decline in Europe, partially offset by a mid-single digit comp increase in Asia and strong performance of our digital flagships. Our North American digital flagship sales contributed 270 basis points to our North American comp performance in the quarter. 
In our Wholesale segment, net sales declined 18.4% due to lower sales in our accessories, womenswear and footwear businesses, partially offset by an increase in our men's business. We saw a 22% decline in our wholesale business in the Americas region as we remain disciplined with the amount of inventory we have shipped into that channel. We also saw a single-digit increase in our European sales. In addition, we had a decrease in Asia, which primarily reflects the shift of our Greater China and South Korean businesses to the Retail segment during the quarter. 
In our Licensing segment, revenue decreased 10.2%. This was primarily due to the continued softness of the fashion watch and jewelry categories as well as lower revenues from our geographic licensing arrangement in Asia as a result of our recent acquisitions of our licensee operations. 
Gross margin expanded 40 basis points to 59.2% due to a favorable channel mix shift towards the Retail segment. Gross margin increased 80 basis points in our Wholesale segment primarily due to a change in the geographic mix. Gross margin declined 250 basis points in the Retail segment attributable to higher markdowns as compared to last year. 
Total operating expense grew 12.7%, and increased 590 basis points to 40.5% of total revenue. The increase was primarily due to the inclusion of our businesses in Greater China and South Korea, our investment in new stores, e-commerce and omnichannel capabilities, new shop-in-shops and the infrastructure improvements. 
Income from operations was $203.7 million, or 18.7% of total revenue as compared to 24.2% of total revenue in the same period last year. 
Retail operating margin was 11.7% compared to 18.8% in the prior year period. Operating margin was negatively impacted by 170 basis points from the inclusion of our newly acquired Greater China and Korea businesses, and by 90 basis points due to a noncash asset impairment charge. Operating margin was also negatively impacted by the 250 basis point decrease in gross margin that I described earlier. 
Operating expense as a percentage of sales was higher due to continued investments in our business, including retail store-related costs and depreciation expense associated with new store openings as well as continued costs relating to building our digital flagship platforms. We expect the inclusion of these international businesses, which currently carry a lower operating margin to negatively impact our operating margin for the balance of the year. Somewhat offsetting the compression from Greater China and Korea is a sequential improvement in gross margin from the first half of the year to the second half, and leveraging of our fixed operating expenses as we grow the retail revenues in the second half. For the second half of the year, we anticipate that the Retail segment operating margin to be approximately 20%. 
Wholesale operating margin was 27.0% compared to 28.3% in the prior year period. This was largely the result of a 210 basis point increase in operating expenses as a percent of revenue due to deleverage. This was partially offset by the aforementioned 80 basis point increase in our wholesale gross margins. 
Licensing operating margin was 31.2% compared to 37.7% in the prior year period. This was primarily due to increased costs associated with advertising as well as increased depreciation expense. 
Income taxes were $41.9 million in the quarter, and our effective tax rate was 20.7% as compared to 28.9% in the same period last year. The decrease in our effective tax rate was primarily due to [Audio Gap] $160.9 million for the second quarter and diluted earnings per share was $0.95. This compares to net income of $193.1 million or $1.01 per share -- per diluted share in the second quarter of fiscal 2016. 
Turning to our balance sheet. At the end of the quarter, cash and cash equivalents were $186.4 million. Inventory decreased 2.5% compared to the prior year due to careful inventory management and the anticipated decline in the U.S. wholesale business. 
We ended the quarter with $384.4 million of debt, which was recorded within short-term debt on a consolidated balance sheet. The debt consisted of borrowings under the company's revolving credit facilities. The amount available for future borrowings is approximately $615.9 million. 
During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 5 million shares totaling $250 million under our share repurchase program and have another $350 million of availability remaining on our most recent $1 billion authorization. This most recent share repurchase further demonstrates the company's commitment to returning value to shareholders and our confidence in our long-term growth potential. 
Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $52.3 million and were related to the build-out of new retail shops and shop-in-shops as well as investments in our distribution facilities, our corporate offices, digital flagships and other infrastructure improvements. We added 16 net new stores and converted 54 wholesale doors in the shop-in-shops globally in the second quarter. 
Overall, Michael Kors remains a leader in the fashion luxury marketplace. That said, our business has become increasingly challenged by macro factors that exist globally, including weakness in consumer spending. While we are excited about the strong response to new product across categories, we see a continuation of soft traffic trends and aggressive promotional activity in the U.S. market. Globally, our brand acceptance remains strong, but we are seeing weakness in tourism, trends, geopolitical issues and foreign currency fluctuations that contribute to top line pressure. Given these macro factors, we are reducing our fiscal 2017 revenue expectation to approximately $4.55 billion and expect a mid-single digit decrease in comp sales. Gross margin is now expected to be approximately 60%, modestly below our initial expectation as we anticipate that our reduced European sales outlook will result in a less favorable benefit from geographic mix than we initially anticipated. In addition, we expect operating expense as a percent of total revenue to be approximately 39.5%. These assumptions result in an operating margin of approximately 20.7%, excluding the $11.3 million in onetime transaction costs related to the acquisition of our Greater China licensee. On a GAAP basis, we expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $4.32 to $4.38, inclusive of the $11.3 million of onetime transaction costs. We expect diluted earnings per share to be in a range of $4.37 to $4.43 for the year, excluding the onetime cost noted earlier. This assumes a tax rate of approximately 21% and 169.5 million shares outstanding. 
For the third quarter, we expect total revenue to be between $1.365 billion and $1.38 billion, and a mid-single digit decrease in comp sales. We expect gross margin of approximately 60.5% driven by favorable geographic and channel mix shift. We plan to continue to invest in our international expansion, digital flagships and global infrastructure, and therefore, expect operating expense as a percent of total revenue to be approximately 35.5% resulting in an operating margin of approximately 25%. We expect diluted earnings per share to be in a range of $1.61 to $1.65. This assumes a tax rate of approximately 21% and 166.5 million weighted average shares outstanding. 
Capital expenditures are expected to total approximately $250 million for the fiscal year 2017. And we will focus on ongoing investments in global digital strategies and omnichannel capabilities, global retail expansion, including approximately 15 new stores in the Americas, 25 in Europe and 30 in Asia; the conversion of approximately 215 wholesale shop-in-shops globally; and the company's global distribution infrastructure information systems and corporate facilities. 
In conclusion, we remain focused on the initiatives that we had in place to drive sequential improvement in our business in the second half of fiscal 2017 and sales and earnings growth over the long term. 
I will now turn the call back to John for closing remarks."

We are also excited about our holiday season as we expect to continue to benefit from the recent new handbag collection launches, the MICHAEL KORS ACCESS wearable technology line and our new Wonderlust fragrance. In addition, we have strong holiday gifting programs, including the Michael Kors Fuji Instax collaboration and our launch of the custom Kors experience on our digital flagship where customers can create their own personalized handbags and small leather goods with monograms, stickers, charms, keychains and interchangeable flaps. We plan to drive brand engagement with exciting new marketing programs positioning Michael Kors as the gifting destination this holiday season.

We will also be focused on helping our customers find the perfect gift for everyone in their lives through a number of jet-set in-store personal shopping events. Our Michael Kors stores will certainly be the place to be this holiday season.

Maybe if you could turn for a second at some of the internal strategies. What are the things that Kors is putting into place to try to combat some of these external pressures and drive growth? And then Joe, I just wanted to follow up on the margin commentary. I'm wondering if you can talk to us about how we should think about Retail segment margins over the medium term? Where do you expect them to land? And wholesale margins over the medium term, where do you think they end up normalizing?"
143971118,405727514,1084248,"Michael Kors Holdings Limited, Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Nov 10, 2016",2016-11-10,"Earnings Calls","Capri Holdings Limited","Executives","Thank you, Kimberly. There's 2 separate things that are going on for us, we believe, in the total retail environment. First, there's no question, in North America, we probably suffered worse than many of our competitors because we have a very large intern",809,"Thank you, Kimberly. There's 2 separate things that are going on for us, we believe, in the total retail environment. First, there's no question, in North America, we probably suffered worse than many of our competitors because we have a very large international business that we have had some very nice growth with, in particular, European tourists coming to the United States and South American tourists coming to the United States, to a degree people from Mexico as well. So most of that business has declined dramatically and we have not seen any return, and it's getting probably closer to the bottom. But there's still more headwinds in there, and obviously, not as volatile as it was 12 months ago. So we're really looking at that as one issue that we have to deal with. And the second issue is in North America, there's been a very, very strong amount of promotional activities generated from competitors and from certain other channels of distribution. So we -- and I'm going to address the second one first. We've, as you know, announced that starting on February 1, we're really focused on reducing the amount of promotional activity that we're going to be involved in as a brand. We think that's the right thing to do for the health of the business. Once again, this past quarter, we saw a mid-single digit increases in our overall accessories business in units. So once again, customers buying Michael Kors, that's not the issue. The issue is that the price of our sale has been denigrated and it's been denigrated because of promotional activity. We believe that, that if we focus on average transaction value and get that up and less on the unit, amount of unit transactions, we're going to have a healthier business. So to that end, our best-selling handbag group this Fall season is Mercer, which we commented about in our remarks earlier. And that product, by the way, is not on promotion anywhere. So we set it out as a nonpromotional item and it is working. It's working really well in every channel of distribution for us. So it shows that the customer is absolutely willing to pay when they understand that things can't be put on promotion on a regular basis. We will have for the spring season 5 groups that will not only fit into that same category, so they will be excluded even from the authorized sale periods that we will have in Michael Kors. So we're going to be focused on average transaction value and how we get that up. But at the same point in time, those groups will be approximately, on a medium-sized handbag, $295, which we think is a really key price point. And we know it's a key price point. We know she's responding and responding in very large quantities. So we think we can create amazing luxury product with fashion sensibility and deliver to her at a price point that, that is something that she's going to find compelling. So we believe that, that will be a number 1 driver for us. Number two, again, the active footwear category has been something that's been explosive for us and we're getting great traction in that category. And third, we're very pleased with what's happening with our smartwatch business. We are probably the #2 player out in the marketplace today, clearly, with Apple being #1 and the response has been extraordinary. We are selling out a product. We're actually in a position where we're not able to fill all the demand that is happening around the globe. And so we think those combination of factors will begin to really start to impact the business as we head through the calendar fourth quarter, our fiscal third quarter and then into first quarter. That all being said, you know that we've reduced our wholesale shipments in preparation of this. And so that's one of the reasons why we've revised our guidance, as I think, we have a better handle on where that's all going to land now. And I think the brand will be in a much better position to grow from there. And then lastly is our men's business, which as we commented earlier, we're very pleased with the initial results both on a sportswear. And I think we're being a little surprised on how successful the leather piece of the business is. It's really taking off very quickly and we're trying to capitalize and moving that into more locations even doors, in our own chain, where we might not already -- or we might not be putting the full assortment of men's in. So we still see opportunity for growth, and that will absolutely be in our projections for next year. So we're feeling good about that. I'll turn it over to Joe now."

But they are making a significant dent in the decline. And we're just, I think we are in a situation where we can't fill all the demand right now, so we really don't need how high is high. We also will have to wait until we get through again, calendar fourth quarter, which will be a very big gifting opportunity for us to see how this really impacts the sales. We also have other products that are going to be launched right behind the smartwatch. And so we think that there's going to be more technology and innovation coming into this category. And I think you heard me say before that we think long-term, the fashion watch category will be revolutionized and may even ultimately eat into the whole tracker market, as you know it today, where watches will have the same capabilities as trackers, so you can have a smartwatch and then you can have watches that will just have less functionality and not be quite as expensive. So we're very excited. I want to thank our partners, both Fossil and Google for everything that they've done to make this such a successful launch for the company and not just domestically, but worldwide. These watches are selling all over the world and so I think we're just at the very beginning of something that's exciting. And the last thing, I would say, is we're bringing -- people are coming into the store who we've never seen before, who have been reading about this either from bloggers or seeing it through our social campaigns, and it absolutely is drawing a new and different customer to our stores. So we're terribly excited about that. And it even kind of leads into this fun little collaboration that we're doing with Fuji on the Instax cameras, they just hit the stores, and they really doing extremely well, as well. So again we're always have been -- Michael has always been focused being a company that leads from a modernity standpoint and we think this just further add credence to what we're doing with the customer with these products."

I think what is important for us in terms of, again, I think you've seen the way we've managed inventory from the days that we were growing it double-digit to now where we've got slower growth. I think we've been very good as a company in terms of managing inventory. I think the biggest issue for us is, we want to continue to introduce newness. That's what's going to keep the customer and engage and excited with our brand, and we've always done that. The issue for us is really more about getting the transaction value back up because when the customer sees our product and not just our products, even with our competitors, the things are constantly being put on sale, you lose a credibility with that customer, that they you should see something new and want to buy it and not just wait until an event happens. So I think that's going to be our major focus next year. It won't be an easy task, I don't want to mislead you, it's not something that happens overnight. But if you really care about your brand long-term and you believe that having less units in the marketplace and a higher transaction value is a long-term strategy, then we believe we'll be successful."

So I think that'",449,"Okay, Randy, first off, good afternoon. It's going be a little hard to answer that question because there was I think 3 or 4 in there. Let me take a stab at it though. We are looking to have AUR increase somewhere in the 10% to 15% range. So I think that's the first place to start. And that's been about the degradation that has taken place over the past let's call it 12 months. And I think I've commented to you all before, too, not only are unit sales up in our own stores and in our department store partners, but our actual consumers who -- new consumers coming to the brand is up as well. So again, we -- between that, between our brand awareness studies, et cetera, we don't see an issue that there's a health of the brand issue, more people are buying it, more people are engaged, more people are actually coming to our company through our own websites and our partners' websites. So that's not the issue. The issue is that when you look at all that and then you got, let's say, on the high side 15% AUR decline, that really -- you can't make up that difference. So that would be our goal. So that would kind of put the units down to that kind of number, somewhere between the 10% and 15%, and then we hope we'd make that up with AUR. And we're going to do that in my earlier answer to Kimberly, not just through the fact that we're going to limit -- exit the friends and family sales and all those types of things. But also, really creating a different sense of excitement around the value of the product. Again, we know she is buying crossbodies and totes, et cetera, from us and she believes that, that's a handbag when she buys it. She didn't say, well, I only bought a small bag because I have less money, that's what the fashion is today. We believe that we can create some excitement with her, especially in medium-sized bags at a higher AUR than what we're currently selling but still with great value for her, and very, very consistent with where we've been as a brand overall. That $300 handbag price point for us has been a very strong price point and we'd like to see a greater amount of our mix shift go into that area, and so that's why I said we'll have these 5 groups in the spring season that we're terribly excited about and should really generate some significant volume if the Mercer collection in particular is any indication of what we've seen happen."

That's obviously being tempered by what we're seeing in Europe, which has been very difficult over the last 2 quarters. So we got to get that straightened out.

Kors Concierge is in a limited amount of the stores right now, and literally, it's only been up for about, I think, 3 or 4 weeks. You might -- you may have seen it in there about 60 days ago or so but the full capabilities of it were really not available for the sales associates until just a few weeks ago. So it's too early to tell what and how that's going to impact the transactions inside the stores. But very clearly, it will give the selling associate the ability to see the full breadth of the product that's available through not only our e-commerce capabilities, but it will also give them a view of all the product that inside the chain in stores. And most importantly, it gives them the capability, as you probably have seen, of really being a styling consultant and wardrobing the customer in multiple different ways that are all selected from Michael, himself, personally, and our design teams and how they see people being put together. So we think it's an incredible tool that sales associates are going to be able to really engage with their customers with. And you combine that with some of the geo-targeting technology that's available from some of our partners, and we're able to have much more targeted communication with the local customer, when I'm talking local, it might be 5 blocks of a store if in your New York City or might be within 2 or 3, 4 miles of a stores out in Manhasset, Long Island. So we think that given the technology capabilities, the clientele-end capabilities and now the styling capabilities, it's going to give our sales associates a lot more to work with, with the customer. And today, that's really what it's all about. You heard us talk earlier, our conversion rates in the stores continue to rise. So again, customers, when they come through the door are engaging with us, that's not the problem. The problem is how do we get them in and again we're hoping this technology as well as some things that we're coupling with that are going to be helpful for us. We're also piloting click and collect, which is a limited amount of the stores, just went live a few days ago. So that capability will be in place also, which is another reason to have our customers come into our stores and engage with our sales associates. So all this heavy lifting that we've been doing from a technology standpoint, the great news is we're really going to be in place to start to reap the benefits of those investments."

Lindsay, the destock that's happening is really starting to happen now because the retailers need to reduce their inventories in light of what our new policy is going to be. They obviously are lowering their sales plans because their current model is to do more business with promotional activity, so that's in conflict or contrast to what we think is the right thing to do going forward. And again, there's been nothing but complete cooperation from every one of our retail partners in the United States, but we're a significant part of many of their businesses. So they need to rightsize their inventories accordingly and we're in complete support of that. So sell-throughs are pretty similar to where they've been historically, but remember all the promotional activity is going on as we speak. So none of that's changed, and none of that will change until the end of January. So we're expecting a fairly promotional holiday season. But once we get beyond that, we're feeling that we've got a different way of looking at how the business can be built. And we're hoping that, that's going to be looked upon at in very positive way by our end consumer."

But the full-price traffic continues to be significantly down. And again, part of that is driven back through our e-commerce business. Joe indicated that we've got a 270 point basis -- basis point increase driven by the e-commerce. So our e-commerce traffic is up strong double digits. We're seeing the same thing happen in Europe. The minute you turn on e-commerce and, as I said to you before, we're very pleased with what's happening so far, it impacts the full price business. So we think that part of this is a shift to our own e-commerce sites. And part of it is obviously people, in general, shopping less in the mall channel just because of all the activity that goes on, on e-commerce sites around North America and now you're starting to see the same thing happen in many large European countries as well."

We believe that the North American handbag business is roughly flat, may be up a couple of points in total. And we don't see that trend changing much. So I think that as it relates to us, we obviously have a fairly large market share in that category. And our growth rate in handbags in North America will be low single digit if we do our job right. And that will be more in dollars than in units. So that's how we view that. 
And then the watch category, we do believe that the decline is going to lessen. As I said earlier, we've already seen that when you add the combined smartwatch and fashion watch categories together. And we don't know how much that will stop declining but there are some very good indications there. 
We clearly need to have other categories working inside of our store. If you take those 2 categories and say, 1 may still be in the, let's pretend it's high single-digit decline and one is flattish to up a few points, we need other categories to work and you're going to be seeing that happen. We're certainly taking the shoe areas inside of our stores and making them significantly larger. Also by the way, the shoe business has been positively impacted by our e-commerce because we're able to have wider assortments online and sales associates are able to do sends, to company -- to customers' homes by virtue of the breadth that we have online. And some of that category could be a very nice increase for us. We'll be making some announcements about some jewelry on the next call, some strategies that we have around jewelry for our own freestanding stores and that we think is also going to be very nice additional category of business for us. So we're going to be looking at other things. And then of course, men's has great opportunity for us. So we're taking certain stores, and that will be a next round of tests for us, that currently have, we believe, space to add the menswear to in its full capacity, so that would be a Tyson's Corner and Aventura, Toronto, there's going to be a handful of stores that we believe we can add menswear to in their existing footprint. And that could be additional volume for us. So our goal would be, for next year, to see our North American comps kind of flatten out and have comp store increases in our international business. And so we do see growth, and that will be driven by, in certain cases, in our international markets, more in handbag where we can grow market share and in our North American markets where it will come from some other categories. So I hope that's helpful."
