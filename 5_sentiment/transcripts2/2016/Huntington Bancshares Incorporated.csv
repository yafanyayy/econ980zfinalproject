For the past 6 years, Huntington's custo",2451,"Thanks, Mark. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. We appreciate your interest in Huntington. We have great results to share with you today, and we're very pleased with how we are positioned for 2016. 
For the past 6 years, Huntington's customer-centric stress strategy has resulted in growth and market share and in share of wallet through execution, distinctive Fair Play philosophy, our welcome culture and our superior customer service. 2015 was a year of continued disciplined execution of the strategy, producing solid results and delivering on our commitments to our customers, colleagues, communities and most importantly, our shareholders.
We continue to invest in our colleagues and in the capabilities we need to continue to being industry leader in customer experience, including digital, data analytics and cybersecurity. We also continue to optimize our customer-centric distribution strategy, including the accelerated build-out of our in-store strategy in Michigan. 
In addition, in 2015, we returned approximately $400 million of capital for more than 55% of net income to shareholders via dividends and buybacks.
Slide 2 shows some of the financial highlights for the year. Earnings per common share of $0.81 was up 13% from 2014, while tangible book value per share increased 4% to $6.91. Full year return on tangible common equity was 12.4%, which was modestly below our long-term financial goal of 13% to 15%. Return on assets was 1.01 for the full year.
We are very pleased with our core fundamentals for the full year, including revenue growth of 6%, average loan growth of 7% and average core deposit growth of 9%. And we delivered positive operating leverage for the third consecutive year.
Slide 3 shows similar financial highlights for the fourth quarter. Earnings per common share of $0.21 was up 11% year-over-year. Fourth quarter return on tangible common equity was 12.4%, while fourth quarter return on assets was 1%.
We again produced solid revenue growth despite the challenging interest rate environment. The year-over-year revenue growth was 9% with both net interest income and noninterest income contributing to the increase.
We were particularly pleased with the 17% year-over-year increase in noninterest income in the fourth quarter, benefiting from performance in capital markets, mortgage banking and SBA loan sales, among other. 
Expense growth was well controlled with noninterest expense up only 3% year-over-year.
Our efficiency ratio for the quarter was 63.7%, a 250 basis point improvement from the year ago quarter.
High-quality balance sheet growth included an 8% year-over-year increase in average core deposits and a 6% increase in average loans and leases. 
Growth in average core deposits more than fully funded average loan growth. As we've noted in the past several quarters, while the value of core deposits may not be fully appreciated, we believe that our strong core deposit franchise will prove to be a key differentiator in the rising rate environment. 
We remain pleased with our credit quality with only 18 basis points of net charge-offs in the fourth quarter and 79 basis points of nonperforming assets.
Our capital ratios remain strong as well. Tangible common equity entered the quarter at 7.81%, while common equity Tier 1 was 9.80%. 
Slide 4 provides a summary of the income statement, including some additional details on our noninterest income and noninterest expense for the quarter. Relative to last year's fourth quarter, total reported revenue increased 9% to $778 million. Spread revenues accounted for less than half of the increases as net interest income increased 5% to $505 million. We benefited from 8% average earning asset growth, partially offset by 9 basis points of net interest margin compression.
The NIM was negatively impacted by mixed shift on both side of the balance sheet, most notably, the increase in low yielding LCR compliant securities in our earning assets and higher cost senior bank notes in our funding mix.
We continue to remain disciplined in pricing in both loan and deposits. 
During the 2015 fourth quarter, Congress passed the provision in the Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act, more commonly referred to as the Highway Bill, which reduced and kept dividends paid by the Federal Reserve to banks with assets greater than $10 billion, including Huntington. The reduction in these dividends is expected to negatively impact net interest income by approximately $7 million in 2016.
We were pleased with our free income performance in the quarter as more than 60% of the year-over-year revenue increase came from noninterest income. Specifically, reported noninterest income was $272 million, an increase of $39 million or 17% from the year ago quarter. Highlights included an 8% increase in service charges on deposit accounts and continued momentum incurred in payment processing income.
Mortgage banking income increased 124% from 1 year ago quarter as a result of an $11 million increase in mortgage origination and secondary marketing revenues, coupled with a $5 million increase from the MSR hedging-related activities.
Other income included a $3 million gain on the sale of Huntington Asset Advisors, Huntington Asset Services and Unified Financial Services, which was included in the quarters merger and acquisition-related significant item. The decision to sell these noncore businesses allow us to focus on the core wealth business and continue to reposition the regional banking in Huntington Private Client group segment for better growth and returns in coming quarters. The sale is expected to reduce noninterest income by approximately $14 million in 2016, primarily in the trust services line; and reduce noninterest expense by approximately $22 million in 2016, primarily in the personal expense line.
Reported noninterest expense in the 2015 fourth quarter was $499 million, an increase of $15 million or 3% from the year ago quarter. This quarter's noninterest expense included 2 significant items: $8 million of franchise repositioning expense related to closures, facilities impairments and personal actions; and $3 million of merger-related expense from the Huntington Technology Finance acquisition and a previously mentioned sale of Huntington Asset Advisors, Huntington Asset Services and Unified Financial Services.
Noninterest expense adjusted for significant items in both quarters increased $25 million or 5% year-over-year. Of this increase, approximately $14 million was related to the acquisition of Macquarie Equipment Finance, which we have rebranded Huntington Technology Finance.
During the fourth quarter, the FDIC announced the surcharge on banks with assets in excess of $10 billion including Huntington. We expect the surcharge will negatively impact our FDIC insurance expense by approximately $13 million in 2016. 
Turning to Slide 5. Average loans and leases increased $2.7 billion or 6% year-over-year as we again experienced year-over-year growth in every  portfolio. Average securities increased $2.1 billion or 17%, primarily reflecting growth in LCR compliant securities into a lesser extent growth and direct purchase as simple securities as originated by our Commercial segment. 
Average commercial industrial loans include $1.3 billion or 7%, primarily driven by a $1.1 billion increase in asset finance, $0.8 billion of which came via the Huntington Technology Finance acquisition.
The quarter also benefited from seasonal strength in auto floor plan lending and growth and corporate lending, by a court market business banking saw modest portfolio reductions. 
Average automobile loans from $0.8 billion or 9% from the year ago quarter. The 2015 fourth quarter represented the eighth consecutive quarter of more than $1 billion of auto loan originations.
Auto Finance remains a core competency of Huntington. And as detailed on the slides and the appendix, we have remained consistent in our strategy, which is built around a dealer-centric model and focused on prime borrowers.
Of underwriting has not changed. In fact, industry volumes were up around 5% to 6% in 2015. Our origination volumes were essentially flat, reflecting our lending discipline.
Yields on new auto paper dipped slightly in the fourth quarter for the 290 to 295 range, just above the 3% in the prior quarter. We also saw the normal seasonal shift to new car sales in the quarter, resulting in a mixed shift reduction in the overall yield. We expect a new used mix will return to more normal levels in the first quarter.
Moving to the right side of the slide on the right side of the balance sheet, average total deposits increased $4.6 billion or 9% over the year ago quarter, including the $3.9 billion or 8% increase in average core deposits.
Average noninterest-bearing demand deposits increased $2 billion or 13% year-over-year and average interest-bearing demand deposits increased $1 billion or 16%.
These growth numbers reflect our continued focus on new customer checking households and commercial relationship account acquisitions. 
Average money market deposits increased $1.4 billion or 8% year-over-year, reflecting our continued effort to deepen banking relationships and increase share of wallet.
We also continue to remix the consumer deposit base out of higher cost CDs into other less expensive products. Average core CDs decreased $0.6 billion or 21% year-over-year.
As shown on Slide 5, average total demand deposits accounted for 38% of nonequity funding in 2015 fourth quarter, while money market deposits accounted for 31%. By contrast, average core CDs accounted for only 4% of our nonequity funding in the quarter.
As we have highlighted in the last few quarters, the year-over-year growth in our total core deposits more than fully funded our average loan growth over this period. Average long-term debt increased $2.9 billion or 72% as a result of 4 bank level senior debt issuances this year totaling $3.1 billion, including $850 million issued in November, as well as the assumption of $500 million of debt in the Huntington Technology Finance acquisition.
These long-term debt issuances allowed us to reduce average short-term borrowings by $2.2 billion or 80% from the year ago quarter. While this trade had a negative impact on the net interest margin, the long-term debt provides us with advantages of long-term stable funding. 
Average broker deposits increased by $100 million. We continue to view wholesale funding sources as a cost-efficient means for funding balance sheet growth, including LCR-related securities growth, while managing core deposit expense and maintaining sales focus on acquiring core checking account customers.
Slide 6 shows our net interest margin slotted against earning asset yields and interest-bearing liability cost. 
Fourth quarter NIM decreased 9 basis points year-over-year and 7 basis points linked quarter to 3.09%. Recall that the third quarter of 2015 net interest margin benefited from approximately 2 basis points of interest recoveries in the commercial portfolio. We continue to experience pricing pressure across those asset classes to build the majority of the compression reflected unfavorable mixed shift on both side of the balance sheet. Most notably, the growth in LCR compliant securities funded by senior bank debt issuance.
While we were encouraged by the December rate interest rate increase by  the FMC, the impact in the fourth quarter's net interest margin was negligible. 
Going forward, we expect modest interest margin pressure to remain ahead of investable asset classes continue to price slower, given average portfolio of rates above new money rates despite the recent increases in LIBOR and prime. 
Based on our current outlook, we remain comfortable reaffirming that the net interest margin will remain above 3% in 2016.
Slide 7 provides an update on our assets and sensitivity positioning and how we manage our interest rate risk. We continue to have a relatively neutral balance sheet largely due to our swap portfolio.
As shown in the chart on top, our modeling estimates that net interest income would benefit by 0.3% if interest rates were grant 200 basis points in addition to increases already reflected in the current and 5 forward curve, unchanged from 1 quarter ago.
In a hypothetical scenario, without the $8.5 billion of asset swaps, the estimated benefit would approximate positive 3.4% in the up 200-basis-point ramp scenario.
The chart on the bottom of the slide shows our $8.5 billion assets swap portfolio and the $5.9 billion liability swap portfolio, including the respective average remaining lives and their impact on net interest income.
The incremental benefit of swaps was $29 million in the 2015 fourth  quarter, up from $28 million in the 2015 third quarter and $24 million in the year ago quarter.
As we have stated previously, our asset swap portfolio is a laddered portfolio. There are no clips moving on the horizon entering the 2015 fourth quarter, $800 million of the asset swaps mature.
As we communicated a few quarters ago, we intend to allow maturing asset swaps this year to run off, gradually shifting our balance sheet positioning more asset sensitive. As of year end, $3.6 billion of swaps was scheduled to mature over the next 12 months.
Slide 8 shows the trends in our capital ratios. Our risk-based regulatory capital ratios improved modestly from the prior quarter end, while tangible common equity, or TCE, declined slightly. We repurchased 2.5 million common shares during the fourth quarter at an average price of $11.59 per share in a total of 23 million common shares on average price of $10.93 over the full year.
Coupled with cash dividends, we effectively returned approximate $400 million of capital to shareholders during 2015. We have 166 million of authorized repurchase capacity remaining for the final 2 quarters under our 366 million share repurchase authorization.
Slide 9 provides an overview of our loan loss provision, net charge-offs and allowance for credit losses. Credit performance remained solid and in line with our expectations. The loan loss provision was $36.5 million in the fourth quarter compared to $21.8 million of net charge-offs. Net charge-offs remained well controlled at only 18 basis points are well below our long-term expectations of 35 to 55 basis points. Net charge-offs for the full year were also 18 basis points.
The ACL ratio ticked up 1 basis points to 1.33% of loans and leases compared to 1.32% at the end of the prior quarter. The ratio of allowance in nonaccrual loans used 2 180% compared to 184% 1 quarter ago due to slight uptick in NALs. We believe the allowances is appropriate and reflexive the underwriting credit quality of our loan portfolio.
Slide 10 shows trends in nonperforming assets, delinquencies and Criticized assets. The chart of the upper left shows a slight increase in the nonperforming asset ratio for the quarter to 79 basis points compared to 77 basis points 1 quarter ago.
The increase primarily reflected the oil and gas exploration and production credits, which replaced the nonaccruals during the quarter. The chart on the upper right reflects our 90-day delinquencies, which remained flat from 1 quarter ago. The bottom left shows the criticized asset ratio, which also remains unchanged.
Finally, the chart on the bottom line shows inflows of the percentage of beginning period loans of 29 basis points in fourth quarter, again, unchanged from the prior quarter. Let me now turn the presentation over to Steve."

Our Fair Play banking philosophy, our welcome culture month and our Optimal Customer Relationship, or OCR, focused continues to drive we believe to be industry-leading customer acquisition. Slide 11 illustrates these long-term trends in consumer and commercial customer acquisition. We've increased our consumer checking households and our business checking relationships by 8% and 5% compounded annual growth rates since 2010. Although low of large numbers might be beginning to weigh on these growth rates, the underlying customer growth rates remains impressive.
These robust customer growth rates have allowed us to post the associated revenue growth you can see in the 2 lower charts on the slide. We are particularly pleased with the recent trend this above on the chart on the bottom left as the past 3 quarters have shown improved momentum in the consumer household revenue metrics as we've lapped the last key change we've implemented under our Fair Play philosophy and continue to realize the benefits of the underlying customer growth.
You've heard me say this before, but our focus remains on growing revenues. We will continue to grow revenues despite the challenging environment.
Although slides have been slightly redesigned from the what you are used to seeing, Slide 12 and 13 illustrate the continued success of our OCR strategy and deepening our customer and commercial relationships. As we've stated before, our strategy is not about gaining market share, our strategy is about gaining market share and share of wallet. 
Now the strategy built around increasing the number of products and services we provide to our customers knowing that this will translate growth into more loyal, satisfied and customers as well as revenue growth. 
As of the year end, almost 52% of our consumer checking households use 6 or more products and services, and that's up from 49% 1 year ago.
Correspondingly, our consumer checking account household revenue was up 13% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. Similarly, 44% of our commercial customers used 4 or more products or services at year end, up from 42% 1 year ago. Again, this is translated directly to revenue growth as commercial revenue increased 4% year-over-year. 
We introduced the next 2 slides to you last quarter and many of you indicated how helpful you found them.
Slide 14 illustrates trends in the unemployment rate across over 6 core Western states as well as other leading coincident and lagging economic data for the region. 
Slide 15 takes a deeper look at the trend in the unemployment rates in our largest metropolitan markets. Despite the recent volatility exhibited in the equity and commodity market, we remain bullish on our core Midwestern footprint. Our small- and medium-sized commercial customers continue to express confidence in their businesses. And while consumers continue to benefit from recovering real state markets, low energy prices and early signs of wage inflation in certain markets, such us here and Columbus. The auto industry is an important component of the economy and our footprint, and it appears poised for another stellar year in 2016. 
Other industries that contribute meaningfully to the regional economy, such as health care, medical devices, medical technology and higher education, among others, also remains strong.
Our small business customers continue to experience strong performance and improving balance sheets. Our SBA lending also remains quite robust. 
I find the chart on the lower right on Slide 14 particularly encouraging. This chart shows the state-leading economic industries as reported by the federal reserve Bank of Philadelphia for our 6-day footprint, all of which are projected to be positive over the next 6 months.
The chart in the bottom left on Slide 14 shows unemployment rate in our footprint states continue to trend positively, including recent improvement in West Virginia following several charging months of impact of lower coal prices.
Unemployment rates in most of our footprint states remain in line with, or better than, the national average. The chart on the bottom of Slide 15 shows the similar trend for our 10 largest deposit market, which collectively account for more than 80% of our total deposit franchise.
As detailed in the chart, the majority of these markets continue to trend favorably and 7 to 10 markets currently enjoyed unemployment rates below the national average, and this is quite a departure from several years ago when most of these markets were above the national average.
In 2014, we introduced long-term financial goals, including positive operating leverage annually. 
Slide 16 shows that we've delivered our commitment for positive operating leverage in 2015, our third consecutive year to achieve this goal. Further, we also delivered on our commitment for positive operating leverage, both including and excluding the highly accretive Huntington Technology Finance acquisition.
Over the course of the past year, some of you expressed concern about our ability to deliver this commitment in 2015 and while others have questioned the prudence of such a commitment even in the first place. So therefore, rather than take you lap or growing too much on the accomplishment, I think it's important to reflect back both on the impetus for establishing annual positive operating leverages as one of our long-term financial goal and made us a better company. 
Just a few years ago, some shareholders questioned our spending discipline as we invest in the future, while the related revenue growth was often difficult to ascertain because continued refinements to our Fair Play philosophy mask the underlying momentum and the ultimate return on those investments is not always easily enough quantified.
But we continue to invest thoughtfully, strategically and opportunistically for the future. However, we've committed to our owners that we would better taste our investments with revenue growth and improved transparency. You can now see the fruit of this commitment on our daily call through Huntington, our call through in which continues improvement a focus on driving sustained. Revenue growth and accountability for every dollar of investment has been established as an absolute expectation. We've developed the culture in which our share owners should expect, more often than not, that we will deliver positive operating leverage as we constantly strive to post improved returns and top-tier performance. 
With that, let's turn to Slide 17% for some closing remarks in our initial 2016 expectation.
We continue to manage the company with a focus on delivering consistent, through the cycle, shareholder returns. The strategy entails reducing short-term volatility, achieving top-tier performance over the long-term and maintaining our aggregate moderate to low risk profile route. We successfully built a strong distinguished consumer brand, differentiated products and superior customer service. We continue to execute our strategy and to adapt or adjust our environment where necessary.
We completed and integrated the highly accretive acquisition of Macquarie Equity Finance, which we rebranded Huntington Technology Finance, or HDF. Investments also continue to pay off, such as our data analytic effort, which will drive better customer targeting and ongoing efforts to prove sales execution across the franchise and grow revenue. 
None of our investments are mature. We also continue to invest and enhance sales management, digital technology, further investments in data analytics and optimizing our retail distribution network, all of which will help drive future performance.
The early anecdotal evidence from the build-out of our strategy in the back half of 2015 is very positive point towards a faster ramp than in prior in-store branch openings. We've refined our answer execution over the past several years to drive its improved performance. And these new stores represented some of the best location, which would, therefor, also virtually lend themselves to struggle results. We remain bullish from the economic vitality and economic outlook of our core Midwest footprint, while we're prudently monitoring certain industries or sectors potentially impacted by global macroeconomic development, such as oil and gas exploration of production. We believe these risks remain well contained within our performance and the majority of our core consumer and small medium-sized businesses and customers enjoy a positive near-term outlook. Customer sentiment also remains positive. Commercial loan utilization rates showed a slight increase for the third consecutive quarter and loan pipelines are steady.
Competitive pressures across our businesses show signs of stabilizing while our commitment to be disciplined lenders has not waived. 2016, our commercial team will be refocusing our core middle-market and small business customers following the recent years focused on building out our especially lending critical. Our equipment to consumers remains constant.
In summary, we're pleased with our 2015 results and are optimistic as we enter 2016. Just as we did last year, we built our 2015 budget, assuming no benefit from interest rates and have established continued success should an even more challenging environment materialized. 
We control our own destiny. And once again, our focus and execution will deliver for our shareholders in 2016. While we expect NIM pressure will remain a headwind in the near term, we expect to grow revenue despite the pressure. That said, we continue to expect the NIM will bottom out later this year assuming no interest rate increase and will remain above 3%.
And further, we expect to prove both net interest income and noninterest income. We expect 2016 full year revenue growth will be consistent with our 4% to 6% long-term financial goal, excluding items and MSR activity. 
As you should have come to expect from us, we will continue to invest in our businesses, but we'll phase those investments consistent with our revenue outlook. The bulk of these investments will remain focused on technology, including data analytics, digital and mobile and improved sales execution.
We continue to manage our home portfolio closely, particularly sectors in specific relationships, most likely to be affected by recent market volatility with in dollar, declining commodity values and other macroeconomic factors. I'm incrementally and more concerned today about our credit outlook than I was when we spoke 1 quarter ago, but I stressed that we do not see significant deterioration in the near term horizon.
Given those absolute low level of our credit metrics, recent global economic volatility and the stress in the dollar, we expect some volatility in our credit metric going forward and anticipate that loan loss provision for both ourselves and the broader industry will likely begin to increase some time into 2016.
On the other hand, we expect our net charge-offs will remain in or below our long-term expected range of 35 to 55 basis points. 
Finally, I always like to close with the reminder that there are high-level alignment below the Board and management and our shareholders. The Board and our colleagues are collectively to seek largest shareholder Huntington. We have hold the retirement requirements on certain shares and are appropriately focused on driving sustained long-term performance. We're highly focused on our commitment to being good stewards of shareholder's capital. 
So now I'll turn it back to Mark so we can begin the Q&A."

We have great results to share with you today, and we're very pleased with how we are positioned for 2016. 
For the past 6 years, Huntington's customer-centric strategy has resulted in growth in market share and in share of wallet through execution through our distinctive Fair Play philosophy, our welcome culture and our superior customer service. 2015 was a year of continued disciplined execution of the strategy, producing solid results and delivering on our commitments to our customers, colleagues, communities and, most importantly, our shareholders.
We continue to invest in our colleagues and in the capabilities we need to continue to being industry leader in customer experience, including digital, data analytics and cybersecurity. We also continue to optimize our customer-centric distribution strategy, including the accelerated build-out of our in-store strategy in Michigan. In addition, in 2015, we returned approximately $400 million of capital or more than 55% of net income to shareholders via dividends and buybacks.
Slide 2 shows some of the financial highlights for the year. Earnings per common share of $0.81 was up 13% from 2014 while tangible book value per share increased 4% to $6.91. Full year return on tangible common equity was 12.4%, which was modestly below our long-term financial goal of 13% to 15%. Return on assets was 1.01% for the full year. We are very pleased with our core fundamentals for the full year, including revenue growth of 6%, average loan growth of 7% and average core deposit growth of 9%, and we delivered positive operating leverage for the third consecutive year.
Slide 3 shows similar financial highlights for the fourth quarter. Earnings per common share of $0.21 was up 11% year-over-year. Fourth quarter return on tangible common equity was 12.4% while fourth quarter return on assets was 1%. 
We again produced solid revenue growth despite the challenging interest rate environment. The year-over-year revenue growth was 9% with both net interest income and noninterest income contributing to the increase. We were particularly pleased with the 17% year-over-year increase in noninterest income in the fourth quarter, benefiting from performance in capital markets, mortgage banking and SBA loan sales, among others. Expense growth was well controlled with noninterest expense up only 3% year-over-year. Our efficiency ratio for the quarter was 63.7%, a 250 basis point improvement from the year-ago quarter. 
High-quality balance sheet growth included an 8% year-over-year increase in average core deposits and a 6% increase in average loans and leases. Growth in average core deposits more than fully funded average loan growth. As we've noted in the past several quarters, while the value of core deposits may not be fully appreciated, we believe that our strong core deposit franchise will prove to be a key differentiator in a rising rate environment. 
We remain pleased with our credit quality with only 18 basis points of net charge-offs in the fourth quarter and 79 basis points of nonperforming assets. Our capital ratios remained strong as well. Tangible common equity ended the quarter at 7.81% while common equity Tier 1 was 9.80%. 
Slide 4 provides a summary of the income statement, including some additional details on our noninterest income and noninterest expense for the quarter. Relative to last year's fourth quarter, total reported revenue increased 9% to $778 million. Spread revenues accounted for less than half of the increases as net interest income increased 5% to $505 million. We benefited from 8% average earning asset growth, partially offset by 9 basis points of net interest margin compression. The NIM was negatively impacted by mixed shift on both sides of the balance sheet, most notably, the increase in low-yielding LCR-compliant securities in our earning assets and higher-cost senior bank notes in our funding mix.
We continue to remain disciplined in pricing at both loan and deposits. During the 2015 fourth quarter, Congress passed a provision in the Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act, more commonly referred to as the Highway Bill, which reduced and capped dividends paid by the Federal Reserve to banks with assets greater than $10 billion, including Huntington. The reduction in these dividends is expected to negatively impact net interest income by approximately $7 million in 2016.
We were pleased with our fee income performance in the quarter as more than 60% of the year-over-year revenue increase came from noninterest income. Specifically, reported noninterest income was $272 million, an increase of $39 million or 17% from the year-ago quarter. Highlights included an 8% increase in service charges on deposit accounts and continued momentum incurred in payment processing income. Mortgage banking income increased 124% from the year-ago quarter as a result of an $11 million increase in mortgage origination and secondary marketing revenues, coupled with a $5 million increase from the MSR hedging-related activities.
Other income included a $3 million gain on the sale of Huntington Asset Advisors, Huntington Asset Services and Unified Financial Services, which was included in the quarter's merger and acquisition-related significant item. The decision to sell these noncore businesses allow us to focus on the core wealth business and continue to reposition the regional banking and Huntington Private Client group segment for better growth and returns in coming quarters. The sale is expected to reduce noninterest income by approximately $14 million in 2016, primarily in the trust services line, and reduce noninterest expense by approximately $22 million in 2016, primarily in the personal expense line.
Reported noninterest expense in the 2015 fourth quarter was $499 million, an increase of $15 million or 3% from the year-ago quarter. This quarter's noninterest expense included 2 significant items: $8 million of franchise repositioning expense related to branch closures, facilities impairments and personnel actions; and $3 million of merger-related expense from the Huntington Technology Finance acquisition and the previously mentioned sale of Huntington Asset Advisors, Huntington Asset Services and Unified Financial Services. Noninterest expense adjusted for significant items in both quarters increased $25 million or 5% year-over-year. Of this increase, approximately $14 million was related to the acquisition of Macquarie Equipment Finance, which we have rebranded Huntington Technology Finance.
During the fourth quarter, the FDIC announced the surcharge on banks with assets in excess of $10 billion, including Huntington. We expect the surcharge will negatively impact our FDIC insurance expense by approximately $13 million in 2016. 
Turning to Slide 5. Average loans and leases increased $2.7 billion or 6% year-over-year as we again experienced year-over-year growth in every  portfolio. Average securities increased $2.1 billion or 17%, primarily reflecting growth in LCR-compliant securities and, to a lesser extent, growth in direct-purchase municipal securities originated by our commercial segment. Average commercial industrial loans grew $1.3 billion or 7%, primarily driven by a $1.1 billion increase in asset finance, $0.8 billion of which came via the Huntington Technology Finance acquisition. 
The quarter also benefited from seasonal strength in auto floor plan lending and growth in corporate lending while ut core middle market business banking saw modest portfolio reductions. Average automobile loans grew $0.8 billion or 9% from the year-ago quarter. The 2015 fourth quarter represented the eighth consecutive quarter of more than $1 billion of auto loan originations.
Auto Finance remains a core competency of Huntington, and as detailed on the slides and the appendix, we have remained consistent in our strategy, which is built around a dealer-centric model and focused on prime borrowers. Our underwriting has not changed. In fact, while industry volumes were up around 5% to 6% in 2015, our origination volumes were essentially flat, reflecting our lending discipline.
Yields on new auto paper dipped slightly in the fourth quarter to the 2.90% to 2.95% range, just above the 3% in the prior quarter. We also saw the normal seasonal shift to new car sales in the quarter, resulting in a mixed shift reduction in the overall yield. We expect the new-used mix will return to more normal levels in the first quarter.
Moving to the right side of the slide and the right side of the balance sheet. Average total deposits increased $4.6 billion or 9% over the year-ago quarter, including the $3.9 billion or 8% increase in average core deposits. Average noninterest-bearing demand deposits increased $2 billion or 13% year-over-year, and average interest-bearing demand deposits increased $1 billion or 16%. These growth numbers reflect our continued focus on new customer checking households and commercial relationship account acquisition. 
Average money market deposits increased $1.4 billion or 8% year-over-year, reflecting our continued efforts to deepen banking relationships and increase share of wallet. We also continue to remix the consumer deposit base out of higher-cost CDs into other less expensive deposit products. Average core CDs decreased $0.6 billion or 21% year-over-year.
As shown on Slide 5, average total demand deposits accounted for 38% of non-equity funding in 2015 fourth quarter while money market deposits accounted for 31%. By contrast, average core CDs accounted for only 4% of our non-equity funding in the quarter.
As we have highlighted in the last few quarters, the year-over-year growth in our total core deposits more than fully funded our average loan growth over this period. Average long-term debt increased $2.9 billion or 72% as a result of 4 bank-level senior debt issuances this year, totaling $3.1 billion, including $850 million issued in November as well as the assumption of $500 million of debt in the Huntington Technology Finance acquisition. These long-term debt issuances allowed us to reduce average short-term borrowings by $2.2 billion or 80% from the year-ago quarter. While this trade had a negative impact on the net interest margin, the long-term debt provides us with advantages of long-term stable funding. 
Average broker deposits increased by $100 million. We continue to view wholesale funding sources as a cost-efficient means for funding balance sheet growth, including LCR-related securities growth, while managing core deposit expense and maintaining sales focus on acquiring core checking account customers.
Slide 6 shows our net interest margin plotted against earning asset yields and interest-bearing liability costs. Fourth quarter NIM decreased 9 basis points year-over-year and 7 basis points linked quarter to 3.09%. Recall that the third quarter of 2015 net interest margin benefited from approximately 2 basis points of interest recoveries in the commercial portfolio. We continue to experience pricing pressure across most asset classes through the -- though the majority of the compression reflected unfavorable mixed shift on both sides of the balance sheet, most notably, the growth in LCR-compliant securities funded by senior bank debt issuance.
While we were encouraged by the December interest rate increase by the FOMC, the impact on the fourth quarter's net interest margin was negligible. Going forward, we expect modest interest margin pressure to remain a headwind as several asset classes continue to price lower, given average portfolio of rates above new money rates, despite the recent increases in LIBOR and prime. Based on our current outlook, we remain comfortable reaffirming that the net interest margin will remain above 3% in 2016.
Slide 7 provides an update on our asset sensitivity positioning and how we manage interest rate risk. We continue to have a relatively neutral balance sheet, largely due to our swap portfolio. As shown in the chart on top, our modeling estimates that net interest income would benefit by 0.3% if interest rates were to gradually ramp 200 basis points in addition to increases already reflected in the current implied forward curve, unchanged from a quarter ago. In a hypothetical scenario, without the $8.5 billion of asset swaps, the estimated benefit would approximate positive 3.4% in the up 200 basis point ramp scenario. The chart on the bottom of the slide shows our $8.5 billion asset swap portfolio and the $5.9 billion liability swap portfolio, including their respective average remaining lives and their impact on net interest income.  
The incremental benefit of the swaps was $29 million in the 2015 fourth  quarter, up from $28 million in the 2015 third quarter and $24 million in the year-ago quarter. As we have stated previously, our asset swap portfolio is a laddered portfolio. There are no cliffs looming on the horizon, and during the 2015 fourth quarter, $800 million of the asset swaps mature. As we communicated a few quarters ago, we intend to allow maturing asset swaps this year to run off, gradually shifting our balance sheet positioning more asset-sensitive. As of year-end, $3.6 billion of swaps was scheduled to mature over the next 12 months.
Slide 8 shows the trends in our capital ratios. Our risk-based regulatory capital ratios improved modestly from the prior quarter-end while tangible common equity, or TCE, declined slightly. We repurchased 2.5 million common shares during the fourth quarter at an average price of $11.59 per share in a total of 23 million common shares on average price of $10.93 over the full year. Coupled with cash dividends, we effectively returned approximately $400 million of capital to shareholders during 2015. We have 166 million of authorized repurchase capacity remaining for the final 2 quarters under our 366 million share repurchase authorization.
Slide 9 provides an overview of our loan loss provision, net charge-offs and allowance for credit losses. Credit performance remained solid and in line with our expectations. The loan loss provision was $36.5 million in the fourth quarter compared to $21.8 million of net charge-offs. Net charge-offs remained well controlled at only 18 basis points or well below our long-term expectations of 35 to 55 basis points. Net charge-offs for the full year were also 18 basis points.
The ACL ratio ticked up one basis point to 1.33% of loans and leases compared to 1.32% at the end of the prior quarter. The ratio of allowance to nonaccrual loans eased to 180% compared to 184% a quarter ago due to a slight uptick in NALs. We believe the allowance is appropriate and reflects the underlying credit quality of our loan portfolio.
Slide 10 shows trends on nonperforming assets, delinquencies and criticized assets. The chart on the upper left shows a slight increase in the nonperforming asset ratio for the quarter to 79 basis points compared to 77 basis points a quarter ago. The increase primarily reflected 2 oil and gas exploration and production credits, which replaced a nonaccrual during the quarter. The chart on the upper right reflects our 90-day delinquencies, which remained flat from a quarter ago. The bottom left shows the criticized asset ratio, which also remains unchanged. Finally, the chart on the bottom right shows NPA inflows of the percentage of beginning period loans of 29 basis points in fourth quarter, again, unchanged from the prior quarter. 
Let me now turn the presentation over to Steve."

Our Fair Play banking philosophy, our welcome culture and our optimal customer relationship, or OCR, focus continues to drive what we believe to be industry-leading customer acquisition. 
Slide 11 illustrate these long-term trends in consumer and commercial customer acquisition. We've increased our consumer checking households and our business checking relationships by 8% and 5% compounded annual growth rates since 2010. While the law of large numbers might be beginning to weigh on these growth rates, the underlying customer growth rates remain impressive. These robust customer growth rates have allowed us to post the associated revenue growth you can see in the 2 lower charts on the slide. And we're particularly pleased with the recent trend, visible on the chart on the bottom left, as the past 3 quarters have shown an improved momentum in the consumer household revenue metrics as we've lapped the last fee change we implemented under our Fair Play philosophy and continued to realize the benefits of the underlying customer growth. You've heard me say this before, but our focus remains on growing revenues. We will continue to grow revenues despite the challenging environment.
Although slides have been slightly redesigned from what you are used to seeing, Slide 12 and 13 illustrate the continued success of our OCR strategy and deepening our consumer and commercial relationships. As we've stated before, our strategy is not about gaining market share -- our strategy is about gaining market share and share of wallet. Now this strategy is built around increasing the number of products and services we provide to our customers, knowing that this will translate both into more loyal, satisfied and stickier customers as well as revenue growth. As of year-end, almost 52% of our consumer checking households use 6 or more products and services, and that's up from 49% a year ago. Correspondingly, our consumer checking account household revenue was up 13% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. Similarly, 44% of our commercial customers use 4 or more products or services at year-end, up from 42% a year ago. Again, this is translated directly to revenue growth as commercial revenue increased 4% year-over-year. 
We introduced the next 2 slides to you last quarter and many of you indicated how helpful you found them. Slide 14 illustrates trends in the unemployment rate across our 6 core Midwestern states as well as other leading coincident and lagging economic data for the region. Slide 15 takes a deeper look at the trend in the unemployment rates in our largest metropolitan markets. 
Despite the recent volatility exhibited in the equity and commodity markets, we remain bullish on our core Midwestern footprint. Our small- and medium-sized commercial customers continue to express confidence in their businesses and while consumers continue to benefit from recovering real estate markets, low energy prices and early signs of wage inflation in certain markets, such us here and Columbus. The auto industry is an important component of the economy and our footprint, and it appears poised for another stellar year in 2016. 
Other industries that contribute meaningfully to the regional economy, such as health care, medical devices, medical technology and higher education, amongst others, also remained strong. Our small business customers continue to experience strong performance and improving balance sheets. Our SBA lending also remains quite robust. 
I find the chart in the lower right on Slide 14 particularly encouraging. This chart shows the state-leading economic indices, as reported by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, for our 6-day footprint, all of which are projected to be positive over the next 6 months. The chart in the bottom left in Slide 14 shows that unemployment rates in our footprint states continue to trend positively, including recent improvement in West Virginia following several challenging months as they dealt the impact of lower coal prices.
Unemployment rates in most of our footprint states remain in line with or better than the national average. The chart on the bottom of Slide 15 shows a similar trend for our 10 largest deposit market, which collectively account for more than 80% of our total deposit franchise. As detailed in the chart, the majority of these markets continue to trend favorably and 7 to 10 markets currently enjoy unemployment rates below the national average. And this is quite a departure from several years ago when most of these markets were above the national average.
In 2014, we introduced long-term financial goals, including positive operating leverage annually. Slide 16 shows that we've delivered on our commitment for positive operating leverage in 2015, our third consecutive year to achieve this goal. Further, we also delivered on our commitment for positive operating leverage, both including and excluding the highly accretive Huntington Technology Finance acquisition.
Over the course of the past year, some of you expressed concern about our ability to deliver this commitment in 2015 and while others have questioned the prudence of such a commitment even in the first place. So therefore rather than take a victory lap or gloating too much on the accomplishment, I think it's important to reflect back both on the impetus for establishing annual positive operating leverage as one of our long-term financial goal and why it's made us a better company. 
Just a few years ago, some shareholders questioned our spending discipline as we invest in the future while the related revenue growth was often difficult to ascertain because continued refinements of our Fair Play philosophy masked the underlying momentum and the ultimate return on those investments was not always easily enough quantified. But we continue to invest thoughtfully, strategically and opportunistically for the future. However, we've committed to our owners that we would better pace our investments with revenue growth and improved transparency. 
You can now see the fruit of these commitments on our daily culture in Huntington, a culture in which continuous improvement, a focus on driving sustained revenue growth and accountability for every dollar of investment has been established as an absolute expectation. We've developed the culture in which our share owners should expect, more often than not, that we will deliver positive operating leverage as we constantly strive to post improved returns and top-tier performance. 
With that, let's turn to Slide 17% for some closing remarks and our initial 2016 expectation. We continue to manage the company with a focus on delivering consistent, through the cycle, shareholder returns. This strategy entails reducing short-term volatility, achieving top-tier performance over the long term and maintaining our aggregate moderate to low risk profile throughout. We've successfully built a strong distinguished consumer brand with differentiated products and superior customer service. We continue to execute our strategy and to adapt or adjust to our environment where necessary.
We completed and integrated the highly accretive acquisition of Macquarie Equity Finance, which we rebranded Huntington Technology Finance, or HTF. Our past investments also continue to pay off, such as our data analytics effort, which will drive better customer targeting and ongoing efforts to improve sales execution across the franchise and grow revenue. None of our investments are mature. We also continue to invest and enhance sales management, digital technology, further investments in data analytics and optimizing our retail distribution network, all of which will help drive future performance.
The early anecdotal evidence from the build-out of our Meijer in-store strategy in the back half of 2015 is very positive. It point towards a faster ramp than in prior in-store branch openings. We've refined our in-store execution over the past several years to drive this improved performance. And these new stores represented some of the best location which would, therefore, also naturally lend themselves to stronger results. 
We remain bullish on the economic vitality and economic outlook of our core Midwest footprint while we're prudently monitoring certain industries or sectors potentially impacted by global macroeconomic development, such as oil and gas exploration and production. We believe these risks remain well contained within our portfolio, and the majority of our core consumer and small medium-sized businesses and customers enjoy a positive near-term outlook. Customer sentiment also remains positive. Commercial loan utilization rates showed a slight increase for the third consecutive quarter, and loan pipelines are steady. Competitive pressures across our businesses show signs of stabilizing while our commitment to be disciplined lenders has not wavered. 2016, our commercial team will be refocusing on our core middle market and small business customers following the recent years focused on building out our specialty lending verticals. Our commitment to consumers remains constant.
In summary, we're pleased with our 2015 results and are optimistic as we enter 2016. Just as we did last year, we built our 2016 budget assuming no benefit from interest rates and have established contingency plans should an even more challenging environment materialize. We control our own destiny, and once again, our focus and execution will deliver for our share owners in 2016. 
While we expect NIM pressure will remain a headwind in the near term, we expect to grow revenue despite the pressure. That said, we continue to expect the NIM will bottom out later this year, assuming no interest rate increase, and will remain above 3%. And further, we expect to grow both net interest income and noninterest income. We expect 2016 full year revenue growth will be consistent with our 4% to 6% long-term financial goal, excluding significant items and net MSR activity. 
As you should have come to expect from us, we will continue to invest in our businesses, but we'll pace those investments consistent with our revenue outlook. The bulk of these investments will remain focused on technology, including data analytics, digital and mobile and improved sales execution. We continue to manage our home portfolio closely, particularly sectors and specific relationships most likely to be affected by recent market volatility with strengthening dollar, declining commodity values and other macroeconomic factors. I'm incrementally more concerned today about our credit outlook than I was when we spoke a quarter ago, but I stress that we do not see significant deterioration of the near-term horizon.
Given those absolute low level of our credit metrics, recent global economic volatility and the strength of the dollar, we expect some volatility in our credit metric going forward and anticipate that loan loss provision for both ourselves and the broader industry will likely begin to increase sometime in 2016. On the other hand, we expect our net charge-offs will remain in or below our long-term expected range of 35 to 55 basis points. 
Finally, I always like to close with the reminder that there are high-level alignment below the board and management and our shareholders. The board and our colleagues are collectively the sixth largest shareholder of Huntington. We have hold the retirement requirements on certain shares and are appropriately focused on driving sustained long-term performance. We're highly focused on our commitment to being good stewards of shareholder's capital. 
So now I'll turn it back over to Mark so we can begin the Q&A."

We have great results to share with you today, and we're very pleased with how we are positioned for 2016. 
For the past 6 years, Huntington's customer-centric strategy has resulted in growth in market share and in share of wallet through execution through our distinctive Fair Play philosophy, our welcome culture and our superior customer service. 2015 was a year of continued disciplined execution of the strategy, producing solid results and delivering on our commitments to our customers, colleagues, communities and, most importantly, our shareholders.
We continue to invest in our colleagues and in the capabilities we need to continue to being an industry leader in customer experience, including digital, data analytics and cybersecurity. We also continue to optimize our customer-centric distribution strategy, including the accelerated build-out of our in-store strategy in Michigan. In addition, in 2015, we returned approximately $400 million of capital or more than 55% of net income to shareholders via dividends and buybacks.
Slide 2 shows some of the financial highlights for the year. Earnings per common share of $0.81 was up 13% from 2014 while tangible book value per share increased 4% to $6.91. Full year return on tangible common equity was 12.4%, which was modestly below our long-term financial goal of 13% to 15%. Return on assets was 1.01% for the full year. We are very pleased with our core fundamentals for the full year, including revenue growth of 6%, average loan growth of 7% and average core deposit growth of 9%, and we delivered positive operating leverage for the third consecutive year.
Slide 3 shows similar financial highlights for the fourth quarter. Earnings per common share of $0.21 was up 11% year-over-year. Fourth quarter return on tangible common equity was 12.4% while fourth quarter return on assets was 1%. 
We again produced solid revenue growth despite the challenging interest rate environment. Year-over-year revenue growth was 9% with both net interest income and noninterest income contributing to the increase. We were particularly pleased with the 17% year-over-year increase in noninterest income in the fourth quarter, benefiting from performance in capital markets, mortgage banking and SBA loan sales, among others. Expense growth was well controlled with noninterest expense up only 3% year-over-year. Our efficiency ratio for the quarter was 63.7%, a 250 basis point improvement from the year-ago quarter. 
High-quality balance sheet growth included an 8% year-over-year increase in average core deposits and a 6% increase in average loans and leases. Growth in average core deposits more than fully funded average loan growth. As we've noted the past several quarters, while the value of core deposits may not be fully appreciated, we believe that our strong core deposit franchise will prove to be a key differentiator in a rising rate environment. 
We remain pleased with our credit quality with only 18 basis points of net charge-offs in the fourth quarter and 79 basis points of nonperforming assets. Our capital ratios remained strong as well. Tangible common equity ended the quarter at 7.81% while common equity Tier 1 was 9.80%. 
Slide 4 provides a summary of the income statement, including some additional details on our noninterest income and noninterest expense for the quarter. Relative to last year's fourth quarter, total reported revenue increased 9% to $778 million. Spread revenues accounted for less than half of the increases as net interest income increased 5% to $505 million. We benefited from 8% average earning asset growth, partially offset by 9 basis points of net interest margin compression. The NIM was negatively impacted by mix shift on both sides of the balance sheet, most notably, the increase in low-yielding LCR-compliant securities in our earning assets and higher-cost senior bank notes in our funding mix.
We continue to remain disciplined in pricing at both loans and deposits. During the 2015 fourth quarter, Congress passed a provision in the Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act, more commonly referred to as the Highway Bill, which reduced and capped dividends paid by the Federal Reserve to banks with assets greater than $10 billion, including Huntington. The reduction in these dividends is expected to negatively impact net interest income by approximately $7 million in 2016.
We were pleased with our fee income performance in the quarter as more than 60% of the year-over-year revenue increase came from noninterest income. Specifically, reported noninterest income was $272 million, an increase of $39 million or 17% from the year-ago quarter. Highlights included an 8% increase in service charges on deposit accounts and continued momentum in card and payment processing income. Mortgage banking income increased 124% from the year-ago quarter as a result of an $11 million increase in mortgage origination and secondary marketing revenues, coupled with a $5 million increase from the MSR hedging-related activities.
Other income included a $3 million gain on the sale of Huntington Asset Advisors, Huntington Asset Services and Unified Financial Services, which was included in the quarter's merger and acquisition-related significant item. The decision to sell these noncore businesses allow us to focus on the core wealth business and continue to reposition the regional banking and Huntington Private Client group segment for better growth and returns in coming quarters. The sale is expected to reduce noninterest income by approximately $14 million in 2016, primarily in the trust services line, and reduce noninterest expense by approximately $22 million in 2016, primarily in the personnel expense line.
Reported noninterest expense in the 2015 fourth quarter was $499 million, an increase of $15 million or 3% from the year-ago quarter. This quarter's noninterest expense included 2 significant items: $8 million of franchise repositioning expense related to branch closures, facilities impairments and personnel actions; and $3 million of merger-related expense from the Huntington Technology Finance acquisition and the previously mentioned sale of Huntington Asset Advisors, Huntington Asset Services and Unified Financial Services. Noninterest expense adjusted for significant items in both quarters increased $25 million or 5% year-over-year. Of this increase, approximately $14 million was related to the acquisition of Macquarie Equipment Finance, which we have rebranded Huntington Technology Finance.
During the fourth quarter, the FDIC announced a surcharge on banks with assets in excess of $10 billion, including Huntington. We expect the surcharge will negatively impact our FDIC insurance expense by approximately $13 million in 2016. 
Turning to Slide 5. Average loans and leases increased $2.7 billion or 6% year-over-year as we again experienced year-over-year growth in every  portfolio. Average securities increased $2.1 billion or 17%, primarily reflecting growth in LCR-compliant securities and, to a lesser extent, growth in direct-purchase municipal securities originated by our commercial segment. Average Commercial and Industrial loans grew $1.3 billion or 7%, primarily driven by a $1.1 billion increase in asset finance, $0.8 billion of which came via the Huntington Technology Finance acquisition. 
The quarter also benefited from seasonal strength in Auto Floor Plan Lending and growth in Corporate lending while core middle market business banking saw modest portfolio reductions. Average automobile loans grew $0.8 billion or 9% from the year-ago quarter. The 2015 fourth quarter represented the eighth consecutive quarter of more than $1 billion of auto loan originations.
Auto Finance remains a core competency of Huntington, and as detailed on the slides in the appendix, we have remained consistent in our strategy, which is built around a dealer-centric model and focused on prime borrowers. Our underwriting has not changed. In fact, while industry volumes were up around 5% to 6% in 2015, our origination volumes were essentially flat, reflecting our lending discipline.
Yields on new auto paper dipped slightly in the fourth quarter to the 2.90% to 2.95% range, just above the 3% in the prior quarter. We also saw the normal seasonal shift to new car sales in the quarter, resulting in a mix shift reduction in the overall yield. We expect the new/used mix will return to more normal levels in the first quarter.
Moving to the right side of the slide and the right side of the balance sheet. Average total deposits increased $4.6 billion or 9% over the year-ago quarter, including a $3.9 billion or 8% increase in average core deposits. Average noninterest-bearing demand deposits increased $2 billion or 13% year-over-year, and average interest-bearing demand deposits increased $1 billion or 16%. These growth numbers reflect our continued focus on new customer checking households and commercial relationship account acquisition. 
Average money market deposits increased $1.4 billion or 8% year-over-year, reflecting our continued efforts to deepen banking relationships and increase share of wallet. We also continue to remix the consumer deposit base out of higher-cost CDs into other less expensive deposit products. Average core CDs decreased $0.6 billion or 21% year-over-year.
As shown on Slide 5, average total demand deposits accounted for 38% of non-equity funding in 2015 fourth quarter while money market deposits accounted for 31%. By contrast, average core CDs accounted for only 4% of our non-equity funding in the quarter.
As we have highlighted in the last few quarters, the year-over-year growth in our total core deposits more than fully funded our average loan growth over this period. Average long-term debt increased $2.9 billion or 72% as a result of 4 bank-level senior debt issuances this year, totaling $3.1 billion, including $850 million issued in November as well as the assumption of $500 million of debt in the Huntington Technology Finance acquisition. These long-term debt issuances allowed us to reduce average short-term borrowings by $2.2 billion or 80% from the year-ago quarter. While this trade had a negative impact on the net interest margin, the long-term debt provides us with advantages of long-term stable funding. 
Average broker deposits increased by $100 million. We continue to view wholesale funding sources as a cost-efficient means for funding balance sheet growth, including LCR-related securities growth, while managing core deposit expense and maintaining sales focus on acquiring core checking account customers.
Slide 6 shows our net interest margin plotted against earning asset yields and interest-bearing liability costs. Fourth quarter NIM decreased 9 basis points year-over-year and 7 basis points linked-quarter to 3.09%. Recall that the third quarter of 2015 net interest margin benefited from approximately 2 basis points of interest recoveries in the commercial portfolio. We continue to experience pricing pressure across most asset classes through the -- though the majority of the compression reflected unfavorable mix shift on both sides of the balance sheet, most notably, the growth in LCR-compliant securities funded by senior bank debt issuance.
While we were encouraged by the December interest rate increase by the FOMC, the impact on the fourth quarter's net interest margin was negligible. Going forward, we expect modest interest margin pressure to remain a headwind as several asset classes continue to price lower, given average portfolio of rates above new money rates, despite the recent increases in LIBOR and prime. Based on our current outlook, we remain comfortable reaffirming that the net interest margin will remain above 3% in 2016.
Slide 7 provides an update on our asset sensitivity positioning and how we manage interest rate risk. We continue to have a relatively neutral balance sheet, largely due to our swap portfolio. As shown in the chart on top, our modeling estimates that net interest income would benefit by 0.3% if interest rates were to gradually ramp 200 basis points in addition to increases already reflected in the current implied forward curve, unchanged from a quarter ago. In a hypothetical scenario, without the $8.5 billion of asset swaps, the estimated benefit would approximate positive 3.4% in the up 200 basis point ramp scenario. The chart on the bottom of the slide shows our $8.5 billion asset swap portfolio and the $5.9 billion liability swap portfolio, including their respective average remaining lives and their impact on net interest income.  
The incremental benefit of the swaps was $29 million in the 2015 fourth quarter, up from $28 million in the 2015 third quarter and $24 million in the year-ago quarter. As we have stated previously, our asset swap portfolio is a laddered portfolio. There are no cliffs looming on the horizon, and during the 2015 fourth quarter, $800 million of the asset swaps mature. As we communicated a few quarters ago, we intend to allow maturing asset swaps this year to run off; gradually shifting our balance sheet positioning more asset-sensitive. As of year-end, $3.6 billion of swaps were scheduled to mature over the next 12 months.
Slide 8 shows the trends in our capital ratios. Our risk-based regulatory capital ratios improved modestly from the prior quarter-end while tangible common equity or TCE, declined slightly. We repurchased 2.5 million common shares during the fourth quarter at an average price of $11.59 per share and a total of 23 million common shares at an average price of $10.93 over the full year. Coupled with cash dividends, we effectively returned approximately $400 million of capital to shareholders during 2015. We have 166 million of authorized repurchase capacity remaining for the final 2 quarters under our 366 million share repurchase authorization.
Slide 9 provides an overview of our loan loss provision, net charge-offs and allowance for credit losses. Credit performance remains solid and in line with our expectations. The loan loss provision was $36.5 million in the fourth quarter compared to $21.8 million of net charge-offs. Net charge-offs remained well controlled at only 18 basis points or well below our long-term expectations of 35 to 55 basis points. Net charge-offs for the full year were also 18 basis points.
The ACL ratio ticked up one basis point to 1.33% of loans and leases compared to 1.32% at the end of the prior quarter. The ratio of allowance to nonaccrual loans eased to 180% compared to 184% a quarter ago due to a slight uptick in NALs. We believe the allowance is appropriate and reflects the underlying credit quality of our loan portfolio.
Slide 10 shows trends in nonperforming assets, delinquencies and criticized assets. The chart on the upper left shows a slight increase in the nonperforming asset ratio for the quarter to 79 basis points compared to 77 basis points a quarter ago. The increase primarily reflected 2 oil and gas exploration and production credits, which were placed on nonaccrual during the quarter. The chart on the upper right reflects our 90-day delinquencies, which remained flat from a quarter ago. The bottom left shows the criticized asset ratio, which also remains unchanged. Finally, the chart on the bottom right shows NPA inflows as a percentage of beginning period loans at [ph] 29 basis points in fourth quarter, again, unchanged from the prior quarter. 
Let me now turn the presentation over to Steve."

Slide 11 illustrate these long-term trends in con",1831,"Thank you, Mac. Our ""Fair Play"" banking philosophy, our welcome culture and our optimal customer relationship, or OCR focus continues to drive what we believe to be industry-leading customer acquisition. 
Slide 11 illustrate these long-term trends in consumer and commercial customer acquisition. We've increased our consumer checking households and our business checking relationships by 8% and 5% compounded annual growth rates since 2010. While the law of large numbers might be beginning to weigh on these growth rates, the underlying customer growth rates remain impressive. These robust customer growth rates have allowed us to post the associated revenue growth you can see in the 2 lower charts on the slide. And we're particularly pleased with the recent trend, visible on the chart on the bottom left, as the past 3 quarters have shown improved momentum in consumer household revenue metrics as we've lapped the last fee change we implemented under our ""Fair Play"" philosophy and continued to realize the benefit of the underlying customer growth. You've heard me say this before, but our focus remains on growing revenues. We will continue to grow revenues despite the challenging environment.
Although slides have been slightly redesigned from what you are used to seeing, Slide 12 and 13 illustrate the continued success of our OCR strategy and deepening our consumer and commercial relationships. As we've stated before, our strategy is not about gaining market share -- our strategy is about gaining market share and share of wallet. Now this strategy is built around increasing the number of products and services we provide to our customers, knowing that this will translate both into more loyal, satisfied and stickier customers as well as revenue growth. As of year-end, almost 52% of our consumer checking households used 6 or more products and services; and that's up from 49% a year ago. Correspondingly, our consumer checking account household revenue was up 13% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. Similarly, 44% of our commercial customers used 4 or more products or services at year-end, up from 42% a year ago. Again, this is translated directly to revenue growth as commercial revenue increased 4% year-over-year. 
We introduced the next 2 slides to you last quarter and many of you indicated how helpful you found them. Slide 14 illustrates trends in the unemployment rate across our 6 core Midwestern states as well as other leading coincident and lagging economic data for the region. Slide 15 takes a deeper look at the trend in the unemployment rates in our largest metropolitan markets. 
Despite the recent volatility exhibited in the equity and commodity markets, we remain bullish on our core Midwestern footprint. Our small- and medium-sized commercial customers continue to express confidence in their businesses and while consumers continue to benefit from recovering real estate markets, low energy prices and early signs of wage inflation in certain markets, such us here and Columbus. The auto industry is an important component of the economy and our footprint, and it appears poised for another stellar year in 2016. 
Other industries that contribute meaningfully to the regional economy, such as health care, medical devices, medical technology and higher education, amongst others, also remained strong. Our small business customers continue to experience strong performance and improving balance sheets. Our SBA lending also remains quite robust. 
I find the chart in the lower right on Slide 14 particularly encouraging. This chart shows the state leading economic indices, as reported by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, for our 6 state footprint, all of which are projected to be positive over the next 6 months. The chart in the bottom left in Slide 14 shows that unemployment rates in our footprint states continue to trend positively, including recent improvement in West Virginia, following several challenging months as they dealt the impact of lower coal prices.
Unemployment rates in most of our footprint states remain in line with or better than the national average. The chart on the bottom of Slide 15 shows a similar trend for our 10 largest deposit markets, which collectively account for more than 80% of our total deposit franchise. As detailed in the chart, the majority of these markets continue to trend favorably and 7 to 10 markets currently enjoy unemployment rates below the national average. And this is quite a departure from several years ago when most of these markets were above the national average.
In 2014, we introduced long-term financial goals, including positive operating leverage annually. Slide 16 shows that we've delivered on our commitment for positive operating leverage in 2015, our third consecutive year to achieve this goal. Further, we also delivered on our commitment for positive operating leverage, both including and excluding the highly accretive Huntington Technology Finance acquisition.
Over the course of the past year, some of you expressed concern about our ability to deliver this commitment in 2015, while others have questioned the prudence of such a commitment even in the first place. So therefore rather than take a victory lap or gloating too much on the accomplishment, I think it's important to reflect back both on the impetus for establishing annual positive operating leverage as one of our long-term financial goal and why it's made us a better company. 
Just a few years ago, some shareholders questioned our spending discipline as we invested in the future while the related revenue growth was often difficult to ascertain because continued refinements of our ""Fair Play"" philosophy masked the underlying momentum and the ultimate return on those investments was not always easily enough quantified. But we continued to invest thoughtfully, strategically and opportunistically for the future. However, we've committed to our owners that we would better pace our investments with revenue growth and improved transparency. 
You can now see the fruit of these commitments on our daily culture in Huntington, a culture in which continuous improvement, a focus on driving sustained revenue growth and accountability for every dollar of investment has been established as an absolute expectation. We've developed a culture in which our share owners should expect, more often than not, that we will deliver positive operating leverage as we constantly strive to post improved returns and top-tier performance. 
With that, let's turn to Slide 17% for some closing remarks and our initial 2016 expectation. We continue to manage the company with a focus on delivering consistent -- through the cycle -- shareholder returns. This strategy entails reducing short-term volatility, achieving top-tier performance over the long term and maintaining our aggregate moderate to low risk profile throughout. We've successfully built a strong distinguished consumer brand with differentiated products and superior customer service. We continue to execute our strategies and to adapt or adjust to our environment where necessary.
We completed and integrated the highly accretive acquisition of Macquarie Equipment Finance, which we rebranded Huntington Technology Finance, or HTF. Other past investments also continue to pay off, such as our data analytics effort, which will drive better customer targeting and ongoing efforts to improve sales execution across the franchise and grow revenue. None of our investments are mature. We also continue to invest and enhance sales management, digital technology, further investments in data analytics and optimizing our retail distribution network; all of which will help drive future performance.
The early anecdotal evidence from the build-out of our Meijer in-store strategy in the back half of 2015 is very positive, pointing towards a faster ramp than in prior in-store branch openings. We've refined our in-store execution over the past several years to drive this improved performance. And these new stores represented some of the best locations; which would, therefore, also naturally lend themselves to stronger results. 
We remain bullish on the economic vitality and economic outlook of our core Midwest footprint while we're prudently monitoring certain industries or sectors potentially impacted by global macroeconomic development, such as oil and gas exploration and production. We believe these risks remain well contained within our portfolio, and the majority of our core consumer and small to medium-sized businesses and customers enjoy a positive near-term outlook. Customer sentiment also remains positive. Commercial loan utilization rates showed a slight increase for the third consecutive quarter, and loan pipelines are steady. Competitive pressures across our businesses show signs of stabilizing while our commitment to be disciplined lenders has not wavered. 2016, our commercial team will be refocusing on our core middle market and small business customers following the recent years focus on building out our specialty lending verticals. Our commitment to consumers remains constant.
In summary, we're pleased with our 2015 results and are optimistic as we enter 2016. Just as we did last year, we built our 2016 budget assuming no benefit from interest rates and have established contingency plans should an even more challenging environment materialize. We control our own destiny, and once again, our focus and execution will deliver for our share owners in 2016. 
While we expect NIM pressure will remain a headwind in the near term, we expect to grow revenue despite the pressure. That said, we continue to expect the NIM will bottom out later this year, assuming no interest rate increase, and will remain above 3%. And further, we expect to grow both net interest income and noninterest income. We expect 2016 full year revenue growth will be consistent with our 4% to 6% long-term financial goal, excluding significant items and net MSR activity. 
As you should have come to expect from us, we will continue to invest in our businesses, but we'll pace those investments consistent with our revenue outlook. The bulk of these investments will remain focused on technology, including data analytics, digital and mobile and improved sales execution. We continue to manage our loan portfolios closely, particularly sectors and specific relationships most likely to be affected by recent market volatility, the strengthening dollar, declining commodity values and other macroeconomic factors. I'm incrementally more concerned today about our credit outlook than I was when we spoke a quarter ago, but I stress that we do not see significant deterioration of the near-term horizon.
Given the absolute low level of our credit metrics, recent global economic volatility and the strength of the dollar, we expect some volatility in our credit metric going forward and anticipate that loan loss provisioning for both ourselves and the broader industry will likely begin to increase sometime in 2016. On the other hand, we expect our net charge-offs will remain in or below our long-term expected range of 35 to 55 basis points. 
Finally, I always like to close with the reminder that there is a high-level of alignment between the Board and management and our shareholders. The Board and our colleagues are collectively the sixth largest shareholder of Huntington. We have holder [ph] retirement requirements upon certain shares and are appropriately focused on driving sustained long-term performance. We're highly focused on our commitment to being good stewards of shareholder's capital. 
So now I'll turn it back over to Mark so we can begin the Q&A."

278614,321825730,920139,"Huntington Bancshares Incorporated, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 21, 2016",2016-01-21,"Earnings Calls","Huntington Bancshares Incorporated","Executives","Thanks, Mark. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. We appreciate your interest in Huntington. We have great results to share with you today, and we're very pleased with how we are positioned for 2016. For the past 6 years, Huntington's custo",2444,"Thanks, Mark. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. We appreciate your interest in Huntington. We have great results to share with you today, and we're very pleased with how we are positioned for 2016. 
For the past 6 years, Huntington's customer-centric strategy has resulted in growth in market share and in share of wallet through execution through our distinctive Fair Play philosophy, our welcome culture and our superior customer service. 2015 was a year of continued disciplined execution of the strategy, producing solid results and delivering on our commitments to our customers, colleagues, communities and, most importantly, our shareholders.
We continue to invest in our colleagues and in the capabilities we need to continue to being an industry leader in customer experience, including digital, data analytics and cybersecurity. We also continue to optimize our customer-centric distribution strategy, including the accelerated build-out of our in-store strategy in Michigan. In addition, in 2015, we returned approximately $400 million of capital or more than 55% of net income to shareholders via dividends and buybacks.
Slide 2 shows some of the financial highlights for the year. Earnings per common share of $0.81 was up 13% from 2014 while tangible book value per share increased 4% to $6.91. Full year return on tangible common equity was 12.4%, which was modestly below our long-term financial goal of 13% to 15%. Return on assets was 1.01% for the full year. We are very pleased with our core fundamentals for the full year, including revenue growth of 6%, average loan growth of 7% and average core deposit growth of 9%, and we delivered positive operating leverage for the third consecutive year.
Slide 3 shows similar financial highlights for the fourth quarter. Earnings per common share of $0.21 was up 11% year-over-year. Fourth quarter return on tangible common equity was 12.4% while fourth quarter return on assets was 1%. 
We again produced solid revenue growth despite the challenging interest rate environment. Year-over-year revenue growth was 9% with both net interest income and noninterest income contributing to the increase. We were particularly pleased with the 17% year-over-year increase in noninterest income in the fourth quarter, benefiting from performance in capital markets, mortgage banking and SBA loan sales, among others. Expense growth was well controlled with noninterest expense up only 3% year-over-year. Our efficiency ratio for the quarter was 63.7%, a 250 basis point improvement from the year-ago quarter. 
High-quality balance sheet growth included an 8% year-over-year increase in average core deposits and a 6% increase in average loans and leases. Growth in average core deposits more than fully funded average loan growth. As we've noted the past several quarters, while the value of core deposits may not be fully appreciated, we believe that our strong core deposit franchise will prove to be a key differentiator in a rising rate environment. 
We remain pleased with our credit quality with only 18 basis points of net charge-offs in the fourth quarter and 79 basis points of nonperforming assets. Our capital ratios remained strong as well. Tangible common equity ended the quarter at 7.81% while common equity Tier 1 was 9.80%. 
Slide 4 provides a summary of the income statement, including some additional details on our noninterest income and noninterest expense for the quarter. Relative to last year's fourth quarter, total reported revenue increased 9% to $778 million. Spread revenues accounted for less than half of the increases as net interest income increased 5% to $505 million. We benefited from 8% average earning asset growth, partially offset by 9 basis points of net interest margin compression. The NIM was negatively impacted by mix shift on both sides of the balance sheet, most notably, the increase in low-yielding LCR-compliant securities in our earning assets and higher-cost senior bank notes in our funding mix.
We continue to remain disciplined in pricing at both loans and deposits. During the 2015 fourth quarter, Congress passed a provision in the Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act, more commonly referred to as the Highway Bill, which reduced and capped dividends paid by the Federal Reserve to banks with assets greater than $10 billion, including Huntington. The reduction in these dividends is expected to negatively impact net interest income by approximately $7 million in 2016.
We were pleased with our fee income performance in the quarter as more than 60% of the year-over-year revenue increase came from noninterest income. Specifically, reported noninterest income was $272 million, an increase of $39 million or 17% from the year-ago quarter. Highlights included an 8% increase in service charges on deposit accounts and continued momentum in card and payment processing income. Mortgage banking income increased 124% from the year-ago quarter as a result of an $11 million increase in mortgage origination and secondary marketing revenues, coupled with a $5 million increase from the MSR hedging-related activities.
Other income included a $3 million gain on the sale of Huntington Asset Advisors, Huntington Asset Services and Unified Financial Services, which was included in the quarter's merger and acquisition-related significant item. The decision to sell these noncore businesses allow us to focus on the core wealth business and continue to reposition the regional banking and Huntington Private Client group segment for better growth and returns in coming quarters. The sale is expected to reduce noninterest income by approximately $14 million in 2016, primarily in the trust services line, and reduce noninterest expense by approximately $22 million in 2016, primarily in the personnel expense line.
Reported noninterest expense in the 2015 fourth quarter was $499 million, an increase of $15 million or 3% from the year-ago quarter. This quarter's noninterest expense included 2 significant items: $8 million of franchise repositioning expense related to branch closures, facilities impairments and personnel actions; and $3 million of merger-related expense from the Huntington Technology Finance acquisition and the previously mentioned sale of Huntington Asset Advisors, Huntington Asset Services and Unified Financial Services. Noninterest expense adjusted for significant items in both quarters increased $25 million or 5% year-over-year. Of this increase, approximately $14 million was related to the acquisition of Macquarie Equipment Finance, which we have rebranded Huntington Technology Finance.
During the fourth quarter, the FDIC announced a surcharge on banks with assets in excess of $10 billion, including Huntington. We expect the surcharge will negatively impact our FDIC insurance expense by approximately $13 million in 2016. 
Turning to Slide 5. Average loans and leases increased $2.7 billion or 6% year-over-year as we again experienced year-over-year growth in every  portfolio. Average securities increased $2.1 billion or 17%, primarily reflecting growth in LCR-compliant securities and, to a lesser extent, growth in direct-purchase municipal securities originated by our commercial segment. Average Commercial and Industrial loans grew $1.3 billion or 7%, primarily driven by a $1.1 billion increase in asset finance, $0.8 billion of which came via the Huntington Technology Finance acquisition. 
The quarter also benefited from seasonal strength in Auto Floor Plan Lending and growth in Corporate lending while core middle market business banking saw modest portfolio reductions. Average automobile loans grew $0.8 billion or 9% from the year-ago quarter. The 2015 fourth quarter represented the eighth consecutive quarter of more than $1 billion of auto loan originations.
Auto Finance remains a core competency of Huntington, and as detailed on the slides in the appendix, we have remained consistent in our strategy, which is built around a dealer-centric model and focused on prime borrowers. Our underwriting has not changed. In fact, while industry volumes were up around 5% to 6% in 2015, our origination volumes were essentially flat, reflecting our lending discipline.
Yields on new auto paper dipped slightly in the fourth quarter to the 2.90% to 2.95% range, just above the 3% in the prior quarter. We also saw the normal seasonal shift to new car sales in the quarter, resulting in a mix shift reduction in the overall yield. We expect the new/used mix will return to more normal levels in the first quarter.
Moving to the right side of the slide and the right side of the balance sheet. Average total deposits increased $4.6 billion or 9% over the year-ago quarter, including a $3.9 billion or 8% increase in average core deposits. Average noninterest-bearing demand deposits increased $2 billion or 13% year-over-year, and average interest-bearing demand deposits increased $1 billion or 16%. These growth numbers reflect our continued focus on new customer checking households and commercial relationship account acquisition. 
Average money market deposits increased $1.4 billion or 8% year-over-year, reflecting our continued efforts to deepen banking relationships and increase share of wallet. We also continue to remix the consumer deposit base out of higher-cost CDs into other less expensive deposit products. Average core CDs decreased $0.6 billion or 21% year-over-year.
As shown on Slide 5, average total demand deposits accounted for 38% of non-equity funding in 2015 fourth quarter while money market deposits accounted for 31%. By contrast, average core CDs accounted for only 4% of our non-equity funding in the quarter.
As we have highlighted in the last few quarters, the year-over-year growth in our total core deposits more than fully funded our average loan growth over this period. Average long-term debt increased $2.9 billion or 72% as a result of 4 bank-level senior debt issuances this year, totaling $3.1 billion, including $850 million issued in November as well as the assumption of $500 million of debt in the Huntington Technology Finance acquisition. These long-term debt issuances allowed us to reduce average short-term borrowings by $2.2 billion or 80% from the year-ago quarter. While this trade had a negative impact on the net interest margin, the long-term debt provides us with advantages of long-term stable funding. 
Average broker deposits increased by $100 million. We continue to view wholesale funding sources as a cost-efficient means for funding balance sheet growth, including LCR-related securities growth, while managing core deposit expense and maintaining sales focus on acquiring core checking account customers.
Slide 6 shows our net interest margin plotted against earning asset yields and interest-bearing liability costs. Fourth quarter NIM decreased 9 basis points year-over-year and 7 basis points linked-quarter to 3.09%. Recall that the third quarter of 2015 net interest margin benefited from approximately 2 basis points of interest recoveries in the commercial portfolio. We continue to experience pricing pressure across most asset classes through the -- though the majority of the compression reflected unfavorable mix shift on both sides of the balance sheet, most notably, the growth in LCR-compliant securities funded by senior bank debt issuance.
While we were encouraged by the December interest rate increase by the FOMC, the impact on the fourth quarter's net interest margin was negligible. Going forward, we expect modest interest margin pressure to remain a headwind as several asset classes continue to price lower, given average portfolio of rates above new money rates, despite the recent increases in LIBOR and prime. Based on our current outlook, we remain comfortable reaffirming that the net interest margin will remain above 3% in 2016.
Slide 7 provides an update on our asset sensitivity positioning and how we manage interest rate risk. We continue to have a relatively neutral balance sheet, largely due to our swap portfolio. As shown in the chart on top, our modeling estimates that net interest income would benefit by 0.3% if interest rates were to gradually ramp 200 basis points in addition to increases already reflected in the current implied forward curve, unchanged from a quarter ago. In a hypothetical scenario, without the $8.5 billion of asset swaps, the estimated benefit would approximate positive 3.4% in the up 200 basis point ramp scenario. The chart on the bottom of the slide shows our $8.5 billion asset swap portfolio and the $5.9 billion liability swap portfolio, including their respective average remaining lives and their impact on net interest income.  
The incremental benefit of the swaps was $29 million in the 2015 fourth quarter, up from $28 million in the 2015 third quarter and $24 million in the year-ago quarter. As we have stated previously, our asset swap portfolio is a laddered portfolio. There are no cliffs looming on the horizon, and during the 2015 fourth quarter, $800 million of the asset swaps mature. As we communicated a few quarters ago, we intend to allow maturing asset swaps this year to run off; gradually shifting our balance sheet positioning more asset-sensitive. As of year-end, $3.6 billion of swaps were scheduled to mature over the next 12 months.
Slide 8 shows the trends in our capital ratios. Our risk-based regulatory capital ratios improved modestly from the prior quarter-end while tangible common equity or TCE, declined slightly. We repurchased 2.5 million common shares during the fourth quarter at an average price of $11.59 per share and a total of 23 million common shares at an average price of $10.93 over the full year. Coupled with cash dividends, we effectively returned approximately $400 million of capital to shareholders during 2015. We have 166 million of authorized repurchase capacity remaining for the final 2 quarters under our 366 million share repurchase authorization.
Slide 9 provides an overview of our loan loss provision, net charge-offs and allowance for credit losses. Credit performance remains solid and in line with our expectations. The loan loss provision was $36.5 million in the fourth quarter compared to $21.8 million of net charge-offs. Net charge-offs remained well controlled at only 18 basis points or well below our long-term expectations of 35 to 55 basis points. Net charge-offs for the full year were also 18 basis points.
The ACL ratio ticked up one basis point to 1.33% of loans and leases compared to 1.32% at the end of the prior quarter. The ratio of allowance to nonaccrual loans eased to 180% compared to 184% a quarter ago due to a slight uptick in NALs. We believe the allowance is appropriate and reflects the underlying credit quality of our loan portfolio.
Slide 10 shows trends in nonperforming assets, delinquencies and criticized assets. The chart on the upper left shows a slight increase in the nonperforming asset ratio for the quarter to 79 basis points compared to 77 basis points a quarter ago. The increase primarily reflected 2 oil and gas exploration and production credits, which were placed on nonaccrual during the quarter. The chart on the upper right reflects our 90-day delinquencies, which remained flat from a quarter ago. The bottom left shows the criticized asset ratio, which also remains unchanged. Finally, the chart on the bottom right shows NPA inflows as a percentage of beginning period loans at [ph] 29 basis points in fourth quarter, again, unchanged from the prior quarter. 
Let me now turn the presentation over to Steve."

Slide 11 illustrate these long-term trends in con",1831,"Thank you, Mac. Our ""Fair Play"" banking philosophy, our welcome culture and our optimal customer relationship, or OCR focus continues to drive what we believe to be industry-leading customer acquisition. 
Slide 11 illustrate these long-term trends in consumer and commercial customer acquisition. We've increased our consumer checking households and our business checking relationships by 8% and 5% compounded annual growth rates since 2010. While the law of large numbers might be beginning to weigh on these growth rates, the underlying customer growth rates remain impressive. These robust customer growth rates have allowed us to post the associated revenue growth you can see in the 2 lower charts on the slide. And we're particularly pleased with the recent trend, visible on the chart on the bottom left, as the past 3 quarters have shown improved momentum in consumer household revenue metrics as we've lapped the last fee change we implemented under our ""Fair Play"" philosophy and continued to realize the benefit of the underlying customer growth. You've heard me say this before, but our focus remains on growing revenues. We will continue to grow revenues despite the challenging environment.
Although slides have been slightly redesigned from what you are used to seeing, Slide 12 and 13 illustrate the continued success of our OCR strategy and deepening our consumer and commercial relationships. As we've stated before, our strategy is not about gaining market share -- our strategy is about gaining market share and share of wallet. Now this strategy is built around increasing the number of products and services we provide to our customers, knowing that this will translate both into more loyal, satisfied and stickier customers as well as revenue growth. As of year-end, almost 52% of our consumer checking households used 6 or more products and services; and that's up from 49% a year ago. Correspondingly, our consumer checking account household revenue was up 13% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. Similarly, 44% of our commercial customers used 4 or more products or services at year-end, up from 42% a year ago. Again, this is translated directly to revenue growth as commercial revenue increased 4% year-over-year. 
We introduced the next 2 slides to you last quarter and many of you indicated how helpful you found them. Slide 14 illustrates trends in the unemployment rate across our 6 core Midwestern states as well as other leading coincident and lagging economic data for the region. Slide 15 takes a deeper look at the trend in the unemployment rates in our largest metropolitan markets. 
Despite the recent volatility exhibited in the equity and commodity markets, we remain bullish on our core Midwestern footprint. Our small- and medium-sized commercial customers continue to express confidence in their businesses and while consumers continue to benefit from recovering real estate markets, low energy prices and early signs of wage inflation in certain markets, such us here and Columbus. The auto industry is an important component of the economy and our footprint, and it appears poised for another stellar year in 2016. 
Other industries that contribute meaningfully to the regional economy, such as health care, medical devices, medical technology and higher education, amongst others, also remained strong. Our small business customers continue to experience strong performance and improving balance sheets. Our SBA lending also remains quite robust. 
I find the chart in the lower right on Slide 14 particularly encouraging. This chart shows the state leading economic indices, as reported by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, for our 6 state footprint, all of which are projected to be positive over the next 6 months. The chart in the bottom left in Slide 14 shows that unemployment rates in our footprint states continue to trend positively, including recent improvement in West Virginia, following several challenging months as they dealt the impact of lower coal prices.
Unemployment rates in most of our footprint states remain in line with or better than the national average. The chart on the bottom of Slide 15 shows a similar trend for our 10 largest deposit markets, which collectively account for more than 80% of our total deposit franchise. As detailed in the chart, the majority of these markets continue to trend favorably and 7 to 10 markets currently enjoy unemployment rates below the national average. And this is quite a departure from several years ago when most of these markets were above the national average.
In 2014, we introduced long-term financial goals, including positive operating leverage annually. Slide 16 shows that we've delivered on our commitment for positive operating leverage in 2015, our third consecutive year to achieve this goal. Further, we also delivered on our commitment for positive operating leverage, both including and excluding the highly accretive Huntington Technology Finance acquisition.
Over the course of the past year, some of you expressed concern about our ability to deliver this commitment in 2015, while others have questioned the prudence of such a commitment even in the first place. So therefore rather than take a victory lap or gloating too much on the accomplishment, I think it's important to reflect back both on the impetus for establishing annual positive operating leverage as one of our long-term financial goal and why it's made us a better company. 
Just a few years ago, some shareholders questioned our spending discipline as we invested in the future while the related revenue growth was often difficult to ascertain because continued refinements of our ""Fair Play"" philosophy masked the underlying momentum and the ultimate return on those investments was not always easily enough quantified. But we continued to invest thoughtfully, strategically and opportunistically for the future. However, we've committed to our owners that we would better pace our investments with revenue growth and improved transparency. 
You can now see the fruit of these commitments on our daily culture in Huntington, a culture in which continuous improvement, a focus on driving sustained revenue growth and accountability for every dollar of investment has been established as an absolute expectation. We've developed a culture in which our share owners should expect, more often than not, that we will deliver positive operating leverage as we constantly strive to post improved returns and top-tier performance. 
With that, let's turn to Slide 17% for some closing remarks and our initial 2016 expectation. We continue to manage the company with a focus on delivering consistent -- through the cycle -- shareholder returns. This strategy entails reducing short-term volatility, achieving top-tier performance over the long term and maintaining our aggregate moderate to low risk profile throughout. We've successfully built a strong distinguished consumer brand with differentiated products and superior customer service. We continue to execute our strategies and to adapt or adjust to our environment where necessary.
We completed and integrated the highly accretive acquisition of Macquarie Equipment Finance, which we rebranded Huntington Technology Finance, or HTF. Other past investments also continue to pay off, such as our data analytics effort, which will drive better customer targeting and ongoing efforts to improve sales execution across the franchise and grow revenue. None of our investments are mature. We also continue to invest and enhance sales management, digital technology, further investments in data analytics and optimizing our retail distribution network; all of which will help drive future performance.
The early anecdotal evidence from the build-out of our Meijer in-store strategy in the back half of 2015 is very positive, pointing towards a faster ramp than in prior in-store branch openings. We've refined our in-store execution over the past several years to drive this improved performance. And these new stores represented some of the best locations; which would, therefore, also naturally lend themselves to stronger results. 
We remain bullish on the economic vitality and economic outlook of our core Midwest footprint while we're prudently monitoring certain industries or sectors potentially impacted by global macroeconomic development, such as oil and gas exploration and production. We believe these risks remain well contained within our portfolio, and the majority of our core consumer and small to medium-sized businesses and customers enjoy a positive near-term outlook. Customer sentiment also remains positive. Commercial loan utilization rates showed a slight increase for the third consecutive quarter, and loan pipelines are steady. Competitive pressures across our businesses show signs of stabilizing while our commitment to be disciplined lenders has not wavered. 2016, our commercial team will be refocusing on our core middle market and small business customers following the recent years focus on building out our specialty lending verticals. Our commitment to consumers remains constant.
In summary, we're pleased with our 2015 results and are optimistic as we enter 2016. Just as we did last year, we built our 2016 budget assuming no benefit from interest rates and have established contingency plans should an even more challenging environment materialize. We control our own destiny, and once again, our focus and execution will deliver for our share owners in 2016. 
While we expect NIM pressure will remain a headwind in the near term, we expect to grow revenue despite the pressure. That said, we continue to expect the NIM will bottom out later this year, assuming no interest rate increase, and will remain above 3%. And further, we expect to grow both net interest income and noninterest income. We expect 2016 full year revenue growth will be consistent with our 4% to 6% long-term financial goal, excluding significant items and net MSR activity. 
As you should have come to expect from us, we will continue to invest in our businesses, but we'll pace those investments consistent with our revenue outlook. The bulk of these investments will remain focused on technology, including data analytics, digital and mobile and improved sales execution. We continue to manage our loan portfolios closely, particularly sectors and specific relationships most likely to be affected by recent market volatility, the strengthening dollar, declining commodity values and other macroeconomic factors. I'm incrementally more concerned today about our credit outlook than I was when we spoke a quarter ago, but I stress that we do not see significant deterioration of the near-term horizon.
Given the absolute low level of our credit metrics, recent global economic volatility and the strength of the dollar, we expect some volatility in our credit metric going forward and anticipate that loan loss provisioning for both ourselves and the broader industry will likely begin to increase sometime in 2016. On the other hand, we expect our net charge-offs will remain in or below our long-term expected range of 35 to 55 basis points. 
Finally, I always like to close with the reminder that there is a high-level of alignment between the board and management and our shareholders. The board and our colleagues are collectively the sixth largest shareholder of Huntington. We have holder [ph] retirement requirements upon certain shares and are appropriately focused on driving sustained long-term performance. We're highly focused on our commitment to being good stewards of shareholder's capital. 
So now I'll turn it back over to Mark so we can begin the Q&A."

So certainly, encouraged by what we see this quarter and definitely expect the trends to remain intact, especially relative to what you saw previous to this quarter."

We're pleased to report another quarter of solid results and believe 2016 is off to a good start. Huntington's customer-centric strategy continues to deliver consistent growth and market share and share of through execution of our distinctive Fair Play philosophy, our wealth and culture and our superior customer service.
Disciplined execution of our strategy and well-timed investments in our businesses over the past several years are producing solid results for our shareholders, our customers, our colleagues and our communities.
Slide 3 shows some of the financial highlights for the quarter. Earnings per common share of $0.20 was up 5% from the 2015 first quarter, while same-store book value per share increased 8% to $7.12. Return on tangible common equity was 11.9%, while return on assets was 0.96%. Core fundamental trends remain strong and reflected the benefit of our strategic investments over the past several years. Year-over-year revenue growth was 7% comprised 8% increase in net interest income and a 4% increase in noninterest income. We continue to believe that our ability to deliver consistent topline growth despite the challenging interest rate environment distinguishes Huntington from our peers.
We also believe that our disciplined Investment Strategy combined with the focus on achieving positive operating leverage on an annual basis is proving to be a key differentiator. While we achieved positive operating leverage for the quarter, noninterest expense increased 7% year-over-year reflecting our ongoing investments including 44 new in-store branches in digital and technology investments, such as our new mortgage origination platform that is currently been piloted.
Our efficiency ratio for the quarter was 64.6%, which remains well above our long-term financial goal of 56% to 59%. We will continue to work to improve our operating efficiency organically by growing revenue faster than expense, but we also continue to expect that the recently announced acquisition of FirstMerit, we will meaningful improvements in our pro forma efficiency.
Turning to the balance sheet, average loan growth was 6% year-over-year, while average core deposit growth was 5%, continuing a trend of year-over-year core deposit growth being greater than 5%. Overall, credit metrics remain solid, criticized assets remain stable. We incurred only 7 basis points of net charge-offs in the quarter as we continue to benefit from large commercial real estate recoveries. Nonperforming assets increased 23 basis points from the previous quarter with the majority of the increase centered in our oil and gas exploration and production and coal portfolios.
Our capital ratios remain strong. Tangible common equity ended the quarter at 7.89%, up 7 basis points from year-end. While all regulatory capital ratios except Common Equity Tier 1 increased meaningfully during the quarter due the issuance of $400 million of perpetual preferred shock on March 21.
Slide 4 provides a summary income statement, including some additional details on our noninterest income and noninterest expense for the quarter. Relative to the first quarter of 2015, total reported revenue increased 7% to $754 million. Spread revenues accounted for the majority of the increase as net interest income increased 8% to $512 million.
We benefited from 8% average earning asset growth, partially offset by 4 basis points of net interest margin compression. The NIM was negatively impacted by unfavorable mix shift on both sides of the balance sheet, most notably the increase in our low yielding LCR-compliant Securities and our earning assets and higher cost senior banknotes in our funding mix.
We continue to remain disciplined in pricing of both loans and deposits. Fee income increased 4% from the year ago quarter to $242 million, primarily driven by continued customer acquisition gains in relationship deepening. Highlights included a 13% increase in service charges on deposit accounts and a 12% increase in card and payment processing income. We also faced some headwinds in the quarter in mortgage banking in trust service income. Mortgage banking income decreased 19% from the year ago quarter as a result of a 5% decline in origination volume coupled with a $2 million decrease from net NSR activity.
Trust services income declined 21% year-over-year, primarily due to the sale of our funds management and services businesses at the end of last year. Reported noninterest expense in the 2016 first quarter was $491 million, an increase of $32 million or 7% from the year ago quarter. This quarter's noninterest expense included one significant item: $6 million of merger and acquisition related expense from the pending FirstMerit acquisition.
As detailed on Page 7 of the press release, noninterest expense adjusted for significant items in both quarters increased $29 million or 6% year-over-year. In March, the FDIC announced the final rule of proving the previously disclosed surcharge on banks with assets in excess of $10 billion, including Huntington. In our conference call last quarter we stated that the surcharge would negatively impact our FDIC insurance expense by approximately $13 million in 2016. Due to the delay in the implementation until July 1, we now expect the negative impact will be approximately $7 million this year.
Slide 5 details the trends in our balance sheet mix. Average loans leases increased $2.8 billion or 6% year-over-year, as most portfolios continue to experience year-over-year growth. Average securities increased $2.1 billion or 17%, primarily reflecting growth in LCR-compliant Securities into a lesser extent growth in our direct purchase Securities in our commercial banking segment. We are currently above the 100% threshold for liquidly coverage ratio.
Digging into the loan growth little deeper, average commercial and industrial loans grew $1.5 billion or 8%, primarily driven by a $0.8 billion increase in asset finance. The quarter also benefited from continued momentum in auto plan and broad-based commercial lending. Average automobile loans grew to $0.9 billion or 11% from the year ago quarter. Auto Finance remains a core competency of Huntington and we're committed to this business and reviewing our customers.
The first quarter of 2016 represented the ninth consecutive quarter of more than $1 billion of automobile loan originations. We have achieved this by remaining absolutely consistent in our strategy, which is built around the credit model that is focused on prime and subprime borrowers and a business model of high touch and local delivery.
As detailed on Slides 46 and 47, in the appendix, our underwriting has not changed and our credit performance remains superior. The on the new order paper rebounded slightly in the first quarter back up to around 3% compared to the 290 and 295 range in the fourth quarter. Recall yields last quarter were impacted by the normal seasonal mix shift towards new vehicle sales that occurred in the fourth quarter as manufacturers try to drive yearly volume goals, while the first quarter's originations reflected a return to more normal, new used mix.
The auto portfolio continues to perform very well. As expected, the seasonal increases in delinquencies and charge-offs we experienced in the fourth quarter -- this quarter, with delinquencies declining 26 basis points sequentially, and net charge-offs declining 5 basis points. Further if you compare our delinquencies and nonaccrual loans with the year ago quarter, you will see they are essentially flat.
Net charge-offs are modestly year-over-year will remain well below the levels which we underwrite the portfolio.
Staying on Slide 5 and moving to the right side, average total deposits increased $2.9 billion or 5% over the year ago quarter, including a $2.6 billion or 5% increase in average core deposits. We continue to see strong growth in demand deposits as average non-interest-bearing demand deposits increased $1.1 billion or 7% year-over-year. An average interest-bearing deposits increased $1.6 billion or 26%. This growth reflects our continued focus on new customer checking household and commercial relationship account acquisition as well as relationship deepening. All of which are detailed on Slides 11 through 13 that Steve will discuss later.
We also continue to remix the consumer deposit base at a higher cost CDs into other less expensive deposit products. Average core CDs increased to $0.5 billion or 19% year-over-year.
Average total demand deposits accounted for 37% of non-equity funding in the 2016 first quarter, while money market and savings deposits accounted for combined 38%. By contrast, average core CDs accounted only 3% of our non-equity funding in the quarter. Average total debt increased $2.1 billion or 34% as a result of 5 senior debt issuances over the past 5 quarters totaling $4.1 billion, including $1 billion issued in March of this year as well as the assumption of deaths in the Huntington Technology Finance acquisition.
The $1 billion senior debt issuance this quarter was part of our normal funding strategy.
Slide 6 shows our net interest margin plotted against our earning asset yield, interest-bearing liability costs and other deposit costs. First quarter NIM decreased 4 basis points year-over-year, but increased 2 basis points from the previous quarter to 3.11%. This quarter the net interest margin benefited from approximately 2 basis points of interest recoveries in the commercial real estate portfolio. And another 1 to 2 basis points in day counts.
Adjusting these benefits out of the first quarter margin we expect another 2 basis points contraction in the second quarter, but will remain comfortable reaffirming our previous guidance from last quarter that the net interest margin will remain above 3% for each quarter in 2016.
Slide 7 provides an update on our asset sensitivity positioning and how we manage interest rate risk. As shown in the chart on top, we estimate that net interest income would benefit by 3.6% if interest rates would gradually ramped 200 basis points in addition to increases reflected in the current and
This is an increase from what we estimated a quarter ago, as we recently updated our non-maturity deposit models resulting in a reduction in the sensitivity of these deposits. In addition, as we've discussed for some time, our assets beginning a period of study amortization as disclosed in our 10-K. We also proactively terminated $1.9 billion of swaps in January taking advantage of in the markets. As we've stated previously, our asset swap portfolio is a letter portfolio. There are no cliffs moving on the horizon. These actions coupled with changes in our overall balance sheet mix drove the increase in model asset sensitivity.
As shown on the bottom right, on a hypothetical scenario, the $5.8 billion of remaining asset swaps. The estimated benefit would approximate 5.4% up 200 basis points gradual ramp scenario.
The chart on the bottom of the slide shows our $5.8 billion asset swap portfolio and $5.8 billion liability swap portfolio, including the respective average remaining lives and their impact on net interest income. The incremental benefit of swaps was $24 million in the 2016 first quarter, down from $29 million in the 2015 fourth quarter and $25 million in the year ago quarter.
Slide 8 shows the trends in our capital ratios. Tangible common equity increased 7 basis points sequentially to 7.89%. All regulatory capital ratios improved meaningfully from the prior quarter end with the exception of Common Equity Tier 1 regulatory capital ratio, which declined slightly.
Late in the quarter, we issued $400 million of 6.25 fixed-rate non-committee preferred equity in order to take advantage of unusual market conditions and lower interest rate environment to lock in low cost permanent capital. With this issuance, we are now more in line with our peers with respect to the amount of preferred equity in our capital structure. Although, as market conditions allow, you may see us further optimize our capital structure in the future relative to the Basel III rules.
Slide 9 provides an overview of our loan loss provisions, net charge-offs and allowance for credit losses. Credit performance remains solid and inline with our expectations. Criticized assets remain stable. But loan loss provision was $27.6 million in the first quarter compared to $8.6 million of net charge-offs. Net charge-offs represented 7 basis points of average loans and benefited from the previously mentioned large recovery in our commercial real estate portfolio.
As we stated last quarter, we expect credit cost will gradually migrate back to more normalized levels, particularly, as recoveries from previously charged off commercial real estate loans diminished.  2016, however, we expect net charge-offs will remain below our long-term expectations of 35 basis points to 55 basis points.
The ACL ratio ticked up 1 basis point to 1.34% of loans and leases compared to 1.33% at the prior quarter and. The ratio of allowance to nonaccrual loans decreased to 138% compared to 180% a quarter ago due to the uptick in NAL's, primarily within our oil and gas exploration of production and core portfolios.
We believe the allowance is appropriate and we the underlying credit quality of our loan portfolio. Slide 10 shows trends in nonperforming assets, delinquencies and criticized assets. The chart in the upper left shows an increase in the nonperforming asset ratio for the quarter to 102 basis points compared to 79 basis points a quarter ago. The increase again, primarily reflected several oil and gas explanation and production credits in one large coal credit, which replaced our nonaccrual during the quarter.
The chart on the upper right reflects our 90-day delinquencies, which remained essentially flat for the past year. The bottom left chart shows the criticized assets ratio, which also has remained relatively stable over the past few quarters. Finally, the chart on the bottom right shows NPA inflows as a percentage of beginning period loans at 48 basis points for the first quarter, reflecting the oil and gas explanation and production in nonaccrual as I mentioned previously.
All credit metrics fully reflect the results of the recently completed Shared National Credit exam. Results were consistent with past exams and that we had a handful of downgrades as well as some upgrades. We processed all the downgrades, however, we only processed a few of the upgrades as we believe we either have more recent or more complete information on the relationship or we simply opted to take a more conservative stands. This practice would also be consistent with past exams.
Let me now turn the presentation over to Steve."

We these resu",1320,"Thank you, Mac. Slide 11 shows the continued progress driving what we believed to be industry-leading, customer acquisition and associated revenue growth from both acquiring and building meaningful banking relationships with these customers. We these results to the unique combination of our Fair Play, banking philosophy, our welcome culture and execution of our optimal customer relationships or OCR focus on relationship banking. Since 2010, we've increased our consumer checking households and business checking relationships by 8% and 5% compound annual growth rates, respectively.
These robust customer acquisition rates have allowed us to post the associated 5% and 9% compound annual growth rates in consumer and business revenue, which you can see in the 2 lower charts on the slide.
You heard me say this for a number of years and you will hear me say it again in the future, our focus remains on growing revenues. We continue to grow revenues despite the challenging environment.
Slide 12 and 13 illustrates the continued success of our OCR strategy and deepening our consumer and commercial relationships. Our strategy has remained consistent since 2010 and is built around 2 simple objectives: gain market share and gain share of wallet. A track record has illustrated and we will continue to demonstrate that this strategy results both in more loyal, satisfied and sticker customers as well as revenue growth.
As of the quarter end, almost 53% of our consumer checking households used 6 or more products and services, up from 50% a year ago. Correspondingly, our consumer checking account household revenue was up $33 million or 12% year-over-year in the first quarter. Similarly, almost 48% of our commercial checking customers used 4 or more products or services at year-end, up from 43% a year ago.
Commercial revenue increased $4 million or 2% year-over-year. And you will notice a step up this quarter in the number of businesses in relationship utilizing 4 or more products or services. This increased result from a recent change in pricing for certain of a treasury management products and related impact on the measurement or product and services utilized by these customers. We expect this will represent a one-time step up.
Slides 14 and 15 provide a glimpse at some of the key economic data for our footprint. Slide 14 illustrates trends and the unemployment rates across our 6 core Midwestern states as well as other leading, and lagging economic data for the region. Unemployment rates in Ohio and Michigan are the lowest since the early 2000, and the unemployment rate for the 4 largest states in the footprint Michigan, Ohio, Indiana and Pennsylvania are all at or below national unemployment rates.
Further, the higher rate in the Midwest is the highest in the nation. Over 50% of the net manufacturing jobs created in the country, since the recession, are in Ohio Michigan and Indiana. The finally despite recent market volatility and global macroeconomic uncertainty, average consumer confidence in the Midwest is around what it was in 2002.
Slide 15 takes a deeper look at the trends in unemployment rates in our largest metropolitan market, most of the large the footprint we're near 15-year lows for unemployment levels at the end of January.
As you can probably gather from this data, we remain bullish on our core Midwestern footprint. The auto industry is an important component of the economy in our footprint and it appears poised for another year in 2016.
Our small medium-sized commercial customers continued to express confidence in their businesses. Real estate markets across the footprint are improving. There is a significant amount of economic activity in our footprint of higher education and healthcare. And I continue to believe that benefit of low-energy prices for consumers and manufacturers more than outlays the isolated pockets of stress on business within the energy sector in our footprint.
Our SBA lending also remains quite robust. In fact, March was our best month ever for SBA originations.
Turning to Slide 16. While we're only one quarter into the year, Slide 16 shows that we're off to a good start to execute for our long term financial goal of annual operating leverage. We expect 2016 will represent our fourth consecutive year to deliver positive operating leverage.
So with that, let's turn to Slide 17 for some closing remarks and messages. We remain focused on delivering consistent through the cycle shareholder returns. And the strategy reducing short-term volatility, achieving top-tier performance over the long term and maintaining our aggregate moderate-to-low risk profile Our value proposition for both consumers and businesses continue to drive industry-leading new customer acquisition. We've successfully build a strong and recognizable consumer brand with differentiated products and superior customer services. We continue to execute our strategies and refinery act when necessary. We've invested and will continue to invest in our businesses, particularly, around enhanced sales management, mobile and digital technologies, data analytics and optimizing our retail distribution network. Importantly, we plan to continue to manage our expenses, appropriately, within our revenue outlook. And we expect to grow revenue.
We're optimistic on our core Midwest footprint local economies and the businesses and consumers within them. We're prudently managing certain industries or sectors, potentially impacted by market volatility and global macroeconomic uncertainty. However, we believe these risks remain well contain, and the majority of our core consumer and small and medium-sized business customers enjoy a healthy, near-term outlook. We see no evidence of near-term deterioration or problems on the horizon. Customer sentiment remains positive and commercial loan utilization rates show a slight increase for the fourth consecutive quarter.
Pressure on our NIM will remain a modest headwind in the near term. We continue to expect the NIM will remain above 3% throughout 2016.
We expect to grow revenue despite these pressures consistent with our 4% to 6% long-term financial goal, excluding significant items and then MSR activity and obviously the impact of FirstMerit. We'll continue to place ongoing investments, and our business is consistent with our revenue outlook and consistent with our long-term goal of annual operating positive leverage.
We closely monitor our loan portfolio, and given the absolute low level of our credit metrics in the recent market and global economic volatility, we do expect some volatility in our credit metrics going forward, and anticipate that loan-loss provisioning for both ourselves and the board industry will gradually begin to return to more normalized levels. So in this stress, we do not see any material deterioration on the horizon. We're simply moving our cyclical lows and will gradually move back towards normal for both provisioning and net charge-offs.
We expect our net charge-offs for the year will remain below our long-term expected range of 35 basis points to 55 basis points.
Next, we always like to include a reminder that there is an alignment between the board, management, our employees and our shareholders. The board and our colleagues are collectively the sixth largest shareholder of Huntington. We have hold the retirement requirements on certain shares, and are appropriately focused on driving sustained, long-term performance. We're highly focused on our commitment to being of shareholders' capital.
Finally, before we move into the Q&A period, I'd like to give you a quick update on the status on the FirstMerit acquisition we announced earlier this year. We've filed our application with the and anticipate that we'll receive both regulatory and shareholder approval to allow the close the transaction in the third quarter. We also continue our integration planning. We've made significant product -- progress in our product and data mapping process, as well as our planning around the organizational structure. The more we get to know the FirstMerit team, the quality and the depth of their talent and the severity of cultures, the more excited I get about this transaction and our ability to deliver on our commitment as we come together.

Other than that, we've given guidance that we still expect to be below the 35 to 55. So I think that gives you pretty good range of what we might see. In terms of the energy build this quarter, we think we've been very conservative in identifying the issue that we there. We are well reserved on that portfolio. We've got a credit mark on that portfolio with 10%, which given the combination -- or the constitution of our portfolio, no Energy Services, I think, that's a big differentiator when we're looking at energy exposure, ours is all -- E&P very well secured, exposure.

So I think that's important. There is a bit of an effect in there from -- we've talked about the CCPA, which is the telephone consumer protection act, which limited our ability to make calls to cellphones. That had a small incremental effects. So we probably have a couple basis points of additional charge-off that was in that number. And that -- the impact of that will dissipate overtime. But -- just as a reminder, our origination strategy on Indirect Auto has not moved at all. We continue to maintain the same FICO scores, LTV's terms. It's a very dealer-centric model. And I think it is important when you look at our portfolio relative to others, the distinction in terms of our focus on prime and super prime customers. When we expand in the different markets, which we do from time to time, we go in with more conservative origination criteria then for the book as a whole.

I would point out that the mix of our vehicles is a little bit different than what industry average would be as well. When you focus on a high FICO borrower, when you have to take the vehicles back, you tend to get a vehicle that is in better shape and having a higher resale value. I think the mix of our book also has more trucks and SUVs in it, and those values tend to hold up better than the vehicles as a whole. So those factors also are going to us.

And the compression is been driven just due to the fact that we're adding the LCR-compliant Securities and then on the funding side of that is coming through on the debt side. So that results in some competition as we move throughout the year. There is some additional compression that will take place on certain asset categories. But again, based on everything we know today, and weather forecast looks better for the number of the year, we do believe -- we stay above 3% in every quarter of 2016."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We're pleased to report another quarter of solid results and believe 2016 is off to a good start. Huntington's customer-centric strategy continues to deliver consistent growth and market share and share of wallet through execution of our distinctive Fair Play philosophy, our wealth and culture and our superior customer service.
Disciplined execution of our strategy and well-timed investments in our businesses over the past several years are producing solid results for our shareholders, our customers, our colleagues and our communities.
Slide 3 shows some of the financial highlights for the quarter. Earnings per common share of $0.20 was up 5% from the 2015 first quarter, while tangible book value per share increased 8% to $7.12. Return on tangible common equity was 11.9%, while return on assets was 0.96%. Core fundamental trends remain strong and reflect the benefit of our strategic investments over the past several years. Year-over-year revenue growth was 7% comprised of an 8% increase in net interest income and a 4% increase in noninterest income. We continue to believe that our ability to deliver consistent topline growth despite the challenging interest rate environment distinguishes Huntington from our peers.
We also believe that our disciplined Investment Strategy combined with the focus on achieving positive operating leverage on an annual basis is proving to be a key differentiator. While we achieved positive operating leverage for the quarter, noninterest expense increased 7% year-over-year, reflecting our ongoing investments including 44 new in-store branches in digital and technology investments, such as our new mortgage origination platform that is currently being piloted.
Our efficiency ratio for the quarter was 64.6%, which remains well above our long-term financial goal of 56% to 59%. We will continue to work to improve our operating efficiency organically by growing revenue faster than expense, but we also continue to expect that our recently announced acquisition of FirstMerit wield meaningful improvements in our pro forma efficiency.
Turning to the balance sheet, average loan growth was 6% year-over-year, while average core deposit growth was 5%, continuing a 7-quarter trend of year-over-year core deposit growth being greater than 5%. Overall, credit metrics remained solid, criticized assets remained stable. We incurred only 7 basis points of net charge-offs in the quarter as we continue to benefit from large commercial real estate recoveries. Nonperforming assets increased 23 basis points from the previous quarter, with the majority of the increase centered in our oil and gas exploration and production and coal portfolios.
Our capital ratios remain strong. Tangible common equity ended the quarter at 7.89%, up 7 basis points from year-end. While all regulatory capital ratios except Common Equity Tier 1 increased meaningfully during the quarter due to the issuance of $400 million of perpetual preferred stock on March 21.
Slide 4 provides a summary income statement, including some additional details on our noninterest income and noninterest expense for the quarter. Relative to the first quarter of 2015, total reported revenue increased 7% to $754 million. Spread revenues accounted for the majority of the increase as net interest income increased 8% to $512 million.
We benefited from 8% average earning asset growth, partially offset by 4 basis points of net interest margin compression. The NIM was negatively impacted by unfavorable mix shift on both sides of the balance sheet, most notably the increase in our low-yielding LCR-compliant securities and our earning assets and higher cost senior banknotes in our funding mix. We continue to remain disciplined in pricing of both loans and deposits.
Fee income increased 4% from the year ago quarter to $242 million, primarily driven by continued customer acquisition gains and relationship deepening. Highlights included a 13% increase in service charges on deposit accounts and a 12% increase in card and payment processing income. We also faced some headwinds in the quarter in mortgage banking and trust service income. Mortgage banking income decreased 19% from the year ago quarter as a result of a 5% decline in origination volume coupled with a $2 million decrease from net MSR activity. Trust services income declined 21% year-over-year, primarily due to the sale of our funds management and servicing businesses at the end of last year.
Reported noninterest expense in the 2016 first quarter was $491 million, an increase of $32 million or 7% from the year ago quarter. This quarter's noninterest expense included one significant item: $6 million of merger-and-acquisition-related expense from the pending FirstMerit acquisition.
As detailed on Page 7 of the press release, noninterest expense adjusted for significant items in both quarters increased $29 million or 6% year-over-year. In March, the FDIC announced the final role of proving the previously disclosed surcharge on banks with assets in excess of $10 billion, including Huntington. In our conference call last quarter, we stated that the surcharge would negatively impact our FDIC insurance expense by approximately $13 million in 2016. Due to the delay in the implementation until July 1, we now expect the negative impact will be approximately $7 million this year.
Slide 5 details the trends in our balance sheet mix. Average loans and leases increased $2.8 billion or 6% year-over-year as most portfolios continue to experience year-over-year growth. Average securities increased $2.1 billion or 17%, primarily reflecting growth in LCR-compliant securities and, to a lesser extent, growth in our direct-purchase municipal securities in our commercial banking segment. We are currently above the 100% threshold for liquidity coverage ratio.
Digging into the loan growth a little deeper, average commercial and industrial loans grew $1.5 billion or 8%, primarily driven by a $0.8 billion increase in asset finance. The quarter also benefited from continued momentum in auto floor plan and broad-based commercial lending. Average automobile loans grew $0.9 billion or 11% from the year ago quarter. Auto Finance remains a core competency of Huntington, and we're committed to this business and our dealer customers.
The first quarter of 2016 represented the ninth consecutive quarter of more than $1 billion of automobile loan originations. We have achieved this by remaining absolutely consistent in our strategy, which is built around the credit model that is focused on prime and super prime borrowers and a business model of high touch and local delivery.
As detailed on Slides 46 and 47 in the appendix, our underwriting has not changed, and our credit performance remains superior. Yields on the new auto paper rebounded slightly in the first quarter, back up to around 3% compared to the 2.90% to 2.95% range in the fourth quarter. Recall yields last quarter were impacted by the normal seasonal mix shift towards new vehicle sales that occur in the fourth quarter as manufacturers try to drive yearly volume goals, while the first quarter's originations reflected a return to more normal, new used mix.
The auto portfolio continues to perform very well. As expected, the seasonal increases and delinquencies and charge-offs we experienced in the fourth quarter reversed course this quarter, with delinquencies declining 26 basis points sequentially and net charge-offs declining 5 basis points. Further, if you compare our delinquencies and nonaccrual loans with the year ago quarter, you will see they are essentially flat. Net charge-offs are up modestly year-over-year but will remain well below the levels to which we underwrite the portfolio.
Staying on Slide 5 and moving to the right side, average total deposits increased $2.9 billion or 5% over the year ago quarter, including a $2.6 billion or 5% increase in average core deposits. We continue to see strong growth in demand deposits as average non-interest-bearing demand deposits increased $1.1 billion or 7% year-over-year, and average interest-bearing demand deposits increased $1.6 billion or 26%. This growth reflects our continued focus on new customer checking household and commercial relationship account acquisition as well as relationship deepening, all of which are detailed on Slides 11 through 13 that Steve will discuss later.
We also continue to remix the consumer deposit base out of higher-cost CDs into other less expensive deposit products. Average core CDs increased to $0.5 billion or 19% year-over-year.
Average total demand deposits accounted for 37% of non-equity funding in the 2016 first quarter, while money market and savings deposits accounted for a combined 38%. By contrast, average core CDs accounted for only 3% of our non-equity funding in the quarter. Average total debt increased $2.1 billion or 34% as a result of 5 senior debt issuances over the past 5 quarters totaling $4.1 billion, including $1 billion issued in March of this year as well as the assumption of debts in the Huntington Technology Finance acquisition. The $1 billion senior debt issuance this quarter was part of our normal funding strategy.
Slide 6 shows our net interest margin plotted against earning asset yields, interest-bearing liability costs and other deposit costs. First quarter NIM decreased 4 basis points year-over-year but increased 2 basis points from the previous quarter to 3.11%. This quarter the net interest margin benefited from approximately 2 basis points of interest recoveries in the commercial real estate portfolio and another 1 to 2 basis points in day count.
Adjusting these benefits out of the first quarter margin, we expect another 2 to 4 basis points of contraction in the second quarter, but we remain comfortable reaffirming our previous guidance from last quarter that the net interest margin will remain above 3% for each quarter in 2016.
Slide 7 provides an update on our asset sensitivity positioning and how we manage interest rate risk. As shown in the chart on top, we estimate that net interest income would benefit by 3.6% if interest rates would have gradually ramped 200 basis points in addition to increases already reflected in the current implied forward curve. This is an increase from what we estimated a quarter ago as we recently updated our non-maturity deposit models, resulting in a reduction in the sensitivity of these deposits. In addition, as we have discussed for some time, our asset swaps are beginning a period of steady amortization as disclosed in our 10-K. We also proactively terminated $1.9 billion of swaps in January, taking advantage of volatility in the markets. As we have stated previously, our asset swap portfolio is a laddered portfolio. There are no cliffs looming on the horizon. These actions, coupled with changes in our overall balance sheet mix, drove the increase in muddled asset sensitivity.
As shown on the bottom right, on a hypothetical scenario, without the $5.8 billion of remaining asset swaps, the estimated benefit would approximate positive 5.4% in the up 200-basis point gradual ramp scenario.
The chart on the bottom of the slide shows our $5.8 billion asset swap portfolio and $5.8 billion liability swap portfolio, including their respective average remaining lives and their impact on net interest income. The incremental benefit of swaps was $24 million in the 2016 first quarter, down from $29 million in the 2015 fourth quarter and $25 million in the year ago quarter.
Slide 8 shows the trends in our capital ratios. Tangible common equity increased 7 basis points sequentially to 7.89%. All regulatory capital ratios improved meaningfully from the prior quarter end, with the exception of Common Equity Tier 1 regulatory capital ratio, which declined slightly.
Later in the quarter, we issued $400 million of 6.25 fixed-rate non-cumulative preferred equity in order to take advantage of unusual market conditions and low-interest rate environment to lock in low cost permanent capital. With this issuance, we are now more in line with our peers with respect to the amount of preferred equity in our capital structure. Although as market conditions allow, you may see us further optimize our capital structure in the future, relative to the Basel III rules.
Slide 9 provides an overview of our loan loss provision, net charge-offs and allowance for credit losses. Credit performance remains solid and inline with our expectations. Criticized assets remain stable. The loan loss provision was $27.6 million in the first quarter compared to $8.6 million of net charge-offs. Net charge-offs represented 7 basis points of average loans and benefited from the previously mentioned large recovery in our commercial real estate portfolio.
As we stated last quarter, we expect credit cost will gradually migrate back to more normalized levels, particularly as recoveries from previously charged off commercial real estate loans diminish. For 2016, however, we expect net charge-offs will remain below our long-term expectations of 35 basis points to 55 basis points.
The ACL ratio ticked up 1 basis point to 1.34% of loans and leases compared to 1.33% at the prior quarter end. The ratio of allowance to nonaccrual loans decreased to 138% compared to 180% a quarter ago due to the uptick in NALs, primarily within our oil and gas exploration of production and coal portfolios. We believe the allowance is appropriate and reflects the underlying credit quality of our loan portfolio.
Slide 10 shows trends in nonperforming assets, delinquencies and criticized assets. The chart in the upper left shows an increase in the nonperforming asset ratio for the quarter to 102 basis points compared to 79 basis points a quarter ago. The increase again, primarily reflected several oil and gas exploration and production credits and one large coal credit, which replaced a nonaccrual during the quarter.
The chart on the upper right reflects our 90-day delinquencies, which remained essentially flat for the past year. The bottom left chart shows the criticized asset ratio, which also has remained relatively stable the past few quarters. Finally, the chart on the bottom right shows NPA inflows as a percentage of beginning-period loans at 48 basis points for the first quarter, reflecting the oil and gas exploration and production in coal nonaccrual credits mentioned previously.
All credit metrics fully reflect the results of the recently completed Shared National Credit exam. Results were consistent with past exams and that we had a handful of downgrades as well as some upgrades. We processed all the downgrades. However, we only processed a few of the upgrades as we believe we either have more recent or more complete information on the relationship, or we simply opted to take a more conservative stance. This practice would also be consistent with past exams.
Let me now turn the presentation over to Steve."
278614,329635066,960065,"Huntington Bancshares Incorporated, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 20, 2016",2016-04-20,"Earnings Calls","Huntington Bancshares Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Mac.Slide 11 shows the continued progress driving what we believe to be industry-leading customer acquisition and associated revenue growth from both acquiring and building meaningful banking relationships with these customers. We owe these r",1333,"Thank you, Mac.
Slide 11 shows the continued progress driving what we believe to be industry-leading customer acquisition and associated revenue growth from both acquiring and building meaningful banking relationships with these customers. We owe these results to the unique combination of our Fair Play banking philosophy, our welcome culture and execution of our optimal customer relationship or OCR focus on relationship banking. Since 2010, we've increased our consumer checking households and business checking relationships by 8% and 5% compound annual growth rates, respectively. These robust customer acquisition rates have allowed us to post the associated 5% and 9% compound annual growth rates in consumer and business revenue, which you can see in the 2 lower charts on the slide.
You've heard me say this for a number of years and you'll hear me say it again in the future, our focus remains on growing revenues. We continue to grow revenues despite the challenging environment.
Slide 12 and 13 illustrate the continued success of our OCR strategy and deepening our consumer and commercial relationships. Our strategy has remained consistent since 2010 and is built around 2 simple objectives: gain market share and gain share of wallet. Our track record has illustrated and we will continue to demonstrate that this strategy results both in more loyal, satisfied and stickier customers as well as revenue growth.
As of the quarter end, almost 53% of our consumer checking households used 6 or more products and services, up from 50% a year ago. Correspondingly, our consumer checking account household revenue was up $33 million or 12% year-over-year in the first quarter. Similarly, almost 48% of our commercial checking customers used 4 or more products or services at year-end, up from 43% a year ago.
Commercial revenue increased $4 million or 2% year-over-year. And you'll notice a step up this quarter in the number of business relationships utilizing 4 or more products or services. This increase results from a recent change in pricing for certain of our treasury management products and related impact on the measurement of products and services utilized by these customers. We expect this will represent a one-time step up.
Slides 14 and 15 provide a glimpse at some of the key economic data for our footprint. Slide 14 illustrates trends in the unemployment rates across our 6 core Midwestern states as well as other leading, coincident and lagging economic data for the region. Unemployment rates in Ohio and Michigan are the lowest since the early 2000s, and the unemployment rates in the 4 largest states in the footprint, Michigan, Ohio, Indiana and Pennsylvania, are all at or below national unemployment rates.
Further, the higher rate in the Midwest is the highest in the nation. Over 50% of the net manufacturing jobs created in the country since the recession are in Ohio, Michigan and Indiana. And finally, despite recent market volatility and global macroeconomic uncertainty, average consumer confidence in the Midwest is around what it was in 2002.
Slide 15 takes a deeper look at the trends in unemployment rates in our largest metropolitan markets. Most of the large MSAs, the footprint were near 15-year lows for unemployment levels at the end of January.
As you can probably gather from this data, we remain bullish on our core Midwestern footprint. The auto industry is an important component of the economy in our footprint, and it appears poised for another stellar year in 2016.
Our small medium-sized commercial customers continue to express confidence in their businesses. Real estate markets across the footprint are improving. There is a significant amount of economic activity in our footprint tide to higher education and healthcare. And I continue to believe the benefit of low-energy prices for consumers and manufacturers more than outweighs the isolated pockets of stress on business within the energy sector in our footprint. Our SBA lending also remains quite robust. In fact, March was our best month ever for SBA originations.
Turning to Slide 16. While we're only one quarter into the year, Slide 16 shows that we're off to a good start to execute for our long term financial goal of annual positive operating leverage. We expect 2016 will represent our fourth consecutive year to deliver positive operating leverage.
So with that, let's turn to Slide 17 for some closing remarks and messages. We remain focused on delivering consistent, through the cycle shareholder returns. And the strategy entails reducing short-term volatility, achieving top-tier performance over the long term and maintaining our aggregate moderate-to-low risk profile throughout. Our value proposition for both consumers and businesses continue to drive industry-leading new customer acquisition. We've successfully built a strong and recognizable consumer brand, with differentiated products and superior customer service. We continue to execute our strategies and refine and react when necessary. We've invested and will continue to invest in our businesses, particularly around enhanced sales management, mobile and digital technologies, data analytics and optimizing our retail distribution network. Importantly, we plan to continue to manage our expenses appropriately, within our revenue outlook. And we expect to grow revenue.
We're optimistic on our core Midwest footprint's local economies and the businesses and consumers within them. We are prudently managing certain industries or sectors, potentially impacted by market volatility and global macroeconomic uncertainty. However, we believe these risks remain well-contained, and the majority of our core consumer and small and medium-sized business customers enjoy a healthy, near-term outlook. We see no evidence of near-term deterioration or problems looming on the horizon. Customer sentiment remains positive, and commercial loan utilization rate showed a slight increase for the fourth consecutive quarter.
Pressure on our NIM will remain a modest headwind in the near term. We continue to expect the NIM will remain above 3% throughout 2016.
We expect to grow revenue despite these pressures, consistent with our 4% to 6% long-term financial goal, excluding significant items and that of MSR activity and obviously the impact of FirstMerit. We'll continue to place ongoing investments, and our business is consistent with our revenue outlook and consistent with our long-term goal of annual operating positive leverage.
We closely monitor our loan portfolio, and given the absolute low level of our credit metrics in recent market and global economic volatility, we do expect some volatility in our credit metrics going forward, and anticipate that loan-loss provisioning for both ourselves and the board industry will gradually begin to return to more normalized levels. So let me stress, we do not see any material deterioration on the horizon. We're simply moving all cyclical lows, and we'll gradually move back toward normal for both provisioning and net charge-offs. We expect our net charge-offs for the year will remain below our long-term expected range of 35 basis points to 55 basis points.
Next, we always like to include a reminder that there is alignment between the board, management, our employees and our shareholders. The board and our colleagues are collectively the sixth largest shareholder of Huntington. We uphold the retirement requirements on certain shares and are appropriately focused on driving sustained, long-term performance. We're highly focused on our commitment to being good stewards of shareholders' capital.
Finally, before we move into the Q&A period, I'd like to give you a quick update on the status of the FirstMerit acquisition we announced earlier this year. We have filed our application with the regulators and anticipate that we will receive both regulatory and shareholder approval to allow us to close the transaction in the third quarter. We also continue our integration planning. We've made significant product -- progress in our product and data mapping process, as well as our planning around the organizational structure. The more we get to know the FirstMerit team, the quality and the depth of their talent and the similarity of cultures, the more excited I get about this transaction and our ability to deliver on our commitments as we come together.
So now I'll turn it back over to Mark, so we can get to your questions."

So if there's going to be one difference in the subsequent quarters, it's going to be a more normalized level of recovery. So that in and of itself will take the net charge-off number up. But we are not seeing anything on the horizon that leads us to conclude that there would be any notable changes. Other than that, we've given guidance that we still expect to be below the 35 basis points to 55 basis points. So I think that gives you a pretty good range of what we might see. In terms of the energy build this quarter, we think we've been very conservative in identifying the issues that we have out there. We are well reserved on that portfolio. We've got our credit mark on that portfolio with 10%, which given the combination -- or the constitution of our portfolio, no energy services, I think, that's a big differentiator when we're looking at energy exposure. Ours is all E&P, very well-secured exposure. So even if you say there's going to be continued low energy prices, we think that portfolio on a relative basis is going to hold up quite well."

There is a bit of an effect in there from -- we've talked about TCPA, which is the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, which limited our ability to make calls to cellphones. That had a small incremental effect. So we probably have a couple basis points of additional charge-off that was in that number. And that -- the impact of that will dissipate overtime. But just as a reminder, our origination strategy on Indirect Auto has not moved at all. We continue to maintain the same FICO scores, LTVs, terms. It's a very dealer-centric model. And I think it is important when we look at our portfolio relative to others, the distinction in terms of our focus on prime and super prime customers. When we expand in the different markets, which we do from time to time, we go in with more conservative origination criteria then for the book as a whole.

I would point out that the mix of our vehicles is a little bit different than what industry average would be as well. When you focus on a high FICO borrower, when you have to take the vehicles back, you tend to get a vehicle that is in better shape and having a higher resale value. I think the mix of our book also has more trucks and SUVs in it, and those values tend to hold up better than vehicles as a whole. So those factors also are going to aid us. So we feel very confident even though we know there will be some reduction in the Manheim because we've been at historically high levels for the -- probably, the last 5 or 6 years."

And that's really -- this -- that can be explained by 2 things: One is the MSR impairment, which was $6 million to $7 million on a linked-quarter basis; and the other portion of the decline was just due to lower origination volume. So that -- I think that explains the linked quarter pretty well. And actually that's the same explanation for year-over-year, it's MSR and lower origination. So we're pleased with origination volume, where it's at currently. We just have these seasonal effects and also just the impact of the MSR evaluation."

That impact is completely manageable when you think about the quarter-to-quarter impact and how slow those are rolling off. We -- on the second question, we really don't have a target in terms of what we're looking for. We do think eventually, it's going to be good to be asset-sensitive. We're very comfortable with our position today and how we're managing the balance sheet. With the swaps rolling off and I think some of the changes that we've made in the non-maturity deposits, we have seen the increase in asset sensitivity. But again, we're very comfortable with how the balance sheet is positioned and the outlook for interest rates as we go through 2016."

We're off to a good start in 2016 as our first quarter results provided a solid base to build from. We delivered 7% year-over-year revenue growth, 3% net income growth and 5% growth in EPS and an 8% increase in tangible book value per share.

          Thanks, Mark.
Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We're pleased to report another quarter of solid results and believe 2016 is off to a good start. Huntington's customer-centric strategy continues to deliver consistent growth and market share and share of wallet through execution of our distinctive Fair Play philosophy, our welcome culture and our superior customer service.
Disciplined execution of our strategy and well-timed investments in our businesses over the past several years are producing solid results for our shareholders, our customers, our colleagues and our communities.
Slide 3 shows some of the financial highlights for the quarter. Earnings per common share of $0.20 was up 5% from the 2015 first quarter, while tangible book value per share increased 8% to $7.12. Return on tangible common equity was 11.9%, while return on assets was 0.96%. Core fundamental trends remain strong and reflect the benefit of our strategic investments over the past several years. Year-over-year revenue growth was 7% comprised of an 8% increase in net interest income and a 4% increase in noninterest income. We continue to believe that our ability to deliver consistent topline growth despite the challenging interest rate environment distinguishes Huntington from our peers.
We also believe that our disciplined Investment Strategy combined with the focus on achieving positive operating leverage on an annual basis is proving to be a key differentiator. While we achieved positive operating leverage for the quarter, noninterest expense increased 7% year-over-year, reflecting our ongoing investments including 44 new in-store branches and digital and technology investments, such as our new mortgage origination platform that is currently being piloted.
Our efficiency ratio for the quarter was 64.6%, which remains well above our long-term financial goal of 56% to 59%. We will continue to work to improve our operating efficiency organically by growing revenue faster than expense, but we also continue to expect that our recently announced acquisition of FirstMerit wield meaningful improvements in our pro forma efficiency.
Turning to the balance sheet, average loan growth was 6% year-over-year, while average core deposit growth was 5%, continuing a 7-quarter trend of year-over-year core deposit growth being greater than 5%. Overall, credit metrics remained solid, criticized assets remained stable. We incurred only 7 basis points of net charge-offs in the quarter as we continue to benefit from large commercial real estate recoveries. Nonperforming assets increased 23 basis points from the previous quarter, with the majority of the increase centered in our oil and gas exploration and production and coal portfolios.
Our capital ratios remain strong. Tangible common equity ended the quarter at 7.89%, up 7 basis points from year-end. While all regulatory capital ratios except Common Equity Tier 1 increased meaningfully during the quarter due to the issuance of $400 million of perpetual preferred stock on March 21.
Slide 4 provides a summary income statement, including some additional details on our noninterest income and noninterest expense for the quarter. Relative to the first quarter of 2015, total reported revenue increased 7% to $754 million. Spread revenues accounted for the majority of the increase as net interest income increased 8% to $512 million.
We benefited from 8% average earning asset growth, partially offset by 4 basis points of net interest margin compression. The NIM was negatively impacted by unfavorable mix shift on both sides of the balance sheet, most notably the increase in our low-yielding LCR-compliant securities and our earning assets and higher cost senior banknotes in our funding mix. We continue to remain disciplined in pricing of both loans and deposits.
Fee income increased 4% from the year ago quarter to $242 million, primarily driven by continued customer acquisition gains and relationship deepening. Highlights included a 13% increase in service charges on deposit accounts and a 12% increase in card and payment processing income. We also faced some headwinds in the quarter in mortgage banking and trust service income. Mortgage banking income decreased 19% from the year ago quarter as a result of a 5% decline in origination volume coupled with a $2 million decrease from net MSR activity. Trust services income declined 21% year-over-year, primarily due to the sale of our funds management and servicing businesses at the end of last year.
Reported noninterest expense in the 2016 first quarter was $491 million, an increase of $32 million or 7% from the year ago quarter. This quarter's noninterest expense included one significant item: $6 million of merger-and-acquisition-related expense from the pending FirstMerit acquisition.
As detailed on Page 7 of the press release, noninterest expense adjusted for significant items in both quarters increased $29 million or 6% year-over-year. In March, the FDIC announced the final role approving the previously disclosed surcharge on banks with assets in excess of $10 billion, including Huntington. In our conference call last quarter, we stated that the surcharge would negatively impact our FDIC insurance expense by approximately $13 million in 2016. Due to the delay in the implementation until July 1, we now expect the negative impact will be approximately $7 million this year.
Slide 5 details the trends in our balance sheet mix. Average loans and leases increased $2.8 billion or 6% year-over-year as most portfolios continue to experience year-over-year growth. Average securities increased $2.1 billion or 17%, primarily reflecting growth in LCR-compliant securities and, to a lesser extent, growth in our direct-purchase municipal securities in our commercial banking segment. We are currently above the 100% threshold for liquidity coverage ratio.
Digging into the loan growth a little deeper, average commercial and industrial loans grew $1.5 billion or 8%, primarily driven by a $0.8 billion increase in asset finance. The quarter also benefited from continued momentum in auto floor plan and broad-based commercial lending. Average automobile loans grew $0.9 billion or 11% from the year ago quarter. Auto Finance remains a core competency of Huntington, and we're committed to this business and our dealer customers.
The first quarter of 2016 represented the ninth consecutive quarter of more than $1 billion of automobile loan originations. We have achieved this by remaining absolutely consistent in our strategy, which is built around the credit model that is focused on prime and super prime borrowers and a business model of high touch and local delivery.
As detailed on Slides 46 and 47 in the appendix, our underwriting has not changed, and our credit performance remains superior. Yields on the new auto paper rebounded slightly in the first quarter, back up to around 3% compared to the 2.90% to 2.95% range in the fourth quarter. Recall yields last quarter were impacted by the normal seasonal mix shift towards new vehicle sales that occur in the fourth quarter as manufacturers try to drive yearly volume goals, while the first quarter's originations reflected a return to more normal, new used mix.
The auto portfolio continues to perform very well. As expected, the seasonal increases and delinquencies and charge-offs we experienced in the fourth quarter reversed course this quarter, with delinquencies declining 26 basis points sequentially and net charge-offs declining 5 basis points. Further, if you compare our delinquencies and nonaccrual loans with the year ago quarter, you will see they are essentially flat. Net charge-offs are up modestly year-over-year but will remain well below the levels to which we underwrite the portfolio.
Staying on Slide 5 and moving to the right side, average total deposits increased $2.9 billion or 5% over the year ago quarter, including a $2.6 billion or 5% increase in average core deposits. We continue to see strong growth in demand deposits as average non-interest-bearing demand deposits increased $1.1 billion or 7% year-over-year, and average interest-bearing demand deposits increased $1.6 billion or 26%. This growth reflects our continued focus on new customer checking household and commercial relationship account acquisition as well as relationship deepening, all of which are detailed on Slides 11 through 13 that Steve will discuss later.
We also continue to remix the consumer deposit base out of higher-cost CDs into other less expensive deposit products. Average core CDs increased to $0.5 billion or 19% year-over-year.
Average total demand deposits accounted for 37% of non-equity funding in the 2016 first quarter, while money market and savings deposits accounted for a combined 38%. By contrast, average core CDs accounted for only 3% of our non-equity funding in the quarter. Average total debt increased $2.1 billion or 34% as a result of 5 senior debt issuances over the past 5 quarters totaling $4.1 billion, including $1 billion issued in March of this year as well as the assumption of debts in the Huntington Technology Finance acquisition. The $1 billion senior debt issuance this quarter was part of our normal funding strategy.
Slide 6 shows our net interest margin plotted against earning asset yields, interest-bearing liability costs and other deposit costs. First quarter NIM decreased 4 basis points year-over-year but increased 2 basis points from the previous quarter to 3.11%. This quarter the net interest margin benefited from approximately 2 basis points of interest recoveries in the commercial real estate portfolio and another 1 to 2 basis points in day count.
Adjusting these benefits out of the first quarter margin, we expect another 2 to 4 basis points of contraction in the second quarter, but remain comfortable reaffirming our previous guidance from last quarter that the net interest margin will remain above 3% for each quarter in 2016.
Slide 7 provides an update on our asset sensitivity positioning and how we manage interest rate risk. As shown in the chart on top, we estimate that net interest income would benefit by 3.6% if interest rates were to gradually ramped 200 basis points in addition to increases already reflected in the current implied forward curve. This is an increase from what we estimated a quarter ago as we recently updated our non-maturity deposit models, resulting in a reduction in the sensitivity of these deposits. In addition, as we have discussed for some time, our asset swaps are beginning a period of steady amortization as disclosed in our 10-K. We also proactively terminated $1.9 billion of swaps in January, taking advantage of volatility in the markets. As we have stated previously, our asset swap portfolio is a laddered portfolio. There are no cliffs looming on the horizon. These actions, coupled with changes in our overall balance sheet mix, drove the increase in muddled asset sensitivity.
As shown on the bottom right, on a hypothetical scenario, without the $5.8 billion of remaining asset swaps, the estimated benefit would approximate positive 5.4% in the up 200-basis point gradual ramp scenario.
The chart on the bottom of the slide shows our $5.8 billion asset swap portfolio and $5.8 billion liability swap portfolio, including their respective average remaining lives and their impact on net interest income. The incremental benefit of swaps was $24 million in the 2016 first quarter, down from $29 million in the 2015 fourth quarter and $25 million in the year ago quarter.
Slide 8 shows the trends in our capital ratios. Tangible common equity increased 7 basis points sequentially to 7.89%. All regulatory capital ratios improved meaningfully from the prior quarter end, with the exception of Common Equity Tier 1 regulatory capital ratio, which declined slightly.
Late in the quarter, we issued $400 million of 6.25 fixed-rate non-cumulative preferred equity in order to take advantage of unusual market conditions and low-interest rate environment to lock in low cost permanent capital. With this issuance, we are now more in line with our peers with respect to the amount of preferred equity in our capital structure. Although as market conditions allow, you may see us further optimize our capital structure in the future, relative to the Basel III rules.
Slide 9 provides an overview of our loan loss provision, net charge-offs and allowance for credit losses. Credit performance remains solid and inline with our expectations. Criticized assets remain stable. The loan loss provision was $27.6 million in the first quarter compared to $8.6 million of net charge-offs. Net charge-offs represented 7 basis points of average loans and benefited from the previously mentioned large recovery in our commercial real estate portfolio.
As we stated last quarter, we expect credit cost will gradually migrate back to more normalized levels, particularly as recoveries from previously charged off commercial real estate loans diminish. For 2016, however, we expect net charge-offs will remain below our long-term expectations of 35 basis points to 55 basis points.
The ACL ratio ticked up 1 basis point to 1.34% of loans and leases compared to 1.33% at the prior quarter end. The ratio of allowance to nonaccrual loans decreased to 138% compared to 180% a quarter ago due to the uptick in NALs, primarily within our oil and gas exploration of production and coal portfolios. We believe the allowance is appropriate and reflects the underlying credit quality of our loan portfolio.
Slide 10 shows trends in nonperforming assets, delinquencies and criticized assets. The chart in the upper left shows an increase in the nonperforming asset ratio for the quarter to 102 basis points compared to 79 basis points a quarter ago. The increase again, primarily reflected several oil and gas exploration and production credits and one large coal credit, which were placed on nonaccrual during the quarter.
The chart on the upper right reflects our 90-day delinquencies, which remained essentially flat for the past year. The bottom left chart shows the criticized asset ratio, which also has remained relatively stable the past few quarters. Finally, the chart on the bottom right shows NPA inflows as a percentage of beginning-period loans at 48 basis points for the first quarter, reflecting the oil and gas exploration and production in coal nonaccrual credits mentioned previously.
All credit metrics fully reflect the results of the recently completed Shared National Credit exam. Results were consistent with past exams and that we had a handful of downgrades as well as some upgrades. We processed all the downgrades. However, we only processed a few of the upgrades as we believe we either have more recent or more complete information on the relationship, or we simply opted to take a more conservative stance. This practice would also be consistent with past exams.
Let me now turn the presentation over to Steve."

          Thank you, Mac.
Slide 11 shows the continued progress driving what we believe to be industry-leading customer acquisition and associated revenue growth from both acquiring and building meaningful banking relationships with these customers. We owe these results to the unique combination of our Fair Play banking philosophy, our welcome culture and execution of our optimal customer relationship or OCR focus on relationship banking. Since 2010, we've increased our consumer checking households and business checking relationships by 8% and 5% compound annual growth rates, respectively. These robust customer acquisition rates have allowed us to post the associated 5% and 9% compound annual growth rates in consumer and business revenue, which you can see in the 2 lower charts on the slide.
You've heard me say this for a number of years and you'll hear me say it again in the future, our focus remains on growing revenues. We continue to grow revenues despite the challenging environment.
Slide 12 and 13 illustrate the continued success of our OCR strategy and deepening our consumer and commercial relationships. Our strategy has remained consistent since 2010 and is built around 2 simple objectives: gain market share and gain share of wallet. Our track record has illustrated and we will continue to demonstrate that this strategy results both in more loyal, satisfied and stickier customers as well as revenue growth.
As of the quarter end, almost 53% of our consumer checking households used 6 or more products and services, up from 50% a year ago. Correspondingly, our consumer checking account household revenue was up $33 million or 12% year-over-year in the first quarter. Similarly, almost 48% of our commercial checking customers used 4 or more products or services at year-end, up from 43% a year ago.
Commercial revenue increased $4 million or 2% year-over-year. And you'll notice a step up this quarter in the number of business relationships utilizing 4 or more products or services. This increase results from a recent change in pricing for certain of our treasury management products and related impact on the measurement of products and services utilized by these customers. We expect this will represent a one-time step up.
Slides 14 and 15 provide a glimpse at some of the key economic data for our footprint. Slide 14 illustrates trends in the unemployment rates across our 6 core Midwestern states as well as other leading, coincident and lagging economic data for the region. Unemployment rates in Ohio and Michigan are the lowest since the early 2000s, and the unemployment rates in the 4 largest states in the footprint, Michigan, Ohio, Indiana and Pennsylvania, are all at or below national unemployment rates.
Further, the higher rate in the Midwest is the highest in the nation. Over 50% of the net manufacturing jobs created in the country since the recession are in Ohio, Michigan and Indiana. And finally, despite recent market volatility and global macroeconomic uncertainty, average consumer confidence in the Midwest is around what it was in 2002.
Slide 15 takes a deeper look at the trends in unemployment rates in our largest metropolitan markets. Most of the large MSAs, the footprint were near 15-year lows for unemployment levels at the end of January.
As you can probably gather from this data, we remain bullish on our core Midwestern footprint. The auto industry is an important component of the economy in our footprint, and it appears poised for another stellar year in 2016.
Our small medium-sized commercial customers continue to express confidence in their businesses. Real estate markets across the footprint are improving. There is a significant amount of economic activity in our footprint tied to higher education and healthcare. And I continue to believe the benefit of low-energy prices for consumers and manufacturers more than outweighs the isolated pockets of stress on business within the energy sector in our footprint. Our SBA lending also remains quite robust. In fact, March was our best month ever for SBA originations.
Turning to Slide 16. While we're only one quarter into the year, Slide 16 shows that we're off to a good start to execute for our long term financial goal of annual positive operating leverage. We expect 2016 will represent our fourth consecutive year to deliver positive operating leverage.
So with that, let's turn to Slide 17 for some closing remarks and messages. We remain focused on delivering consistent, through the cycle shareholder returns. And this strategy entails reducing short-term volatility, achieving top-tier performance over the long term and maintaining our aggregate moderate-to-low risk profile throughout. Our value proposition for both consumers and businesses continue to drive industry-leading new customer acquisition. We've successfully built a strong and recognizable consumer brand, with differentiated products and superior customer service. We continue to execute our strategies and refine and react when necessary. We've invested and will continue to invest in our businesses, particularly around enhanced sales management, mobile and digital technologies, data analytics and optimizing our retail distribution network. Importantly, we plan to continue to manage our expenses appropriately, within our revenue outlook. And we expect to grow revenue.
We're optimistic on our core Midwest footprint's local economies and the businesses and consumers within them. We are prudently managing certain industries or sectors, potentially impacted by market volatility and global macroeconomic uncertainty. However, we believe these risks remain well-contained, and the majority of our core consumer and small and medium-sized business customers enjoy a healthy, near-term outlook. We see no evidence of near-term deterioration or problems looming on the horizon. Customer sentiment remains positive, and commercial loan utilization rate showed a slight increase for the fourth consecutive quarter.
Pressure on our NIM will remain a modest headwind in the near term. We continue to expect the NIM will remain above 3% throughout 2016.
We expect to grow revenue despite these pressures, consistent with our 4% to 6% long-term financial goal, excluding significant items and that of MSR activity and obviously the impact of FirstMerit. We'll continue to place ongoing investments in our businesses consistent with our revenue outlook and consistent with our long-term goal of annual operating positive leverage.
We closely monitor our loan portfolio, and given the absolute low level of our credit metrics in recent market and global economic volatility, we do expect some volatility in our credit metrics going forward, and anticipate that loan-loss provisioning for both ourselves and the broader industry will gradually begin to return to more normalized levels. So let me stress, we do not see any material deterioration on the horizon. We're simply moving off cyclical lows, and we'll gradually move back toward normal for both provisioning and net charge-offs. We expect our net charge-offs for the year will remain below our long-term expected range of 35 basis points to 55 basis points.
Next, we always like to include a reminder that there is alignment between the board, management, our employees and our shareholders. The board and our colleagues are collectively the sixth largest shareholder of Huntington. We uphold the retirement requirements on certain shares and are appropriately focused on driving sustained, long-term performance. We're highly focused on our commitment to being good stewards of shareholders' capital.
Finally, before we move into the Q&A period, I'd like to give you a quick update on the status of the FirstMerit acquisition we announced earlier this year. We have filed our application with the regulators and anticipate that we will receive both regulatory and shareholder approval to allow us to close the transaction in the third quarter. We also continue our integration planning. We've made significant product -- progress in our product and data mapping process, as well as our planning around the organizational structure. The more we get to know the FirstMerit team, the quality and the depth of their talent and the similarity of cultures, the more excited I get about this transaction and our ability to deliver on our commitments as we come together.
So now I'll turn it back over to Mark, so we can get to your questions."

          I got just -- I just want to follow-up on the credit side in hearing your points about not seeing much else but expecting the normalization.

So I guess, just the questions are: can you help us understand kind of what you think the core charge-offs if we -- and size of that recovery? And then just your general premise around building reserves from here, do you think you've kind of gotten it there for what you need as far as the energy and coal-related?"

So, I think, the one thing -- this was a record quarter for us in terms of recoveries. So that 7 basis points charge-offs is obviously, very good performance, but it is driven by similarly an unusual level of recovery. So that is not going to continue. So if there's going to be one difference in the subsequent quarters, it's going to be a more normalized level of recovery. So that in and of itself will take the net charge-off number up. But we are not seeing anything on the horizon that leads us to conclude that there would be any notable changes. Other than that, we've given guidance that we still expect to be below the 35 basis points to 55 basis points. So I think that gives you a pretty good range of what we might see. In terms of the energy build this quarter, we think we've been very conservative in identifying the issues that we have out there. We are well reserved on that portfolio. We've got our credit mark on that portfolio with 10%, which given the combination -- or the constitution of our portfolio, no energy services, I think, that's a big differentiator when we're looking at energy exposure. Ours is all E&P, very well-secured exposure. So even if you say there's going to be continued low energy prices, we think that portfolio on a relative basis is going to hold up quite well."

So -- but, I will say that the stress analysis we do, there's still quite a bit of room between where we were at today and where we feel we would incur significant losses.

          Sure. This is Dan again. So one, I think, we have to look at -- we are looking at very low levels of charge-off. So I think if you looked to a year ago, we're probably at about 19 basis points and in the most recent quarter up to about 28 basis points. That is a very low level of charge-offs and well below what we actually model. So I think that's important. There is a bit of an effect in there from -- we've talked about TCPA, which is the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, which limited our ability to make calls to cellphones. That had a small incremental effect. So we probably have a couple basis points of additional charge-off that was in that number. And that -- the impact of that will dissipate overtime. But just as a reminder, our origination strategy on Indirect Auto has not moved at all. We continue to maintain the same FICO scores, LTVs, terms. It's a very dealer-centric model. And I think it is important when we look at our portfolio relative to others, the distinction in terms of our focus on prime and super prime customers. When we expand in the different markets, which we do from time to time, we go in with more conservative origination criteria then for the book as a whole. So we just feel, we have been rock solid in our origination strategies and don't expect to see any significant movement. So we remain very confident in our performance."

          Yes. So we've looked -- we obviously follow Manheim closely, and I think their forecast called for the index to decline about 8% cumulatively over the next few years. And even with that adjustment, we don't see this moving the needle significantly in terms of our performance. I would point out that the mix of our vehicles is a little bit different than what industry average would be as well. When you focus on a high FICO borrower, when you have to take the vehicles back, you tend to get a vehicle that is in better shape and having a higher resale value. I think the mix of our book also has more trucks and SUVs in it, and those values tend to hold up better than vehicles as a whole. So those factors also are going to aid us. So we feel very confident even though we know there will be some reduction in the Manheim because we've been at historically high levels for the -- probably, the last 5 or 6 years."

And under that scenario, which is the scenario that we use in order to provide the guidance for the year, as Scott pointed out earlier, the 3.11% that we reported probably comes down about 4 basis points, 2 basis points to 4 basis points. And a lot of that compression is being driven just due to the fact that we're adding the LCR-compliant securities. And then on the funding side, a lot of that is coming through on the debt side. So that results in some compression as we move throughout the year. There is some additional compression that will take place on certain asset categories.

We're off to a good start in 2016 as our first quarter results provided a solid base to build from. We delivered 7% year-over-year revenue growth, 3% net income growth and 5% growth in EPS and an 8% increase in tangible book value per share. So these are solid fundamentals, and we're well-positioned to continue to deliver good results through the remainder of the year. You've heard me say this before, and it remains true: Our strategies are working, and our execution remains focused and strong. We expect to continue to gain market share and improve share of wallet in both consumers and businesses. We expect to generate annual revenue growth consistent with our long-term financial goals and manage our continued investments in our businesses, consistent with the revenue environment and our long-term financial goal of positive operating leverage. We're optimistic with the economic outlook in our footprint and believe the gradual transition to more normalized credit metrics will be effectively managed.
Finally, I want to close by reiterating that our board and management team are all long-term shareholder, and our top priorities include managing risk, reducing volatility and driving solid, consistent, long-term performance.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We're pleased to report another quarter of solid results and believe 2016 is off to a good start. Huntington's customer-centric strategy continues to deliver consistent growth and market share and share of wallet through execution of our distinctive Fair Play philosophy, our welcome culture and our superior customer service.
Disciplined execution of our strategy and well-timed investments in our businesses over the past several years are producing solid results for our shareholders, our customers, our colleagues and our communities.
Slide 3 shows some of the financial highlights for the quarter. Earnings per common share of $0.20 was up 5% from the 2015 first quarter, while tangible book value per share increased 8% to $7.12. Return on tangible common equity was 11.9%, while return on assets was 0.96%. Core fundamental trends remain strong and reflect the benefit of our strategic investments over the past several years. Year-over-year revenue growth was 7% comprised of an 8% increase in net interest income and a 4% increase in noninterest income. We continue to believe that our ability to deliver consistent topline growth despite the challenging interest rate environment distinguishes Huntington from our peers.
We also believe that our disciplined Investment Strategy combined with the focus on achieving positive operating leverage on an annual basis is proving to be a key differentiator. While we achieved positive operating leverage for the quarter, noninterest expense increased 7% year-over-year, reflecting our ongoing investments including 44 new in-store branches and digital and technology investments, such as our new mortgage origination platform that is currently being piloted.
Our efficiency ratio for the quarter was 64.6%, which remains well above our long-term financial goal of 56% to 59%. We will continue to work to improve our operating efficiency organically by growing revenue faster than expense, but we also continue to expect that our recently announced acquisition of FirstMerit wield meaningful improvements in our pro forma efficiency.
Turning to the balance sheet, average loan growth was 6% year-over-year, while average core deposit growth was 5%, continuing a 7-quarter trend of year-over-year core deposit growth being greater than 5%. Overall, credit metrics remained solid, criticized assets remained stable. We incurred only 7 basis points of net charge-offs in the quarter as we continue to benefit from large commercial real estate recoveries. Nonperforming assets increased 23 basis points from the previous quarter, with the majority of the increase centered in our oil and gas exploration and production and coal portfolios.
Our capital ratios remain strong. Tangible common equity ended the quarter at 7.89%, up 7 basis points from year-end. While all regulatory capital ratios except Common Equity Tier 1 increased meaningfully during the quarter due to the issuance of $400 million of perpetual preferred stock on March 21.
Slide 4 provides a summary income statement, including some additional details on our noninterest income and noninterest expense for the quarter. Relative to the first quarter of 2015, total reported revenue increased 7% to $754 million. Spread revenues accounted for the majority of the increase as net interest income increased 8% to $512 million.
We benefited from 8% average earning asset growth, partially offset by 4 basis points of net interest margin compression. The NIM was negatively impacted by unfavorable mix shift on both sides of the balance sheet, most notably the increase in our low-yielding LCR-compliant securities and our earning assets and higher cost senior banknotes in our funding mix. We continue to remain disciplined in pricing of both loans and deposits.
Fee income increased 4% from the year ago quarter to $242 million, primarily driven by continued customer acquisition gains and relationship deepening. Highlights included a 13% increase in service charges on deposit accounts and a 12% increase in card and payment processing income. We also faced some headwinds in the quarter in mortgage banking and trust service income. Mortgage banking income decreased 19% from the year ago quarter as a result of a 5% decline in origination volume coupled with a $2 million decrease from net MSR activity. Trust services income declined 21% year-over-year, primarily due to the sale of our funds management and servicing businesses at the end of last year.
Reported noninterest expense in the 2016 first quarter was $491 million, an increase of $32 million or 7% from the year ago quarter. This quarter's noninterest expense included one significant item: $6 million of merger-and-acquisition-related expense from the pending FirstMerit acquisition.
As detailed on Page 7 of the press release, noninterest expense adjusted for significant items in both quarters increased $29 million or 6% year-over-year. In March, the FDIC announced the final role approving the previously disclosed surcharge on banks with assets in excess of $10 billion, including Huntington. In our conference call last quarter, we stated that the surcharge would negatively impact our FDIC insurance expense by approximately $13 million in 2016. Due to the delay in the implementation until July 1, we now expect the negative impact will be approximately $7 million this year.
Slide 5 details the trends in our balance sheet mix. Average loans and leases increased $2.8 billion or 6% year-over-year as most portfolios continue to experience year-over-year growth. Average securities increased $2.1 billion or 17%, primarily reflecting growth in LCR-compliant securities and, to a lesser extent, growth in our direct-purchase municipal securities in our commercial banking segment. We are currently above the 100% threshold for liquidity coverage ratio.
Digging into the loan growth a little deeper, average commercial and industrial loans grew $1.5 billion or 8%, primarily driven by a $0.8 billion increase in asset finance. The quarter also benefited from continued momentum in auto floor plan and broad-based commercial lending. Average automobile loans grew $0.9 billion or 11% from the year ago quarter. Auto Finance remains a core competency of Huntington, and we're committed to this business and our dealer customers.
The first quarter of 2016 represented the ninth consecutive quarter of more than $1 billion of automobile loan originations. We have achieved this by remaining absolutely consistent in our strategy, which is built around the credit model that is focused on prime and super prime borrowers and a business model of high touch and local delivery.
As detailed on Slides 46 and 47 in the appendix, our underwriting has not changed, and our credit performance remains superior. Yields on the new auto paper rebounded slightly in the first quarter, back up to around 3% compared to the 2.90% to 2.95% range in the fourth quarter. Recall yields last quarter were impacted by the normal seasonal mix shift towards new vehicle sales that occur in the fourth quarter as manufacturers try to drive yearly volume goals, while the first quarter's originations reflected a return to more normal, new used mix.
The auto portfolio continues to perform very well. As expected, the seasonal increases and delinquencies and charge-offs we experienced in the fourth quarter reversed course this quarter, with delinquencies declining 26 basis points sequentially and net charge-offs declining 5 basis points. Further, if you compare our delinquencies and nonaccrual loans with the year ago quarter, you will see they are essentially flat. Net charge-offs are up modestly year-over-year but will remain well below the levels to which we underwrite the portfolio.
Staying on Slide 5 and moving to the right side, average total deposits increased $2.9 billion or 5% over the year ago quarter, including a $2.6 billion or 5% increase in average core deposits. We continue to see strong growth in demand deposits as average non-interest-bearing demand deposits increased $1.1 billion or 7% year-over-year, and average interest-bearing demand deposits increased $1.6 billion or 26%. This growth reflects our continued focus on new customer checking household and commercial relationship account acquisition as well as relationship deepening, all of which are detailed on Slides 11 through 13 that Steve will discuss later.
We also continue to remix the consumer deposit base out of higher-cost CDs into other less expensive deposit products. Average core CDs increased to $0.5 billion or 19% year-over-year.
Average total demand deposits accounted for 37% of non-equity funding in the 2016 first quarter, while money market and savings deposits accounted for a combined 38%. By contrast, average core CDs accounted for only 3% of our non-equity funding in the quarter. Average total debt increased $2.1 billion or 34% as a result of 5 senior debt issuances over the past 5 quarters totaling $4.1 billion, including $1 billion issued in March of this year as well as the assumption of debts in the Huntington Technology Finance acquisition. The $1 billion senior debt issuance this quarter was part of our normal funding strategy.
Slide 6 shows our net interest margin plotted against earning asset yields, interest-bearing liability costs and other deposit costs. First quarter NIM decreased 4 basis points year-over-year but increased 2 basis points from the previous quarter to 3.11%. This quarter the net interest margin benefited from approximately 2 basis points of interest recoveries in the commercial real estate portfolio and another 1 to 2 basis points in day count.
Adjusting these benefits out of the first quarter margin, we expect another 2 to 4 basis points of contraction in the second quarter, but remain comfortable reaffirming our previous guidance from last quarter that the net interest margin will remain above 3% for each quarter in 2016.
Slide 7 provides an update on our asset sensitivity positioning and how we manage interest rate risk. As shown in the chart on top, we estimate that net interest income would benefit by 3.6% if interest rates were to gradually ramped 200 basis points in addition to increases already reflected in the current implied forward curve. This is an increase from what we estimated a quarter ago as we recently updated our non-maturity deposit models, resulting in a reduction in the sensitivity of these deposits. In addition, as we have discussed for some time, our asset swaps are beginning a period of steady amortization as disclosed in our 10-K. We also proactively terminated $1.9 billion of swaps in January, taking advantage of volatility in the markets. As we have stated previously, our asset swap portfolio is a laddered portfolio. There are no cliffs looming on the horizon. These actions, coupled with changes in our overall balance sheet mix, drove the increase in muddled asset sensitivity.
As shown on the bottom right, on a hypothetical scenario, without the $5.8 billion of remaining asset swaps, the estimated benefit would approximate positive 5.4% in the up 200-basis point gradual ramp scenario.
The chart on the bottom of the slide shows our $5.8 billion asset swap portfolio and $5.8 billion liability swap portfolio, including their respective average remaining lives and their impact on net interest income. The incremental benefit of swaps was $24 million in the 2016 first quarter, down from $29 million in the 2015 fourth quarter and $25 million in the year ago quarter.
Slide 8 shows the trends in our capital ratios. Tangible common equity increased 7 basis points sequentially to 7.89%. All regulatory capital ratios improved meaningfully from the prior quarter end, with the exception of Common Equity Tier 1 regulatory capital ratio, which declined slightly.
Late in the quarter, we issued $400 million of 6.25 fixed-rate non-cumulative preferred equity in order to take advantage of unusual market conditions and low-interest rate environment to lock in low cost permanent capital. With this issuance, we are now more in line with our peers with respect to the amount of preferred equity in our capital structure. Although as market conditions allow, you may see us further optimize our capital structure in the future, relative to the Basel III rules.
Slide 9 provides an overview of our loan loss provision, net charge-offs and allowance for credit losses. Credit performance remains solid and in line with our expectations. Criticized assets remain stable. The loan loss provision was $27.6 million in the first quarter compared to $8.6 million of net charge-offs. Net charge-offs represented 7 basis points of average loans and benefited from the previously mentioned large recovery in our commercial real estate portfolio.
As we stated last quarter, we expect credit cost will gradually migrate back to more normalized levels, particularly as recoveries from previously charged off commercial real estate loans diminish. For 2016, however, we expect net charge-offs will remain below our long-term expectations of 35 basis points to 55 basis points.
The ACL ratio ticked up 1 basis point to 1.34% of loans and leases compared to 1.33% at the prior quarter end. The ratio of allowance to nonaccrual loans decreased to 138% compared to 180% a quarter ago due to the uptick in NALs, primarily within our oil and gas exploration of production and coal portfolios. We believe the allowance is appropriate and reflects the underlying credit quality of our loan portfolio.
Slide 10 shows trends in nonperforming assets, delinquencies and criticized assets. The chart in the upper left shows an increase in the nonperforming asset ratio for the quarter to 102 basis points compared to 79 basis points a quarter ago. The increase again, primarily reflected several oil and gas exploration and production credits and one large coal credit, which were placed on nonaccrual during the quarter.
The chart on the upper right reflects our 90-day delinquencies, which remained essentially flat for the past year. The bottom left chart shows the criticized asset ratio, which also has remained relatively stable the past few quarters. Finally, the chart on the bottom right shows NPA inflows as a percentage of beginning-period loans at 48 basis points for the first quarter, reflecting the oil and gas exploration and production in coal nonaccrual credits mentioned previously.
All credit metrics fully reflect the results of the recently completed Shared National Credit exam. Results were consistent with past exams and that we had a handful of downgrades as well as some upgrades. We processed all the downgrades. However, we only processed a few of the upgrades as we believe we either have more recent or more complete information on the relationship, or we simply opted to take a more conservative stance. This practice would also be consistent with past exams.
Let me now turn the presentation over to Steve."

We owe these r",1333,"Thank you, Mac.
Slide 11 shows the continued progress driving what we believe to be industry-leading customer acquisition and associated revenue growth from both acquiring and building meaningful banking relationships with these customers. We owe these results to the unique combination of our Fair Play banking philosophy, our welcome culture and execution of our optimal customer relationship or OCR focus on relationship banking. Since 2010, we've increased our consumer checking households and business checking relationships by 8% and 5% compound annual growth rates, respectively. These robust customer acquisition rates have allowed us to post the associated 5% and 9% compound annual growth rates in consumer and business revenue, which you can see in the 2 lower charts on the slide.
You've heard me say this for a number of years and you'll hear me say it again in the future, our focus remains on growing revenues. We continue to grow revenues despite the challenging environment.
Slide 12 and 13 illustrate the continued success of our OCR strategy and deepening our consumer and commercial relationships. Our strategy has remained consistent since 2010 and is built around 2 simple objectives: gain market share and gain share of wallet. Our track record has illustrated and we will continue to demonstrate that this strategy results both in more loyal, satisfied and stickier customers as well as revenue growth.
As of the quarter end, almost 53% of our consumer checking households used 6 or more products and services, up from 50% a year ago. Correspondingly, our consumer checking account household revenue was up $33 million or 12% year-over-year in the first quarter. Similarly, almost 48% of our commercial checking customers used 4 or more products or services at year-end, up from 43% a year ago.
Commercial revenue increased $4 million or 2% year-over-year. And you'll notice a step up this quarter in the number of business relationships utilizing 4 or more products or services. This increase results from a recent change in pricing for certain of our treasury management products and related impact on the measurement of products and services utilized by these customers. We expect this will represent a one-time step up.
Slides 14 and 15 provide a glimpse at some of the key economic data for our footprint. Slide 14 illustrates trends in the unemployment rates across our 6 core Midwestern states as well as other leading, coincident and lagging economic data for the region. Unemployment rates in Ohio and Michigan are the lowest since the early 2000s, and the unemployment rates in the 4 largest states in the footprint, Michigan, Ohio, Indiana and Pennsylvania, are all at or below national unemployment rates.
Further, the higher rate in the Midwest is the highest in the nation. Over 50% of the net manufacturing jobs created in the country since the recession are in Ohio, Michigan and Indiana. And finally, despite recent market volatility and global macroeconomic uncertainty, average consumer confidence in the Midwest is around what it was in 2002.
Slide 15 takes a deeper look at the trends in unemployment rates in our largest metropolitan markets. Most of the large MSAs, the footprint were near 15-year lows for unemployment levels at the end of January.
As you can probably gather from this data, we remain bullish on our core Midwestern footprint. The auto industry is an important component of the economy in our footprint, and it appears poised for another stellar year in 2016.
Our small medium-sized commercial customers continue to express confidence in their businesses. Real estate markets across the footprint are improving. There is a significant amount of economic activity in our footprint tied to higher education and healthcare. And I continue to believe the benefit of low-energy prices for consumers and manufacturers more than outweighs the isolated pockets of stress on business within the energy sector in our footprint. Our SBA lending also remains quite robust. In fact, March was our best month ever for SBA originations.
Turning to Slide 16. While we're only one quarter into the year, Slide 16 shows that we're off to a good start to execute for our long term financial goal of annual positive operating leverage. We expect 2016 will represent our fourth consecutive year to deliver positive operating leverage.
So with that, let's turn to Slide 17 for some closing remarks and messages. We remain focused on delivering consistent, through the cycle shareholder returns. And this strategy entails reducing short-term volatility, achieving top-tier performance over the long term and maintaining our aggregate moderate-to-low risk profile throughout. Our value proposition for both consumers and businesses continue to drive industry-leading new customer acquisition. We've successfully built a strong and recognizable consumer brand, with differentiated products and superior customer service. We continue to execute our strategies and refine and react when necessary. We've invested and will continue to invest in our businesses, particularly around enhanced sales management, mobile and digital technologies, data analytics and optimizing our retail distribution network. Importantly, we plan to continue to manage our expenses appropriately, within our revenue outlook. And we expect to grow revenue.
We're optimistic on our core Midwest footprint's local economies and the businesses and consumers within them. We are prudently managing certain industries or sectors, potentially impacted by market volatility and global macroeconomic uncertainty. However, we believe these risks remain well contained, and the majority of our core consumer and small and medium-sized business customers enjoy a healthy, near-term outlook. We see no evidence of near-term deterioration or problems looming on the horizon. Customer sentiment remains positive, and commercial loan utilization rate showed a slight increase for the fourth consecutive quarter.
Pressure on our NIM will remain a modest headwind in the near term. We continue to expect the NIM will remain above 3% throughout 2016.
We expect to grow revenue despite these pressures, consistent with our 4% to 6% long-term financial goal, excluding significant items and that of MSR activity and obviously the impact of FirstMerit. We'll continue to place ongoing investments in our businesses consistent with our revenue outlook and consistent with our long-term goal of annual operating positive leverage.
We closely monitor our loan portfolio, and given the absolute low level of our credit metrics in recent market and global economic volatility, we do expect some volatility in our credit metrics going forward, and anticipate that loan-loss provisioning for both ourselves and the broader industry will gradually begin to return to more normalized levels. So let me stress, we do not see any material deterioration on the horizon. We're simply moving off cyclical lows, and we'll gradually move back toward normal for both provisioning and net charge-offs. We expect our net charge-offs for the year will remain below our long-term expected range of 35 basis points to 55 basis points.
Next, we always like to include a reminder that there is alignment between the board, management, our employees and our shareholders. The board and our colleagues are collectively the sixth largest shareholder of Huntington. We uphold the retirement requirements on certain shares and are appropriately focused on driving sustained, long-term performance. We're highly focused on our commitment to being good stewards of shareholders' capital.
Finally, before we move into the Q&A period, I'd like to give you a quick update on the status of the FirstMerit acquisition we announced earlier this year. We have filed our application with the regulators and anticipate that we will receive both regulatory and shareholder approval to allow us to close the transaction in the third quarter. We also continue our integration planning. We've made significant product -- progress in our product and data mapping process, as well as our planning around the organizational structure. The more we get to know the FirstMerit team, the quality and the depth of their talent and the similarity of cultures, the more excited I get about this transaction and our ability to deliver on our commitments as we come together.
So now I'll turn it back over to Mark, so we can get to your questions."

So if there's going to be one difference in the subsequent quarters, it's going to be a more normalized level of recovery. So that in and of itself will take the net charge-off number up. But we are not seeing anything on the horizon that leads us to conclude that there would be any notable changes. Other than that, we've given guidance that we still expect to be below the 35 basis points to 55 basis points. So I think that gives you a pretty good range of what we might see. In terms of the energy build this quarter, we think we've been very conservative in identifying the issues that we have out there. We are well reserved on that portfolio. We've got our credit mark on that portfolio with 10%, which given the combination -- or the constitution of our portfolio, no energy services, I think, that's a big differentiator when we're looking at energy exposure. Ours is all E&P, very well-secured exposure. So even if you say there's going to be continued low energy prices, we think that portfolio on a relative basis is going to hold up quite well."

So -- but, I will say that the stress analysis we do, there's still quite a bit of room between where we were at today and where we feel we would incur significant losses. So we do various stressing on the portfolio. Our sensitized case that we use is well below the strip case, and we even do modeling that goes well below that, and even under those scenarios, this is going to be a very manageable series of events for us. Just -- we have a very small portfolio, it's 1/2 of 1% of our entire portfolio. So the overall impact just is not going to be that dramatic."

So I think if you looked to a year ago, we're probably at about 19 basis points and in the most recent quarter up to about 28 basis points. That is a very low level of charge-offs and well below what we actually model. So I think that's important. There is a bit of an effect in there from -- we've talked about TCPA, which is the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, which limited our ability to make calls to cellphones. That had a small incremental effect. So we probably have a couple basis points of additional charge-off that was in that number. And that -- the impact of that will dissipate overtime. But just as a reminder, our origination strategy on Indirect Auto has not moved at all. We continue to maintain the same FICO scores, LTVs, terms. It's a very dealer-centric model. And I think it is important when we look at our portfolio relative to others, the distinction in terms of our focus on prime and super prime customers. When we expand in the different markets, which we do from time to time, we go in with more conservative origination criteria then for the book as a whole. So we just feel, we have been rock solid in our origination strategies and don't expect to see any significant movement. So we remain very confident in our performance."

And even with that adjustment, we don't see this moving the needle significantly in terms of our performance. I would point out that the mix of our vehicles is a little bit different than what industry average would be as well. When you focus on a high FICO borrower, when you have to take the vehicles back, you tend to get a vehicle that is in better shape and having a higher resale value. I think the mix of our book also has more trucks and SUVs in it, and those values tend to hold up better than vehicles as a whole. So those factors also are going to aid us. So we feel very confident even though we know there will be some reduction in the Manheim because we've been at historically high levels for the -- probably, the last 5 or 6 years."

We appreciate your interest and support. It's an exciting time for Huntington. We saw a continued solid execution in the second quarter of 2016 built on a strong foundation and momentum demonstrated in the first quarter. 
We believe we have a good story to share with you this morning. We have filed a [indiscernible] path since 2009 focused on building a strong recognizable brand, differentiated product set and industry-leading customer service. 
While others have pulled back with a focus on cost-cutting, we invested on our franchise, built our Fair Play philosophy and our welcome culture. 
Second quarter results again provide proof that our strategies are working and that we are executing at a higher level. 
Turning to Slide 3, let's review the financial highlights of our second quarter. Huntington reported earnings per common share of $0.19, inclusive of $0.02 per share of significant items related to the costs associated with the integration of the pending FirstMerit acquisition. 
Tangible book value per share increased 9% to $7.29. Reported return on tangible common equity was 11% while reported return on assets was 0.96%. 
Fundamental trends were in line with our expectations. Compared to the second quarter of 2015, revenue grew by 1% despite an $8 million impact from net MSR activity and the realization of a $5 million gain on the securitization of auto loans in the second quarter of 2015.
Net interest income growth of 3% was largely responsible for reported revenue growth. We continue to believe that our ability to deliver consistent top line growth despite the challenging interest rate environment distinguishes Huntington from our peers. 
Noninterest expense increased $32 million or 6% year-over-year, including $21 million incurred in relation to the integration of our pending acquisition of FirstMerit. 
Noninterest expense adjusted for the FirstMerit integration expense increased 3% year-over-year. 
Our reported efficiency ratio for the quarter was 66.1%. However, the FirstMerit integration expense increased to report efficiency ratio by 260 basis points. 
While we remain above our long-term efficiency goal of 56% to 59%, improving operating efficiency continues to be the top priority for our management team. We remain confident that productivity improvements from the FirstMerit integration will significantly accelerate our ability to achieve this important financial goal.
Balance sheet growth continue to be strong. Average loans grew 8% year-over-year while average core deposits grew 5%, marking the eighth consecutive quarter of year-over-year core deposit growth being at least 5%. 
Overall, credit performance continue to demonstrate our commitment to an aggregate moderate to low risk profile. 
Second quarter net charge-offs of 13 basis points remained well below our long-term financial target of 35 to 55 basis points. 
Nonperforming assets decreased 7% linked quarter. Tangible common equity ended the quarter at 7.96%, up 4 basis points year-over-year, and 7 basis points linked quarter. And our CET1 ratio trended up 15 basis points year-over-year and 7 basis points quarter-over-quarter. 
Turning to Slide 4 and diving deeper to the income statement. Net interest income was up 3% from a year ago quarter, primarily reflecting strong earning asset growth of 8%, which was partially offset by 14 basis points of net interest margin compression.
Noninterest income was down $11 million or 4% from a year ago, impacted by $8 million of net MSR activity and a $5 million gain on the securitization of auto loans in the second quarter of 2015.
Reflecting the strength of new household acquisition out of our OCR strategy, service charges on deposit accounts increased 8%, card and payment processing income increased 9%. 
Trust service revenue in the quarter was impacted by the sale of our funds and fund servicing businesses as well as an ongoing shift in the product mix. 
Noninterest expense increased $32 million or 6% from a year ago, with FirstMerit expense accounting for $21 million of the increase. 
After adjusting for FirstMerit integration expense, noninterest expense increased 3%, primarily driven by [indiscernible] expense medical claims and technology investments. 
Of note, we continue to see wage inflation given the relatively low unemployment in many of our markets.
Turning to Slide 5, let's look at balance sheet trends. Disciplined but strong loan and lease growth continued in the second quarter, increasing 8% year-over-year. Growth was spread among many portfolios, but commercial banking and auto lending continue to lead the pack. 
Auto lending increased 26% from a year ago quarter as production continued at record levels while we maintain longstanding underwriting consistency and discipline. 
Slides 46 to 49 in the appendix showed the underwriting has not changed and our credit performance remains superior. Our auto portfolio continues to demonstrate industry-leading performance. 
Our C&I portfolio grew 8%, driven by equipment finance [indiscernible] floor plan and Corporate Banking. 
Average securities increased 15%, primarily reflecting reinvestment of portfolio runoff into LCR-compliant securities into a lesser extent growth and direct purchase visible securities in our Commercial Banking segment. We remain above the 100% threshold for the liquidity coverage ratio. 
Strong growth in our loan and securities portfolio amounted to an overall 8% increase in our average earning asset from a year ago quarter.
Moving to the right side of the slide. Average total deposits increased 5% over the year ago quarter, including a 5% increase in average core deposits. 
Demand deposits continue to drive growth, increasing 11% year-over-year, including a 4% increase in noninterest-bearing demand deposits and a 28% increase in interest-bearing demand deposits. 
Our focus on new consumer checking household and commercial relationship account acquisition as well as relationship deepening continue to drive growth in demand deposits.
Average total debt increased $1.7 billion or 23% as a result of the issuance of $3.1 billion of senior debt over the past 5 quarters, which was partially offset by a $1.1 billion decrease in short-term borrowings.
Money market deposits increased by $0.7 billion or 4% from the year ago quarter, reflecting improved cross-sell and targeted marketing. 
We also continue to remixing our deposit base, moving consumer deposits out of higher cost CDs into other less expensive deposit products. As a result, average core CDs decreased $0.6 billion or 24% year-over-year.
The net interest margin was 3.06% for the second quarter, down 14 basis points from the year ago quarter. The decrease reflected a 4 basis point decrease in earning asset yield and a 14 basis point increase in funding cost. Loan yields were only down 2 basis points year-over-year while security yields declined 9 basis points.
The increase in funding cost was almost entirely driven by the impact of the debt issuances over the past 4 quarters as the cost of deposits only increased 1 basis point year-over-year. 
On a linked quarter basis, the net interest margin decreased by 5 basis points, driven by a 3 basis point decrease in earning asset yield and a 4 basis point increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities. 
Recall that last quarter's NIM benefited from approximately 2 basis points of interest recoveries in the commercial real estate portfolio. 
Though modest further NIM compression is expected to continue given the rate environment, we continue to expect net interest margin at standalone Huntington to remain above 3% for the remaining 2 quarters of 2016. 
Slide 7 provides an update on our asset sensitivity positioning and how we manage interest rate risk. 
As shown in the chart on top, our modeling for standalone Huntington projects that net interest income will benefit by 4.1% if interest rates were to gradually ramped 200 basis points in addition to increases already reflected in the current implied forward curve. This is an increase of roughly 50 basis points from a quarter ago as our assets swap book continue to mature. 
Though we expect additional runoff from our asset swap book in coming quarters, the portfolio is laddered and there are cliffs remain on the horizon. 
As shown on the bottom right in a hypothetical scenario without the $4.7 billion of remaining asset swaps, the estimated benefit is projected to be 5.4% in the up 2 basis points gradual scenario.
The chart on the bottom of the slide shows our $4.7 billion asset swap portfolio and $6.8 billion liability swap portfolio, including their respective average remaining lives and their impact on net interest income. 
The incremental benefit of the swaps was $19 [ph] million in the 2016 second quarter, down slightly from $21 million in the first quarter and $26 million in the year ago quarter. 75% of the $19 million in swap benefit in the second quarter was from liability swaps with the remainder coming from asset swaps.
Turning to Slide 8. We see our capital ratios, which increased across the board on both the year-over-year and linked quarter basis. Tangible common equity ended the quarter at 7.96%, up 4 basis points year-over-year, and 7 basis points linked quarter. 
During the quarter, we issued an additional $200 million of attractively priced fixed rate preferred equity on top of the $400 million issued late in the first quarter.
Referring to Slide 9, we book provision expense of $25 million compared to net charge-offs of $70 [ph] million. This modest reserve bill along with the reduction in NPLs led to a 151% NAL coverage ratio, as noted in the chart on the right. 
The ACL as a percentage of loans saw [ph] 1 basis point to 1.33% due to portfolio growth. 
Asset quality metrics were favorable in the quarter, as indicated on Slide 10. NPA still in the quarter as new inflows were down substantially for prior periods. The criticized asset ratio was down modestly, falling 3.5% to 3.44%. 
New additions to criticize were offset by upgrades and paydowns. Deliquencies were also well-controlled exhibiting continued reductions. 
Let me now turn the presentation over to Steve."

I want to use the next few slides to talk about our industry-leading customer acquisition. Mac mentioned at the beginning of the call that we've taken the growth for the past several years, focusing on customer acquisition in relation to the deepening through our Fair Play banking philosophy. 
Slide 10 shows the fruits of our labor. And as you can see, both consumer and business relationships are up substantially since 2009. 
Consumer households have experienced an 8% compound annual growth since 2010 while business relationships have experienced 5% compound annual growth over the same time period. We can see the relationship growth flowing through to revenue growth as business revenues have seen 9% compound annual growth since 2009 while consumer revenues are up 5% over the same period.
I want to call out particular strong revenue growth from the consumer side over the last 5 quarters. We've not always seen the revenue benefit on the consumer side, but we've now overcome the headwind of the latest adjustments under our Fair Play philosophy implemented in the third quarter of 2014, and the investments in data and analytics will begin in 2015 are starting to show results. 
We experienced 10% year-over-year growth in consumer household revenue in the second quarter of 2016, along with 5% linked-quarter growth. And these are very strong numbers and we're optimistic we can build on these in coming quarters. 
It's not just about relationship growth, but indeed the deepening of our existing relationships. For us, the strategy has remained consistent since putting place since 2009, and we continue to see progress. 
The next 2 slides show how we think about deepening relationships with our customers. As of quarter end, 52% of our consumer checking households used 6 or more products and services, up from 51% a year ago. 
On the commercial side, 47% use 4 of our products or more of our products and services, up from 43% a year ago. And these figures are important and ones we monitor closely. 
We believe the revenue growth is a result of deeper understanding and relationship with our customers. The fair banking philosophy starts with doing the right thing for our customers, but that's just the beginning of any single customer relationship. To achieve the full potential on both sides, we have to better understand the individual customer needs and tailor our products, services and experiences to fit those needs.
So we're not just adding new customers. We're making sure we can better serve and foster a mutually beneficial relationship with our total customer base, all of our existing relationships. 
Moving to the economy. Slide 14 contains what we feel to be some of the more meaningful economic indicators for our footprint. The bottom left chart illustrates trends in unemployment rates across our 6 Midwestern states. And as you can see, the majority of our footprint has shown marked improvement in unemployment rates relative to the national average. And Ohio and Michigan in particular remained at or near their lowest level since the early 2000s. 
The chart on the top of the -- and bottom right show coincident and leading economic indicators for the region. The bottom chart, which shows leading indexes for our footprint as of May, shows that 5 of the 6 states in our footprint expect positive economic growth over the next 6 months. 
Slide 15 takes a deeper look at the trends of unemployment rates in our largest metropolitan markets. Many of the large MSAs of the footprint were near 15-year lows for unemployment rate at the end of May. Ohio, Indiana and Michigan, in particular, continue to outpace overall U.S. growth since the recovery.
There's additional calls for optimism here in our home footprint. Per capita disposable and personnel growth has outpaced the national average due to the recovery and continued to do so through the second quarter. 
Housing markets in the footprint and especially here in Ohio have shown to be far more stable than the national average. Affordability in the Midwest is the best in the country. 
The higher rate in the Midwest continues to be among the highest in the nation. And over 50% of that manufacturing jobs created in the country since the recession are in Ohio, Michigan and Indiana. 3 states have over 50% of the net manufacturing increase since the recession.
Despite continued market volatility and global macroeconomic uncertainty, we remain confident in the economy in our footprint. Indeed, the average consumer remains confident in our footprint economy as consumer confidence in the Midwest is near to 2002 levels, and we recognize the escalation of market and global volatility in recent months and the threat it impose the business here in our footprint, but affect so far had been modest. 
Turning to Slide 16. Operating leverage for the 6 months of the year was slightly negative, which was consistent with our internal forecast. Recall this is almost exactly where we were at the second quarter of 2015. We delivered positive operating leverage in 2015, which was our third consecutive year of doing so. And positive operating leverage remains an annual financial goal. 
So with that, let's turn to Slide 20 for some closing remarks and important messages. We remain focused on delivering consistent through the cycle shareholder returns. This strategy entails reducing short-term volatility, achieving top-tier performance over the long term and maintaining our aggregate moderate to low risk profile throughout. 
Our [indiscernible] stress loss estimates continue to reflect well comparatively well, and for this year included FirstMerit loan portfolios. 
Our value proposition for both consumers and businesses continue to drive industry-leading new customer acquisition. We've successfully built a strong and recognizable consumer brand with differentiated products and superior, superior customer service. 
For the third year in a row, we were recognized for leading customer satisfaction by J.D. Power and others. We continue to execute our strategies and refine and react when necessary. 
We have invested and will continue to invest in our businesses, particularly around enhanced sales management, mobile and digital technologies, data analytics and optimizing our retail distribution network. 
Importantly, we plan to continue to manage our expenses appropriately within our revenue outlook.
We expect to grow revenue. We expect growth within our core Midwest footprint's local economies and the businesses and consumers with them. We are prudently managing certain industries or sectors, potentially impacted by the market volatility and global macroeconomic uncertainty. However, we believe these risks remain well contained.
We see no evidence of near-term deterioration or problems looming on the horizon. Customer sentiment remains positive. Pressure on our NIM will remain modest headwind on the near term. We continue to expect the NIM for standalone Huntington will remain above 3% for each quarter throughout 2016.
We expect to grow revenue despite this pressure consistent to our 4% to 6% long-term financial goal, excluding significant items that our MSR activity and the impact of FirstMerit. 
We will continue to pace ongoing investments in our businesses, consistent with our revenue outlook and consistent with our long-term goal of annual positive operating leverage. 
We continue to monitor our loan portfolio very closely. And given the absolute low level of our credit metrics and recent market and global economic volatility, we do expect some volatility on our credit metrics going forward. 
And as we stated last quarter, anticipate that loan-loss provisions for both ourselves and the broader industry will gradually begin to return to more normalized levels.
Let me stress, we do not see any material deterioration on the horizon. We're simply moving off cyclical lows, and we're gradually moved back to our normal for both provisioning and net charge-offs. We expect our net charge-offs for the year will remain below our long-term expected range of 35 to 55 basis points.
Next, as we always like to include a reminder that there's a high level of alignment between the board, management, our employees and our shareholders. The board and our colleagues are collectively the sixth largest shareholder of Huntington. We have whole through retirement requirements on certain shares and are appropriately focused on driving sustained, long-term performance. We're highly focused on our commitment to being good stewards of shareholder capital.
And finally, before we move into the Q&A period, I'd like to tell you how pleased we are with the progress we're making with FirstMerit. We recently received signoff from the Department of Justice for its divestiture that results our concentration issue, which was primarily in the Canton, Ohio market. We identified a branch closures that will occur with a branch conversion in the first quarter of next year. We also continue to make progress and building out the organization for the combined entity. Our systems conversion planning efforts continued to progress as our IT teams have completed all product mapping are in the final stage of completing all data mapping. Indeed, we're coding now for the conversion. 
Finally, we remain confident that the transaction will close in the third quarter of 2016. 
I'll now turn it back over to Mark so that we can get to your questions. Thank you."

And clearly, we don't have complete insights into what happens inside the black box. And we do think the process is very different for a company that's going through an acquisition, and that's included in the CCAR results. But let me just point out a few things that could help reconcile the numbers from a capital perspective. So we knew going into this year's CCAR process that we were below our peer group in terms of CET1, probably to 220 basis points on average, and that really comes back to the fact that we were pretty aggressive in 2014 and 2015 and returning earnings to shareholders, probably 76% on average across the 2 years. Also, keep in mind that we did the Macquarie acquisition without issuing any capital. So that put us in a lower starting point relative to the peers. We also disclosed an announcement on FirstMerit that we have 100 basis points impact to CET1 because of the structure of the transaction. So that impacted as well. And then finally, we know that as we went through a business combination in a severely ever scenario inside a CCAR process that it probably cost us 50 to 70 basis points of CET1. So when you reconcile all those things and consider everything from the starting position, it really is related to going through the business combination in the CCAR process."

The performance continues to be solid, delivering revenue growth despite challenging headwinds. And our fundamentals remain solid and we're well-positioned to continue to deliver through the remainder of the year. 
You've heard me say this before, and it remains true. Our strategies are working, and our execution remains focused and strong. We expect to continue to gain market share and improve share of wallet. We expect to generate annual revenue growth consistent with our long-term financial goals and manage our continued investments in our businesses consistent with the revenue environment in our long-term financial goal of positive operating leverage annually. 
We expect modest growth in our economic footprint and continue to gradual transition to more normalized credit metrics, which will be effectively managed. We made significant progress, significant progress in our integration planning for the FirstMerit acquisition, and we look forward to completing acquisition later to this quarter following receipt of all regulatory approvals in our customary closing conditions. 
Finally, I wanted to close by reiterating that our board and this management team are all long-term shareholders. Our top priorities include increasing primary relationships across our business segments, managing risks, reducing volatility and driving solid consistent long-term performance.

278614,371817607,1009435,"Huntington Bancshares Incorporated, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 21, 2016",2016-07-21,"Earnings Calls","Huntington Bancshares Incorporated","Executives","Thanks, Mark, and thanks to everyone for joining our call today.

We appreciate your interest and support. It's an exciting time for Huntington. We saw a continued solid execution in the second quarter of 2016 built on the strong foundation and momentum demonstrated in the first quarter. 
We believe we have a good story to share with you this morning. We have filed a contrarian path since 2009 focused on building a strong recognizable brand, differentiated product set and industry-leading customer service. While others have pulled back with a focus on cost-cutting, we invested on our franchise, built our Fair Play philosophy and our welcome culture. Second quarter results again provide proof that our strategies are working and that we are executing at a high level. 
Turning to Slide 3, let's review the financial highlights of our second quarter. Huntington reported earnings per common share of $0.19, inclusive of $0.02 per share of significant items related to the costs associated with the integration of the pending FirstMerit acquisition. Tangible book value per share increased 9% to $7.29. Reported return on tangible common equity was 11%, while reported return on assets was 0.96%. 
Fundamental trends were in line with our expectations. Compared to the second quarter of 2015, revenue grew by 1% despite an $8 million impact from net MSR activity and the realization of a $5 million gain on the securitization of auto loans in the second quarter of 2015.
Net interest income growth of 3% was largely responsible for reported revenue growth. We continue to believe that our ability to deliver consistent top line growth despite the challenging interest rate environment distinguishes Huntington from our peers. 
Noninterest expense increased $32 million or 6% year-over-year, including $21 million incurred in relation to the integration of our pending acquisition of FirstMerit. Noninterest expense adjusted for the FirstMerit integration expense increased 3% year-over-year. Our reported efficiency ratio for the quarter was 66.1%. However, the FirstMerit integration expense increased the report efficiency ratio by 260 basis points. 
While we remain above our long-term efficiency goal of 56% to 59%, improving operating efficiency continues to be the top priority for our management team. We remain confident that productivity improvements from the FirstMerit integration will significantly accelerate our ability to achieve this important financial goal.
Balance sheet growth continue to be strong. Average loans grew 8% year-over-year while average core deposits grew 5%, marking the eighth consecutive quarter of year-over-year core deposit growth being at least 5%. Overall, credit performance continue to demonstrate our commitment to an aggregate moderate to low risk profile. Second quarter net charge-offs of 13 basis points remained well below our long-term financial target of 35 to 55 basis points. 
Nonperforming assets decreased 7% linked quarter. Tangible common equity ended the quarter at 7.96%, up 4 basis points year-over-year and 7 basis points linked quarter. And our CET1 ratio trended up 15 basis points year-over-year and 7 basis points quarter-over-quarter. 
Turning to Slide 4 and diving in deeper to the income statement. Net interest income was up 3% from a year ago quarter, primarily reflecting strong earning asset growth of 8%, which was partially offset by 14 basis points of net interest margin compression.
Noninterest income was down $11 million or 4% from a year ago, impacted by $8 million of net MSR activity and a $5 million gain on the securitization of auto loans in the second quarter of 2015. Reflecting the strength of new household acquisition, out of our OCR strategy, service charges on deposit accounts increased 8%, card and payment processing income increased 9%. Trust service revenue in the quarter was impacted by the sale of our funds and fund servicing businesses as well as an ongoing shift in the product mix.  
Noninterest expense increased $32 million or 6% from a year ago, with FirstMerit integration expense accounting for $21 million of the increase. After adjusting for FirstMerit integration expense, noninterest expense increased 3%, primarily driven by salary expense, medical claims and technology investments. Of note, we continue to see wage inflation given the relatively low unemployment levels in many of our markets.
Turning to Slide 5, let's look at balance sheet trends. Disciplined but strong loan and lease growth continued in the second quarter, increasing 8% year-over-year. Growth was spread among many portfolios, but commercial banking and auto lending continue to lead the pack. Auto lending increased 26% from a year ago quarter as production continued at record levels, while we maintain our long-standing underwriting consistency and discipline. 
Slides 46 to 49 in the appendix showed the underwriting has not changed, and our credit performance remains superior. Our auto portfolio continues to demonstrate industry-leading performance. Our C&I portfolio grew 8%, driven by equipment finance, dealer floorplan and corporate banking. 
Average securities increased 15%, primarily reflecting reinvestment of portfolio runoff into LCR-compliant securities into a lesser extent growth and direct purchase municipal securities in our Commercial Banking segment. We remain above the 100% threshold for the liquidity coverage ratio. Strong growth in our loan and securities portfolio amounted to an overall 8% increase in our average earning assets from a year ago quarter.
Moving to the right side of the slide. Average total deposits increased 5% over the year ago quarter, including a 5% increase in average core deposits.  Demand deposits continue to drive growth, increasing 11% year-over-year, including a 4% increase in noninterest-bearing demand deposits and a 28% increase in interest-bearing demand deposits. 
Our focus on new consumer checking household and commercial relationship account acquisition as well as relationship deepening continue to drive growth in demand deposits. Average total debt increased $1.7 billion or 23% as a result of the issuance of $3.1 billion in senior debt over the past 5 quarters, which was partially offset by a $1.1 billion decrease in short-term borrowings.
Money market deposits increased by $0.7 billion or 4% from the year ago quarter, reflecting improved cross-sell and targeted marketing. We also continued remixing our deposit base, moving consumer deposits out of higher cost CDs into other less expensive deposit products. As a result, average core CDs decreased $0.6 billion or 24% year-over-year.
The net interest margin was 3.06% for the second quarter, down 14 basis points from the year ago quarter. The decrease reflected a 4 basis point decrease in earning asset yield and a 14 basis point increase in funding cost. Loan yields were only down 2 basis points year-over-year while security yields declined 9 basis points. The increase in funding cost was almost entirely driven by the impact of the debt issuances over the past 4 quarters as the cost of deposits only increased 1 basis point year-over-year. 
On a linked-quarter basis, the net interest margin decreased by 5 basis points, driven by a 3 basis point decrease in earning asset yield and a 4 basis point increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities. Recall that last quarter's NIM benefited from approximately 2 basis points of interest recoveries in the commercial real estate portfolio. Though modest further NIM compression is expected to continue given the rate environment, we continue to expect that net interest margin at standalone Huntington to remain above 3% for the remaining 2 quarters of 2016. 
Slide 7 provides an update on our asset sensitivity positioning and how we manage interest rate risk. 
As shown in the chart on top, our modeling for stand-alone Huntington projects that net interest income would benefit by 4.1% if interest rates were to gradually ramp 200 basis points in addition to increases already reflected in the current implied forward curve. This is an increase of roughly 50 basis points from a quarter ago as our asset swap book continue to mature. Though we expect additional runoff from our asset swap book in coming quarters, the portfolio is laddered, and there are no cliffs looming on the horizon. 
As shown on the bottom right in a hypothetical scenario without the $4.7 billion of remaining asset swaps, the estimated benefit is projected to be 5.4% in the up 2 basis points gradual ramp scenario.
The chart on the bottom of the slide shows our $4.7 billion asset swap portfolio and $6.8 billion liability swap portfolio, including their respective average remaining lives and their impact on net interest income. The incremental benefit of the swaps was $19 million in the 2016 second quarter, down slightly from $21 million in the first quarter and $26 million in the year ago quarter. 75% of the $19 million in swap benefit in the second quarter was from liability swaps with the remainder coming from asset swaps.
Turning to Slide 8. We see our capital ratios, which increased across the board on both the year-over-year and linked-quarter basis. Tangible common equity ended the quarter at 7.96%, up 4 basis points year-over-year, and 7 basis points linked quarter. During the quarter, we issued an additional $200 million of attractively priced fixed rate preferred equity on top of the $400 million issued late in the first quarter.
Referring to Slide 9, we book provision expense of $25 million compared to net charge-offs of $17 million. This modest reserve bill along with the reduction in NPLs led to a 151% NAL coverage ratio, as noted in the chart on the right. The ACL, as a percentage of loans, fell 1 basis point to 1.33% due to portfolio growth. 
Asset quality metrics were favorable in the quarter, as indicated on Slide 10. NPA is still in the quarter as new inflows were down substantially for prior periods. The criticized asset ratio was down modestly, falling 3.5% to 3.44%. New additions to criticize were offset by upgrades and paydowns. Deliquencies were also well-controlled exhibiting continued reductions. 
Let me now turn the presentation over to Steve."

I want to use the next few slides to talk about our industry-leading customer acquisition. Mac mentioned at the beginning of the call that we've taken a contrarian approach for the past several years, focusing on customer acquisition in relation to the deepening through our Fair Play banking philosophy. 
Slide 10 shows the fruits of our labor. And as you can see, both consumer and business relationships are up substantially since 2009. Consumer households have experienced an 8% compound annual growth since 2010 while business relationships have experienced 5% compound annual growth over the same time period. We can see the relationship growth flowing through to revenue growth as business revenues have seen 9% compound annual growth since 2009 while consumer revenues are up 5% over the same period.
I want to call out particularly strong revenue growth from the consumer side over the last 5 quarters. We've not always seen the revenue benefit on the consumer side, but we've now overcome the headwind of the latest adjustments under our Fair Play philosophy implemented in the third quarter of 2014, and the investments in data and analytics will begin in 2015 are starting to show results. 
We experienced 10% year-over-year growth in consumer household revenue in the second quarter of 2016, along with 5% linked-quarter growth. And these are very strong numbers, and we're optimistic we can build on these in coming quarters. 
It's not just about relationship growth, but indeed the deepening of our existing relationships. For us, this strategy has remained consistent since put in place 2009, and we continue to see progress. 
The next 2 slides show how we think about deepening relationships with our customers. As of quarter end, 52% of our consumer checking households used 6 or more products and services, up from 51% a year ago. 
On the commercial side, 47% use 4 of our products or more of our products and services, up from 43% a year ago. And these figures are important and ones we monitor closely. We believe the revenue growth is a result of a deeper understanding and relationship with our customers. The fair banking philosophy starts with doing the right thing for our customers, but that's just the beginning of any single customer relationship. To achieve the full potential on both sides, we have to better understand the individual customer needs and tailor our products, services and experiences to fit those needs.
So we're not just adding new customers. We're making sure we can better serve and foster a mutually beneficial relationship with our total customer base, all of our existing relationships. 
Moving to the economy. Slide 14 contains what we feel to be some of the more meaningful economic indicators for our footprint. The bottom left chart illustrates trends in unemployment rates across our 6 Midwestern states. And as you can see, the majority of our footprint has shown marked improvement in unemployment rates relative to the national average. And Ohio and Michigan, in particular, remained at or near their lowest level since the early 2000s. 
The chart on the top of the -- and bottom right show coincident and leading economic indicators for the region. The bottom chart, which shows leading indexes for our footprint as of May, shows that 5 of the 6 states in our footprint expect positive economic growth over the next 6 months. 
Slide 15 takes a deeper look at the trends of unemployment rates in our largest metropolitan markets. Many of the large MSAs of the footprint were near 15-year lows for unemployment rate at the end of May. Ohio, Indiana and Michigan, in particular, continue to outpace overall U.S. growth since the recovery.
There's additional calls for optimism here in our home footprint. Per capita disposable and personnel income growth has outpaced the national average due to the recovery and continued to do so through the second quarter. 
Housing markets in the footprint and especially here in Ohio have shown to be far more stable than the national average. Affordability in the Midwest is the best in the country. The higher rate in the Midwest continues to be among the highest in the nation. And over 50% of that manufacturing jobs created in the country since the recession are in Ohio, Michigan and Indiana. 3 states have over 50% of the net manufacturing increase since the recession.
Despite continued market volatility and global macroeconomic uncertainty, we remain confident in the economy in our footprint. Indeed, the average consumer remains confident in our footprint economy as consumer confidence in the Midwest is near the 2002 levels. And we recognize the escalation of market and global volatility in recent months and the threat it can pose to business here in our footprint, but effects so far have been modest. 
Turning to Slide 16. Operating leverage for the first 6 months of the year was slightly negative, which was consistent with our internal forecast. Recall this is almost exactly where we were at the end of the second quarter 2015. We delivered positive operating leverage in 2015, which was our third consecutive year of doing so. And positive operating leverage remains an annual financial goal. 
So with that, let's turn to Slide 20 for some closing remarks and important messages. We remain focused on delivering consistent through-the-cycle shareholder returns. This strategy entails reducing short-term volatility, achieving top-tier performance over the long term and maintaining our aggregate moderate to low risk profile throughout. 
Our distressed [ph] stress loss estimates continue to reflect comparatively well, and for this year, included FirstMerit loan portfolios. Our value proposition for both consumers and businesses continue to drive industry-leading new customer acquisition. We've successfully built a strong and recognizable consumer brand with differentiated products and superior, superior customer service. 
For the third year in a row, we were recognized for leading customer satisfaction by J.D. Power and others. We continue to execute our strategies and refine and react when necessary. 
We have invested and will continue to invest in our businesses, particularly around enhanced sales management, mobile and digital technologies, data analytics and optimizing our retail distribution network. Importantly, we plan to continue to manage our expenses appropriately within our revenue outlook. We expect to grow revenue. We expect growth within our core Midwest footprint local economies and the businesses and consumers with them. We are prudently managing certain industries or sectors, potentially impacted by the market volatility and global macroeconomic uncertainty. However, we believe these risks remain well contained.
We see no evidence of near-term deterioration or problems looming on the horizon. Customer sentiment remains positive. Pressure on our NIM will remain a modest headwind in the near term. We continue to expect the NIM for stand-alone Huntington will remain above 3% for each quarter throughout 2016.
We expect to grow revenue despite this pressure consistent to our 4% to 6% long-term financial goal, excluding significant items that have MSR activity and the impact of FirstMerit. We will continue to pace ongoing investments in our businesses, consistent with our revenue outlook and consistent with our long-term goal of annual positive operating leverage. We continue to monitor our loan portfolio very closely. And given the absolute low level of our credit metrics and recent market and global economic volatility, we do expect some volatility on our credit metrics going forward.  And as we stated last quarter, anticipate that loan-loss provisions for both ourselves and the broader industry will gradually begin to return to more normalized levels.
Let me stress, we do not see any material deterioration on the horizon. We're simply moving off cyclical lows. And we'll gradually move back towards normal for both provisioning and net charge-offs. We expect our net charge-offs for the year will remain below our long-term expected range of 35 to 55 basis points.
Next, as we always like to include a reminder that there's a high level of alignment between the board, management, our employees and our shareholders. The board and our colleagues are collectively the sixth largest shareholder of Huntington. We have hold through retirement requirements on certain shares and are appropriately focused on driving sustained, long-term performance. We're highly focused on our commitment to being good stewards of shareholder capital.
And finally, before we move into the Q&A period, I'd like to tell you how pleased we are with the progress we're making with FirstMerit. We recently received sign-off from the Department of Justice for its divestiture that resolves our concentration issue, which was primarily in the Canton, Ohio market. We've identified the branch closures that will occur once we sit with the branch conversion in the first quarter of next year. We also continue to make progress in building out the organization for the combined entity. Our systems conversion planning efforts continue to progress as our IT teams have completed -- all product mapping are in the final stage of completing all data mapping. Indeed, we're coding now for the conversion. 
Finally, we remain confident that the transaction will close in the third quarter of 2016. 
I'll now turn it back over to Mark so we can get to your questions. Thank you."

And we do think that the process is very different for a company that's going through an acquisition. That's included in the CCAR results. But let me just point out a few things that could help reconcile the numbers from a capital perspective. So we knew going into this year's CCAR process that we were below our peer group in terms of CET1, probably to the tune of 120 basis points on average. And that really comes back to the fact that we were pretty aggressive in 2014 and 2015 and returning earnings to shareholders, probably 76% on average across the 2 years. Also keep in mind that we did the Macquarie acquisition without issuing any capital. So that put us in a lower starting point relative to the peers. We also disclosed an announcement on FirstMerit that we have 100 basis points impact to CET1 because of the structure of the transaction. So that impacted us well. And then finally, we know that as we went through a business combination in a severely adverse scenario inside the CCAR process, that it probably cost us 50 to 70 basis points of CET1. So when you reconcile all those things and consider everything from the starting position, it really is related to going through the business combination in the CCAR process."

So we have that entire process to work through as well. So that's the way I take a look at it. We feel good about the margin.

But even at that level, the impact to us on our portfolio is about 9 basis points of charge-offs. Keep in mind, we have a different customer base than average. So with our prime -- super prime focus, we managed the probability default. We think that we will -- our portfolio will have a much lower incidence of default, and therefore, the impact of these car values relative to the rest of the market is not as significant. So we're very comfortable where we stand. And even if the index were to fall, we think we're very well positioned. Again, we have a differentiated model from what many others would have."

We appreciate your interest and support. It's an exciting time for Huntington. We saw a continued solid execution in the second quarter of 2016 built on the strong foundation and momentum demonstrated in the first quarter. 
We believe we have a good story to share with you this morning. We have filed a contrarian path since 2009 focused on building a strong recognizable brand, differentiated product set and industry-leading customer service. While others have pulled back with a focus on cost-cutting, we invested in our franchise, built our Fair Play philosophy and our welcome culture. Second quarter results again provide proof that our strategies are working and that we are executing at a high level. 
Turning to Slide 3, let's review the financial highlights of our second quarter. Huntington reported earnings per common share of $0.19, inclusive of $0.02 per share of significant items related to the costs associated with the integration of the pending FirstMerit acquisition. Tangible book value per share increased 9% to $7.29. Reported return on tangible common equity was 11%, while reported return on assets was 0.96%. 
Fundamental trends were in line with our expectations. Compared to the second quarter of 2015, revenue grew by 1% despite an $8 million impact from net MSR activity and the realization of a $5 million gain on the securitization of auto loans in the second quarter of 2015.
Net interest income growth of 3% was largely responsible for reported revenue growth. We continue to believe that our ability to deliver consistent top line growth despite the challenging interest rate environment distinguishes Huntington from our peers. 
Noninterest expense increased $32 million or 6% year-over-year, including $21 million incurred in relation to the integration of our pending acquisition of FirstMerit. Noninterest expense adjusted for the FirstMerit integration expense increased 3% year-over-year. Our reported efficiency ratio for the quarter was 66.1%. However, the FirstMerit integration expense increased the report efficiency ratio by 260 basis points. 
While we remain above our long-term efficiency goal of 56% to 59%, improving operating efficiency continues to be the top priority for our management team. We remain confident that productivity improvements from the FirstMerit integration will significantly accelerate our ability to achieve this important financial goal.
Balance sheet growth continue to be strong. Average loans grew 8% year-over-year while average core deposits grew 5%, marking the eighth consecutive quarter of year-over-year core deposit growth being at least 5%. Overall, credit performance continued to demonstrate our commitment to an aggregate moderate to low risk profile. Second quarter net charge-offs of 13 basis points remained well below our long-term financial target of 35 to 55 basis points. 
Nonperforming assets decreased 7% linked quarter. Tangible common equity ended the quarter at 7.96%, up 4 basis points year-over-year and 7 basis points linked quarter. And our CET1 ratio trended up 15 basis points year-over-year and 7 basis points quarter-over-quarter. 
Turning to Slide 4 and diving in deeper to the income statement. Net interest income was up 3% from the year ago quarter, primarily reflecting strong earning asset growth of 8%, which was partially offset by 14 basis points of net interest margin compression.
Noninterest income was down $11 million or 4% from a year ago, impacted by $8 million of net MSR activity and a $5 million gain on the securitization of auto loans in the second quarter of 2015. Reflecting the strength of new household acquisition, out of our OCR strategy, service charges on deposit accounts increased 8%, card and payment processing income increased 9%. Trust service revenue in the quarter was impacted by the sale of our funds and fund servicing businesses as well as an ongoing shift in the product mix.  
Noninterest expense increased $32 million or 6% from a year ago, with FirstMerit integration expense accounting for $21 million of the increase. After adjusting for FirstMerit integration expense, noninterest expense increased 3%, primarily driven by salary expense, medical claims and technology investments. Of note, we continue to see wage inflation given the relatively low unemployment levels in many of our markets.
Turning to Slide 5, let's look at balance sheet trends. Disciplined but strong loan and lease growth continued in the second quarter, increasing 8% year-over-year. Growth was spread among many portfolios, but commercial banking and auto lending continue to lead the pack. Auto lending increased; 26% from a year ago quarter as production continued at record levels, while we maintain our long-standing underwriting consistency and discipline. 
Slides 46 to 49 in the appendix showed the underwriting has not changed, and our credit performance remains superior. Our auto portfolio continues to demonstrate industry-leading performance. Our C&I portfolio grew 8%, driven by equipment finance, dealer floorplan and corporate banking. 
Average securities increased 15%, primarily reflecting reinvestment of portfolio runoff into LCR-compliant securities into a lesser extent growth and direct purchase municipal securities in our Commercial Banking segment. We remain above the 100% threshold for the liquidity coverage ratio. Strong growth in our loan and securities portfolio amounted to an overall 8% increase in our average earning assets from a year ago quarter.
Moving to the right side of the slide. Average total deposits increased 5% over the year ago quarter, including a 5% increase in average core deposits.  Demand deposits continue to drive growth, increasing 11% year-over-year, including a 4% increase in noninterest-bearing demand deposits and a 28% increase in interest-bearing demand deposits. 
Our focus on new consumer checking household and commercial relationship account acquisition as well as relationship deepening continue to drive growth in demand deposits. Average total debt increased $1.7 billion or 23% as a result of the issuance of $3.1 billion in senior debt over the past 5 quarters, which was partially offset by a $1.1 billion decrease in short-term borrowings.
Money market deposits increased by $0.7 billion or 4% from the year ago quarter, reflecting improved cross-sell and targeted marketing. We also continued remixing our deposit base, moving consumer deposits out of higher cost CDs into other less expensive deposit products. As a result, average core CDs decreased $0.6 billion or 24% year-over-year.
The net interest margin was 3.06% for the second quarter, down 14 basis points from the year ago quarter. The decrease reflected a 4 basis point decrease in earning asset yield and a 14 basis point increase in funding cost. Loan yields were only down 2 basis points year-over-year while security yields declined 9 basis points. The increase in funding cost was almost entirely driven by the impact of the debt issuances over the past 4 quarters as the cost of deposits only increased 1 basis point year-over-year. 
On a linked-quarter basis, the net interest margin decreased by 5 basis points, driven by a 3 basis point decrease in earning asset yield and a 4 basis point increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities. Recall that last quarter's NIM benefited from approximately 2 basis points of interest recoveries in the commercial real estate portfolio. Though modest further NIM compression is expected to continue given the rate environment, we continue to expect that net interest margin at standalone Huntington to remain above 3% for the remaining 2 quarters of 2016. 
Slide 7 provides an update on our asset sensitivity positioning and how we manage interest rate risk. 
As shown in the chart on top, our modeling for stand-alone Huntington projects that net interest income would benefit by 4.1% if interest rates were to gradually ramp 200 basis points in addition to increases already reflected in the current implied forward curve. This is an increase of roughly 50 basis points from a quarter ago as our asset swap book continue to mature. Though we expect additional runoff from our asset swap book in coming quarters, the portfolio is laddered, and there are no cliffs looming on the horizon. 
As shown on the bottom right in a hypothetical scenario without the $4.7 billion of remaining asset swaps, the estimated benefit is projected to be 5.4% in the up 200 basis points gradual ramp scenario.
The chart on the bottom of the slide shows our $4.7 billion asset swap portfolio and $6.8 billion liability swap portfolio, including their respective average remaining lives and their impact on net interest income. The incremental benefit of the swaps was $19 million in the 2016 second quarter, down slightly from $21 million in the first quarter and $26 million in the year ago quarter. 75% of the $19 million in swap benefit in the second quarter was from liability swaps with the remainder coming from asset swaps.
Turning to Slide 8. We see our capital ratios, which increased across the board on both the year-over-year and linked-quarter basis. Tangible common equity ended the quarter at 7.96%, up 4 basis points year-over-year, and 7 basis points linked quarter. During the quarter, we issued an additional $200 million of attractively priced fixed rate preferred equity on top of the $400 million issued late in the first quarter.
Referring to Slide 9, we book provision expense of $25 million compared to net charge-offs of $17 million. This modest reserve bill along with the reduction in NPLs led to a 151% NAL coverage ratio, as noted in the chart on the right. The ACL, as a percentage of loans, fell 1 basis point to 1.33% due to portfolio growth. 
Asset quality metrics were favorable in the quarter, as indicated on Slide 10. NPAs fell in the quarter as new inflows were down substantially from prior periods. The criticized asset ratio was down modestly, falling 3.5% to 3.44%. New additions to criticize were offset by upgrades and paydowns. Deliquencies were also well-controlled exhibiting continued reductions. 
Let me now turn the presentation over to Steve."

I want to use the next few slides to talk about our industry-leading customer acquisition. Mac mentioned at the beginning of the call that we've taken a contrarian approach for the past several years, focusing on customer acquisition in relation to the deepening through to our Fair Play banking philosophy. 
Slide 10 shows the fruits of our labor. And as you can see, both consumer and business relationships are up substantially since 2009. Consumer households have experienced an 8% compound annual growth since 2010 while business relationships have experienced 5% compound annual growth over the same time period. We can see the relationship growth flowing through to revenue growth as business revenues have seen 9% compound annual growth since 2009 while consumer revenues are up 5% over the same period.
I want to call out particularly strong revenue growth from the consumer side over the last 5 quarters. We've not always seen the revenue benefit on the consumer side, but we've now overcome the headwind of the latest adjustments under our Fair Play philosophy implemented in the third quarter of 2014, and the investments in data and analytics will begin in 2015 are starting to show results. 
We experienced 10% year-over-year growth in consumer household revenue in the second quarter of 2016, along with 5% linked-quarter growth. And these are very strong numbers, and we're optimistic we can build on these in coming quarters. 
It's not just about relationship growth, but indeed the deepening of our existing relationships. For us, this strategy has remained consistent since put in place 2009, and we continue to see progress. 
The next 2 slides show how we think about deepening relationships with our customers. As of quarter end, 52% of our consumer checking households used 6 or more products and services, up from 51% a year ago. 
On the commercial side, 47% use 4 of our products or more of our products and services, up from 43% a year ago. And these figures are important and ones we monitor closely. We believe the revenue growth is a result of a deeper understanding and relationship with our customers. The fair banking philosophy starts with doing the right thing for our customers, but that's just the beginning of any single customer relationship. To achieve the full potential on both sides, we have to better understand the individual customer needs and tailor our products, services and experiences to fit those needs.
So we're not just adding new customers. We're making sure we can better serve and foster a mutually beneficial relationship with our total customer base, all of our existing relationships. 
Moving to the economy. Slide 14 contains what we feel to be some of the more meaningful economic indicators for our footprint. The bottom left chart illustrates trends in unemployment rates across our 6 Midwestern states. And as you can see, the majority of our footprint has shown marked improvement in unemployment rates relative to the national average. And Ohio and Michigan, in particular, remained at or near their lowest level since the early 2000s. 
The chart on the top of the -- and bottom right show coincident and leading economic indicators for the region. The bottom chart, which shows leading indexes for our footprint as of May, shows that 5 of the 6 states in our footprint expect positive economic growth over the next 6 months. 
Slide 15 takes a deeper look at the trends in unemployment rates in our largest metropolitan markets. Many of the large MSAs of the footprint were near 15-year lows for unemployment rate at the end of May. Ohio, Indiana and Michigan, in particular, continue to outpace overall U.S. growth since the recovery.
There's additional calls for optimism here in our home footprint. Per capita disposable and personnel income growth has outpaced the national average due to the recovery and continued to do so through the second quarter. 
Housing markets in the footprint and especially here in Ohio have shown to be far more stable than the national average. Affordability in the Midwest is the best in the country. The higher rate in the Midwest continues to be among the highest in the nation. And over 50% of that manufacturing jobs created in the country since the recession are in Ohio, Michigan and Indiana. 3 states have over 50% of the net manufacturing increase since the recession.
Despite continued market volatility and global macroeconomic uncertainty, we remain confident in the economy in our footprint. Indeed, the average consumer remains confident in our footprint economy as consumer confidence in the Midwest is near the 2002 levels. And we recognize the escalation of market and global volatility in recent months and the threat it can pose to business here in our footprint, but effects so far have been modest. 
Turning to Slide 16. Operating leverage for the first 6 months of the year was slightly negative, which was consistent with our internal forecast. Recall this is almost exactly where we were at the end of the second quarter 2015. We delivered positive operating leverage in 2015, which was our third consecutive year of doing so. And positive operating leverage remains an annual financial goal. 
So with that, let's turn to Slide 20 for some closing remarks and important messages. We remain focused on delivering consistent through-the-cycle shareholder returns. This strategy entails reducing short-term volatility, achieving top-tier performance over the long term and maintaining our aggregate moderate to low risk profile throughout. 
Our distressed [ph] stress loss estimates continue to reflect comparatively well, and for this year, included FirstMerit loan portfolios. Our value proposition for both consumers and businesses continue to drive industry-leading new customer acquisition. We've successfully built a strong and recognizable consumer brand with differentiated products and superior, superior customer service. 
For the third year in a row, we were recognized for leading customer satisfaction by J.D. Power and others. We continue to execute our strategies and refine and react when necessary. 
We have invested and will continue to invest in our businesses, particularly around enhanced sales management, mobile and digital technologies, data analytics and optimizing our retail distribution network. Importantly, we plan to continue to manage our expenses appropriately within our revenue outlook. We expect to grow revenue. We expect growth within our core Midwest footprint local economies and the businesses and consumers with them. We are prudently managing certain industries or sectors, potentially impacted by the market volatility and global macroeconomic uncertainty. However, we believe these risks remain well contained.
We see no evidence of near-term deterioration or problems looming on the horizon. Customer sentiment remains positive. Pressure on our NIM will remain a modest headwind in the near term. We continue to expect the NIM for stand-alone Huntington will remain above 3% for each quarter throughout 2016.
We expect to grow revenue despite this pressure consistent to our 4% to 6% long-term financial goal, excluding significant items that have MSR activity and the impact of FirstMerit. We will continue to pace ongoing investments in our businesses, consistent with our revenue outlook and consistent with our long-term goal of annual positive operating leverage. We continue to monitor our loan portfolio very closely. And given the absolute low level of our credit metrics and recent market and global economic volatility, we do expect some volatility on our credit metrics going forward.  And as we stated last quarter, anticipate that loan-loss provisions for both ourselves and the broader industry will gradually begin to return to more normalized levels.
Let me stress, we do not see any material deterioration on the horizon. We're simply moving off cyclical lows. And we'll gradually move back towards normal for both provisioning and net charge-offs. We expect our net charge-offs through the year will remain below our long-term expected range of 35 to 55 basis points.
Next, as we always like to include a reminder that there's a high level of alignment between the board, management, our employees and our shareholders. The board and our colleagues are collectively the sixth largest shareholder of Huntington. We have hold through retirement requirements on certain shares and are appropriately focused on driving sustained, long-term performance. We're highly focused on our commitment to being good stewards of shareholder capital.
And finally, before we move into the Q&A period, I'd like to tell you how pleased we are with the progress we're making with FirstMerit. We recently received sign-off from the Department of Justice for its divestiture that resolves our concentration issue, which was primarily in the Canton, Ohio market. We've identified the branch closures that will occur coincident with the branch conversion in the first quarter of next year. We also continue to make progress in building out the organization for the combined entity. Our systems conversion planning efforts continue to progress as our IT teams have completed  all product mapping are in the final stage of completing all data mapping. Indeed, we're coding now for the conversion. 
Finally, we remain confident that the transaction will close in the third quarter of 2016. 
I'll now turn it back over to Mark so we can get to your questions. Thank you."

And clearly, we don't have complete insights into what happens inside the black box. And we do think that the process is very different for a company that's going through an acquisition, if that's included in the CCAR results. But let me just point out a few things that could help reconcile the numbers from a capital perspective. So we knew going into this year's CCAR process that we were below our peer group in terms of CET1, probably to the tune of 120 basis points on average. And that really comes back to the fact that we were pretty aggressive in 2014 and 2015 and returning earnings to shareholders, probably 76% on average across the 2 years. Also keep in mind that we did the Macquarie acquisition without issuing any capital. So that put us in a lower starting point relative to the peers. We also disclosed an announcement on FirstMerit that we have 100 basis points impact to CET1 because of the structure of the transaction. So that impacted as well. And then finally, we know that as we went through a business combination in a severely adverse scenario inside the CCAR process, that it probably cost us 50 to 70 basis points of CET1. So when you reconcile all those things and consider everything but the starting position, it really is related to going through the business combination in the CCAR process."

You have a lot of banks that are moving the other direction. They've been asset-sensitive throughout anticipating what the Fed is going to do. Now that they don't have that hope anymore, they're kind of swimming, what I would call, out of the pool of pain and trying to get as much as they can before the yield curve kind of collapses on the back end on them. You're really going in opposite direction and creating a lot of revenue headwinds when you're looking at about $10 million from the peak of what you were getting out of the swaps.

So the asset sensitivity numbers that we publish are at 200 basis point gradual increase scenario. If you think about where the rate curve is today and you think about a flat rate environment going forward, over the next 12 months, we have maybe a basis point or 2 of margin at risk. So I'm not totally uncomfortable with that position. Plus we've got the FirstMerit closing integration, and I would say, optimization of the 2 balance sheets as they come together. So we have that entire process to work through as well. So that's the way I take a look at it. We feel good about the margin. And where it's at today, we still believe that we're above 3% for the remainder of the year in core Huntington. And if you take a look at FirstMerit, excluding any impact from the first accounting adjustments, it's actually additive to the margin. So that's our perspective, Marlin."

And I think it bottomed out in the 107 range briefly. And we have stressed the portfolio on our end going down to 100, which we don't think is really possible. But even at that level, the impact to us on our portfolio is about 9 basis points of charge-offs. Keep in mind, we have a different customer base than average. So with our prime -- super prime focus, we managed the probability default. We think that we will -- our portfolio will have a much lower incidence of default, and therefore, the impact of these car values relative to the rest of the market is not as significant. So we're very comfortable where we stand. And even if the index were to fall, we think we're very well positioned. Again, we have a differentiated model from what many others would have."

We appreciate your interest and support. It's an exciting time for Huntington. We saw a continued solid execution in the second quarter of 2016 built on the strong foundation and momentum demonstrated in the first quarter. 
We believe we have a good story to share with you this morning. We have filed a contrarian path since 2009 focused on building a strong recognizable brand, differentiated product set and industry-leading customer service. While others have pulled back with a focus on cost-cutting, we invested in our franchise, built our Fair Play philosophy and our welcome culture. Second quarter results again provide proof that our strategies are working and that we are executing at a high level. 
Turning to Slide 3, let's review the financial highlights of our second quarter. Huntington reported earnings per common share of $0.19, inclusive of $0.02 per share of significant items related to the costs associated with the integration of the pending FirstMerit acquisition. Tangible book value per share increased 9% to $7.29. Reported return on tangible common equity was 11%, while reported return on assets was 0.96%. 
Fundamental trends were in line with our expectations. Compared to the second quarter of 2015, revenue grew by 1% despite an $8 million impact from net MSR activity and the realization of a $5 million gain on the securitization of auto loans in the second quarter of 2015.
Net interest income growth of 3% was largely responsible for reported revenue growth. We continue to believe that our ability to deliver consistent top line growth despite the challenging interest rate environment distinguishes Huntington from our peers. 
Noninterest expense increased $32 million or 6% year-over-year, including $21 million incurred in relation to the integration of our pending acquisition of FirstMerit. Noninterest expense adjusted for the FirstMerit integration expense increased 3% year-over-year. Our reported efficiency ratio for the quarter was 66.1%. However, the FirstMerit integration expense increased the report efficiency ratio by 260 basis points. 
While we remain above our long-term efficiency goal of 56% to 59%, improving operating efficiency continues to be the top priority for our management team. We remain confident that productivity improvements from the FirstMerit integration will significantly accelerate our ability to achieve this important financial goal.
Balance sheet growth continue to be strong. Average loans grew 8% year-over-year while average core deposits grew 5%, marking the eighth consecutive quarter of year-over-year core deposit growth being at least 5%. Overall, credit performance continued to demonstrate our commitment to an aggregate moderate to low risk profile. Second quarter net charge-offs of 13 basis points remained well below our long-term financial target of 35 to 55 basis points. 
Nonperforming assets decreased 7% linked quarter. Tangible common equity ended the quarter at 7.96%, up 4 basis points year-over-year and 7 basis points linked quarter. And our CET1 ratio trended up 15 basis points year-over-year and 7 basis points quarter-over-quarter. 
Turning to Slide 4 and diving in deeper to the income statement. Net interest income was up 3% from the year ago quarter, primarily reflecting strong earning asset growth of 8%, which was partially offset by 14 basis points of net interest margin compression.
Noninterest income was down $11 million or 4% from a year ago, impacted by $8 million of net MSR activity and a $5 million gain on the securitization of auto loans in the second quarter of 2015. Reflecting the strength of new household acquisition, out of our OCR strategy, service charges on deposit accounts increased 8%, card and payment processing income increased 9%. Trust service revenue in the quarter was impacted by the sale of our funds and fund servicing businesses as well as an ongoing shift in the product mix.  
Noninterest expense increased $32 million or 6% from a year ago, with FirstMerit integration expense accounting for $21 million of the increase. After adjusting for FirstMerit integration expense, noninterest expense increased 3%, primarily driven by salary expense, medical claims and technology investments. Of note, we continue to see wage inflation given the relatively low unemployment levels in many of our markets.
Turning to Slide 5, let's look at balance sheet trends. Disciplined but strong loan and lease growth continued in the second quarter, increasing 8% year-over-year. Growth was spread among many portfolios, but commercial banking and auto lending continue to lead the pack. Auto lending increased; 26% from a year ago quarter as production continued at record levels, while we maintain our long-standing underwriting consistency and discipline. 
Slides 46 to 49 in the appendix showed the underwriting has not changed, and our credit performance remains superior. Our auto portfolio continues to demonstrate industry-leading performance. Our C&I portfolio grew 8%, driven by equipment finance, dealer floorplan and corporate banking. 
Average securities increased 15%, primarily reflecting reinvestment of portfolio runoff into LCR-compliant securities into a lesser extent growth and direct purchase municipal securities in our Commercial Banking segment. We remain above the 100% threshold for the liquidity coverage ratio. Strong growth in our loan and securities portfolio amounted to an overall 8% increase in our average earning assets from a year ago quarter.
Moving to the right side of the slide. Average total deposits increased 5% over the year ago quarter, including a 5% increase in average core deposits.  Demand deposits continue to drive growth, increasing 11% year-over-year, including a 4% increase in noninterest-bearing demand deposits and a 28% increase in interest-bearing demand deposits. 
Our focus on new consumer checking household and commercial relationship account acquisition as well as relationship deepening continue to drive growth in demand deposits. Average total debt increased $1.7 billion or 23% as a result of the issuance of $3.1 billion in senior debt over the past 5 quarters, which was partially offset by a $1.1 billion decrease in short-term borrowings.
Money market deposits increased by $0.7 billion or 4% from the year ago quarter, reflecting improved cross-sell and targeted marketing. We also continued remixing our deposit base, moving consumer deposits out of higher cost CDs into other less expensive deposit products. As a result, average core CDs decreased $0.6 billion or 24% year-over-year.
The net interest margin was 3.06% for the second quarter, down 14 basis points from the year ago quarter. The decrease reflected a 4 basis point decrease in earning asset yield and a 14 basis point increase in funding cost. Loan yields were only down 2 basis points year-over-year while security yields declined 9 basis points. The increase in funding cost was almost entirely driven by the impact of the debt issuances over the past 4 quarters as the cost of deposits only increased 1 basis point year-over-year. 
On a linked-quarter basis, the net interest margin decreased by 5 basis points, driven by a 3 basis point decrease in earning asset yield and a 4 basis point increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities. Recall that last quarter's NIM benefited from approximately 2 basis points of interest recoveries in the commercial real estate portfolio. Though modest further NIM compression is expected to continue given the rate environment, we continue to expect that net interest margin at standalone Huntington to remain above 3% for the remaining 2 quarters of 2016. 
Slide 7 provides an update on our asset sensitivity positioning and how we manage interest rate risk. 
As shown in the chart on top, our modeling for stand-alone Huntington projects that net interest income would benefit by 4.1% if interest rates were to gradually ramp 200 basis points in addition to increases already reflected in the current implied forward curve. This is an increase of roughly 50 basis points from a quarter ago as our asset swap book continue to mature. Though we expect additional runoff from our asset swap book in coming quarters, the portfolio is laddered, and there are no cliffs looming on the horizon. 
As shown on the bottom right in a hypothetical scenario without the $4.7 billion of remaining asset swaps, the estimated benefit is projected to be 5.4% in the up 200 basis points gradual ramp scenario.
The chart on the bottom of the slide shows our $4.7 billion asset swap portfolio and $6.8 billion liability swap portfolio, including their respective average remaining lives and their impact on net interest income. The incremental benefit of the swaps was $19 million in the 2016 second quarter, down slightly from $21 million in the first quarter and $26 million in the year ago quarter. 75% of the $19 million in swap benefit in the second quarter was from liability swaps with the remainder coming from asset swaps.
Turning to Slide 8. We see our capital ratios, which increased across the board on both the year-over-year and linked-quarter basis. Tangible common equity ended the quarter at 7.96%, up 4 basis points year-over-year, and 7 basis points linked quarter. During the quarter, we issued an additional $200 million of attractively priced fixed rate preferred equity on top of the $400 million issued late in the first quarter.
Referring to Slide 9, we book provision expense of $25 million compared to net charge-offs of $17 million. This modest reserve bill along with the reduction in NPLs led to a 151% NAL coverage ratio, as noted in the chart on the right. The ACL, as a percentage of loans, fell 1 basis point to 1.33% due to portfolio growth. 
Asset quality metrics were favorable in the quarter, as indicated on Slide 10. NPAs fell in the quarter as new inflows were down substantially from prior periods. The criticized asset ratio was down modestly, falling 3.5% to 3.44%. New additions to criticize were offset by upgrades and paydowns. Deliquencies were also well-controlled exhibiting continued reductions. 
Let me now turn the presentation over to Steve."

I want to use the next few slides to talk about our industry-leading customer acquisition. Mac mentioned at the beginning of the call that we've taken a contrarian approach for the past several years, focusing on customer acquisition in relation to the deepening through to our Fair Play banking philosophy. 
Slide 10 shows the fruits of our labor. And as you can see, both consumer and business relationships are up substantially since 2009. Consumer households have experienced an 8% compound annual growth since 2010 while business relationships have experienced 5% compound annual growth over the same time period. We can see the relationship growth flowing through to revenue growth as business revenues have seen 9% compound annual growth since 2009 while consumer revenues are up 5% over the same period.
I want to call out particularly strong revenue growth from the consumer side over the last 5 quarters. We've not always seen the revenue benefit on the consumer side, but we've now overcome the headwind of the latest adjustments under our Fair Play philosophy implemented in the third quarter of 2014, and the investments in data and analytics will begin in 2015 are starting to show results. 
We experienced 10% year-over-year growth in consumer household revenue in the second quarter of 2016, along with 5% linked-quarter growth. And these are very strong numbers, and we're optimistic we can build on these in coming quarters. 
It's not just about relationship growth, but indeed the deepening of our existing relationships. For us, this strategy has remained consistent since put in place 2009, and we continue to see progress. 
The next 2 slides show how we think about deepening relationships with our customers. As of quarter end, 52% of our consumer checking households used 6 or more products and services, up from 51% a year ago. 
On the commercial side, 47% use 4 of our products or more of our products and services, up from 43% a year ago. And these figures are important and ones we monitor closely. We believe the revenue growth is a result of a deeper understanding and relationship with our customers. The fair banking philosophy starts with doing the right thing for our customers, but that's just the beginning of any single customer relationship. To achieve the full potential on both sides, we have to better understand the individual customer needs and tailor our products, services and experiences to fit those needs.
So we're not just adding new customers. We're making sure we can better serve and foster a mutually beneficial relationship with our total customer base, all of our existing relationships. 
Moving to the economy. Slide 14 contains what we feel to be some of the more meaningful economic indicators for our footprint. The bottom left chart illustrates trends in unemployment rates across our 6 Midwestern states. And as you can see, the majority of our footprint has shown marked improvement in unemployment rates relative to the national average. And Ohio and Michigan, in particular, remained at or near their lowest level since the early 2000s. 
The chart on the top of the -- and bottom right show coincident and leading economic indicators for the region. The bottom chart, which shows leading indexes for our footprint as of May, shows that 5 of the 6 states in our footprint expect positive economic growth over the next 6 months. 
Slide 15 takes a deeper look at the trends in unemployment rates in our largest metropolitan markets. Many of the large MSAs of the footprint were near 15-year lows for unemployment rate at the end of May. Ohio, Indiana and Michigan, in particular, continue to outpace overall U.S. growth since the recovery.
There's additional calls for optimism here in our home footprint. Per capita disposable and personnel income growth has outpaced the national average due to the recovery and continued to do so through the second quarter. 
Housing markets in the footprint and especially here in Ohio have shown to be far more stable than the national average. Affordability in the Midwest is the best in the country. The higher rate in the Midwest continues to be among the highest in the nation. And over 50% of that manufacturing jobs created in the country since the recession are in Ohio, Michigan and Indiana. 3 states have over 50% of the net manufacturing increase since the recession.
Despite continued market volatility and global macroeconomic uncertainty, we remain confident in the economy in our footprint. Indeed, the average consumer remains confident in our footprint economy as consumer confidence in the Midwest is near the 2002 levels. And we recognize the escalation of market and global volatility in recent months and the threat it can pose to business here in our footprint, but effects so far have been modest. 
Turning to Slide 16. Operating leverage for the first 6 months of the year was slightly negative, which was consistent with our internal forecast. Recall this is almost exactly where we were at the end of the second quarter 2015. We delivered positive operating leverage in 2015, which was our third consecutive year of doing so. And positive operating leverage remains an annual financial goal. 
So with that, let's turn to Slide 20 for some closing remarks and important messages. We remain focused on delivering consistent through-the-cycle shareholder returns. This strategy entails reducing short-term volatility, achieving top-tier performance over the long term and maintaining our aggregate moderate to low risk profile throughout. 
Our distressed [ph] stress loss estimates continue to reflect comparatively well, and for this year, included FirstMerit loan portfolios. Our value proposition for both consumers and businesses continue to drive industry-leading new customer acquisition. We've successfully built a strong and recognizable consumer brand with differentiated products and superior, superior customer service. 
For the third year in a row, we were recognized for leading customer satisfaction by J.D. Power and others. We continue to execute our strategies and refine and react when necessary. 
We have invested and will continue to invest in our businesses, particularly around enhanced sales management, mobile and digital technologies, data analytics and optimizing our retail distribution network. Importantly, we plan to continue to manage our expenses appropriately within our revenue outlook. We expect to grow revenue. We expect growth within our core Midwest footprint local economies and the businesses and consumers with them. We are prudently managing certain industries or sectors, potentially impacted by the market volatility and global macroeconomic uncertainty. However, we believe these risks remain well contained.
We see no evidence of near-term deterioration or problems looming on the horizon. Customer sentiment remains positive. Pressure on our NIM will remain a modest headwind in the near term. We continue to expect the NIM for stand-alone Huntington will remain above 3% for each quarter throughout 2016.
We expect to grow revenue despite this pressure consistent to our 4% to 6% long-term financial goal, excluding significant items that have MSR activity and the impact of FirstMerit. We will continue to pace ongoing investments in our businesses, consistent with our revenue outlook and consistent with our long-term goal of annual positive operating leverage. We continue to monitor our loan portfolio very closely. And given the absolute low level of our credit metrics and recent market and global economic volatility, we do expect some volatility on our credit metrics going forward.  And as we stated last quarter, anticipate that loan-loss provisions for both ourselves and the broader industry will gradually begin to return to more normalized levels.
Let me stress, we do not see any material deterioration on the horizon. We're simply moving off cyclical lows. And we'll gradually move back towards normal for both provisioning and net charge-offs. We expect our net charge-offs through the year will remain below our long-term expected range of 35 to 55 basis points.
Next, as we always like to include a reminder that there's a high level of alignment between the board, management, our employees and our shareholders. The board and our colleagues are collectively the sixth largest shareholder of Huntington. We have hold through retirement requirements on certain shares and are appropriately focused on driving sustained, long-term performance. We're highly focused on our commitment to being good stewards of shareholder capital.
And finally, before we move into the Q&A period, I'd like to tell you how pleased we are with the progress we're making with FirstMerit. We recently received sign-off from the Department of Justice for its divestiture that resolves our concentration issue, which was primarily in the Canton, Ohio market. We've identified the branch closures that will occur coincident with the branch conversion in the first quarter of next year. We also continue to make progress in building out the organization for the combined entity. Our systems conversion planning efforts continue to progress as our IT teams have completed  all product mapping are in the final stage of completing all data mapping. Indeed, we're coding now for the conversion. 
Finally, we remain confident that the transaction will close in the third quarter of 2016. 
I'll now turn it back over to Mark so we can get to your questions. Thank you."

And clearly, we don't have complete insights into what happens inside the black box. And we do think that the process is very different for a company that's going through an acquisition, if that's included in the CCAR results. But let me just point out a few things that could help reconcile the numbers from a capital perspective. So we knew going into this year's CCAR process that we were below our peer group in terms of CET1, probably to the tune of 120 basis points on average. And that really comes back to the fact that we were pretty aggressive in 2014 and 2015 and returning earnings to shareholders, probably 76% on average across the 2 years. Also keep in mind that we did the Macquarie acquisition without issuing any capital. So that put us in a lower starting point relative to the peers. We also disclosed an announcement on FirstMerit that we have 100 basis points impact to CET1 because of the structure of the transaction. So that impacted as well. And then finally, we know that as we went through a business combination in a severely adverse scenario inside the CCAR process, that it probably cost us 50 to 70 basis points of CET1. So when you reconcile all those things and consider everything but the starting position, it really is related to going through the business combination in the CCAR process."

Performance continues to be solid, delivering revenue growth despite challenging headwinds. And our fundamentals remain solid, and we're well-positioned to continue to deliver through the remainder of the year. You've heard me say this before, and it remains true. Our strategies are working, and our execution remains focused and strong. We expect to continue to gain market share and improve share of wallet. We expect to generate annual revenue growth consistent with our long-term financial goals and manage our continued investments in our businesses consistent with the revenue environment and our long-term financial goal of positive operating leverage annually. 
We expect modest growth in our economic footprint and continue the gradual transition to more normalized credit metrics, which will be effectively managed. We made significant progress, significant progress in our integration planning for the FirstMerit acquisition. We look forward to completing the acquisition later this quarter following receipt of all regulatory approvals in our customary closing conditions. 
Finally, I want to close by reiterating that our board and this management team are all long-term shareholders. Our top priorities include increasing primary relationships across our business segments, managing risks, reducing volatility and driving solid consistent long-term performance.

We appreciate your interest and support. It's an exciting time for Huntington. We saw a continued solid execution in the second quarter of 2016 built on the strong foundation and momentum demonstrated in the first quarter. 
We believe we have a good story to share with you this morning. We have followed a contrarian path since 2009 focused on building a strong recognizable brand, differentiated product set and industry-leading customer service. While others have pulled back with a focus on cost-cutting, we invested in our franchise, built our Fair Play philosophy and our welcome culture. Second quarter results again provide proof that our strategies are working and that we are executing at a high level. 
Turning to Slide 3, let's review the financial highlights of our second quarter. Huntington reported earnings per common share of $0.19, inclusive of $0.02 per share of significant items related to the costs associated with the integration of the pending FirstMerit acquisition. Tangible book value per share increased 9% to $7.29. Reported return on tangible common equity was 11%, while reported return on assets was 0.96%. 
Fundamental trends were in line with our expectations. Compared to the second quarter of 2015, revenue grew by 1% despite an $8 million impact from net MSR activity and the realization of a $5 million gain on the securitization of auto loans in the second quarter of 2015.
Net interest income growth of 3% was largely responsible for reported revenue growth. We continue to believe that our ability to deliver consistent top line growth despite the challenging interest rate environment distinguishes Huntington from our peers. 
Noninterest expense increased $32 million or 6% year-over-year, including $21 million incurred in relation to the integration of our pending acquisition of FirstMerit. Noninterest expense adjusted for the FirstMerit integration expense increased 3% year-over-year. Our reported efficiency ratio for the quarter was 66.1%. However, the FirstMerit integration expense increased the report efficiency ratio by 260 basis points. 
While we remain above our long-term efficiency goal of 56% to 59%, improving operating efficiency continues to be the top priority for our management team. We remain confident that productivity improvements from the FirstMerit integration will significantly accelerate our ability to achieve this important financial goal.
Balance sheet growth continue to be strong. Average loans grew 8% year-over-year while average core deposits grew 5%, marking the eighth consecutive quarter of year-over-year core deposit growth being at least 5%. Overall, credit performance continued to demonstrate our commitment to an aggregate moderate to low risk profile. Second quarter net charge-offs of 13 basis points remained well below our long-term financial target of 35 to 55 basis points. 
Nonperforming assets decreased 7% linked quarter. Tangible common equity ended the quarter at 7.96%, up 4 basis points year-over-year and 7 basis points linked quarter. And our CET1 ratio trended up 15 basis points year-over-year and 7 basis points quarter-over-quarter. 
Turning to Slide 4 and diving in deeper to the income statement. Net interest income was up 3% from the year ago quarter, primarily reflecting strong earning asset growth of 8%, which was partially offset by 14 basis points of net interest margin compression.
Noninterest income was down $11 million or 4% from a year ago, impacted by $8 million of net MSR activity and a $5 million gain on the securitization of auto loans in the second quarter of 2015. Reflecting the strength of new household acquisition, out of our OCR strategy, service charges on deposit accounts increased 8%, card and payment processing income increased 9%. Trust service revenue in the quarter was impacted by the sale of our funds and fund servicing businesses as well as an ongoing shift in the product mix. 
Noninterest expense increased $32 million or 6% from a year ago, with FirstMerit integration expense accounting for $21 million of the increase. After adjusting for FirstMerit integration expense, noninterest expense increased 3%, primarily driven by salary expense, medical claims and technology investments. Of note, we continue to see wage inflation given the relatively low unemployment levels in many of our markets.
Turning to Slide 5, let's look at balance sheet trends. Disciplined but strong loan and lease growth continued in the second quarter, increasing 8% year-over-year. Growth was spread among many portfolios, but commercial banking and auto lending continue to lead the pack. Auto lending increased; 26% from a year ago quarter as production continued at record levels, while we maintain our long-standing underwriting consistency and discipline. 
Slides 46 to 49 in the appendix showed the underwriting has not changed, and our credit performance remains superior. Our auto portfolio continues to demonstrate industry-leading performance. Our C&I portfolio grew 8%, driven by equipment finance, dealer floorplan and corporate banking. 
Average securities increased 15%, primarily reflecting reinvestment of portfolio runoff into LCR-compliant securities into a lesser extent growth in direct purchase municipal securities in our Commercial Banking segment. We remain above the 100% threshold for the liquidity coverage ratio. Strong growth in our loan and securities portfolio amounted to an overall 8% increase in our average earning assets from a year ago quarter.
Moving to the right side of the slide. Average total deposits increased 5% over the year ago quarter, including a 5% increase in average core deposits. Demand deposits continue to drive growth, increasing 11% year-over-year, including a 4% increase in noninterest-bearing demand deposits and a 28% increase in interest-bearing demand deposits. 
Our focus on new consumer checking household and commercial relationship account acquisition as well as relationship deepening continue to drive growth in demand deposits. Average total debt increased $1.7 billion or 23% as a result of the issuance of $3.1 billion in senior debt over the past 5 quarters, which was partially offset by a $1.1 billion decrease in short-term borrowings.
Money market deposits increased by $0.7 billion or 4% from the year ago quarter, reflecting improved cross-sell and targeted marketing. We also continued remixing our deposit base, moving consumer deposits out of higher cost CDs into other less expensive deposit products. As a result, average core CDs decreased $0.6 billion or 24% year-over-year.
The net interest margin was 3.06% for the second quarter, down 14 basis points from the year ago quarter. The decrease reflected a 4 basis point decrease in earning asset yield and a 14 basis point increase in funding cost. Loan yields were only down 2 basis points year-over-year while security yields declined 9 basis points. The increase in funding cost was almost entirely driven by the impact of the debt issuances over the past 4 quarters as the cost of deposits only increased 1 basis point year-over-year. 
On a linked-quarter basis, the net interest margin decreased by 5 basis points, driven by a 3 basis point decrease in earning asset yield and a 4 basis point increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities. Recall that last quarter's NIM benefited from approximately 2 basis points of interest recoveries in the commercial real estate portfolio. Though modest further NIM compression is expected to continue given the rate environment, we continue to expect that net interest margin at standalone Huntington to remain above 3% for the remaining 2 quarters of 2016. 
Slide 7 provides an update on our asset sensitivity positioning and how we manage interest rate risk. As shown in the chart on top, our modeling for stand-alone Huntington projects that net interest income would benefit by 4.1% if interest rates were to gradually ramp 200 basis points in addition to increases already reflected in the current implied forward curve. This is an increase of roughly 50 basis points from a quarter ago as our asset swap book continue to mature. Though we expect additional runoff from our asset swap book in coming quarters, the portfolio is laddered, and there are no cliffs looming on the horizon. 
As shown on the bottom right in a hypothetical scenario without the $4.7 billion of remaining asset swaps, the estimated benefit is projected to be 5.4% in the up 200 basis points gradual ramp scenario.
The chart on the bottom of the slide shows our $4.7 billion asset swap portfolio and $6.8 billion liability swap portfolio, including their respective average remaining lives and their impact on net interest income. The incremental benefit of the swaps was $19 million in the 2016 second quarter, down slightly from $21 million in the first quarter and $26 million in the year ago quarter. 75% of the $19 million in swap benefit in the second quarter was from liability swaps with the remainder coming from asset swaps.
Turning to Slide 8. We see our capital ratios, which increased across the board on both the year-over-year and linked-quarter basis. Tangible common equity ended the quarter at 7.96%, up 4 basis points year-over-year, and 7 basis points linked quarter. During the quarter, we issued an additional $200 million of attractively priced fixed rate preferred equity on top of the $400 million issued late in the first quarter.
Referring to Slide 9, we book provision expense of $25 million compared to net charge-offs of $17 million. This modest reserve build along with the reduction in NPLs led to a 151% NAL coverage ratio, as noted in the chart on the right. The ACL, as a percentage of loans, fell 1 basis point to 1.33% due to portfolio growth. 
Asset quality metrics were favorable in the quarter, as indicated on Slide 10. NPAs fell in the quarter as new inflows were down substantially from prior periods. The criticized asset ratio was down modestly, falling 3.5% to 3.44%. New additions to criticize were offset by upgrades and paydowns. Delinquencies were also well-controlled exhibiting continued reductions. 
Let me now turn the presentation over to Steve."

I want to use the next few slides to talk about our industry-leading customer acquisition. Mac mentioned at the beginning of the call that we've taken a contrarian approach for the past several years, focusing on customer acquisition in relation to the deepening through to our Fair Play banking philosophy. 
Slide 10 shows the fruits of our labor. And as you can see, both consumer and business relationships are up substantially since 2009. Consumer households have experienced an 8% compound annual growth since 2010 while business relationships have experienced 5% compound annual growth over the same time period. We can see the relationship growth flowing through to revenue growth as business revenues have seen 9% compound annual growth since 2009 while consumer revenues are up 5% over the same period.
I want to call out particularly strong revenue growth from the consumer side over the last 5 quarters. We've not always seen the revenue benefit on the consumer side, but we've now overcome the headwind of the latest adjustments under our Fair Play philosophy implemented in the third quarter of 2014, and the investments in data and analytics will begin in 2015 are starting to show results. 
We experienced 10% year-over-year growth in consumer household revenue in the second quarter of 2016, along with 5% linked-quarter growth. And these are very strong numbers, and we're optimistic we can build on these in coming quarters. 
It's not just about relationship growth, but indeed the deepening of our existing relationships. For us, this strategy has remained consistent since put in place 2009, and we continue to see progress. 
The next 2 slides show how we think about deepening relationships with our customers. As of quarter end, 52% of our consumer checking households used 6 or more products and services, up from 51% a year ago. 
On the commercial side, 47% use 4 of our products or more of our products and services, up from 43% a year ago. And these figures are important and ones we monitor closely. We believe the revenue growth is a result of a deeper understanding and relationship with our customers. The fair banking philosophy starts with doing the right thing for our customers, but that's just the beginning of any single customer relationship. To achieve the full potential on both sides, we have to better understand the individual customer needs and tailor our products, services and experiences to fit those needs.
So we're not just adding new customers. We're making sure we can better serve and foster a mutually beneficial relationship with our total customer base, all of our existing relationships. 
Moving to the economy. Slide 14 contains what we feel to be some of the more meaningful economic indicators for our footprint. The bottom left chart illustrates trends in unemployment rates across our 6 Midwestern states. And as you can see, the majority of our footprint has shown marked improvement in unemployment rates relative to the national average. And Ohio and Michigan, in particular, remained at or near their lowest level since the early 2000s. 
The chart on the top of the -- and bottom right show coincident and leading economic indicators for the region. The bottom chart, which shows leading indexes for our footprint as of May, shows that 5 of the 6 states in our footprint expect positive economic growth over the next 6 months. 
Slide 15 takes a deeper look at the trends in unemployment rates in our largest metropolitan markets. Many of the large MSAs of the footprint were near 15-year lows for unemployment rate at the end of May. Ohio, Indiana and Michigan, in particular, continue to outpace overall U.S. growth since the recovery.
There's additional calls for optimism here in our home footprint. Per capita disposable and personnel income growth has outpaced the national average due to the recovery and continued to do so through the second quarter. 
Housing markets in the footprint and especially here in Ohio have shown to be far more stable than the national average. Affordability in the Midwest is the best in the country. The higher rate in the Midwest continues to be among the highest in the nation. And over 50% of that manufacturing jobs created in the country since the recession are in Ohio, Michigan and Indiana. 3 states have over 50% of the net manufacturing increase since the recession.
Despite continued market volatility and global macroeconomic uncertainty, we remain confident in the economy in our footprint. Indeed, the average consumer remains confident in our footprint economy as consumer confidence in the Midwest is near the 2002 levels. And we recognize the escalation of market and global volatility in recent months and the threat it can pose to business here in our footprint, but effects so far have been modest. 
Turning to Slide 16. Operating leverage for the first 6 months of the year was slightly negative, which was consistent with our internal forecast. Recall this is almost exactly where we were at the end of the second quarter 2015. We delivered positive operating leverage in 2015, which was our third consecutive year of doing so. And positive operating leverage remains an annual financial goal. 
So with that, let's turn to Slide 20 for some closing remarks and important messages. We remain focused on delivering consistent through-the-cycle shareholder returns. This strategy entails reducing short-term volatility, achieving top-tier performance over the long term and maintaining our aggregate moderate to low risk profile throughout. 
Our DFAST stress loss estimates continue to reflect comparatively well, and for this year, included FirstMerit loan portfolios. Our value proposition for both consumers and businesses continue to drive industry-leading new customer acquisition. We've successfully built a strong and recognizable consumer brand with differentiated products and superior, superior customer service. 
For the third year in a row, we were recognized for leading customer satisfaction by J.D. Power and others. We continue to execute our strategies and refine and react when necessary. 
We have invested and will continue to invest in our businesses, particularly around enhanced sales management, mobile and digital technologies, data analytics and optimizing our retail distribution network. Importantly, we plan to continue to manage our expenses appropriately within our revenue outlook. We expect to grow revenue. We expect growth within our core Midwest footprint local economies and the businesses and consumers with them. We are prudently managing certain industries or sectors, potentially impacted by the market volatility and global macroeconomic uncertainty. However, we believe these risks remain well contained.
We see no evidence of near-term deterioration or problems looming on the horizon. Customer sentiment remains positive. Pressure on our NIM will remain a modest headwind in the near term. We continue to expect the NIM for stand-alone Huntington will remain above 3% for each quarter throughout 2016.
We expect to grow revenue despite this pressure consistent to our 4% to 6% long-term financial goal, excluding significant items that have MSR activity and the impact of FirstMerit. We will continue to pace ongoing investments in our businesses, consistent with our revenue outlook and consistent with our long-term goal of annual positive operating leverage. We continue to monitor our loan portfolio very closely. And given the absolute low level of our credit metrics and recent market and global economic volatility, we do expect some volatility on our credit metrics going forward. And as we stated last quarter, anticipate that loan-loss provisions for both ourselves and the broader industry will gradually begin to return to more normalized levels.
Let me stress, we do not see any material deterioration on the horizon. We're simply moving off cyclical lows. And we'll gradually move back towards normal for both provisioning and net charge-offs. We expect our net charge-offs for the year will remain below our long-term expected range of 35 to 55 basis points.
Next, as we always like to include a reminder that there's a high level of alignment between the board, management, our employees and our shareholders. The board and our colleagues are collectively the sixth largest shareholder of Huntington. We have hold through retirement requirements on certain shares and are appropriately focused on driving sustained, long-term performance. We're highly focused on our commitment to being good stewards of shareholder capital.
And finally, before we move into the Q&A period, I'd like to tell you how pleased we are with the progress we're making with FirstMerit. We recently received sign-off from the Department of Justice for its divestiture that resolves our concentration issue, which was primarily in the Canton, Ohio market. We've identified the branch closures that will occur coincident with the branch conversion in the first quarter of next year. We also continue to make progress in building out the organization for the combined entity. Our systems conversion planning efforts continue to progress as our IT teams have completed all product mapping are in the final stage of completing all data mapping. Indeed, we're coding now for the conversion. 
Finally, we remain confident that the transaction will close in the third quarter of 2016. 
I'll now turn it back over to Mark so we can get to your questions. Thank you."

And we do think that the process is very different for a company that's going through an acquisition, if that's included in the CCAR results. But let me just point out a few things that could help reconcile the numbers from a capital perspective. So we knew going into this year's CCAR process that we were below our peer group in terms of CET1, probably to the tune of 120 basis points on average. And that really comes back to the fact that we were pretty aggressive in 2014 and 2015 and returning earnings to shareholders, probably 76% on average across the 2 years. Also keep in mind that we did the Macquarie acquisition without issuing any capital. So that put us in a lower starting point relative to the peers. We also disclosed an announcement on FirstMerit that we have 100 basis points impact to CET1 because of the structure of the transaction. So that impacted as well. And then finally, we know that as we went through a business combination in a severely adverse scenario inside the CCAR process, that it probably cost us 50 to 70 basis points of CET1. So when you reconcile all those things and consider everything but the starting position, it really is related to going through the business combination in the CCAR process."

So we have that entire process to work through as well. So that's the way I take a look at it. We feel good about the margin.

But even at that level, the impact to us on our portfolio is about 9 basis points of charge-offs. Keep in mind, we have a different customer base than average. So with our prime -- super prime focus, we managed the probability default. We think that we will -- our portfolio will have a much lower incidence of default, and therefore, the impact of these car values relative to the rest of the market is not as significant. So we're very comfortable where we stand. And even if the index were to fall, we think we're very well positioned. Again, we have a differentiated model from what many others would have."

We appreciate your interest and support. It's an exciting time for Huntington. We saw a continued solid execution in the second quarter of 2016 built on the strong foundation and momentum demonstrated in the first quarter. 
We believe we have a good story to share with you this morning. We have followed a contrarian path since 2009 focused on building a strong recognizable brand, differentiated product set and industry-leading customer service. While others have pulled back with a focus on cost cutting, we invested in our franchise, built our Fair Play philosophy and our welcome culture. Second quarter results again provide proof that our strategies are working and that we are executing at a high level. 
Turning to Slide 3. Let's review the financial highlights of our second quarter. Huntington reported earnings per common share of $0.19, inclusive of $0.02 per share of significant items related to the costs associated with the integration of the pending FirstMerit acquisition. Tangible book value per share increased 9% to $7.29. Reported return on tangible common equity was 11%, while reported return on assets was 0.96%. 
Fundamental trends were in line with our expectations. Compared to the second quarter of 2015, revenue grew by 1% despite an $8 million impact from net MSR activity and the realization of a $5 million gain on a securitization of auto loans in the second quarter of 2015. Net interest income growth of 3% was largely responsible for reported revenue growth. We continue to believe that our ability to deliver consistent top line growth despite the challenging interest rate environment distinguishes Huntington from our peers. 
Noninterest expense increased $32 million or 6% year-over-year, including $21 million incurred in relation to the integration of our pending acquisition of FirstMerit. Noninterest expense adjusted for the FirstMerit integration expense increased 3% year-over-year. Our reported efficiency ratio for the quarter was 66.1%. However, the FirstMerit integration expense increased the report efficiency ratio by 260 basis points. 
While we remain above our long-term efficiency goal of 56% to 59%, improving operating efficiency continues to be the top priority for our management team. We remain confident that productivity improvements from the FirstMerit integration will significantly accelerate our ability to achieve this important financial goal.
Balance sheet growth continued to be strong. Average loans grew 8% year-over-year while average core deposits grew 5%, marking the eighth consecutive quarter of year-over-year core deposit growth being at least 5%. Overall, credit performance continued to demonstrate our commitment to an aggregate moderate to low risk profile. Second quarter net charge-offs of 13 basis points remained well below our long-term financial target of 35 to 55 basis points. 
Nonperforming assets decreased 7% linked quarter. Tangible common equity ended the quarter at 7.96%, up 4 basis points year-over-year and 7 basis points linked quarter. And our CET1 ratio trended up 15 basis points year-over-year and 7 basis points quarter-over-quarter. 
Turning to Slide 4 and diving in deeper to the income statement. Net interest income was up 3% from the year ago quarter, primarily reflecting strong earning asset growth of 8%, which was partially offset by 14 basis points of net interest margin compression.
Noninterest income was down $11 million or 4% from a year ago, impacted by $8 million of net MSR activity and a $5 million gain on the securitization of auto loans in the second quarter of 2015. Reflecting the strength of new household acquisition, out of our OCR strategy, service charges on deposit accounts increased 8%, card and payment processing income increased 9%. Trust service revenue in the quarter was impacted by the sale of our funds and fund servicing businesses as well as an ongoing shift in the product mix. 
Noninterest expense increased $32 million or 6% from a year ago, with FirstMerit integration expense accounting for $21 million of the increase. After adjusting for FirstMerit integration expense, noninterest expense increased 3%, primarily driven by salary expense, medical claims and technology investments. Of note, we continue to see wage inflation given the relatively low unemployment levels in many of our markets.
Turning to Slide 5. Let's look at balance sheet trends. Disciplined but strong loan and lease growth continued in the second quarter, increasing 8% year-over-year. Growth was spread among many portfolios, but commercial banking and auto lending continue to lead the pack. Auto lending increased 26% from a year ago quarter as production continued at record levels, while we maintained our long-standing underwriting consistency and discipline. 
Slides 46 to 49 in the appendix show the underwriting has not changed, and our credit performance remains superior. Our auto portfolio continues to demonstrate industry-leading performance. Our C&I portfolio grew 8%, driven by equipment finance, dealer floorplan and corporate banking. 
Average securities increased 15%, primarily reflecting reinvestment of portfolio runoff into LCR-compliant securities and, to a lesser extent, growth in direct purchase municipal securities in our Commercial Banking segment. We remain above the 100% threshold for the liquidity coverage ratio. Strong growth in our loan and securities portfolio amounted to an overall 8% increase in our average earning assets from a year ago quarter.
Moving to the right side of the slide. Average total deposits increased 5% over the year ago quarter, including a 5% increase in average core deposits. Demand deposits continue to drive growth, increasing 11% year-over-year, including a 4% increase in noninterest-bearing demand deposits and a 28% increase in interest-bearing demand deposits. 
Our focus on new consumer checking household and commercial relationship account acquisition as well as relationship deepening continue to drive growth in demand deposits. Average total debt increased $1.7 billion or 23% as a result of the issuance of $3.1 billion in senior debt over the past 5 quarters, which was partially offset by a $1.1 billion decrease in short-term borrowings.
Money market deposits increased by $0.7 billion or 4% from the year ago quarter, reflecting improved cross-sell and targeted marketing. We also continued remixing our deposit base, moving consumer deposits out of higher cost CDs into other less expensive deposit products. As a result, average core CDs decreased $0.6 billion or 24% year-over-year.
The net interest margin was 3.06% for the second quarter, down 14 basis points from the year ago quarter. The decrease reflected a 4 basis point decrease in earning asset yield and a 14 basis point increase in funding cost. Loan yields were only down 2 basis points year-over-year while security yields declined 9 basis points. The increase in funding cost was almost entirely driven by the impact of the debt issuances over the past 4 quarters as the cost of deposits only increased 1 basis point year-over-year. 
On a linked-quarter basis, the net interest margin decreased by 5 basis points, driven by a 3 basis point decrease in earning asset yield and a 4 basis point increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities. Recall that last quarter's NIM benefited from approximately 2 basis points of interest recoveries in the commercial real estate portfolio. Though modest further NIM compression is expected to continue given the rate environment, we continue to expect that net interest margin at standalone Huntington to remain above 3% for the remaining 2 quarters of 2016. 
Slide 7 provides an update on our asset sensitivity positioning and how we manage interest rate risk. As shown in the chart on top, our modeling for standalone Huntington projects that net interest income would benefit by 4.1% if interest rates were to gradually ramp 200 basis points in addition to increases already reflected in the current implied forward curve. This is an increase of roughly 50 basis points from a quarter ago as our asset swap book continue to mature. Though we expect additional runoff from our asset swap book in coming quarters, the portfolio is laddered and there are no cliffs looming on the horizon. 
As shown on the bottom right in a hypothetical scenario without the $4.7 billion of remaining asset swaps, the estimated benefit is projected to be 5.4% in the up 200 basis point gradual ramp scenario. The chart on the bottom of the slide shows our $4.7 billion asset swap portfolio and $6.8 billion liability swap portfolio, including their respective average remaining lives and their impact on net interest income. The incremental benefit of the swaps was $19 million in the 2016 second quarter, down slightly from $21 million in the first quarter and $26 million in the year ago quarter. 75% of the $19 million in swap benefit in the second quarter was from liability swaps with the remainder coming from asset swaps.
Turning to Slide 8. We see our capital ratios, which increased across-the-board on both a year-over-year and linked-quarter basis. Tangible common equity ended the quarter at 7.96%, up 4 basis points year-over-year and 7 basis points linked quarter. During the quarter, we issued an additional $200 million of attractively priced fixed rate preferred equity on top of the $400 million issued late in the first quarter.
Referring to Slide 9, we booked provision expense of $25 million compared to net charge-offs of $17 million. This modest reserve build, along with the reduction in NPLs, led to a 151% NAL coverage ratio, as noted in the chart on the right. The ACL, as a percentage of loans, fell 1 basis point to 1.33% due to portfolio growth. 
Asset quality metrics were favorable in the quarter, as indicated on Slide 10. NPAs fell in the quarter as new inflows were down substantially from prior periods. The criticized asset ratio was down modestly, falling 3.5% to 3.44%. New additions to criticized were offset by upgrades and paydowns. Delinquencies were also well controlled exhibiting continued reductions. 
Let me now turn the presentation over to Steve."

I want to use the next few slides to talk about our industry-leading customer acquisition. Mac mentioned at the beginning of the call that we've taken a contrarian approach for the past several years, focusing on customer acquisition and relationship deepening through our Fair Play banking philosophy. 
Slide 10 shows the fruits of our labor. And as you can see, both consumer and business relationships are up substantially since 2009. Consumer households have experienced an 8% compound annual growth since 2010 while business relationships have experienced 5% compound annual growth over the same time period. We can see the relationship growth flowing through to revenue growth as business revenues have seen 9% compound annual growth since 2009 while consumer revenues are up 5% over the same period.
I want to call out particularly strong revenue growth on the consumer side over the last 5 quarters. We've not always seen the revenue benefit on the consumer side, but we've now overcome the headwind of the latest adjustments under our Fair Play philosophy implemented in the third quarter of 2014, and the investments in data and analytics we began in 2015 are starting to show results. 
We experienced 10% year-over-year growth in consumer household revenue in the second quarter of 2016, along with 5% linked-quarter growth. And these are very strong numbers, and we're optimistic we can build on these in coming quarters. It's not just about relationship growth, but indeed the deepening of our existing relationships. For us, this strategy has remained consistent since put in place in 2009, and we continue to see progress. 
The next 2 slides show how we think about deepening relationships with our customers. As of quarter end, 52% of our consumer checking households use 6 or more products and services, up from 51% a year ago. On the commercial side, 47% use 4 of our products or more of our products and services, up from 43% a year ago. These figures are important and ones we monitor closely. We believe the revenue growth is a result of a deeper understanding and relationship with our customers. 
The fair banking philosophy starts with doing the right thing for our customers, but that's just the beginning of any single customer relationship. To achieve the full potential on both sides, we have to better understand the individual customer needs and tailor our products, services and experiences to fit those needs. So we're not just adding new customers, we're making sure we can better serve and foster a mutually beneficial relationship with our total customer base, all of our existing relationships. 
Moving to the economy. Slide 14 contains what we feel to be some of the more meaningful economic indicators for our footprint. The bottom left chart illustrates trends in unemployment rates across our 6 Midwestern states. And as you can see, the majority of our footprint has shown marked improvement in unemployment rates relative to the national average. And Ohio and Michigan in particular remain at or near their lowest level since the early 2000s. The chart on the top of the -- and bottom right show coincident and leading economic indicators for the region. The bottom chart, which shows leading indexes for our footprint as of May, shows that 5 of the 6 states in our footprint expect positive economic growth over the next 6 months. 
Slide 15 takes a deeper look at the trends in unemployment rates in our largest metropolitan markets. Many of the large MSAs the footprint were near 15-year lows for unemployment rate at the end of May. Ohio, Indiana and Michigan in particular continue to outpace overall U.S. growth since the recovery. There's additional cause for optimism here in our home footprint. Per capita disposable personal income growth has outpaced the national average through the recovery and continued to do so through the second quarter. 
Housing markets in the footprint and especially here in Ohio have shown to be far more stable than the national average. Affordability in the Midwest is the best in the country. The higher rate in the Midwest continues to be among the highest in the nation. And over 50% of net manufacturing jobs created in the country since the recession are in Ohio, Michigan and Indiana. 3 states have over 50% of the net manufacturing increase since the recession.
Despite continued market volatility and global macroeconomic uncertainty, we remain confident in the economy in our footprint. Indeed, the average consumer remains confident in our footprint economy as consumer confidence in the Midwest is near the 2002 levels. And we recognize the escalation of market and global volatility in recent months and the threat it can pose to business here in our footprint, but effects so far have been modest. 
Turning to Slide 16. Operating leverage for the first 6 months of the year was slightly negative, which was consistent with our internal forecast. Recall this is almost exactly where we were at the end of the second quarter of 2015. We delivered positive operating leverage in 2015, which was our third consecutive year doing so. And positive operating leverage remains an annual financial goal. 
So with that, let's turn to Slide 20 for some closing remarks and important messages. We remain focused on delivering consistent through-the-cycle shareholder returns. This strategy entails reducing short-term volatility, achieving top tier performance over the long term and maintaining our aggregate moderate to low risk profile throughout. Our DFAST stress loss estimates continue to reflect comparatively well, and for this year included FirstMerit loan portfolios. Our value proposition for both consumers and businesses continues to drive industry-leading new customer acquisition. We've successfully built a strong and recognizable consumer brand with differentiated products and superior customer service. For the third year in a row, we were recognized for leading customer satisfaction by J.D. Power and others. 
We continue to execute our strategies and refine or react when necessary. We have invested and will continue to invest in our businesses, particularly around enhanced sales management, mobile and digital technologies, data analytics and optimizing our retail distribution network. Importantly, we plan to continue to manage our expenses appropriately within our revenue outlook. We expect to grow revenue. We expect growth within our core Midwest footprint local economies and the businesses and consumers with them. We are prudently managing certain industries or sectors potentially impacted by the market volatility and global macroeconomic uncertainty. However, we believe these risks remain well contained.
We see no evidence of near-term deterioration or problems looming on the horizon. Customer sentiment remains positive. Pressure on our NIM will remain a modest headwind in the near term. We continue to expect the NIM for standalone Huntington will remain above 3% for each quarter throughout 2016. We expect to grow revenue despite this pressure consistent to our 4% to 6% long-term financial goal, excluding significant items, net MSR activity and the impact of FirstMerit. We will continue to pace ongoing investments in our businesses consistent with our revenue outlook and consistent with our long-term goal of annual positive operating leverage. We continue to monitor our loan portfolio very closely. And given the absolute low level of our credit metrics and recent market and global economic volatility, we do expect some volatility in our credit metrics going forward. And as we stated last quarter, anticipate that loan loss provisions for both ourselves and the broader industry will gradually begin to return to more normalized levels.
Let me stress, we do not see any material deterioration on the horizon. We're simply moving off cyclical lows and will gradually move back towards normal for both provisioning and net charge-offs. We expect our net charge-offs for the year will remain below our long-term expected range of 35 to 55 basis points. Next, as we always like to include a reminder that there's a high level of alignment between the board, management, our employees and our shareholders. The board and our colleagues are collectively the sixth largest shareholder of Huntington. We have hold through retirement requirements on certain shares and are appropriately focused on driving sustained long-term performance. We're highly focused on our commitment to being good stewards of shareholder capital.
And finally, before we move into the Q&A period, I'd like to tell you how pleased we are with the progress we're making with FirstMerit. We recently received sign-off from the Department of Justice for a divestiture that resolves our concentration issue, which was primarily in the Canton, Ohio market. We've identified the branch closures that will occur coincident with the branch conversion in the first quarter of next year. We also continue to make progress in building out the organization for the combined entity. Our systems conversion planning efforts continue to progress as our IT teams have completed all product mapping or are in the final stage of completing all data mapping. Indeed, we're coding now for the conversion. Finally, we remain confident that the transaction will close in the third quarter of 2016. 
I'll now turn it back over to Mark so we can get to your questions. Thank you."

And clearly, we don't have complete insights into what happens inside the black box. And we do think that the process is very different for a company that's going through an acquisition, if that's included in the CCAR results. But let me just point out a few things that could help reconcile the numbers from a capital perspective. So we knew, going into this year CCAR process, that we were below our peer group in terms of CET1, probably to the tune of 120 basis points on average. And that really comes back to the fact that we were pretty aggressive in 2014 and 2015 in returning earnings to shareholders, probably 76% on average across the 2 years. Also keep in mind, that we did the Macquarie acquisition without issuing any capital. So that put us in a lower starting point relative to the peers. We also disclosed on announcement of FirstMerit that we had a 100 basis points impact to CET1 because the structure of the transaction. So that impacted as well. And then finally, we know that as we went through a business combination and a severely adverse scenario inside the CCAR process, that it probably cost us 50 to 70 basis points of CET1. So when you reconcile all those things and consider everything but the starting position, it really is related to going through the business combination in the CCAR process."

So we have that entire process to work through as well. So that's the way I take a look at it. We feel good about the margin. And where it's at today, we still believe that we're above 3% for the remainder of the year in core Huntington. And if you take a look at FirstMerit, excluding any impact from the purchase accounting adjustments, it's actually additive to the margin. So that's our perspective, Marty."

We think that we will -- our portfolio will have a much lower incidence of default, and therefore the impact of the used car values relative to the rest of the market is not as significant. So we're very comfortable where we stand. And even if the index were to fall, we think we're very well positioned. Again, we have a differentiated model from what many others would have."

We appreciate your interest and support. Let me start by acknowledging that the third quarter was a bit noisy, but underneath the noise, we're very pleased with the core financial performance. As you know, the FirstMerit acquisition closed on August 16. Under the terms of the acquisition agreement, shareholders of FirstMerit received 1.72 shares of Huntington common stock and $5 in cash for each share of Huntington -- of FirstMerit common stock. The aggregate purchase price was $3.7 billion including $0.8 billion of cash, $2.8 billion of common stock and $0.1 billion of preferred stock. Huntington issued 284 million shares of common stock that had a total fair value of $2.8 billion based on the closing market price of $9.68 per share on August 15, 2016. We are extremely pleased with the progress we're making in bringing the 2 companies together as one. We believe the combination strengthens our company by improving efficiency, accelerating our long-term growth rate and driving a higher return profile. We are excited to have the opportunity to introduce our strong recognizable brand, differentiated product set and industry-leading customer service in new geographies and to new customers. Integration is moving along as expected and our new colleagues are embracing our Fair Play philosophy and welcome culture. 
Turning to Slide 3, let's review the financial highlights of our third quarter. Huntington reported earnings per common share of $0.11, inclusive of $0.11 per share of significant items related to the FirstMerit acquisition, which also impacted the financial metrics I will highlight on this slide. Tangible book value per share decreased 6% from the year-ago quarter to $6.48 per share. Return on tangible common equity was 7%, while return on assets was 0.58%. Except where noted, all comparisons to previous quarters are inclusive of FirstMerit, but I want to emphasize the core organic performance continued to meet our expectations. Compared to the third quarter of 2015, revenue grew by 24%, with net interest income up 26% and noninterest income up 19%. Noninterest expense increased $186 million or 35% year-over-year. Noninterest expense adjusted for the year-over-year change in significant items increased $7 million or 14% year-over-year. Reflecting the addition of FirstMerit, the accelerated built-out of our in-store channel last fall and ongoing technology investments. Our reported efficiency ratio for the quarter was 75%. However, the acquisition-related expense stemming from the FirstMerit transaction added 17 percentage points to the efficiency ratio. While revenue strength in the quarter including mortgage banking, capital markets and a large interest recovery, combined with a $4 million expense benefit from retiring trust preferred debt, lowered the core efficiency ratio by approximately 150 basis points. We're pleased with the progress towards achieving our long-term efficiency ratio goal of 56% to 59%.
Balance sheet growth in the third quarter showed continued organic strength, which was enhanced by the addition of FirstMerit's loan and deposit base. Average total loans grew 24% year-over-year, with growth excluding FirstMerit coming in at 8%. Average core deposits grew 22% year-over-year with average core deposit growth excluding FirstMerit registering 3%. Our third quarter credit performance reflects Huntington's commitment to an aggregate moderate-to-low risk profile. Net charge-offs of 26 basis points remained below our long-term financial target of 35 to 55 basis points. Nonperforming assets improved 21 basis points to 0.72% compared with the linked quarter. Criticized assets and delinquencies have remained in a relatively tight range for the past several quarters. Our common equity tier 1 ratio decreased 63 basis points year-over-year and 71 basis points linked quarter to 9.09%, reflecting the impact of the FirstMerit transaction.
Turning to Slide 4, and getting more in-depth with the income statement. Net interest income was up 26% from year-ago quarter as were average earning assets, reflecting strong organic loan growth and the impact of the FirstMerit acquisition. The net interest margin for the quarter came in at 3.18%, up 2 basis points from the year-ago quarter and up 12 basis points on a linked-quarter basis. Purchase accounting had a favorable impact of 12 basis points on the margin and we had an interest recovery in the quarter that added an additional 2 basis points.
Noninterest income increased $49 million or 19% from the year-ago quarter, primarily driven by the addition of FirstMerit but also driven by strong organic growth in mortgage banking, service charges on deposit accounts and capital markets. Noninterest expense increased $186 million or 35% from a year ago, with significant items accounting for $116 million of the increase. After adjusting for significant items, noninterest expense increased 14%, primarily reflecting the impact of bringing FirstMerit on for 1.5 months in the current quarter. I want to reiterate our confidence in achieving the $255 million in total annual expense savings that we communication when we announced the transaction. All the cost savings are identified, being executed against and will be implemented within one year of the deal closing. With the vast majority implemented prior to or coincident with the branch and systems conversion over Presidents' Day Weekend in the first quarter 2017.
In total, we plan to consolidate 103 branches or roughly 9% of the combined post-divesture branch network.
In addition, in connection with our normal periodic review of our distribution network, we will be consolidating 9 legacy Huntington branches unrelated to the FirstMerit acquisition during the first quarter of 2017.
Turning to Slide 5, let's review operating leverage. As you would expect, the combined entity has significant positive operating leverage through 9 months. Positive operating leverage remains an important annual financial goal, which we delivered on in 2013, 2014 and 2015, and of course, we expect to deliver again in 2016. 
Turning to Slide 6, let's look at balance sheet trends. Average total loans grew 24% year-over-year with growth excluding FirstMerit coming in at 8%. As you can see from the chart on the left side of the page, the addition of FirstMerit has not had a material impact on our earning asset mix. The chart on the right side of the page, illustrates how the addition of FirstMerit has increased the proportion of low-cost DDA in our funding mix. Average securities increased 32% year-over-year, primarily reflecting the addition of $7.4 billion from FirstMerit, additional investment in LCR Level 1 qualifying securities and growth in direct purchased Municipal Securities and our Commercial Banking segment.
Our liquidity coverage ratio was approximately 110% at quarter end. Average total debt increased $2.9 billion or 42% as a result of the issuance of $3.3 billion in senior debt over the past 5 quarters. 
Turning to Slide 7, as previously discussed, we have continued to evaluate opportunities to optimize the balance sheet and will not affect the quarterly average balances, approximately $2.6 billion of total loans and leases, comprised of $1.5 billion of auto loans, $1 billion of predominately non-relationship C&I loans and leases and $1 billion of predominately nonrelationship CRE loans were moved to loans held for sale at the end of the third quarter. We're taking these actions to improve risk-weighted asset efficiency and specific to the C&I and CRE assets to free up capital that was not generating acceptable returns. Regarding the $1.5 billion of auto loans moved to held-for-sale, our intention is to securitize these assets in the fourth quarter of 2016.
Let me emphasize that we remain steadfast in our commitment to our Auto Finance business, including our well-established strategy, which is built upon deep long-term relationships with our core dealer customers and our focus on prime and super prime indirect lending.
However, we're reducing our indirect auto concentration limit back down to 150% of capital and we are adopting an operating guideline of 125% of capital. You might remember that in mid-2015, before we had an agreement in place with FirstMerit, we increased our indirect auto concentration limit to 175% of capital. Given the larger capital base of the new combined organization, we do not foresee any circumstance in which we would grow our indirect auto portfolio anywhere close to the 175% of capital. In addition, with the new 125% operating guideline in mind, we expect to return to the securitization markets on an annual basis going forward.
Moving to Slide 8. Our net interest margin was 3.18% for the third quarter, up 2 basis points from the year-ago quarter. This increase reflected a 10 basis point increase in earning asset yield, a 2 basis point increase in the benefit from non-interest-bearing deposits and a 10 basis point increase in funding cost. Loan yields improved 16 basis points year-over-year, while securities yields declined to 12 basis points. The increase in funding costs was almost entirely driven by the impact of the debt issuances over the past 5 quarters as the cost of deposits was unchanged year-over-year. On a linked-quarter basis, the net interest margin increased by 12 basis points, driven by an 11 basis point improvement in earning asset yield and 1 basis point decrease in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities.
Purchase accounting contributed 12 basis points to the margin in the third quarter. Adjusting for the impact of purchase accounting, the core net interest margin was 3.06% or unchanged from the prior quarter.
In addition, similar to what we have seen in recent quarters, one 1 large interest recovery added 2 basis points to the margin during the third quarter. Finally, as we communicated previously, core NIM will stay above 3% in every quarter of 2016. 
Slide 9 illustrates the impact of our capital ratios of effectively deploying capital through the acquisition of FirstMerit. Tangible common equity ended the quarter at 7.14%, down 75 basis points year-over-year and 82 basis points linked quarter. Common equity tier 1 ended the quarter at 9.09%, down 63 basis points year-over-year and down 71 basis points sequentially. 
Referring to Slide 10, we booked provision expense of $64 million compared to net charge-offs of $40 million. The higher provision expense compared to the prior quarter was the result of a higher level of net charge-offs, organic loan growth and incremental reserves on the legacy FirstMerit portfolio in excess of the credit mark due the rate mark partially offsetting the credit mark on certain portfolios. In addition, there was approximately $10 million of incremental loan loss provision expense in the third quarter associated with the previously discussed movement of loans held-for-sale. Net charge-offs were higher, represented an annualized 26 basis points of average loans and leases, which remains below our long-term target of 35 to 55 basis points. The allowance for credit losses as a percentage of loans decreased to 1.06%, reflecting the addition of the FirstMerit loan portfolio to the denominator without additional reserves being added to the numerator due to the credit mark applied through the purchase accounting process. The nonaccrual loan coverage ratio increased to 174% as a result of the continued decline in nonaccrual loans.
On Slide 11, the asset quality metrics remained favorable in the quarter as indicated. The nonperforming asset ratio decreased further reaching it's lowest level in 2 years at 0.72%. The criticized asset ratio increased modestly to 3.54%, that has remained in the 3.5% range for the past several quarters. Delinquencies were also well controlled having remained relatively flat for the past 6 quarters. Let me now turn the presentation over to Steve."

Normally at this point in our quarterly discussion, I would provide you with an update on our optimal customer relationship or OCR strategy. However, we've removed those slides from the presentation this quarter, given the recent addition of FirstMerit and our inability to produce similar data for legacy FirstMerit customers. We believe providing OCR data for just legacy Huntington customers will not provide you with complete picture. Let me assure you though that we remain fully committed to our Fair Play philosophy and OCR strategy, which is built upon a simple thesis, that putting customers first, looking out for their needs and doing the right thing will result in more substantial long-term customer relationships. Now for years, we've focused on customer acquisition and relationship deepening with our Fair Play banking philosophy and our OCR strategy. While this was considered a contrary approach when we started these actions, back in 2009 and '10, the results paying a picture of resounding success, and I want to stress that we are not just seeking relationship growth, but indeed are looking to deepen existing relationships. Our OCR strategy is also build upon the fundamental belief that we are here to understand and serve our customers needs. The Fair Play banking philosophy starts with doing the right thing for our customers with products and services that are simple, clear and fair. We couple that with the customer experience designed to fit their needs, not ours. For us, the strategies remain consistent since it was put in place in 2010, and it continues to bear fruit. In light of the recent headlines some of you have asked about our sales and incentive compensation practices and complaint management, particularly with respect to our OCR strategy. The focus of our OCR model is on building deep, trusted and lasting relationships, and this is achieved by getting to know our customers, understanding their needs and helping them meet their financial needs with the appropriate products and services. Further, Huntington as a company built upon a distinguished legacy of superior customer service. Our Fair Play philosophy and welcome culture are built upon the premise and promise of doing the right thing for our customers. As you would expect, given the investor, media and regulatory interest in this matter, we've undertaken a detailed review of our practices, policies and procedures for any signs of misalignment of incentives or other areas of risk or concern. While the review is ongoing, to-date we've not uncovered any systematic, cultural or operational areas of concern. We'll likely refine some of our monitoring but we do not anticipate any material changes to our practices or procedures, and certainly not to our overall OCR strategy. 
Moving to the economy, slide 12 contains what we feel to be some of the more meaningful economic indicators for a footprint. The bottom left chart illustrates trends and the unemployment rates across our now 8 core midwestern states. As you can see, the majority of our footprint remains at or below the national unemployment rates relative to the national average, with Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, Wisconsin particularly showing resilience this past quarter. Charts on the top and bottom right show coincident and leading economic indicators for the region. The bottom chart, which shows leading indexes for our footprint as of August, show that all 8 states in our footprint expect positive economic growth over the next 6 months. 
Slide 13 focuses on trends and unemployment rates in our largest metropolitan areas, and many of the large MSAs in the footprint remain at or near 15-year lows for unemployment at the end of August. Also notable, 11 of the top 15 MSAs experienced declining unemployment rates in the last 3 months. The auto industry is still strong and is a major economic contributor within our footprint, but the housing markets are also strong. Labor market in our footprint has proven to be strong in 2016, with several markets such as here at Columbus, where we're at structural full employment.
We're seeing wage inflation in our expense base and our customers are too. State and local governments continue to operate with surpluses. Ohio, Indiana and Michigan continue to outpace overall U.S. growth since the recovery. We remain confident in our footprint in Midwest economies based on the sustained job growth and economic production since the recovery that began after the great recession. 
Turning to slide 14. I would like to give you some closing remarks and important messages. We remain focused on delivering consistent through the cycle shareholder returns. The strategy entails reducing short-term volatility, achieving top-tier performance over the long-term and maintaining our aggregate moderate to low risk profile throughout. As you heard, Mac, mentioned earlier, the acquisition and integration of FirstMerit provides, what we believe, is an opportunity to achieve significant cost savings and improve our overall efficiency. We're committed to and progressing as planned towards realizing are targeted $255 million of annual cost savings from the acquisition. We continue to win new customers through a strong and recognizable consumer brand with products and superior customer service, the new customers and dynamic markets offered from FirstMerit acquisition provide a deeper and more vibrant pool to deliver our value proposition and add customers and deepen relationships. We have invested and will continue to invest in our businesses, particularly around enhanced sales management, mobile and digital technologies, data analytics and optimizing our retail distribution network. Importantly, we plan to continue to manage our expenses appropriately within our revenue outlook. We always like to include a reminder that there is a high level of alignment between the board, management, our employees and our shareholders. The board and our colleagues are collectively among the largest shareholders of Huntington.
We have the retirement requirement and are appropriately focused on driving the sustained long-term performance. We are highly focused my commitment to being good stewards of shareholders capital. Looking forward to full year 2016 results, excluding the impact of significant items, we expect total revenues to increase 16% to 18%, and noninterest expenses to increase 13% to 15%. We expect to deliver positive operating leverage for the fourth consecutive year. We expect asset quality metrics to remain near current levels, including net charge-offs remaining below our long-term target of 35 to 55 basis points. Now consistent with our historical practice, we anticipate we provide initial expectations for 2017 at an investor conference later this quarter. Finally, we're very pleased with the smooth integration process with FirstMerit, which we acquired on August 16. The divestiture of 13 branches, primarily in the market will occur this quarter. We completed the on-boarding and initial training of our new colleagues and fully implemented the organizational changes for the combined entity that we announced last summer. 103 branch consolidations will occur coincident with the branch conversion in February of 2017. Our systems conversion planning efforts continue to progress as our IT teams have completed all product and data mapping and are now managing system testing and preparing for marked conversions. So I'll now turn it back to Mark, so we can get to your questions. Thank you."

Second is, as you've already noted, we have the movement of loans to held-for-sale. We also had the organic originations from FirstMerit post-closing. So the new loans that are generated have allowance associated with them. And then we did have a portfolio, where we did have a positive rate marks that offset the credit marks. So it's recorded at a premium, so we have a allowance build there. So I wouldn't say that this is a situation where this is the new normal. I think this was a bit of an and I think kind of go-forward basis, we will have provision expense that is more in line with charge-offs and with an allowance for some growth.

We appreciate your interest and support. Let me start by acknowledging that the third quarter was a bit noisy, but underneath the noise, we're very pleased with the core financial performance. As you know, the FirstMerit acquisition closed on August 16. Under the terms of the acquisition agreement, shareholders of FirstMerit received 1.72 shares of Huntington common stock and $5 in cash for each share of Huntington -- of FirstMerit common stock. The aggregate purchase price was $3.7 billion including $0.8 billion of cash, $2.8 billion of common stock and $0.1 billion of preferred stock. Huntington issued 284 million shares of common stock that had a total fair value of $2.8 billion based on the closing market price of $9.68 per share on August 15, 2016. We are extremely pleased with the progress we're making in bringing the 2 companies together as one. We believe the combination strengthens our company by improving efficiency, accelerating our long-term growth rate and driving a higher return profile. We are excited to have the opportunity to introduce our strong recognizable brand, differentiated product set and industry-leading customer service in new geographies and to new customers. Integration is moving along as expected and our new colleagues are embracing our Fair Play philosophy and welcome culture. 
Turning to Slide 3, let's review the financial highlights of our third quarter. Huntington reported earnings per common share of $0.11, inclusive of $0.11 per share of significant items related to the FirstMerit acquisition, which also impacted the financial metrics I will highlight on this slide. Tangible book value per share decreased 6% from the year-ago quarter to $6.48 per share. Return on tangible common equity was 7%, while return on assets was 0.58%. Except where noted, all comparisons to previous quarters are inclusive of FirstMerit, but I want to emphasize the core organic performance continued to meet our expectations. Compared to the third quarter of 2015, revenue grew by 24%, with net interest income up 26% and noninterest income up 19%. Noninterest expense increased $186 million or 35% year-over-year. Noninterest expense adjusted for the year-over-year change in significant items increased $7 million or 14% year-over-year. Reflecting the addition of FirstMerit, the accelerated built-out of our in-store channel last fall and ongoing technology investments. Our reported efficiency ratio for the quarter was 75%. However, the acquisition-related expense stemming from the FirstMerit transaction added 17 percentage points to the efficiency ratio. While revenue strength in the quarter including mortgage banking, capital markets and a large interest recovery, combined with a $4 million expense benefit from retiring trust preferred debt, lowered the core efficiency ratio by approximately 150 basis points. We're pleased with the progress towards achieving our long-term efficiency ratio goal of 56% to 59%.
Balance sheet growth in the third quarter showed continued organic strength, which was enhanced by the addition of FirstMerit's loan and deposit base. Average total loans grew 24% year-over-year, with growth excluding FirstMerit coming in at 8%. Average core deposits grew 22% year-over-year with average core deposit growth excluding FirstMerit registering 3%. Our third quarter credit performance reflects Huntington's commitment to an aggregate moderate-to-low risk profile. Net charge-offs of 26 basis points remained below our long-term financial target of 35 to 55 basis points. Nonperforming assets improved 21 basis points to 0.72% compared with the linked quarter. Criticized assets and delinquencies have remained in a relatively tight range for the past several quarters. Our common equity tier 1 ratio decreased 63 basis points year-over-year and 71 basis points linked quarter to 9.09%, reflecting the impact of the FirstMerit transaction.
Turning to Slide 4, and getting more in-depth with the income statement. Net interest income was up 26% from year-ago quarter as were average earning assets, reflecting strong organic loan growth and the impact of the FirstMerit acquisition. The net interest margin for the quarter came in at 3.18%, up 2 basis points from the year-ago quarter and up 12 basis points on a linked-quarter basis. Purchase accounting had a favorable impact of 12 basis points on the margin and we had an interest recovery in the quarter that added an additional 2 basis points.
Noninterest income increased $49 million or 19% from the year-ago quarter, primarily driven by the addition of FirstMerit but also driven by strong organic growth in mortgage banking, service charges on deposit accounts and capital markets. Noninterest expense increased $186 million or 35% from a year ago, with significant items accounting for $116 million of the increase. After adjusting for significant items, noninterest expense increased 14%, primarily reflecting the impact of bringing FirstMerit on for 1.5 months in the current quarter. I want to reiterate our confidence in achieving the $255 million in total annual expense savings that we communication when we announced the transaction. All the cost savings are identified, being executed against and will be implemented within one year of the deal closing. With the vast majority implemented prior to or coincident with the branch and systems conversion over Presidents' Day Weekend in the first quarter 2017.
In total, we plan to consolidate 103 branches or roughly 9% of the combined post-divesture branch network.
In addition, in connection with our normal periodic review of our distribution network, we will be consolidating 9 legacy Huntington branches unrelated to the FirstMerit acquisition during the first quarter of 2017.
Turning to Slide 5, let's review operating leverage. As you would expect, the combined entity has significant positive operating leverage through 9 months. Positive operating leverage remains an important annual financial goal, which we delivered on in 2013, 2014 and 2015, and of course, we expect to deliver again in 2016. 
Turning to Slide 6, let's look at balance sheet trends. Average total loans grew 24% year-over-year with growth excluding FirstMerit coming in at 8%. As you can see from the chart on the left side of the page, the addition of FirstMerit has not had a material impact on our earning asset mix. The chart on the right side of the page, illustrates how the addition of FirstMerit has increased the proportion of low-cost DDA in our funding mix. Average securities increased 32% year-over-year, primarily reflecting the addition of $7.4 billion from FirstMerit, additional investment in LCR Level 1 qualifying securities and growth in direct purchased Municipal Securities and our Commercial Banking segment.
Our liquidity coverage ratio was approximately 110% at quarter end. Average total debt increased $2.9 billion or 42% as a result of the issuance of $3.3 billion in senior debt over the past 5 quarters. 
Turning to Slide 7, as previously discussed, we have continued to evaluate opportunities to optimize the balance sheet and will not affect the quarterly average balances, approximately $2.6 billion of total loans and leases, comprised of $1.5 billion of auto loans, $1 billion of predominately non-relationship C&I loans and leases and $1 billion of predominately nonrelationship CRE loans were moved to loans held for sale at the end of the third quarter. We're taking these actions to improve risk-weighted asset efficiency and specific to the C&I and CRE assets to free up capital that was not generating acceptable returns. Regarding the $1.5 billion of auto loans moved to held-for-sale, our intention is to securitize these assets in the fourth quarter of 2016.
Let me emphasize that we remain steadfast in our commitment to our Auto Finance business, including our well-established strategy, which is built upon deep long-term relationships with our core dealer customers and our focus on prime and super prime indirect lending.
However, we're reducing our indirect auto concentration limit back down to 150% of capital and we are adopting an operating guideline of 125% of capital. You might remember that in mid-2015, before we had an agreement in place with FirstMerit, we increased our indirect auto concentration limit to 175% of capital. Given the larger capital base of the new combined organization, we do not foresee any circumstance in which we would grow our indirect auto portfolio anywhere close to the 175% of capital. In addition, with the new 125% operating guideline in mind, we expect to return to the securitization markets on an annual basis going forward.
Moving to Slide 8. Our net interest margin was 3.18% for the third quarter, up 2 basis points from the year-ago quarter. This increase reflected a 10 basis point increase in earning asset yield, a 2 basis point increase in the benefit from non-interest-bearing deposits and a 10 basis point increase in funding cost. Loan yields improved 16 basis points year-over-year, while securities yields declined to 12 basis points. The increase in funding costs was almost entirely driven by the impact of the debt issuances over the past 5 quarters as the cost of deposits was unchanged year-over-year. On a linked-quarter basis, the net interest margin increased by 12 basis points, driven by an 11 basis point improvement in earning asset yield and 1 basis point decrease in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities.
Purchase accounting contributed 12 basis points to the margin in the third quarter. Adjusting for the impact of purchase accounting, the core net interest margin was 3.06% or unchanged from the prior quarter.
In addition, similar to what we have seen in recent quarters, one 1 large interest recovery added 2 basis points to the margin during the third quarter. Finally, as we communicated previously, core NIM will stay above 3% in every quarter of 2016. 
Slide 9 illustrates the impact of our capital ratios of effectively deploying capital through the acquisition of FirstMerit. Tangible common equity ended the quarter at 7.14%, down 75 basis points year-over-year and 82 basis points linked quarter. Common equity tier 1 ended the quarter at 9.09%, down 63 basis points year-over-year and down 71 basis points sequentially. 
Referring to Slide 10, we booked provision expense of $64 million compared to net charge-offs of $40 million. The higher provision expense compared to the prior quarter was the result of a higher level of net charge-offs, organic loan growth and incremental reserves on the legacy FirstMerit portfolio in excess of the credit mark due the rate mark partially offsetting the credit mark on certain portfolios. In addition, there was approximately $10 million of incremental loan loss provision expense in the third quarter associated with the previously discussed movement of loans held-for-sale. Net charge-offs were higher, represented an annualized 26 basis points of average loans and leases, which remains below our long-term target of 35 to 55 basis points. The allowance for credit losses as a percentage of loans decreased to 1.06%, reflecting the addition of the FirstMerit loan portfolio to the denominator without additional reserves being added to the numerator due to the credit mark applied through the purchase accounting process. The nonaccrual loan coverage ratio increased to 174% as a result of the continued decline in nonaccrual loans.
On Slide 11, the asset quality metrics remained favorable in the quarter as indicated. The nonperforming asset ratio decreased further reaching it's lowest level in 2 years at 0.72%. The criticized asset ratio increased modestly to 3.54%, that has remained in the 3.5% range for the past several quarters. Delinquencies were also well controlled having remained relatively flat for the past 6 quarters. Let me now turn the presentation over to Steve."

Normally at this point in our quarterly discussion, I would provide you with an update on our optimal customer relationship or OCR strategy. However, we've removed those slides from the presentation this quarter, given the recent addition of FirstMerit and our inability to produce similar data for legacy FirstMerit customers. We believe providing OCR data for just legacy Huntington customers will not provide you with complete picture. Let me assure you though that we remain fully committed to our Fair Play philosophy and OCR strategy, which is built upon a simple thesis, that putting customers first, looking out for their needs and doing the right thing will result in more substantial long-term customer relationships. Now for years, we've focused on customer acquisition and relationship deepening with our Fair Play banking philosophy and our OCR strategy. While this was considered a contrary approach when we started these actions, back in 2009 and '10, the results paying a picture of resounding success, and I want to stress that we are not just seeking relationship growth, but indeed are looking to deepen existing relationships. Our OCR strategy is also build upon the fundamental belief that we are here to understand and serve our customers needs. The Fair Play banking philosophy starts with doing the right thing for our customers with products and services that are simple, clear and fair. We couple that with the customer experience designed to fit their needs, not ours. For us, the strategies remain consistent since it was put in place in 2010, and it continues to bear fruit. In light of the recent headlines some of you have asked about our sales and incentive compensation practices and complaint management, particularly with respect to our OCR strategy. The focus of our OCR model is on building deep, trusted and lasting relationships, and this is achieved by getting to know our customers, understanding their needs and helping them meet their financial needs with the appropriate products and services. Further, Huntington as a company built upon a distinguished legacy of superior customer service. Our Fair Play philosophy and welcome culture are built upon the premise and promise of doing the right thing for our customers. As you would expect, given the investor, media and regulatory interest in this matter, we've undertaken a detailed review of our practices, policies and procedures for any signs of misalignment of incentives or other areas of risk or concern. While the review is ongoing, to-date we've not uncovered any systematic, cultural or operational areas of concern. We'll likely refine some of our monitoring but we do not anticipate any material changes to our practices or procedures, and certainly not to our overall OCR strategy. 
Moving to the economy, slide 12 contains what we feel to be some of the more meaningful economic indicators for a footprint. The bottom left chart illustrates trends and the unemployment rates across our now 8 core midwestern states. As you can see, the majority of our footprint remains at or below the national unemployment rates relative to the national average, with Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, Wisconsin particularly showing resilience this past quarter. Charts on the top and bottom right show coincident and leading economic indicators for the region. The bottom chart, which shows leading indexes for our footprint as of August, show that all 8 states in our footprint expect positive economic growth over the next 6 months. 
Slide 13 focuses on trends and unemployment rates in our largest metropolitan areas, and many of the large MSAs in the footprint remain at or near 15-year lows for unemployment at the end of August. Also notable, 11 of the top 15 MSAs experienced declining unemployment rates in the last 3 months. The auto industry is still strong and is a major economic contributor within our footprint, but the housing markets are also strong. Labor market in our footprint has proven to be strong in 2016, with several markets such as here at Columbus, where we're at structural full employment.
We're seeing wage inflation in our expense base and our customers are too. State and local governments continue to operate with surpluses. Ohio, Indiana and Michigan continue to outpace overall U.S. growth since the recovery. We remain confident in our footprint in Midwest economies based on the sustained job growth and economic production since the recovery that began after the great recession. 
Turning to slide 14. I would like to give you some closing remarks and important messages. We remain focused on delivering consistent through the cycle shareholder returns. The strategy entails reducing short-term volatility, achieving top-tier performance over the long-term and maintaining our aggregate moderate to low risk profile throughout. As you heard, Mac, mentioned earlier, the acquisition and integration of FirstMerit provides, what we believe, is an opportunity to achieve significant cost savings and improve our overall efficiency. We're committed to and progressing as planned towards realizing our targeted $255 million of annual cost savings from the acquisition. We continue to win new customers through a strong and recognizable consumer brand with differentiated products and superior customer service, the new customers and dynamic markets offered from the FirstMerit acquisition provide a deeper and more vibrant pool to deliver our value proposition and add customers and deepen relationships. We have invested and will continue to invest in our businesses, particularly around enhanced sales management, mobile and digital technologies, data analytics and optimizing our retail distribution network. Importantly, we plan to continue to manage our expenses appropriately within our revenue outlook. We always like to include a reminder that there is a high level of alignment between the board, management, our employees and our shareholders. The board and our colleagues are collectively among the largest shareholders of Huntington.
We uphold the retirement requirements on certain shares and are appropriately focused on driving sustained long-term performance. We are highly focused on our commitment to being good stewards of shareholder capital. Looking forward to full year 2016 results, excluding the impact of significant items, we expect total revenues to increase 16% to 18%, and noninterest expenses to increase 13% to 15%. We expect to deliver positive operating leverage for the fourth consecutive year. We expect asset quality metrics to remain near current levels, including net charge-offs remaining below our long-term target of 35 to 55 basis points. Now consistent with our historical practice, we anticipate we will provide initial expectations for 2017, at an investor conference later this quarter. Finally, we're very pleased with the smooth integration process with FirstMerit, which we acquired on August 16. The divestiture of 13 branches, primarily in the Kentucky and Ohio market will occur this quarter. We've completed the on-boarding and initial training of our new colleagues and fully implemented the organizational changes for the combined entity that we announced last summer. 103 branch consolidations will occur coincident with the branch conversion in February of 2017. Our systems conversion planning efforts continue to progress as our IT teams have completed all product and data mapping and are now managing system testing and preparing for marked conversions. So I'll now turn it back over to Mark so we can get to your questions. Thank you."

First, we did have higher charge-offs than what we've been experiencing, although, still below our long-term expectations. So replenishing the $40 million of charge-offs was 1 piece of that. Second is, you've already noted, we had the movement of loans to held-for-sale. We also had the organic originations from FirstMerit post-closing. So the new loans that are generated have allowance associated with them. And then we did have a portfolio, where we had a positive rate marks that offset the credit marks. So it's recorded at a premium, so we have a allowance build there. So I wouldn't say that this is a situation where this is the new normal. I think this was a bit of an outlier and I think on a go-forward basis, we will have provision expense that is more in line with charge-offs and with an allowance for some growth. I also would note that in the quarter, charge-offs were up partially due to the fact that we had lower recoveries in the C&I portfolio that added about $5 million of additional charge-off over what we have been experiencing. So we had quite a number of factors that would have resulted in the higher provision this quarter."

And quite frankly, as we bring on FirstMerit, we have other opportunities to invest capital at higher returns. So that's primarily why we did it. We've always been at 150 historically, and we just feel that operating at 125 gives us flexibility to perhaps go over 125 from a timing perspective if we're getting the securitization done and we don't like the market conditions, we can hold a bit above 125 until we like the market conditions.

We appreciate your interest and support. Let me start by acknowledging that the third quarter was a bit noisy, but underneath the noise, we're very pleased with the core financial performance. As you know, the FirstMerit acquisition closed on August 16. Under the terms of the acquisition agreement, shareholders of FirstMerit received 1.72 shares of Huntington common stock and $5 in cash for each share of Huntington -- of FirstMerit common stock. The aggregate purchase price was $3.7 billion including $0.8 billion of cash, $2.8 billion of common stock and $0.1 billion of preferred stock. Huntington issued 284 million shares of common stock that had a total fair value of $2.8 billion based on the closing market price of $9.68 per share on August 15, 2016.  
We are extremely pleased with the progress we are making in bringing the 2 companies together as one. We believe the combination strengthens our company by improving efficiency, accelerating our long-term growth rate and driving a higher return profile. We are excited to have the opportunity to introduce our strong recognizable brand, differentiated product set and industry-leading customer service in new geographies and to new customers. Integration is moving along as expected and our new colleagues are embracing our Fair Play philosophy and welcome culture. 
Turning to Slide 3, let's review the financial highlights of our third quarter. Huntington reported earnings per common share of $0.11, inclusive of $0.11 per share of significant items related to the FirstMerit acquisition, which also impacted the financial metrics I will highlight on this slide. Tangible book value per share decreased 6% from the year-ago quarter to $6.48 per share. Return on tangible common equity was 7%, while return on assets was 0.58%. Except where noted, all comparisons to previous quarters are inclusive of FirstMerit, but I want to emphasize the core organic performance continued to meet our expectations. 
Compared to the third quarter of 2015, revenue grew by 24%, with net interest income up 26% and noninterest income up 19%. Noninterest expense increased $186 million or 35% year-over-year. Noninterest expense adjusted for the year-over-year change in significant items increased $7 million or 14% year-over-year, reflecting the addition of FirstMerit, the accelerated built-out of our in-store channel last fall and ongoing technology investments. Our reported efficiency ratio for the quarter was 75%. However, the acquisition-related expense stemming from the FirstMerit transaction added 17 percentage points to the efficiency ratio. While revenue strength in the quarter including mortgage banking, capital markets and a large interest recovery, combined with a $4 million expense benefit from retiring trust preferred debt, lowered the core efficiency ratio by approximately 150 basis points. We are pleased with the progress towards achieving our long-term efficiency ratio goal of 56% to 59%.
Balance sheet growth in the third quarter showed continued organic strength, which was enhanced by the addition of FirstMerit's loan and deposit base. Average total loans grew 24% year-over-year, with growth excluding FirstMerit coming in at 8%. Average core deposits grew 22% year-over-year with average core deposit growth excluding FirstMerit registering 3%. Our third quarter credit performance reflects Huntington's commitment to an aggregate moderate-to-low risk profile. Net charge-offs of 26 basis points remained below our long-term financial target of 35 to 55 basis points. Nonperforming assets improved 21 basis points to 0.72% compared with the linked quarter. Criticized assets and delinquencies have remained in a relatively tight range for the past several quarters. Our common equity tier 1 ratio decreased 63 basis points year-over-year and 71 basis points linked quarter to 9.09%, reflecting the impact of the FirstMerit transaction.
Turning to Slide 4, and getting more in-depth with the income statement. Net interest income was up 26% from year-ago quarter as were average earning assets, reflecting strong organic loan growth and the impact of the FirstMerit acquisition. The net interest margin for the quarter came in at 3.18%, up 2 basis points from the year-ago quarter and up 12 basis points on a linked-quarter basis. Purchase accounting had a favorable impact of 12 basis points on the margin and we had an interest recovery in the quarter that added an additional 2 basis points.
Noninterest income increased $49 million or 19% from the year-ago quarter, primarily driven by the addition of FirstMerit but also driven by strong organic growth in mortgage banking, service charges on deposit accounts and capital markets. Noninterest expense increased $186 million or 35% from a year ago, with significant items accounting for $116 million of the increase. After adjusting for significant items, noninterest expense increased 14%, primarily reflecting the impact of bringing FirstMerit on for 1.5 months in the current quarter. 
I want to reiterate our confidence in achieving the $255 million in total annual expense savings that we communicated when we announced the transaction. All the cost savings are identified, being executed against and will be implemented within 1 year of the deal closing, with the vast majority implemented prior to or coincident with the branch and systems conversion over Presidents' Day Weekend in the first quarter 2017.
In total, we plan to consolidate 103 branches or roughly 9% of the combined post-divesture branch network.
In addition, in connection with our normal periodic review of our distribution network, we will be consolidating 9 legacy Huntington branches unrelated to the FirstMerit acquisition during the first quarter of 2017.
Turning to Slide 5, let's review operating leverage. As you would expect, the combined entity has significant positive operating leverage through 9 months. Positive operating leverage remains an important annual financial goal, which we delivered on in 2013, 2014 and 2015, and of course, we expect to deliver again in 2016. 
Turning to Slide 6, let's look at balance sheet trends. Average total loans grew 24% year-over-year with growth excluding FirstMerit coming in at 8%. As you can see from the chart on the left side of the page, the addition of FirstMerit has not had a material impact on our earning asset mix. The chart on the right side of the page, illustrates how the addition of FirstMerit has increased the proportion of low-cost DDA in our funding mix. Average securities increased 32% year-over-year, primarily reflecting the addition of $7.4 billion from FirstMerit, additional investment in LCR Level 1 qualifying securities and growth in direct purchased Municipal Securities and our Commercial Banking segment.
Our liquidity coverage ratio was approximately 110% at quarter end. Average total debt increased $2.9 billion or 42% as a result of the issuance of $3.3 billion in senior debt over the past 5 quarters. 
Turning to Slide 7, as previously discussed, we have continued to evaluate opportunities to optimize the balance sheet and will not affect the quarterly average balances, approximately $2.6 billion of total loans and leases, comprised of $1.5 billion of auto loans, $1 billion of predominately non-relationship C&I loans and leases and $1 billion of predominately non-relationship CRE loans were moved to loans held for sale at the end of the third quarter. We are taking these actions to improve risk-weighted asset efficiency and specific to the C&I and CRE assets to free up capital that was not generating acceptable returns. Regarding the $1.5 billion of auto loans moved to held-for-sale, our intention is to securitize these assets in the fourth quarter of 2016.
Let me emphasize that we remain steadfast in our commitment to our Auto Finance business, including our well-established strategy, which is built upon deep long-term relationships with our core dealer customers and our focus on prime and super prime indirect lending.
However, we're reducing our indirect auto concentration limit back down to 150% of capital and we are adopting an operating guideline of 125% of capital. You might remember that in mid-2015, before we had an agreement in place with FirstMerit, we increased our indirect auto concentration limit to 175% of capital. Given the larger capital base of the new combined organization, we do not foresee any circumstance in which we would grow our indirect auto portfolio anywhere close to the 175% of capital. In addition, with the new 125% operating guideline in mind, we expect to return to the securitization markets on an annual basis going forward.
Moving to Slide 8. Our net interest margin was 3.18% for the third quarter, up 2 basis points from the year-ago quarter. This increase reflected a 10 basis point increase in earning asset yield, a 2 basis point increase in the benefit from non-interest-bearing deposits and a 10 basis point increase in funding cost. Loan yields improved 16 basis points year-over-year, while securities yields declined to 12 basis points. The increase in funding costs was almost entirely driven by the impact of the debt issuances over the past 5 quarters as the cost of deposits was unchanged year-over-year. On a linked-quarter basis, the net interest margin increased by 12 basis points, driven by an 11 basis point improvement in earning asset yield and 1 basis point decrease in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities.
Purchase accounting contributed 12 basis points to the margin in the third quarter. Adjusting for the impact of purchase accounting, the core net interest margin was 3.06% or unchanged from the prior quarter.
In addition, similar to what we have seen in recent quarters, 1 large interest recovery added 2 basis points to the margin during the third quarter. Finally, as we communicated previously, core NIM will stay above 3% in every quarter of 2016. 
Slide 9 illustrates the impact of our capital ratios of effectively deploying capital through the acquisition of FirstMerit. Tangible common equity ended the quarter at 7.14%, down 75 basis points year-over-year and 82 basis points linked quarter. Common equity tier 1 ended the quarter at 9.09%, down 63 basis points year-over-year and down 71 basis points sequentially. 
Referring to Slide 10, we booked provision expense of $64 million compared to net charge-offs of $40 million. The higher provision expense compared to the prior quarter was the result of a higher level of net charge-offs, organic loan growth and incremental reserves on the legacy FirstMerit portfolio in excess of the credit mark due the rate mark partially offsetting the credit mark on certain portfolios. In addition, there was approximately $10 million of incremental loan loss provision expense in the third quarter associated with the previously discussed movement of loans held-for-sale. Net charge-offs were higher, represented an annualized 26 basis points of average loans and leases, which remains below our long-term target of 35 to 55 basis points. The allowance for credit losses as a percentage of loans decreased to 1.06%, reflecting the addition of the FirstMerit loan portfolio to the denominator without additional reserves being added to the numerator due to the credit mark applied through the purchase accounting process. The nonaccrual loan coverage ratio increased to 174% as a result of the continued decline in nonaccrual loans.
On Slide 11, the asset quality metrics remained favorable in the quarter as indicated. The nonperforming asset ratio decreased further reaching its lowest level in 2 years at 0.72%. The criticized asset ratio increased modestly to 3.54%, that has remained in the 3.5% range for the past several quarters. Delinquencies were also well controlled having remained relatively flat for the past 6 quarters. Let me now turn the presentation over to Steve."

Normally at this point in our quarterly discussion, I would provide you with an update on our optimal customer relationship or OCR strategy. However, we've removed those slides from the presentation this quarter, given the recent addition of FirstMerit and our inability to produce similar data for legacy FirstMerit customers. We believe providing OCR data for just legacy Huntington customers will not provide you with complete picture. Let me assure you though that we remain fully committed to our Fair Play philosophy and OCR strategy, which is built upon a simple thesis of putting customers first, looking out for their needs and doing the right thing, will result in more substantial long-term customer relationships. Now for years, we've focused on customer acquisition and relationship deepening with our Fair Play banking philosophy and our OCR strategy. While this was considered a contrary approach when we started these actions, back in 2009 and '10, the results paint a picture of resounding success, and I want to stress that we are not just seeking relationship growth, but indeed are looking to deepen existing relationships. Our OCR strategy is also build upon the fundamental belief that we are here to understand and serve our customers’ needs. The Fair Play banking philosophy starts with doing the right thing for our customers with products and services that are simple, clear and fair. We couple that with the customer experience designed to fit their needs, not ours. For us, the strategies remain consistent since it was put in place in 2010, and it continues to bear fruit. In light of the recent headlines some of you have asked about our sales and incentive compensation practices and complaint management, particularly with respect to our OCR strategy. The focus of our OCR model is on building deep, trusted and lasting relationships, and this is achieved by getting to know our customers, understanding their needs and helping them meet their financial needs with the appropriate products and services. Further, Huntington as a company built upon a distinguished legacy of superior customer service. Our Fair Play philosophy and welcome culture are built upon the premise and promise of doing the right thing for our customers. As you would expect, given the investor, media and regulatory interest in this matter, we've undertaken a detailed review of our practices, policies and procedures for any signs of misalignment of incentives or other areas of risk or concern. While the review is ongoing, to date, we've not uncovered any systematic, cultural or operational areas of concern. We will likely refine some of our monitoring but we do not anticipate any material changes to our practices or procedures, and certainly not to our overall OCR strategy. 
Moving to the economy, Slide 12, contains what we feel to be some of the more meaningful economic indicators for our footprint. The bottom left chart illustrates trends and the unemployment rates across our now 8 core midwestern states. As you can see, the majority of our footprint remains at or below the national unemployment rates relative to the national average, with Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, Wisconsin particularly showing resilience this past quarter. Charts on the top and bottom right show coincident and leading economic indicators for the region. The bottom chart, which shows leading indexes for our footprint as of August, show that all 8 states in our footprint expect positive economic growth over the next 6 months. 
Slide 13 focuses on trends and unemployment rates in our largest metropolitan areas, and many of the large MSAs in the footprint remain at or near 15-year lows for unemployment at the end of August. Also notable, 11 of the top 15 MSAs experienced declining unemployment rates in the last 3 months. The auto industry is still strong and is a major economic contributor within our footprint, but the housing markets are also strong. Labor market in our footprint has proven to be strong in 2016, with several markets such as here at Columbus, where we are at structural full employment.
We're seeing wage inflation in our expense base and our customers are too. State and local governments continue to operate with surpluses. Ohio, Indiana and Michigan continue to outpace overall U.S. growth since the recovery. We remain confident in our footprint Midwest economies based on the sustained job growth and economic production since the recovery that began after the great recession. 
Turning to Slide 14. I'd like to give you some closing remarks and important messages. We remain focused on delivering consistent through the cycle, shareholder returns. The strategy entails reducing short-term volatility, achieving top-tier performance over the long-term and maintaining our aggregate moderate to low risk profile throughout. As you heard Mac mentioned earlier, the acquisition and integration of FirstMerit provides, what we believe, is an opportunity to achieve significant cost savings and improve our overall efficiency. We're committed to and progressing as planned towards realizing our targeted $255 million of annual cost savings from the acquisition. We continue to win new customers through a strong and recognizable consumer brand with differentiated products and superior customer service, the new customers and dynamic markets offered from the FirstMerit acquisition provide a deeper and more vibrant pool to deliver our value proposition and add customers and deepen relationships. We have invested and will continue to invest in our businesses, particularly around enhanced sales management, mobile and digital technologies, data analytics and optimizing our retail distribution network. Importantly, we plan to continue to manage our expenses appropriately within our revenue outlook. We always like to include a reminder that there is a high level of alignment between the board, management, our employees and our shareholders. The board and our colleagues are collectively among the largest shareholders of Huntington.
We uphold the retirement requirements on certain shares and are appropriately focused on driving sustained long-term performance. We're highly focused on our commitment to being good stewards of shareholder capital. Looking forward to full year 2016 results, excluding the impact of significant items, we expect total revenues to increase 16% to 18%, and noninterest expenses to increase 13% to 15%. We expect to deliver positive operating leverage for the fourth consecutive year. We expect asset quality metrics to remain near current levels, including net charge-offs remaining below our long-term target of 35 to 55 basis points. Now consistent with our historical practice, we anticipate we'll provide initial expectations for 2017, at an investor conference later this quarter. Finally, we're very pleased with the smooth integration process with FirstMerit, which we acquired on August 16. The divestiture of 13 branches, primarily in the Kent, Ohio market will occur this quarter. We've completed the on-boarding and initial training of our new colleagues and fully implemented the organizational changes for the combined entity that we announced last summer. 103 branch consolidations will occur coincident with the branch conversion in February of 2017. Our systems conversion planning efforts continue to progress as our IT teams have completed all product and data mapping and are now managing system testing and preparing for marked conversions. So I'll now turn it back over to Mark so we can get to your questions. Thank you."

First, we did have higher charge-offs than what we've been experiencing, although, still below our long-term expectations. So replenishing the $40 million of charge-offs was one piece of that. Second is, you've already noted, we had the movement of loans to held-for-sale. We also had the organic originations from FirstMerit post-closing. So the new loans that are generated have allowance associated with them. And then we did have a portfolio, where we had a positive rate marks that offset the credit marks. So it's recorded at a premium, so we have a allowance build there. So I wouldn't say that this is a situation where this is the new normal. I think this was a bit of an outlier and I think on a go-forward basis, we will have provision expense that is more in line with charge-offs and with an allowance for some growth. I also would note that in the quarter, charge-offs were up partially due to the fact that we had lower recoveries in the C&I portfolio that added about $5 million of additional charge-off over what we have been experiencing. So we had quite a number of factors that would have resulted in the higher provision this quarter."

And quite frankly, as we bring on FirstMerit, we have other opportunities to invest capital at higher returns. So that's primarily why we did it. We've always been at 150 historically, and we just feel that operating at 125 gives us flexibility to perhaps go over 125 from a timing perspective if we're getting the securitization done and we don't like the market conditions, we can hold a bit above 125 until we like the market conditions.

We appreciate your interest and support. Let me start by acknowledging that the third quarter was a bit noisy, but underneath the noise, we're very pleased with the core financial performance. As you know, the FirstMerit acquisition closed on August 16. Under the terms of the acquisition agreement, shareholders of FirstMerit received 1.72 shares of Huntington common stock and $5 in cash for each share of Huntington -- of FirstMerit common stock. The aggregate purchase price was $3.7 billion including $0.8 billion of cash, $2.8 billion of common stock and $0.1 billion of preferred stock. Huntington issued 284 million shares of common stock that had a total fair value of $2.8 billion based on the closing market price of $9.68 per share on August 15, 2016. 
We are extremely pleased with the progress we are making in bringing the 2 companies together as one. We believe the combination strengthens our company by improving efficiency, accelerating our long-term growth rate and driving a higher return profile. We are excited to have the opportunity to introduce our strong recognizable brand, differentiated product set and industry-leading customer service in new geographies and to new customers. Integration is moving along as expected and our new colleagues are embracing our Fair Play philosophy and welcome culture. 
Turning to Slide 3, let's review the financial highlights of our third quarter. Huntington reported earnings per common share of $0.11, inclusive of $0.11 per share of significant items related to the FirstMerit acquisition, which also impacted the financial metrics I will highlight on this slide. Tangible book value per share decreased 6% from the year-ago quarter to $6.48 per share. Return on tangible common equity was 7%, while return on assets was 0.58%. Except where noted, all comparisons to previous quarters are inclusive of FirstMerit, but I want to emphasize the core organic performance continued to meet our expectations. 
Compared to the third quarter of 2015, revenue grew by 24%, with net interest income up 26% and noninterest income up 19%. Noninterest expense increased $186 million or 35% year-over-year. Noninterest expense adjusted for the year-over-year change in significant items increased $7 million or 14% year-over-year, reflecting the addition of FirstMerit, the accelerated built-out of our in-store channel last fall and ongoing technology investments. Our reported efficiency ratio for the quarter was 75%. However, the acquisition-related expense stemming from the FirstMerit transaction added 17 percentage points to the efficiency ratio. While revenue strength in the quarter including mortgage banking, capital markets and a large interest recovery, combined with a $4 million expense benefit from retiring trust preferred debt, lowered the core efficiency ratio by approximately 150 basis points. We are pleased with the progress towards achieving our long-term efficiency ratio goal of 56% to 59%.
Balance sheet growth in the third quarter showed continued organic strength, which was enhanced by the addition of FirstMerit's loan and deposit base. Average total loans grew 24% year-over-year, with growth excluding FirstMerit coming in at 8%. Average core deposits grew 22% year-over-year with average core deposit growth excluding FirstMerit registering 3%. Our third quarter credit performance reflects Huntington's commitment to an aggregate moderate-to-low risk profile. Net charge-offs of 26 basis points remained below our long-term financial target of 35 to 55 basis points. Nonperforming assets improved 21 basis points to 0.72% compared with the linked quarter. Criticized assets and delinquencies have remained in a relatively tight range for the past several quarters. Our common equity tier 1 ratio decreased 63 basis points year-over-year and 71 basis points linked quarter to 9.09%, reflecting the impact of the FirstMerit transaction.
Turning to Slide 4, and getting more in-depth with the income statement. Net interest income was up 26% from year-ago quarter as were average earning assets, reflecting strong organic loan growth and the impact of the FirstMerit acquisition. The net interest margin for the quarter came in at 3.18%, up 2 basis points from the year-ago quarter and up 12 basis points on a linked-quarter basis. Purchase accounting had a favorable impact of 12 basis points on the margin and we had an interest recovery in the quarter that added an additional 2 basis points.
Noninterest income increased $49 million or 19% from the year-ago quarter, primarily driven by the addition of FirstMerit but also driven by strong organic growth in mortgage banking, service charges on deposit accounts and capital markets. Noninterest expense increased $186 million or 35% from a year ago, with significant items accounting for $116 million of the increase. After adjusting for significant items, noninterest expense increased 14%, primarily reflecting the impact of bringing FirstMerit on for 1.5 months in the current quarter. 
I want to reiterate our confidence in achieving the $255 million in total annual expense savings that we communicated when we announced the transaction. All the cost savings are identified, being executed against and will be implemented within 1 year of the deal closing, with the vast majority implemented prior to or coincident with the branch and systems conversion over Presidents' Day Weekend in the first quarter 2017.
In total, we plan to consolidate 103 branches or roughly 9% of the combined post-divesture branch network.
In addition, in connection with our normal periodic review of our distribution network, we will be consolidating 9 legacy Huntington branches unrelated to the FirstMerit acquisition during the first quarter of 2017.
Turning to Slide 5, let's review operating leverage. As you would expect, the combined entity has significant positive operating leverage through 9 months. Positive operating leverage remains an important annual financial goal, which we delivered on in 2013, 2014 and 2015, and of course, we expect to deliver again in 2016. 
Turning to Slide 6, let's look at balance sheet trends. Average total loans grew 24% year-over-year with growth excluding FirstMerit coming in at 8%. As you can see from the chart on the left side of the page, the addition of FirstMerit has not had a material impact on our earning asset mix. The chart on the right side of the page, illustrates how the addition of FirstMerit has increased the proportion of low-cost DDA in our funding mix. Average securities increased 32% year-over-year, primarily reflecting the addition of $7.4 billion from FirstMerit, additional investment in LCR Level 1 qualifying securities and growth in direct purchased Municipal Securities and our Commercial Banking segment.
Our liquidity coverage ratio was approximately 110% at quarter end. Average total debt increased $2.9 billion or 42% as a result of the issuance of $3.3 billion in senior debt over the past 5 quarters. 
Turning to Slide 7, as previously discussed, we have continued to evaluate opportunities to optimize the balance sheet and will not affect the quarterly average balances, approximately $2.6 billion of total loans and leases, comprised of $1.5 billion of auto loans, $1 billion of predominately non-relationship C&I loans and leases and $1 billion of predominately non-relationship CRE loans were moved to loans held for sale at the end of the third quarter. We are taking these actions to improve risk-weighted asset efficiency and specific to the C&I and CRE assets to free up capital that was not generating acceptable returns. Regarding the $1.5 billion of auto loans moved to held-for-sale, our intention is to securitize these assets in the fourth quarter of 2016.
Let me emphasize that we remain steadfast in our commitment to our Auto Finance business, including our well-established strategy, which is built upon deep long-term relationships with our core dealer customers and our focus on prime and super prime indirect lending.
However, we're reducing our indirect auto concentration limit back down to 150% of capital and we are adopting an operating guideline of 125% of capital. You might remember that in mid-2015, before we had an agreement in place with FirstMerit, we increased our indirect auto concentration limit to 175% of capital. Given the larger capital base of the new combined organization, we do not foresee any circumstance in which we would grow our indirect auto portfolio anywhere close to the 175% of capital. In addition, with the new 125% operating guideline in mind, we expect to return to the securitization markets on an annual basis going forward.
Moving to Slide 8. Our net interest margin was 3.18% for the third quarter, up 2 basis points from the year-ago quarter. This increase reflected a 10 basis point increase in earning asset yield, a 2 basis point increase in the benefit from non-interest-bearing deposits and a 10 basis point increase in funding cost. Loan yields improved 16 basis points year-over-year, while securities yields declined to 12 basis points. The increase in funding costs was almost entirely driven by the impact of the debt issuances over the past 5 quarters as the cost of deposits was unchanged year-over-year. On a linked-quarter basis, the net interest margin increased by 12 basis points, driven by an 11 basis point improvement in earning asset yield and 1 basis point decrease in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities.
Purchase accounting contributed 12 basis points to the margin in the third quarter. Adjusting for the impact of purchase accounting, the core net interest margin was 3.06% or unchanged from the prior quarter.
In addition, similar to what we have seen in recent quarters, 1 large interest recovery added 2 basis points to the margin during the third quarter. Finally, as we communicated previously, core NIM will stay above 3% in every quarter of 2016. 
Slide 9 illustrates the impact of our capital ratios of effectively deploying capital through the acquisition of FirstMerit. Tangible common equity ended the quarter at 7.14%, down 75 basis points year-over-year and 82 basis points linked quarter. Common equity tier 1 ended the quarter at 9.09%, down 63 basis points year-over-year and down 71 basis points sequentially. 
Referring to Slide 10, we booked provision expense of $64 million compared to net charge-offs of $40 million. The higher provision expense compared to the prior quarter was the result of a higher level of net charge-offs, organic loan growth and incremental reserves on the legacy FirstMerit portfolio in excess of the credit mark due the rate mark partially offsetting the credit mark on certain portfolios. In addition, there was approximately $10 million of incremental loan loss provision expense in the third quarter associated with the previously discussed movement of loans held-for-sale. Net charge-offs were higher, represented an annualized 26 basis points of average loans and leases, which remains below our long-term target of 35 to 55 basis points. The allowance for credit losses as a percentage of loans decreased to 1.06%, reflecting the addition of the FirstMerit loan portfolio to the denominator without additional reserves being added to the numerator due to the credit mark applied through the purchase accounting process. The nonaccrual loan coverage ratio increased to 174% as a result of the continued decline in nonaccrual loans.
On Slide 11, the asset quality metrics remained favorable in the quarter as indicated. The nonperforming asset ratio decreased further reaching its lowest level in 2 years at 0.72%. The criticized asset ratio increased modestly to 3.54% that has remained in the 3.5% range for the past several quarters. Delinquencies were also well controlled having remained relatively flat for the past 6 quarters. Let me now turn the presentation over to Steve."

Normally at this point in our quarterly discussion, I would provide you with an update on our optimal customer relationship or OCR strategy. However, we've removed those slides from the presentation this quarter, given the recent addition of",1194,"Thanks, Mac. Normally at this point in our quarterly discussion, I would provide you with an update on our optimal customer relationship or OCR strategy. However, we've removed those slides from the presentation this quarter, given the recent addition of FirstMerit and our inability to produce similar data for legacy FirstMerit customers. We believe providing OCR data for just legacy Huntington customers will not provide you with complete picture. Let me assure you though that we remain fully committed to our Fair Play philosophy and OCR strategy, which is built upon a simple thesis of putting customers first, looking out for their needs and doing the right thing, will result in more substantial long-term customer relationships. Now for years, we've focused on customer acquisition and relationship deepening with our Fair Play banking philosophy and our OCR strategy. While this was considered a contrary approach when we started these actions, back in 2009 and '10, the results paint a picture of resounding success, and I want to stress that we are not just seeking relationship growth, but indeed are looking to deepen existing relationships. Our OCR strategy is also build upon the fundamental belief that we are here to understand and serve our customers’ needs. The Fair Play banking philosophy starts with doing the right thing for our customers with products and services that are simple, clear and fair. We couple that with the customer experience designed to fit their needs, not ours. For us, the strategies remain consistent since it was put in place in 2010, and it continues to bear fruit. In light of the recent headlines some of you have asked about our sales and incentive compensation practices and complaint management, particularly with respect to our OCR strategy. The focus of our OCR model is on building deep, trusted and lasting relationships, and this is achieved by getting to know our customers, understanding their needs and helping them meet their financial needs with the appropriate products and services. Further, Huntington as a company built upon a distinguished legacy of superior customer service. Our Fair Play philosophy and welcome culture are built upon the premise and promise of doing the right thing for our customers. As you would expect, given the investor, media and regulatory interest in this matter, we've undertaken a detailed review of our practices, policies and procedures for any signs of misalignment of incentives or other areas of risk or concern. While the review is ongoing, to date, we've not uncovered any systematic, cultural or operational areas of concern. We will likely refine some of our monitoring but we do not anticipate any material changes to our practices or procedures, and certainly not to our overall OCR strategy. 
Moving to the economy, Slide 12, contains what we feel to be some of the more meaningful economic indicators for our footprint. The bottom left chart illustrates trends and the unemployment rates across our now 8 core midwestern states. As you can see, the majority of our footprint remains at or below the national unemployment rates relative to the national average, with Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, Wisconsin particularly showing resilience this past quarter. Charts on the top and bottom right show coincident and leading economic indicators for the region. The bottom chart, which shows leading indexes for our footprint as of August, show that all 8 states in our footprint expect positive economic growth over the next 6 months. 
Slide 13 focuses on trends and unemployment rates in our largest metropolitan areas, and many of the large MSAs in the footprint remain at or near 15-year lows for unemployment at the end of August. Also notable, 11 of the top 15 MSAs experienced declining unemployment rates in the last 3 months. The auto industry is still strong and is a major economic contributor within our footprint, but the housing markets are also strong. Labor market in our footprint has proven to be strong in 2016, with several markets such as here at Columbus, where we are at structural full employment.
We're seeing wage inflation in our expense base and our customers are too. State and local governments continue to operate with surpluses. Ohio, Indiana and Michigan continue to outpace overall U.S. growth since the recovery. We remain confident in our footprint Midwest economies based on the sustained job growth and economic production since the recovery that began after the great recession. 
Turning to Slide 14. I'd like to give you some closing remarks and important messages. We remain focused on delivering consistent through the cycle, shareholder returns. The strategy entails reducing short-term volatility, achieving top-tier performance over the long-term and maintaining our aggregate moderate to low risk profile throughout. As you heard Mac mentioned earlier, the acquisition and integration of FirstMerit provides, what we believe, is an opportunity to achieve significant cost savings and improve our overall efficiency. We're committed to and progressing as planned towards realizing our targeted $255 million of annual cost savings from the acquisition. We continue to win new customers through a strong and recognizable consumer brand with differentiated products and superior customer service, the new customers and dynamic markets offered from the FirstMerit acquisition provide a deeper and more vibrant pool to deliver our value proposition and add customers and deepen relationships. We have invested and will continue to invest in our businesses, particularly around enhanced sales management, mobile and digital technologies, data analytics and optimizing our retail distribution network. Importantly, we plan to continue to manage our expenses appropriately within our revenue outlook. We always like to include a reminder that there is a high level of alignment between the board, management, our employees and our shareholders. The board and our colleagues are collectively among the largest shareholders of Huntington.
We uphold the retirement requirements on certain shares and are appropriately focused on driving sustained long-term performance. We're highly focused on our commitment to being good stewards of shareholder capital. Looking forward to full year 2016 results, excluding the impact of significant items, we expect total revenues to increase 16% to 18%, and noninterest expenses to increase 13% to 15%. We expect to deliver positive operating leverage for the fourth consecutive year. We expect asset quality metrics to remain near current levels, including net charge-offs remaining below our long-term target of 35 to 55 basis points. Now consistent with our historical practice, we anticipate we'll provide initial expectations for 2017, at an investor conference later this quarter. Finally, we're very pleased with the smooth integration process with FirstMerit, which we acquired on August 16. The divestiture of 13 branches, primarily in the Canton, Ohio market will occur this quarter. We've completed the on-boarding and initial training of our new colleagues and fully implemented the organizational changes for the combined entity that we announced last summer. 103 branch consolidations will occur coincident with the branch conversion in February of 2017. Our systems conversion planning efforts continue to progress as our IT teams have completed all product and data mapping and are now managing system testing and preparing for marked conversions. 
So I'll now turn it back over to Mark so we can get to your questions. Thank you."

First, we did have higher charge-offs than what we've been experiencing, although, still below our long-term expectations. So replenishing the $40 million of charge-offs was one piece of that. Second is, you've already noted, we had the movement of loans to held-for-sale. We also had the organic originations from FirstMerit post-closing. So the new loans that are generated have allowance associated with them. And then we did have a portfolio, where we had a positive rate marks that offset the credit marks. So it's recorded at a premium, so we have a allowance build there. So I wouldn't say that this is a situation where this is the new normal. I think this was a bit of an outlier and I think on a go-forward basis, we will have provision expense that is more in line with charge-offs and with an allowance for some growth. I also would note that in the quarter, charge-offs were up partially due to the fact that we had lower recoveries in the C&I portfolio that added about $5 million of additional charge-off over what we have been experiencing. So we had quite a number of factors that would have resulted in the higher provision this quarter."

As you know, the FirstMerit acquisition closed on August 16. Under the terms of the acquisition agreement, shareholders of FirstMerit received 1.72 shares of Huntington common stock and $5 in cash for each share of Huntington -- of FirstMerit common stock. The aggregate purchase price was $3.7 billion, including $0.8 billion of cash, $2.8 billion of common stock and $0.1 billion of preferred stock. Huntington issued 284 million shares of common stock that had a total fair value of $2.8 billion based on the closing market price of $9.68 per share on August 15, 2016. 
We are extremely pleased with the progress we are making in bringing the 2 companies together as one. We believe the combination strengthens our company by improving efficiency, accelerating our long-term growth rate and driving a higher return profile. We are excited to have the opportunity to introduce our strong recognizable brand, differentiated product set and industry-leading customer service in new geographies and to new customers. Integration is moving along as expected and our new colleagues are embracing our Fair Play philosophy and welcome culture. 
Turning to Slide 3. Let's review the financial highlights of our third quarter. Huntington reported earnings per common share of $0.11, inclusive of $0.11 per share of significant items related to the FirstMerit acquisition, which also impacted the financial metrics I will highlight on this slide. Tangible book value per share decreased 6% from the year ago quarter to $6.48 per share. Return on tangible common equity was 7%, while return on assets was 0.58%. Except where noted, all comparisons to previous quarters are inclusive of FirstMerit, but I want to emphasize that core organic performance continued to meet our expectations. 
Compared with third quarter of 2015, revenue grew by 24%, with net interest income up 26% and noninterest income up 19%. Noninterest expense increased $186 million or 35% year-over-year. Noninterest expense adjusted for the year-over-year change in significant items increased $70 million or 14% year-over-year, reflecting the addition of FirstMerit, the accelerated buildout of our in-store channel last fall and ongoing technology investments. 
Our reported efficiency ratio for the quarter was 75%. However, the acquisition related expense stemming from the FirstMerit transaction added 17 percentage points to the efficiency ratio. While revenue strength in the quarter, including mortgage banking, capital markets and a large interest recovery, combined with a $4 million expense benefit from retiring trust preferred debt, lowered the core efficiency ratio by approximately 150 basis points. We are pleased with the progress toward achieving our long-term efficiency ratio goal of 56% to 59%.
Balance sheet growth in the third quarter showed continued organic strength, which was enhanced by the addition of FirstMerit's loan and deposit base. Average total loans grew 24% year-over-year, with growth excluding FirstMerit coming in at 8%. Average core deposits grew 22% year-over-year with average core deposit growth excluding FirstMerit registering 3%. 
Our third quarter credit performance reflects Huntington's commitment to an aggregate moderate to low risk profile. Net charge-offs of 26 basis points remain below our long-term financial target of 35 to 55 basis points. Nonperforming assets improved 21 basis points to 0.72% compared with the linked quarter. Criticized assets and delinquencies have remained in a relatively tight range for the past several quarters. Our common equity tier 1 ratio decreased 63 basis points year-over-year and 71 basis points linked quarter to 9.09%, reflecting the impact of the FirstMerit transaction.
Turning to Slide 4, and getting more in depth with the income statement. Net interest income was up 26% from year ago quarter as were average earning assets, reflecting strong organic loan growth and the impact of the FirstMerit acquisition. The net interest margin for the quarter came in at 3.18%, up 2 basis points from the year ago quarter and up 12 basis points on a linked quarter basis. Purchase accounting had a favorable impact of 12 basis points on the margin, and we had an interest recovery in the quarter that added an additional 2 basis points.
Noninterest income increased $49 million or 19% from the year ago quarter, primarily driven by the addition of FirstMerit, but also driven by strong organic growth in mortgage banking, service charges on deposit accounts and capital markets. Noninterest expense increased $186 million or 35% from a year ago, with significant items accounting for $116 million (sic) [ $160 million ] of the increase. After adjusting for significant items, noninterest expense increased 14%, primarily reflecting the impact of bringing FirstMerit on for 1.5 months in the current quarter. 
I want to reiterate our confidence in achieving the $255 million in total annual expense savings that we communicated when we announced the transaction. All the cost savings are identified, being executed against and will be implemented within 1 year of the deal closing, with vast majority implemented prior to, or coincident with, the branch and systems conversion over Presidents' Day weekend in the first quarter of 2017.
In total, we plan to consolidate 103 branches or roughly 9% of the combined post-divestiture branch network. In addition, in connection with our normal periodic review of our distribution network, we will be consolidating 9 legacy Huntington branches unrelated to the FirstMerit acquisition during the first quarter of 2017.
Turning to Slide 5. Let's review operating leverage. As you would expect, the combined entity has significant positive operating leverage through 9 months. Positive operating leverage remains an important annual financial goal, which we delivered on in 2013, 2014 and 2015, and of course, we expect to deliver again in 2016. 
Turning to Slide 6. Let's look at balance sheet trends. Average total loans grew 24% year-over-year with growth excluding FirstMerit coming in at 8%. As you can see from the chart on the left side of the page, the addition of FirstMerit has not had a material impact on the earning asset mix. The chart on the right side of the page illustrates how the addition of FirstMerit has increased the proportion of low-cost DDA in our funding mix. Average securities increased 32% year-over-year, primarily reflecting the addition of $7.4 billion from FirstMerit, additional investment in LCR Level 1 qualifying securities and growth in direct purchase municipal securities in our Commercial Banking segment. Our liquidity coverage ratio was approximately 110% at quarter end. Average total debt increased $2.9 billion or 42% as a result of the issuance of $3.3 billion in senior debt over the past 5 quarters. 
Turning to Slide 7. As previously discussed, we have continued to evaluate opportunities to optimize the balance sheet and while not affecting quarterly average balances, approximately $2.6 billion of total loans and leases comprised of $1.5 billion of auto loans, $1 billion of predominantly non-relationship C&I loans and leases and $1 billion of predominantly non-relationship CRE loans were moved to loans held for sale at the end of the third quarter. We are taking these actions to improve risk weighted asset efficiency, and specific to the C&I and CRE assets, to free up capital that was not generating acceptable returns. Regarding the $1.5 billion of auto loans moved to held for sale, our intention is to securitize these assets in the fourth quarter of 2016. 
Let me emphasize that we remain steadfast in our commitment to our auto finance business, including our well-established strategy, which is built upon deep long-term relationships with our core dealer customers and a focus on prime and super prime indirect lending. However, we're reducing our indirect auto concentration limit back down to 150% of capital, and we are adopting an operating guideline of 125% of capital. You might remember that in mid-2015, before we had an agreement in place with FirstMerit, we increased our indirect auto concentration limit to 175% of capital. Given the larger capital base of the new combined organization, we do not foresee any circumstance in which we would grow our indirect auto portfolio anywhere close to the 175% of capital. In addition, with the new 125% operating guideline in mind, we expect to return to the securitization markets on an annual basis going forward.
Moving to Slide 8. Our net interest margin was 3.18% for the third quarter, up 2 basis points from the year ago quarter. This increase reflected a 10 basis point increase in earning asset yields, a 2 basis point increase in the benefit from noninterest bearing deposits and a 10 basis point increase in funding costs. Loan yields improved 16 basis points year-over-year, while securities yields declined to 12 basis points. The increase in funding costs was almost entirely driven by the impact of the debt issuances over the past 5 quarters as the cost of deposits was unchanged year-over-year. On a linked quarter basis, the net interest margin increased by 12 basis points driven by an 11 basis point improvement in earning asset yields and a 1 basis point decrease in the cost of interest bearing liabilities.
Purchase accounting contributed 12 basis points to the margin in the third quarter. Adjusting for the impact of purchase accounting, the core net interest margins was 3.06% or unchanged from the prior quarter. In addition, similar to what we have seen in recent quarters, one large interest recovery added 2 basis points to the margin during the third quarter. Finally, as we communicated previously, core NIM will stay above 3% in every quarter of 2016. 
Slide 9 illustrates the impact of our capital ratios of effectively deploying capital through the acquisition of FirstMerit. Tangible common equity ended the quarter at 7.14%, down 75 basis points year-over-year and 82 basis points linked quarter. Common equity tier 1 ended the quarter at 9.09%, down 63 basis points year-over-year and down 71 basis points sequentially. 
Referring to Slide 10, we booked provision expense of $64 million compared to net charge-offs of $40 million. The higher provision expense compared to the prior quarter was the result of a higher level of net charge-offs, organic loan growth and incremental reserves on the legacy FirstMerit portfolio and excess of the credit mark due to the rate mark partially offsetting the credit mark on certain portfolios. In addition, there was approximately $10 million incremental loan loss provision expense in the third quarter associated with the previously discussed movement of loans held for sale. Net charge-offs, while higher, represented an annualized 26 basis points of average loans and leases, which remains below our long-term target of 35 to 55 basis points. The allowance for credit losses as a percentage of loans decreased to 1.06%, reflecting the addition of the FirstMerit loan portfolio to the denominator without additional reserves being added to the numerator due to the credit mark applied through the purchase accounting process. The nonaccrual loan coverage ratio increased to 174% as a result of the continued decline in nonaccrual loans.
On Slide 11, the asset quality metrics remain favorable in the quarter as indicated. The nonperforming asset ratio decreased further reaching its lowest level in 2 years at 0.72%. The criticized asset ratio increased modestly to 3.54% but has remained in the 3.5% range for the past several quarters. Delinquencies were also well controlled having remained relatively flat for the past 6 quarters. 
Let me now turn the presentation over to Steve."
278614,402970443,1069330,"Huntington Bancshares Incorporated, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2016",2016-10-26,"Earnings Calls","Huntington Bancshares Incorporated","Executives","Thanks, Mac. Normally, at this point, in our quarterly discussion, I would provide you with an update on our optimal customer relationship, or OCR, strategy. However, we've removed those slides from the presentation this quarter given the recent addition",1200,"Thanks, Mac. Normally, at this point, in our quarterly discussion, I would provide you with an update on our optimal customer relationship, or OCR, strategy. However, we've removed those slides from the presentation this quarter given the recent addition of FirstMerit and our inability to produce similar data for legacy FirstMerit customers. We believe providing OCR data for just legacy Huntington customers would not provide you with a complete picture. 
Let me assure you though that we remain fully committed to our Fair Play philosophy and OCR strategy, which is built upon the simple thesis that putting customers first, looking out for their needs and doing the right thing will result in more substantial, long-term customer relationships. Now for years we've focused on customer acquisition and relationship deepening with our Fair Play banking philosophy and our OCR strategy. While this was considered a contrarian approach when we started these actions back in 2009 and '10, the results paint a picture of resounding success, and I want to stress that we are not just seeking relationship growth, but indeed are looking to deepen existing relationships. 
Our OCR strategy is also built upon the fundamental belief that we are here to understand and serve our customers’ needs. The Fair Play banking philosophy starts with doing the right thing for our customers with products and services that are simple, clear and fair. We couple that with a customer experience designed to fit their needs, not ours. For us, this strategy has remained consistent since it was put in place in 2010 and it continues to bear fruit. 
In light of the recent headlines, some of you have asked about our sales and incentive compensation practices and complaint management, particularly with respect to our OCR strategy. The focus of our OCR model is on building deep, trusted and lasting relationships, and this is achieved by getting to know our customers, understanding their needs and helping them meet their financial needs with the appropriate products and services. Further, Huntington as a company built upon a distinguished legacy of superior customer service. Our Fair Play philosophy and welcome culture are built upon the premise and promise of doing the right thing for our customers. 
As you'd expect, given the investor meeting and regulatory interest in this matter, we've undertaken a detailed review of our practices, policies and procedures for any signs of misalignment of incentives or other areas of risk or concern. And while the review is ongoing, to date, we've not uncovered any systemic cultural or operational areas of concern. We will likely refine some of our monitoring, but we do not anticipate any material changes to our practices or procedures, and certainly not to our overall OCR strategy. 
Moving to the economy, Slide 12, contains what we feel to be some of the more meaningful economic indicators for our footprint. The bottom left chart illustrates trends in the unemployment rates across our now 8 core Midwestern states. As you can see, the majority of our footprint remains at or below the national unemployment rates relative to the national average with Ohio, Michigan, Indiana and Wisconsin particularly showing resilience this past quarter. The charts on the top and bottom right show coincident and leading economic indicators for the region. The bottom chart, which shows leading indexes for our footprint as of August, show that all 8 states in our footprint expect positive economic growth over the next 6 months. 
Slide 13 focuses on trends and unemployment rates in our largest metropolitan areas, and many of the large MSAs in the footprint remain at or near 15-year lows for unemployment at the end of August. Also notable, 11 of the top 15 MSAs experienced declining unemployment rates in the last 3 months. The auto industry is still strong and is a major economic contributor within our footprint, but the housing markets are also strong. Labor market in our footprint has proven to be strong in 2016 with several markets, such as here at Columbus, where we are at structural full employment. We are seeing wage inflation in our expense base and our customers are too. State and local governments continue to operate with surpluses. Ohio, Indiana and Michigan continue to outpace overall U.S. growth since the recovery. We remain confident in our footprint Midwest economies based on the sustained job growth and economic production since the recovery that began after the great recession. 
Turning to Slide 14. I'd like to give you some closing remarks and important messages. We remain focused on delivering consistent through the cycle, shareholder returns. The strategy entails reducing short-term volatility, achieving top tier performance over the long term and maintaining our aggregate moderate to low risk profile throughout. As you heard Mac mention earlier, the acquisition and integration of FirstMerit provides what we believe is an opportunity to achieve significant cost savings and improve our overall efficiency. We're committed to and progressing as planned toward realizing our targeted $255 million of annual cost savings from the acquisition. We continue to win new customers through a strong and recognizable consumer brand with differentiated products and superior customer service. The new customers and dynamic markets offered from the FirstMerit acquisition provide a deeper and more vibrant pool to deliver our value proposition and add customers and deepen relationships. We have invested and will continue to invest in our businesses, particularly around enhanced sales management, mobile and digital technologies, data analytics and optimizing our retail distribution network. 
Importantly, we plan to continue to manage our expenses appropriately within our revenue outlook. We always like to include a reminder that there's a high level of alignment between the board, management, our employees and our shareholders. The board and our colleagues are collectively among the largest shareholders of Huntington. We uphold to retirement requirements on certain shares and are appropriately focused on driving sustained long-term performance. We're highly focused on our commitment to being good stewards of shareholder capital. 
Looking forward to full year 2016 results, excluding the impact of significant items, we expect total revenues to increase 16% to 18% and noninterest expenses to increase 13% to 15%. We expect to deliver positive operating leverage for the fourth consecutive year. We expect asset quality metrics to remain near current levels, including net charge-offs remaining below our long-term target of 35 to 55 basis points. Now consistent with our historical practice, we anticipate we'll provide initial expectations for 2017 at an investor conference later this quarter. Finally, we're very pleased with the smooth integration process with FirstMerit, which we acquired on August 16. The divestiture of 13 branches, primarily in the Canton, Ohio market, will occur this quarter. We've completed the onboarding and initial training of our new colleagues and fully implemented the organizational changes for the combined entity that we announced last summer. 103 branch consolidations will occur coincident with the branch conversion in February of 2017. Our systems conversion planning efforts continue to progress as our IT teams have completed all product and data mapping and are now managing system testing and preparing for mock conversions. 
So I'll now turn it back over to Mark so we can get to your questions. Thank you."

First, we did have higher charge-offs than what we have been experiencing, although still below our long-term expectation. So replenishing the $40 million of charge-offs was one piece of that. Second, as you've already noted, we had the movement of loans to held for sale. We also had the organic originations from FirstMerit post closing, so the new loans that are generated have allowance associated with them. And then we did have a portfolio where we had a positive rate mark that offset the credit mark, so it's recorded at a premium. So we have allowance billed there. So I wouldn't say that this is a situation where this is the new normal. I think this was a bit of an outlier and I think on a go-forward basis, we will have provision expense that is more in line with charge-offs and with an allowance for some growth. I also would note that in the quarter, charge-offs were up partially due to the fact that we had lower recoveries in the C&I portfolio, that added about $5 million of additional charge-off over what we have been experiencing. So we had quite a number of factors that would have resulted in the higher provision this quarter."

We are comfortable with the core margins staying above 3% for the remainder of the year. And I think it's also important to note that, on a core basis, FirstMerit was accretive to the core margin simply because of asset mix and the fact that they brought more DDA to the funding mix as well."

We're not going to be a national player in auto. We like the geography that we're in. We like the business model that we have in place. We're not going to change the underwriting or the risk profile. And quite frankly, as we bring on FirstMerit, we have other opportunities to invest capital at higher returns. So that's primarily why we did it. We've always been at 150 historically, and we just feel that operating at 125 gives us flexibility to perhaps go over 125 from a timing perspective if we're getting the securitization done and we don't like the market conditions, we can hold a bit above 125 until we like the market conditions.
