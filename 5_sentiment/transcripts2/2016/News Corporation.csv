The quarter present the challen",1814,"Thank you, Mike. Newsgroups evolving rapidly into a more digital and increasingly global company with a diverse revenue mix that we resolutely believe will drive long-term growth in revenue, profits and shareholder returns. The quarter present the challenges with a still uncertain macroeconomic environment and foreign exchange volatility, but we believe in the enduring value of our prestigious brands and the sound logic of our digital strategy. 
Revenues fell 4% to $2.2 billion, and reported total segment EBITDA declined 20% to $280 million. EBITDA for the quarter includes legal and transaction costs, which Bedi will momentarily explain in detail.
However, excluding the effects of ForEx fluctuations, revenues would actually have grown 2% versus the prior year as the successful integration of realtor.com and growth of REA contributed materially to our performance. As that's appropriate in examining individual segments that we begin with Digital Real Estate Services, in which by most measures we have become the world's largest player over the past 12 months. The position will be further enhanced by the imminent closing of REA's acquisition of iProperty, the preeminent digital property company in Southeast Asia. We are particularly pleased by the early returns of Move, which we acquired just over a year ago, and realtor.com network has become the fastest-growing player in the still emerging U.S. digital real estate market. 
For the quarter, average monthly unique users increased by 37% year-over-year, driven by $0.57 surge in mobile users. For the month of January, we recorded 50 million monthly uniques compared to 30 million in the month before we acquired realtor in late 2014.
We are significantly ahead of schedule and revenue growth and in the trajectory of EBITDA for Move. Even with the investment required to enhance the site, we firmly expect positive EBITDA for this fiscal year. That result will not come at the expense of investment in the product or the brand and should be the harbinger of increasing EBITDA in coming years. For the most recent quarter alone, revenues at Move, the parent of realtor.com, expanded 35% year-over-year on a stand-alone basis, while user engagement continued to grow briskly with page use 34% higher at 1.1 billion views and minutes spent on the site increasing 47% year-over-year. In December, we launched a renovated realtor.com site, which is more user and mobile friendly, and we expect to unveil several new products for realtors in coming months, including enhanced listings and extra focus on delivering our cherished clients more and better quality leads. We also fashioned a partnership with that will add many thousands of rental listings and provide a new pipeline of customers who, ideally, will ultimately graduate to being home buyers. 
Meanwhile in Australia, REA group continues to thrive, with revenues expanding more than 30%, excluding the impact of foreign currency, thanks to the broader penetration of premium products. The REA audience in Australia is over twice the size of its nearest competitor in a market that is clearly at a different phase of growth to that of the U.S. Importantly, we are now in a position to share learnings, mobile, software and display modules across our global digital property platforms to ensure that we optimize the experience for users and the revenue for our company. 
Elsewhere in Australia, Fox Sports was affected materially by currency moves, which masked a strong underlying performance. The nature of the business is that the large audiences generated by showcase events such as the rugby World Cup in which Australia's performance exceeded modest expectations are accompanied by increased acquisition and production costs. However, advertising during the quarter rose almost 30% in local currency, far exceeding the level of most Australian brokers. Meanwhile Foxtel, weather has been significant investment in marketing and product reported a moderating of the rate of EBITDA decline and improving revenue growth in local currency. As stated, is cleared. The drive subscriber growth and to highlight the potential customers, the superior value of the product compared to other competitors in Australia like Netflix, which has a markedly inferior offering to that of Foxtel. It's worth noting that churn hit a new record low level at Foxtel this quarter at just over 10%. Sport is a crucial offering, particularly in Australia. And in the most recent quarter, Foxtel and Fox Sports extended their rights to the National Rugby League, which along with rules are the dominant sports in the country. Fox Sports will have specialized channels for both sports as we have now secured rights until 2022. We see these long-term rights as a robust foundation for the expansion of Foxtel and Fox Sports over the coming decade. Foxtel also completed the acquisition of an approximate 48% equity stake in Network during the quarter. ad sales are being integrated into the MCN ad sales venture, creating a unified ad sales network across free-to-air and subscription TV that is already gaining real traction. Ad agencies in Australia strongly endorse the MCN 10 model and Foxtel season ongoing opportunity to drive incremental advertising growth across these powerful platforms.
In our News and Information Services segment, Australian advertising remained challenged, but we are seeing encouraging signs in subscriptions and a more balanced revenue mix. Circulation revenues are up against the quarter, excluding currency, due in part to higher initial subsequent markets, nearly offsetting print volume declines. We are actively focused on costs. In this past quarter, we implemented a cost reduction program across most of the businesses, which will begin to show benefit this quarter. News.com maintained its lead as the #1 news portal in Australia and has become a valuable platform to drive revenues, delivering around 52 million extra visits throughout Australia last year. In the U.K, we are also reducing cost at our while renewing direct relationships with advertisers to maximize revenue. We are delighted with the integration of Unruly, the social and viral ad platform we recently acquired. It is working with our businesses around the world and particularly, with our U.K. baskets to deliver high-quality advertising to our properties and to reduce our alliance on third parties. Unruly's cutting edge metrics and contemporary culture are infusing energy and creativity into the quarter business. Digital transformation is well underway where we recently removed the table and are relaunching the sire March, optimize the video and mobile, which is self-evidently growing the platform. We are also diversifying our revenue base and monetizing is valuable brand. This quarter, we signed 2 licensing deals with Playtex on Bingo and its higher-margin revenue streams will begin flowing in May, just ahead of the European championships in June and in good time for the next English soccer season. The Times of London may have been founded in 1785, but it continues to prosper in 2016, gaining in market share and expanding its circulation revenues base of the continuing success of its digital offerings which we'll be able to expand internationally at little incremental cost. That extended the lead as we had discovered with The Wall Street Journal, is an extremely dark desirable demographic that is difficult to reach on social media and has strong affinity for The Times and The Sunday Times. At The Wall Street Journal, advertising year-on-year was softer, but the early signs for the current quarter are more positive. It's worth pointing out that the real estate categories showed significant strength this quarter, primarily driven in digital by the recent launch of Mansion Global and in print by the Mansion Residential section, highlighting the value that News Corp brings to realtors and the efficacy of the relationship with realtor.com. We believe these complementary platforms are clearly worth more than some of the sum of their parts. Overall, digital now accounts to nearly 50% of revenues at Dow Jones with strong growth in the risk and compliance segment of our professional information business and healthy progress in the pursuit of 3 million subscriptions at WSJ and Barron's within 3 years. Specifically at the Journal, there was an 18% year-on-year growth in Digital early subscriptions for the most recent reported quarter, reaching 819,000 subscribers. As well, ARPU is on the rise. So these are not deeply discounted inevitably for subscribers. I would also point out that the Dow Jones financial site, MarketWatch, set a new traffic record in January with more than 23.3 million unique visitors. MarketWatch also had 1.2 million video starts for the month, which is a more than 460% jump year-over-year, while total visits to the site were a record 60.1 million. In other business, News America Marketing showed healthy domestic in-store and digital revenue growth while experiencing declines in revenues due to challenges in the very competitive SSI business. Sluggish economic growth and the squeeze by many families around the country mean that there is a strong appetite discount, which explains our optimism for the prospects of Checkout 51, our recently acquired digital coupon company. We began a fresh round of marketing for a Checkout 51 in January, and downloads of the app have risen sharply. The weekly rate of new memberships in the U.S. and Canada has tripled in the past month to 70,000, giving Checkout 51 more than 5 million members to date. We are using our powerful platform including realtor.com to drive adoption of the app. That larger audience will give us the scale to surface better offers from consumer goods companies, which in turn will make the apps stickier and more attractive will literally can upload the receipts and receive cash back. At HarperCollins, the integration of Harlequin continues to pace, providing us with a global publishing platform, including best-selling authors, Karen and Daniel Silver, who have successfully published almost 200 HarperCollins titles today in foreign languages across more than 18 countries. Comparisons with last year were naturally made more difficult because the blockbuster success of the Divergent trilogy, which was also a powerful performer as an e-book, given the genre. Teen fiction overindexes digitally. Print sales actually rose during the period but not enough to offset the decline in digital, a softness that other publishers have also reported and is an industry-wide issue.
In conclusion, while macroeconomic conditions and currency trends were inauspicious this quarter, we believe our core strategy to become a more deeply digital company with a particular emphasis on mobile is certainly on track. Our acquisitions are enhancing that capability, whether it be Storyful with mobile mobile video or Unruly with its social sensibility or the acquisition with its digital property prowess in East Asia. We are particularly pleased that realtor.com has been transformed. And through its success, it's transforming characters at News Corp. We have significant toil ahead, but we see a clearly defined pathway to a more digital future and increased profitability, which will be to the benefit of our investors.
With that, I'll turn the floor and the rest of the room to our CFO, Bedi Singh to expedite the numbers."

First,  I'd like to share some high-level highlights for the second quarter, and then we'll go into each segment in further detail. We reported fiscal '16 second quarter total revenues of $2.2 billion, down 4% from the prior year period. As Robert noted, we were again impacted by currency headwinds, primarily the weaker Australian dollar, which negatively impacted Q2 total revenue by $141 million or 6%. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, acquisitions and divestitures, adjusted revenue declined only 1% compared to the prior year. We reported total segment EBITDA of $280 million compared to the prior year period of $352 million, exiting the impact of Digital Education segment in both periods. Currency fluctuations impacted total reported segment EBITDA by $25 million or 7%. Reported segment EBITDA this quarter includes 7 million of legal costs related to the U.K. newspaper mattress, net of indemnification, as well as $5 million of onetime transaction costs related to the Unruly acquisition, which closed on September 30, and as reflected in the News and Information Services segment.
For the quarter, adjusted EPS from continuing operations were $0.20 versus $0.30 in the prior year. Reported EPS from continuing operations were $0.15 compared to $0.27 in the prior year. Now let's turn to the individual operating segments. In News and Information Services, revenues for the quarter declined $123 million, down 8% versus the prior year period. More than 70% of their decline was related to the impact of foreign currency. Adjusted segment revenues declined 4%. Within segment revenues, advertising declined around 12% or about 6% in local currency due to weakness in print, partially offset by strong digital ad growth across each business unit. Circulations of subscription revenue declined 5% but were actually up 1% in local currency due to higher consumer circulation revenues in the U.S. and Australia, combined with improvements at Dow Jones professional information business. We saw a slight decline in the U.K. due to the removal of the Sun payroll in November. Looking at performance across the key units and Dow Jones domestic advertising of The Wall Street Journal declined 5% versus the prior year quarter, due in part to tougher year ago comparisons in the financial category. Declines in print advertising were partially offset by solid growth in digital with strength in display mobile and video. Digital accounted for approximately 1/3 of ad revenues in this quarter. And overall, advertising trends at The Wall Street Journal are relatively stable.
Wall Street Journal circulation revenues grew mid-single digits this quarter due to higher subscription pricing, higher digital subscribers and relatively stable print volume. At professional information business, we saw positive net installs and year-over-year revenue growth absent currency for the second consecutive quarter. We also saw strong growth in risk and compliance and continued stability at 
At News Corp Australia advertising revenue for the quarter declined 26% or 11% in local currency, consistent with the last quarter as the market grows remain challenging across most categories. Print advertising decline were partially offset by strong growth in Digital in both the metro mastheads and news.com.au. Circulation revenues saw a double-digit decline in the prior year. But in local currency revenues rose low single digits due to cover price increases and higher digital subs. Importantly, revenues from digital paid subscribers nearly offset print volume declines.
Digital paid subscribers grew over 30% year-over-year to $268,000 newspapers and other publications are of the quarter end. Digital continues to increase its proportion of weekly circulation volume for all metro titles and for the Australian. And Digital now comprises over 40% of subscribers compared to the same period in the prior year. As we noted last quarter, we are actively addressing the cost structure in News Australia. The benefits of the initiatives implemented in the latter part the fiscal second quarter will begin to flow through from the beginning of the second half of this fiscal year and continue through fiscal 2017 to deliver a 5% annualized fixed cost reduction across most areas of the business.
At News UK, overall advertising revenue declined 12% or 8% in local currency, driven by weakness in print advertising, particularly at The Sun, led by the grocers and telecom providers.
The key management focus at News UK is on improving the performance of The Sun sun, particularly its digital proposition. The Sun changed its digital strategy and removed its payroll on November 30. Based on internal metrics, Sun's December unique users were over 14 million, relatively similar to pre-payroll levels. We expect that the site relaunch, as Robert referenced, to see higher audience levels and improved revenues in the coming quarters.
In Q2, The Times and Sunday Times continued to gain market share with growth and circulation revenues and stable volume, including 172,000 digital-only subscribers as of the quarter end, representing more than 40% off total paid subscribers.
News UK also continues to look very closely at its cost base, focusing on corporate overhead costs and streamlining of their business processes. The News America Marketing revenue declined 3% versus the prior year quarter, although a sequential improvement from Q1. SSI remains weak but was largely offset the growth and domestic install and in digital advertising. News America Marketing is focused on integrating Checkout 51. It's recently acquired digital and mobile coupon company and expanding its user base. Checkout 51 is a data-rich platform of transactions, which has the potential to be leveraged across News Corp's portfolio of companies.
Outlook for the fiscal third quarter for the SSI business remains particularly challenging, and we are also planning additional investments in Checkout 51 to drive membership. For the quarter, News and Information Services segment EBITDA declined 27% as compared to the prior year period, and adjusted segment EBITDA was down 22%. We experienced higher marketing and retail promotion expenses that News UK of around $17 million, primarily related to competitive pricing pressure, but we expect that, that should moderate materially next quarter. Reported segment EBITDA includes $5 million for transaction costs, related to the acquisition of Unruly, as I noted earlier, and $5 million of legal expenses at News America Marketing ongoing litigations.
Turning to the Book Publishing segment. Revenues decreased 5% and segment EBITDA declined 26% versus the prior year. Declines were due to lower e-book volume across the marketplace. Similar to the fourth quarter and tougher year-ago Divergent comps and some FX headwinds. To call out this quarter included Ree Drummond to The Pioneer Woman Cooks and Jesus 
Total digital revenues for the quarter was 16% of consumer revenues, down from 19% the prior year, partially due to the Divergent series, which sold around 600,000 units this quarter versus approximately 1.5 million units in Q2 last year. It's also worth noting that for our fiscal third quarter, we will continue to have tough comps against higher Divergent sales in that the prior year of 2.3 million units and additionally around to putting 7 million units of American cycle.
In Digital real estate services, total segment revenues increased $54 million or 35% to $208 million. Segment EBITDA was $73 million, up 28% compared to the prior year period as improving operating results at REA group were partially offset by foreign currency fluctuations. Excluding foreign currency and reflecting the inclusion of half a quarter's results of Move, adjusted revenue and adjusted EBITDA grew 22% and 19%, respectively. Arias revenues grew 20% in local currency, and EBITDA increased at an high rate of local currency due to higher listing product attrition. The acquisition of the remaining shares of property doesn't already own for approximately AUD 480 million or USD 340 million should close in mid-February. REA expects to incur roughly USD 5 million in transaction cost in the second half related to this acquisition. iProperty will be consolidated into REA commencing this quarter and is expected to have no material impact on News Corp's EPS for the current fiscal year. REA will be reporting its half-year results shortly after this call.
segment results include $87 million in revenues from Move. Move generated mid-single-digit EBITDA, excluding stock-based compensation in the quarter. Results for Move also included around $4 million of legal expenses for our litigation against Zillow, and we remain on track with our expectations to be EBITDA positive for this fiscal year. On a stand-alone basis, Move's revenue would've grown 35% versus the prior year quarter, the highest rate of growth since the acquisition last November and 2.5x the rate of growth seen in Q2 of last fiscal year. The improvement was led again by the collections for co-brokerage product, and near doubling of non-listing ad revenues benefiting from the successful integration into the Dow Jones program exchange, higher margins levels and higher CPMs. We are also continuing to see healthy increases in our agent and broker customer numbers. Unique user growth remained strong, up 37% to 39 million average for fiscal second quarter, a bit lower than the prior quarter due to seasonality. And this has increased to 15 million in January, which has been a record month. Page views and minutes both accelerated versus the prior quarter. We also saw year-over-year and sequential improvement in Move's software and services business led by increase in subscribers through its top producer CRM product.
At Cable Network Programming, revenues decreased by $6 million or 5% compared to the prior year quarter but on a currency adjusted basis, revenues increased 10%. Subscription revenues were down 7% as higher affiliate fees and subscriber gains were more than offset by FX headwinds. Excluding currency, subscriber revenues were around 7%, helped by mid-single-digit subscriber growth.
Advertising revenue grew 7% benefit from -- benefiting from the Rugby Royal Cup and the motorsport properties combined with higher underlying market share. In local currency terms, advertising revenues grew 29%. Segment EBITDA in the quarter fell 28% due to negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations and the expected higher programming rights cost related to the Rugby World Cup of around USD 11 million. In December last year, News Corp Australia in conjunction with Fox Sports Australia announced that it has secured a new 5-year deal with the national Rugby League with the 2018 through 2022 seasons. Fox Sports Australia also announced the extension of rugby unions for 2020. These new contracts combined with a recent extension of the NFL means that Fox Sports and Foxtel have long-term visibility and security, the most important sports rights in Australia. On the NRL, beginning with the 2016 season, Fox Sports will broadcast all games live including 3 matches per week that will be simulcast with network. This will cost incremental approximately USD 10 million with first second half of this fiscal year. This additional cost though will be completely offset by cost savings from the lapping of the Asian cup and the Cricket World Cup from last year.
With respect to earnings from affiliates, Foxtel ended the quarter with approximately 2.9 million total subscribers with cable and satellite subscribers increasing over 7% compared to the prior year period and higher subs despite increasing competition from players. In the quarter, cable and satellite showed an improved [indiscernible] to 10.3% from 11.8% in the prior year. ARPU has remained relatively steady since the new pricing initiative, but as expected, it's down mid-single digits compared to the prior year. Foxtel revenues for the quarter local currency were up 5%, an improvement from the prior quarter, and EBITDA declined at a sequentially lower rate of 7%, mainly due to planned higher programming costs, primarily sports rights and fees and the unexpected increase in cost associated with higher sales volume and the launch of Triple Play and continued marketing investment in Presto.
Turning to loss from discontinued operations. This quarter we incurred a net loss of $24 million, which includes $72 million in severance and lease termination costs as part of the sale of the Insight and Learning businesses. We expect very minimal cost going forward to maintain support for the tablet business and expect these to conclude by the end of fiscal 2016.
In summary, while we faced challenges this quarter notably at the News and Information Services segment and in Book Publishing, compounded by continued currency headwinds, we continue to invest in products including the integration of Unruly and Checkout 51 as Rob mentioned. We are driving higher visibility subs and audience across our key trends and building our additional revenue streams. We are actively addressing our cost base particularly focused in Australia and the U.K. and we expect to see these benefits flow through from the second half onwards.
We continue to aggressively focus on visible real estate, and we believe that Move and REA group will be core pillars of profitability for the future. We have extended our real estate reach and expertise through small investments in India and through REA's investment in Southeast Asia, magnified by its planned acquisition of high property and have also solidified our portfolio at Fox Sports Australia and Foxtel and have long-term visibility with the most valuable domestic sports.
We believe that the steps we have been taking continue to position News Corp to drive long-term value per share. We are pivoting the company into faster growth segments and will continue to reinvest and be balanced with capital returns.
And with that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A."

I'm not going to speculate about the possible outcome other than to say that should be holistic reflect the reality of contemporary digital age of our Australian markets.

Of course, a consequence has a cost-cutting cost, a short-term cost and a long-term benefit. But we're not being defeatist about the power of those platforms. They are very powerful platforms. And so we will continue to invest in his additional development, and we continue to believe that print has a future as a powerful platform. For example, if you look at all the angst ad blockers. Ad blockers don't work for newspapers, and you have 100% durability. So the relative power of print as a platform as part of our portfolio remains constant.

News Corp's evolving rapidly into a more digital and increasingly global company with a diverse revenue mix that we resolutely believe will drive long-term growth in revenue, profits and shareholder returns. The quarter presented challeng",1862,"Thank you, Mike. News Corp's evolving rapidly into a more digital and increasingly global company with a diverse revenue mix that we resolutely believe will drive long-term growth in revenue, profits and shareholder returns. The quarter presented challenges with a still uncertain macroeconomic environment and foreign exchange volatility, but we believe in the enduring value of our prestigious brands and the sound logic of our digital strategy.
Revenues fell 4% to $2.2 billion and reported total segment EBITDA declined 20% to $280 million. EBITDA for the quarter includes legal and transaction costs, which Bedi will momentarily explain in detail. However, excluding the effects of ForEx fluctuations, revenues would actually have grown 2% versus the prior year as the successful integration of realtor.com and growth of REA contributed materially to our performance.
If that's appropriate in examining the individual segments, then we begin with Digital Real Estate Services, in which, by most measures, we have become the world's largest player over the past 12 months. The position will be further enhanced by the imminent closing of REA's acquisition of iProperty, the preeminent digital property company in Southeast Asia. We are particularly pleased by the early returns of Move, which we acquired just over a year ago and whose realtor.com network has become the fastest-growing player in the still emerging U.S. digital real estate market.
For the quarter, average monthly unique users increased by 37% year-over-year, driven by a 57% surge in mobile users. For the month of January, we recorded 50 million monthly uniques compared to 30 million in the month before we acquired realtor in late 2014.
We are significantly ahead of schedule and revenue growth and in the trajectory of EBITDA for Move. Even with the investment required to enhance the site, we firmly expect positive EBITDA for this fiscal year. That result will not come at the expense of investment in the product or the brand and should be the harbinger of increasing EBITDA in coming years.
For the most recent quarter alone, revenues at Move, the parent of realtor.com, expanded 35% year-over-year on a stand-alone basis, while user engagement continued to grow briskly with page views 34% higher at 1.1 billion views and minutes spent on the site increasing 47% year-over-year. In December, we launched a renovated realtor.com site, which is more user- and mobile-friendly, and we expect to unveil several new products for realtors in coming months, including enhanced listings and extra focus on delivering our cherished clients more and better quality buyer leads. We also fashioned a partnership with CoStar that will add many thousands of rental listings and provide a new pipeline of customers who ideally will ultimately graduate to being home buyers.
Meanwhile, in Australia, REA Group continues to thrive, with revenues expanding by more than 30%, excluding the impact of foreign currency, thanks to the broader penetration of premium products. The REA audience in Australia is over twice the size of its nearest competitor in a market that is clearly at a different phase of growth to that of the U.S. Importantly, we are now in a position to share learnings, mobile, software and display modules across our global digital property platforms to ensure that we optimize the experience for users and the revenue for our company.
Elsewhere in Australia, Fox Sports was affected materially by currency movements, which masked a strong underlying performance. The nature of the business is that the large audiences generated by showcase events, such as the Rugby World Cup, in which Australia's performance exceeded our modest expectations are accompanied by increased acquisition and production costs. However, advertising during the quarter rose almost 30% in local currency, far exceeding the level of most Australian broadcasters.
Meanwhile, Foxtel, weather has been significant investment in marketing and product, reported a moderating of the rate of EBITDA decline and improving revenue growth in local currency. Our stated aim is clear, to drive subscriber growth and to highlight to potential customers the superior value of the product selection compared to SVOD other competitors in Australia like Netflix, which has a markedly inferior offering to that of Foxtel. It's worth noting that churn hit a near record low level at Foxtel this quarter at just over 10%.
Sport is patently a crucial offering, particularly in Australia. And in the most recent quarter, Foxtel and Fox Sports extended their rights to the National Rugby League, which, along with Aussie Rules, are the dominant sports in the country. Fox Sports will have specialist channels for both sports as we have now secured rights until 2022. We see these long-term rights as a robust foundation for the expansion of Foxtel and Fox Sports over the coming decade.
Foxtel also completed the acquisition of an approximate 48% equity stake in the Ten Network during the quarter. Ten's ad sales are being integrated into the MCN ad sales venture, creating a unified ad sales network across both free-to-air and subscription TV that is already gaining real traction. Ad agencies in Australia have strongly endorsed the MCN Ten model and Foxtel sees an ongoing opportunity to drive incremental advertising growth across these powerful platforms.
In our News and Information Services segment, Australian advertising remained challenged, but we are seeing encouraging signs in subscriptions and a more balanced revenue mix. Circulation revenues are up against the quarter, excluding currency, due in part to a higher digital subs across our mastheads, nearly offsetting print volume declines.
We are actively focused on costs. In this past quarter, we implemented a cost reduction program across most of the businesses, which will begin to show benefits this quarter. news.com.au maintained its lead as the #1 news portal in Australia and has become a valuable platform to drive revenues, delivering around 52 million extra visits to our sites last year.
In the U.K., we are also assiduously reducing cost at our mastheads while renewing direct relationships with advertisers to maximize revenue. We are delighted with the integration of Unruly, the social and viral ad platform we recently acquired. It is working with our businesses around the world and particularly with our U.K. mastheads to deliver high-quality advertising to our properties and to reduce our alliance on third parties. Unruly's cutting-edge metrics and contemporary culture are infusing energy and creativity into the broader business.
Digital transformation is well underway at The Sun, where we recently removed the paywall and are relaunching the site in March, optimized the video and mobile, which is self-evidently growing in potency as a platform. We are also diversifying our revenue base and monetizing this valuable Sun brand. This past quarter, our News UK has signed 2 licensing deals, with Playtech for Sun Bingo and Tabcorp for Sun Bets, to which higher-margin revenue streams will begin flowing in May, just ahead of the European soccer championships in June and in good time for the next English soccer season.
The Times of London may have been founded in 1785, but it continues to prosper in 2016, gaining in market share and expanding its circulation revenues, thanks to the continuing success of its digital offering, which we'll be able to expand internationally at little incremental cost. That extended a lead as we have discovered with The Wall Street Journal, is an extremely desirable demographic that is difficult to reach on social media and has strong affinity for The Times and The Sunday Times.
At The Wall Street Journal, advertising year-on-year was softer, but the early signs for the current quarter are more positive. It's worth pointing out that the real estate category showed significant ad strength this quarter, primarily driven in digital by the recent launch of Mansion Global and in print by the Mansion residential section, highlighting the value that News Corp brings to realtors and the efficacy of the relationship with realtor.com.
We believe these complementary platforms are clearly worth more than the sum of their parts. Overall, digital now accounts for nearly 50% of revenues at Dow Jones with strong growth in the risk and compliance segment of our professional information business and healthy progress in the pursuit of 3 million subscriptions at WSJ and Barron's within 3 years. Specifically at the Journal, there was an 18% year-on-year growth in digital-only subscriptions for the most recent reported quarter, reaching 819,000 subscribers. As well, ARPU is on the rise. So these are not deeply discounted, inevitably promiscuous subscribers.
I would also point out that the Dow Jones financial site MarketWatch set a new traffic record in January, with more than 23.3 million unique visitors. MarketWatch also had 1.2 million video starts for the month, which is a more than 460% jump year-over-year, while total visits to the site were a record 60.1 million.
In other business, News America Marketing showed healthy domestic in-store and digital revenue growth while experiencing declines in revenues due to challenges in the very competitive FSI business. Sluggish economic growth and the squeeze up [ph] by many families around the country mean that there is a strong appetite for discounts, which explains our optimism for the prospects of Checkout 51, our recently acquired digital coupon company.
We began a fresh round of marketing for a Checkout 51 in January, and downloads of the app have risen sharply. The weekly rate of new memberships in the U.S. and Canada has tripled in the past month to 70,000, giving Checkout 51 more than 5 million members to date. We are using our powerful platform, including realtor.com, to drive adoption of the app. That larger audience will give us the scale to surface better offers from consumer goods companies, which, in turn, will make the app stickier and more attractive for potential who literally can upload their receipts and receive cash back.
At HarperCollins, the integration of Harlequin continues to pace, providing us with a global publishing platform, including best-selling authors, Karen Slaughter and Daniel Silva, who have successfully published almost 200 HarperCollins titles today in foreign languages across more than 18 countries. Comparisons with last year were naturally made more difficult because of the blockbuster success of the Divergent trilogy, which was also a powerful performer as an e-book, given the genre. Teen fiction overindexes digitally. Print sales actually rose during the period, but not enough to offset the decline in digital, a softness that other publishers have also reported and is an industry-wide issue.
In conclusion, while macroeconomic conditions and currency trends were inauspicious this quarter, we believe our core strategy to become a more deeply digital company with a particular emphasis on mobile is certainly on track. Our acquisitions are enhancing that capability, whether it'd be Storyful with mobile video or Unruly with its social sensibility or the imminent acquisition of iProperty with its digital property prowess in East Asia. We are particularly pleased that realtor.com has been transformed. And through its success, it's transforming the character of News Corp. We have significant toil ahead, but we see a clearly defined pathway to a more digital future and increased profitability, which will be to the benefit of all investors.
With that, I turn the floor and the rest of the room to our CFO, Bedi, Singh, to expedite the numbers."
212741644,322245991,927498,"News Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Feb 04, 2016",2016-02-04,"Earnings Calls","News Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Robert.

First, I'd like to share some high-level financial highlights for the second quarter, and then we'll go into each segment in further detail. We reported fiscal '16 second quarter total revenues of $2.2 billion, down 4% from the prior year period. As Robert noted, we were again impacted by currency headwinds, primarily the weaker Australian dollar, which negatively impacted Q2 total revenue by $141 million or 6%. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, acquisitions and divestitures, adjusted revenue declined only 1% compared to the prior year.
We reported total segment EBITDA of $280 million compared to the prior year period of $352 million, excluding the impact of Digital Education segment in both periods. Currency fluctuations impacted total reported segment EBITDA by $25 million or 7%. Reported segment EBITDA this quarter includes $7 million of legal costs related to the U.K. Newspaper Matters net of indemnification as well as $5 million of onetime transaction costs related to the Unruly acquisition, which closed on September 30 and is reflected in the News and Information Services segment. For the quarter, adjusted EPS from continuing operations were $0.20 versus $0.30 in the prior year. Reported EPS from continuing operations were $0.15 compared to $0.27 in the prior year.
Now let's turn to the individual operating segments. In News and Information Services, revenues for the quarter declined $123 million, down 8% versus the prior year period. More than 70% of their decline was related to the impact of foreign currency. Adjusted segment revenues declined 4%. Within segment revenues, advertising declined around 12% or about 6% in local currency due to weakness in print, partially offset by strong digital ad growth across each business unit.
Circulation and subscription revenue declined 5% but were actually up 1% in local currency due to higher consumer circulation revenues in the U.S. and Australia, combined with improvements at Dow Jones professional information business. We saw a slight decline in the U.K. due to the removal of The Sun paywall in November.
Looking at performance across the key units, in Dow Jones, domestic advertising of The Wall Street Journal declined 5% versus the prior year quarter, due in part to tougher year ago comparisons from the financial category. Declines in print advertising were partially offset by solid growth in digital with strength in display, mobile and video. Digital accounted for approximately 1/3 of ad revenues this quarter. And overall, advertising trends at The Wall Street Journal are relatively stable.
Wall Street Journal circulation revenues grew mid-single digits this quarter due to higher subscription pricing, higher digital subscribers and relatively stable print volume. At professional information business, we saw positive net installs and year-over-year revenue growth absent currency for the second consecutive quarter. We also saw strong growth in risk and compliance and continued stability at Factiva.
At News Corp Australia, advertising revenues for the quarter declined 26% or 11% in local currency, consistent with the last quarter as the market growth [ph] remain challenging across most categories. Print advertising declines were partially offset by strong growth in digital and both the metro mastheads and at news.com.au. Circulation revenues saw a double-digit decline versus the prior year. But in local currency, revenues rose low single digits due to cover price increases and higher digital subs. Importantly, revenues from digital paid subscribers nearly offset print volume declines.
Digital paid subscribers grew over 30% year-over-year to 268,000 with newspapers and other publications as of the quarter end. Digital continues to increase its proportion of weekday circulation volume for all metro titles and for The Australian. And digital now comprises over 40% of subscribers compared to the same period in the prior year.
As we noted last quarter, we are actively addressing the cost structure at News Australia. The benefits of the initiatives implemented in the latter part of fiscal second quarter will begin to flow through from the beginning of the second half of this fiscal year and continue through fiscal 2017 to deliver a 5% annualized fixed cost reduction across most areas of the business.
At News UK, overall advertising revenue declined 12% or 8% in local currency, driven by weakness in print advertising, particularly at The Sun, led by the grocers and telecom providers. The key management focus at News UK is on improving the performance of The Sun, particularly its digital proposition. The Sun changed its digital strategy and removed its paywall on November 30. Based on internal metrics, Sun's December unique users were over 14 million, relatively similar to pre-paywall levels. We expect with the site relaunch, as Robert referenced, to see higher audience levels and improved revenues in the coming quarters.
In Q2, The Times and Sunday Times continued to gain market share with growth and circulation revenues and stable volume, including 172,000 digital-only subscribers as of the quarter end, representing more than 40% of total paid subscribers. News UK also continues to look very closely at its cost base, focusing on corporate overhead costs and streamlining of their business processes.
At News America Marketing, revenue declined 3% versus the prior year quarter, although a sequential improvement from Q1. FSI remains weak but was largely offset the growth in domestic in-store and in digital advertising. News America Marketing is focused on integrating Checkout 51, its recently acquired digital and mobile coupon company, and expanding its user base. Checkout 51 is a data-rich platform of transactions, which has the potential to be leveraged across News Corp's portfolio of companies. Outlook for the fiscal third quarter for the FSI business remains particularly challenging, and we are also planning additional investments in Checkout 51 to drive membership.
For the quarter, News and Information Services segment EBITDA declined 27% as compared to the prior year period, and adjusted segment EBITDA was down 22%. We experienced higher marketing and retail promotion expenses at News UK of around $17 million, primarily related to competitive cover pricing pressure, but we expect that, that should moderate materially next quarter. Reported segment EBITDA also includes $5 million for transaction costs related to the acquisition of Unruly, as I noted earlier, and $5 million of legal expenses at News America Marketing ongoing litigations.
Turning to the Book Publishing segment. Revenues decreased 5% and segment EBITDA declined 26% versus the prior year. Declines were due to lower e-book volume across the marketplace similar to the fourth quarter and tougher year ago Divergent comps and some FX headwinds. Titles to call out this quarter included Ree Drummond's The Pioneer Woman Cooks and Sarah Young's Jesus Calling.
Total digital revenues for the quarter was 16% of consumer revenues, down from 19% the prior year, partially due to the Divergent series, which sold around 600,000 units this quarter versus approximately 1.5 million units in Q2 last year. It's also worth noting that for our fiscal third quarter, we will continue to have tough comps against higher Divergent sales in the prior year of 2.3 million units and additionally around 2.7 million units of American Sniper.
In digital real estate services, total segment revenues increased $54 million or 35% to $208 million. Segment EBITDA was $73 million, up 28% compared to the prior year period as improving operating results at REA Group were partially offset by foreign currency fluctuations. Excluding foreign currency and reflecting the inclusion of half a quarter's results of Move, adjusted revenue and adjusted EBITDA grew 22% and 19%, respectively. REA's revenues grew 20% in local currency, and EBITDA increased at a notably higher rate of local currency due to higher listing [indiscernible] product penetration.
The acquisition of the remaining shares of iProperty, REA doesn't already own [ph] for approximately AUD 480 million or USD 340 million, should close in mid-February. REA expects to incur roughly USD 5 million in transaction cost in the second half related to this acquisition. iProperty will be consolidated into REA commencing this quarter and is expected to have no material impact on News Corp's EPS for the current fiscal year. REA will be reporting its half year results shortly after this call.
Reported segment results include $87 million in revenues from Move. Move generated mid-single digit EBITDA, excluding stock-based compensation in the quarter. Results for Move also included around $4 million of legal expenses for our litigation against Zillow, and we remain on track with our expectations to be EBITDA positive for this fiscal year.
On a standalone basis, Move's revenues would have grown 35% versus the prior year quarter, the highest rate of growth since the acquisition last November and 2.5x the rate of growth seen in Q2 of last fiscal year. The improvement was led again by the collections for co-brokerage product and near doubling of nonlisting ad revenues, benefiting from the successful integration into the Dow Jones programmatic exchange, higher audience levels and higher CPMs. We are also continuing to see healthy increases in our agent and broker customer numbers.
Unique user growth remained strong, up 37% to 39 million average for fiscal second quarter, a bit lower than the prior quarter due to seasonality, and this has increased to 50 million in January, which has been a record month. Page views and minutes both accelerated versus the prior quarter. We also saw year-over-year and sequential improvement in Move's software and services business, led by increase in subscribers through its top producer CRM product.
At Cable Network Programming, revenues decreased by $6 million or 5% compared to the prior year quarter. But on a currency adjusted basis, revenues increased 10%. Subscription revenues were down 7% as higher affiliate fees and subscriber gains were more than offset by FX headwinds. Excluding currency, subscriber revenues grew around 7%, helped by mid-single digit subscriber growth.
Advertising revenues grew 7%, benefit from -- benefiting from the Rugby World Cup and the motorsport properties combined with higher underlying market share. In local currency terms, advertising revenues grew 29%. Segment EBITDA in the quarter fell 28% due to negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations and the expected higher programming rights cost related to the Rugby World Cup of around USD 11 million.
In December last year, News Corp Australia, in conjunction with Fox Sports Australia, announced that it has secured a new 5-year deal with the National Rugby League for the 2018 through 2022 seasons. Fox Sports Australia also announced the extension of Rugby Union through 2020. These new contracts, combined with the recent extension of the AFL, means that Fox Sports and Foxtel have long-term visibility and security to the most important sports rights in Australia.
On the NRL, beginning with the 2016 season, Fox Sports will broadcast all games live, including 3 matches per week that will be simulcast with Nine Network. This will cost an incremental approximately USD 10 million with the second half of this fiscal year. This additional cost though will be completely offset by cost savings from the lapping of the Asian Cup and the Cricket World Cup from last year.
With respect to earnings from affiliates, Foxtel ended the quarter with approximately 2.9 million total subscribers with cable and satellite subscribers increasing over 7% compared to the prior year period and higher Presto subs despite increasing competition from SVOD players. In the quarter, cable and satellite shown -- [ph] improved to 10.3% from 11.8% in the prior year. ARPU has remained relatively steady since the new pricing initiative. But as expected, it's down mid-single digits compared to the prior year.
Foxtel revenues for the quarter in local currency were up 5%, an improvement from the prior quarter. And EBITDA declined at a sequentially lower rate of 7%, mainly due to planned higher programming costs, primarily sports rights and fees and an unexpected increase in cost associated with higher sales volume and the launch of triple play and continued marketing investment in Presto.
Turning to loss from discontinued operations. This quarter, we incurred a net loss of $24 million, which includes $17 million in severance and lease termination costs as part of the sale of the Insight and Learning businesses. We expect very minimal cost going forward to maintain support for the tablet business and expect these to conclude by the end of fiscal 2016.
In summary, whilst we faced challenges this quarter, notably at the News and Information Services segment and in Book Publishing, compounded by continued currency headwinds, we continue to invest in digital products, including the integration of Unruly and Checkout 51, as Robert mentioned. We are driving higher digital subs and audience across our key mastheads and building our digital revenue streams. We're actively addressing our cost base, particularly focused in Australia and the U.K., and we expect to see these benefits flow through from the second half onwards.
We continue to aggressively focus on digital real estate, and we believe that Move and REA Group will be core pillars of profitability for the future. We have extended our real estate reach and expertise through small investments in India and through REA's investment in Southeast Asia, magnified by its planned acquisition of iProperty. And we have also solidified our content portfolio at Fox Sports Australia and Foxtel and have long-term visibility with the most valuable domestic sports.
We believe that the steps we have been taking continue to position News Corp to drive long-term value per share. We are pivoting the company into faster growth segments and will continue to reinvest and be balanced with capital returns.
And with that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A."

You have your own impressions on that. The truth is that we're very happy with the mix of portfolio that we have now. You can see how complementary the assets are that we've acquired. These haven't been random investments, by any means. And so any investment we would ever contemplate has to fit that picture where we genuinely believe it becomes more than the sum of the parts. And the way that we've been able to use realtor, for example, to increase the usage and the downloading of the app for Checkout 51, the way we've been able to use MarketWatch to boost traffic for realtor and vice versa, has been an important part of this strategy. So that strategic imperative, which we articulated at the time of the spin, remains constant [ph] at the moment. As for the use of capital, look, we want to be consistent in our messaging and consistent in our returns of capital. We have, as you know, instituted a semiannual dividend, and we want to be consistent about that, and we've had a modest buyback program. We want to be consistent about that as well. And so the principle of a certain amount of return is one that we've established, and we will abide by that principle. But on the other hand, should there be a strategic opportunity for investment, we remain attuned to that possibility."

For our Australian mastheads, clearly, as both Bedi and I have articulated, it was a difficult quarter in advertising. And to that extent, we've clearly embarked on a cost-cutting program at the mastheads. Now, of course, a consequence is that cost cutting has a cost, a short-term cost and a long-term benefit. But we're not being defeatist about the power of those platforms. They are very powerful platforms. And so we will continue to invest in their additional development, and we continue to believe that print has a future as a powerful platform. If, for example, you look at all the angst over ad blockers, you know what, ad blockers don't work on newspapers and you have 100% viewability. So the relative power of print as a platform, as part of our portfolio, remains constant. And I think we're in a period of advertising experimentation, and some advertisers would be, I think, slightly surprised to find the starts about [ph] -- find themselves associated with. They're not premium sites. They range from the ordinary to the tawdry, outside the premium sites and that value is an enduring value."

212741644,322245991,927604,"News Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Feb 04, 2016",2016-02-04,"Earnings Calls","News Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Mike. News Corp's evolving rapidly into a more digital and increasingly global company with a diverse revenue mix that we resolutely believe will drive long-term growth in revenue, profits and shareholder returns. The quarter presented challeng",1864,"Thank you, Mike. News Corp's evolving rapidly into a more digital and increasingly global company with a diverse revenue mix that we resolutely believe will drive long-term growth in revenue, profits and shareholder returns. The quarter presented challenges with a still uncertain macroeconomic environment and foreign exchange volatility, but we believe in the enduring value of our prestigious brands and the sound logic of our digital strategy.
Revenues fell 4% to $2.2 billion and reported total segment EBITDA declined 20% to $280 million. EBITDA for the quarter includes legal and transaction costs, which Bedi will momentarily explain in detail. However, excluding the effects of ForEx fluctuations, revenues would actually have grown 2% versus the prior year as the successful integration of realtor.com and growth of REA contributed materially to our performance.
It is thus, appropriate in examining the individual segments, that we begin with Digital Real Estate Services, in which, by most measures, we have become the world's largest player over the past 12 months. The position will be further enhanced by the imminent closing of REA's acquisition of iProperty, the preeminent digital property company in Southeast Asia. We are particularly pleased by the early returns of Move, which we acquired just over a year ago and whose realtor.com network has become the fastest-growing player in the still emerging U.S. digital real estate market.
For the quarter, average monthly unique users increased by 37% year-over-year, driven by a 57% surge in mobile users. For the month of January, we recorded 50 million monthly uniques compared to 30 million in the month before we acquired realtor in late 2014.
We are significantly ahead of schedule and revenue growth and in the trajectory of EBITDA for Move. Even with the investment required to enhance the site, we firmly expect positive EBITDA for this fiscal year. That result will not come at the expense of investment in the product or the brand and should be the harbinger of increasing EBITDA in coming years.
For the most recent quarter alone, revenues at Move, the parent of realtor.com, expanded 35% year-over-year on a stand-alone basis, while user engagement continued to grow briskly with page views 34% higher at 1.1 billion views and minutes spent on the site increasing 47% year-over-year. In December, we launched a renovated realtor.com site, which is more user- and mobile-friendly, and we expect to unveil several new products for realtors in coming months, including enhanced listings and extra focus on delivering our cherished clients more and better quality buyer leads. We also fashioned a partnership with CoStar that will add many thousands of rental listings and provide a new pipeline of customers who ideally will ultimately graduate to being home buyers.
Meanwhile, in Australia, REA Group continues to thrive, with revenues expanding by more than 30%, excluding the impact of foreign currency, thanks to the broader penetration of premium products. The REA audience in Australia is over twice the size of its nearest competitor in a market that is clearly at a different phase of growth to that of the U.S. Importantly, we are now in a position to share learnings, mobile, software and display modules across our global digital property platforms to ensure that we optimize the experience for users and the revenue for our company.
Elsewhere in Australia, Fox Sports was affected materially by currency movements, which masked a strong underlying performance. The nature of the business is that the large audiences generated by showcase events, such as the Rugby World Cup, in which Australia's performance exceeded modest expectations are accompanied by increased acquisition and production costs. However, advertising during the quarter rose almost 30% in local currency, far exceeding the level of most Australian broadcasters.
Meanwhile, Foxtel, where there has been significant investment in marketing and product, reported a moderating of the rate of EBITDA decline and improving revenue growth in local currency. Our stated aim is clear, to drive subscriber growth and to highlight to potential customers the superior value of the product selection compared to SVOD other competitors in Australia like Netflix, which has a markedly inferior offering to that of Foxtel. It's worth noting that churn hit a near record low level at Foxtel this quarter at just over 10%.
Sport is patently a crucial offering, particularly in Australia. And in the most recent quarter, Foxtel and Fox Sports extended their rights to the National Rugby League, which, along with Aussie Rules, are the dominant sports in the country. Fox Sports will have specialist channels for both sports as we have now secured rights until 2022. We see these long-term rights as a robust foundation for the expansion of Foxtel and Fox Sports over the coming decade.
Foxtel also completed the acquisition of an approximate 48% equity stake in the Ten Network during the quarter. Ten's ad sales are being integrated into the MCN ad sales venture, creating a unified ad sales network across both free-to-air and subscription TV that is already gaining real traction. Ad agencies in Australia have strongly endorsed the MCN Ten model and Foxtel sees an ongoing opportunity to drive incremental advertising growth across these powerful platforms.
In our News and Information Services segment, Australian advertising remained challenged, but we are seeing encouraging signs in subscriptions and a more balanced revenue mix. Circulation revenues are up against the quarter, excluding currency, due in part to a higher digital subs across our mastheads, nearly offsetting print volume declines.
We are actively focused on costs. In this past quarter, we implemented a cost reduction program across most of the businesses, which will begin to show benefits this quarter. news.com.au maintained its lead as the #1 news portal in Australia and has become a valuable platform to drive revenues, delivering around 52 million extra visits to our sites last year.
In the U.K., we are also assiduously reducing cost at our mastheads while renewing direct relationships with advertisers to maximize revenue. We are delighted with the integration of Unruly, the social and viral ad platform we recently acquired. It is working with our businesses around the world and particularly with our U.K. mastheads to deliver high-quality advertising to our properties and to reduce our alliance on third parties. Unruly's cutting-edge metrics and contemporary culture are infusing energy and creativity into the broader business.
Digital transformation is well underway at The Sun, where we recently removed the paywall and are relaunching the site in March, optimized the video and mobile, which is self-evidently growing in potency as a platform. We are also diversifying our revenue base and monetizing this valuable Sun brand. This past quarter, our News UK has signed 2 licensing deals, with Playtech for Sun Bingo and with Tabcorp for Sun Bets, to which higher-margin revenue streams will begin flowing in May, just ahead of the European soccer championships in June and in good time for the next English soccer season.
The Times of London may have been founded in 1785, but it continues to prosper in 2016, gaining in market share and expanding its circulation revenues, thanks to the continuing success of its digital offering, which we'll be able to expand internationally at little incremental cost. That extended a lead as we have discovered with The Wall Street Journal, is an extremely desirable demographic that is difficult to reach on social media and has strong affinity for The Times and The Sunday Times.
At The Wall Street Journal, advertising year-on-year was softer, but the early signs for the current quarter are more positive. It's worth pointing out that the real estate category showed significant ad strength this quarter, primarily driven in digital by the recent launch of Mansion Global and in print by the Mansion residential section, highlighting the value that News Corp brings to realtors and the efficacy of the relationship with realtor.com.
We believe these complementary platforms are clearly worth more than the sum of their parts. Overall, digital now accounts for nearly 50% of revenues at Dow Jones with strong growth in the risk and compliance segment of our professional information business and healthy progress in the pursuit of 3 million subscriptions at WSJ and Barron's within 3 years. Specifically at the Journal, there was an 18% year-on-year growth in digital-only subscriptions for the most recent reported quarter, reaching 819,000 subscribers. As well, ARPU is on the rise. So these are not deeply discounted, inevitably promiscuous subscribers.
I would also point out that the Dow Jones financial site MarketWatch set a new traffic record in January, with more than 23.3 million unique visitors. MarketWatch also had 1.2 million video starts for the month, which is a more than 460% jump year-over-year, while total visits to the site were a record 60.1 million.
In other business, News America Marketing showed healthy domestic in-store and digital revenue growth while experiencing declines in revenues due to challenges in the very competitive FSI business. Sluggish economic growth and the squeeze up [ph] by many families around the country mean that there is a strong appetite for discounts, which explains our optimism for the prospects of Checkout 51, our recently acquired digital coupon company.
We began a fresh round of marketing for a Checkout 51 in January, and downloads of the app have risen sharply. The weekly rate of new memberships in the U.S. and Canada has tripled in the past month to 70,000, giving Checkout 51 more than 5 million members to date. We are using our powerful platforms, including realtor.com, to drive adoption of the app. That larger audience will give us the scale to surface better offers from consumer goods companies, which, in turn, will make the app stickier and more attractive for potential who literally can upload their receipts and receive cash back.
At HarperCollins, the integration of Harlequin continues to pace, providing us with a global publishing platform, including best-selling authors, Karin Slaughter and Daniel Silva, who have successfully published almost 200 HarperCollins titles today in foreign languages across more than 18 countries. Comparisons with last year were naturally made more difficult because of the blockbuster success of the Divergent trilogy, which was also a powerful performer as an e-book, given the genre. Teen fiction overindexes digitally. Print sales actually rose during the period, but not enough to offset the decline in digital, a softness that other publishers have also reported and is an industry-wide issue.
In conclusion, while macroeconomic conditions and currency trends were inauspicious this quarter, we believe our core strategy to become a more deeply digital company with a particular emphasis on mobile is certainly on track. Our acquisitions are enhancing that capability, whether it'd be Storyful with mobile video or Unruly with its social sensibility or the imminent acquisition of iProperty with its digital property prowess in East Asia. We are particularly pleased that realtor.com has been transformed. And through its success, it's transforming the character of News Corp. We have significant toil ahead, but we see a clearly defined pathway to a more digital future and increased profitability, which will be to the benefit of all investors.
With that, I turn the floor and the rest of the room to our CFO, Bedi, Singh, to expedite the numbers."

First, I'd like to share some high-level financial highlights for the second quarter, and then we'll go into each segment in further detail. We reported fiscal '16 second quarter total revenues of $2.2 billion, down 4% from the prior year",2240,"Thanks, Robert. First, I'd like to share some high-level financial highlights for the second quarter, and then we'll go into each segment in further detail. We reported fiscal '16 second quarter total revenues of $2.2 billion, down 4% from the prior year period. As Robert noted, we were again impacted by currency headwinds, primarily the weaker Australian dollar, which negatively impacted Q2 total revenue by $141 million or 6%. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, acquisitions and divestitures, adjusted revenue declined only 1% compared to the prior year.
We reported total segment EBITDA of $280 million compared to the prior year period of $352 million, excluding the impact of Digital Education segment in both periods. Currency fluctuations impacted total reported segment EBITDA by $25 million or 7%. Reported segment EBITDA this quarter includes $7 million of legal costs related to the U.K. Newspaper Matters net of indemnification as well as $5 million of onetime transaction costs related to the Unruly acquisition, which closed on September 30 and is reflected in the News and Information Services segment. For the quarter, adjusted EPS from continuing operations were $0.20 versus $0.30 in the prior year. Reported EPS from continuing operations were $0.15 compared to $0.27 in the prior year.
Now let's turn to the individual operating segments. In News and Information Services, revenues for the quarter declined $123 million, down 8% versus the prior year period. More than 70% of their decline was related to the impact of foreign currency. Adjusted segment revenues declined 4%. Within segment revenues, advertising declined around 12% or about 6% in local currency due to weakness in print, partially offset by strong digital ad growth across each business unit.
Circulation and subscription revenue declined 5% but were actually up 1% in local currency due to higher consumer circulation revenues in the U.S. and Australia, combined with improvements at Dow Jones professional information business. We saw a slight decline in the U.K. due to the removal of The Sun paywall in November.
Looking at performance across the key units, in Dow Jones, domestic advertising of The Wall Street Journal declined 5% versus the prior year quarter, due in part to tougher year ago comparisons from the financial category. Declines in print advertising were partially offset by solid growth in digital with strength in display, mobile and video. Digital accounted for approximately 1/3 of ad revenues this quarter. And overall, advertising trends at The Wall Street Journal are relatively stable.
Wall Street Journal circulation revenues grew mid-single digits this quarter due to higher subscription pricing, higher digital subscribers and relatively stable print volume. At professional information business, we saw positive net installs and year-over-year revenue growth absent currency for the second consecutive quarter. We also saw strong growth in risk and compliance and continued stability at Factiva.
At News Corp Australia, advertising revenues for the quarter declined 26% or 11% in local currency, consistent with the last quarter as the marketplace remained challenging across most categories. Print advertising declines were partially offset by strong growth in digital and both the metro mastheads and at news.com.au. Circulation revenues saw a double-digit decline versus the prior year. But in local currency, revenues rose low single digits due to cover price increases and higher digital subs. Importantly, revenues from digital paid subscribers nearly offset print volume declines.
Digital paid subscribers grew over 30% year-over-year to 268,000 for newspapers and other publications as of the quarter end. Digital continues to increase its proportion of weekday circulation volume for all metro titles and for The Australian. And digital now comprises over 40% of subscribers compared to the same period in the prior year.
As we noted last quarter, we are actively addressing the cost structure at News Australia. The benefits of the initiatives implemented in the latter part of fiscal second quarter will begin to flow through from the beginning of the second half of this fiscal year and continue through fiscal 2017 to deliver a 5% annualized fixed cost reduction across most areas of the business.
At News UK, overall advertising revenue declined 12% or 8% in local currency, driven by weakness in print advertising, particularly at The Sun, led by the grocers and telecom providers. The key management focus at News UK is on improving the performance of The Sun, particularly its digital proposition. The Sun changed its digital strategy and removed its paywall on November 30. Based on internal metrics, Sun's December unique users were over 14 million, relatively similar to pre-paywall levels. We expect with the site relaunch, as Robert referenced, to see higher audience levels and improved revenues in the coming quarters.
In Q2, The Times and Sunday Times continued to gain market share with growth and circulation revenues and stable volume, including 172,000 digital-only subscribers as of the quarter end, representing more than 40% of total paid subscribers. News UK also continues to look very closely at its cost base, focusing on corporate overhead costs and streamlining of their business processes.
At News America Marketing, revenue declined 3% versus the prior year quarter, although a sequential improvement from Q1. FSI remains weak but was largely offset the growth in domestic in-store and in digital advertising. News America Marketing is focused on integrating Checkout 51, its recently acquired digital and mobile coupon company, and expanding its user base. Checkout 51 is a data-rich platform of transactions, which has the potential to be leveraged across News Corp's portfolio of companies. Outlook for the fiscal third quarter for the FSI business remains particularly challenging, and we are also planning additional investments in Checkout 51 to drive membership.
For the quarter, News and Information Services segment EBITDA declined 27% as compared to the prior year period, and adjusted segment EBITDA was down 22%. We experienced higher marketing and retail promotion expenses at News UK of around $17 million, primarily related to competitive cover pricing pressure, but we expect that, that should moderate materially next quarter. Reported segment EBITDA also includes $5 million for transaction costs related to the acquisition of Unruly, as I noted earlier, and $5 million of legal expenses at News America Marketing for ongoing litigations.
Turning to the Book Publishing segment. Revenues decreased 5% and segment EBITDA declined 26% versus the prior year. Declines were due to lower e-book volume across the marketplace similar to the fourth quarter and tougher year ago Divergent comps and some FX headwinds. Titles to call out this quarter included Ree Drummond's The Pioneer Woman Cooks and Sarah Young's Jesus Calling.
Total digital revenues for the quarter was 16% of consumer revenues, down from 19% the prior year, partially due to the Divergent series, which sold around 600,000 units this quarter versus approximately 1.5 million units in Q2 last year. It's also worth noting that for our fiscal third quarter, we will continue to have tough comps against higher Divergent sales in the prior year of 2.3 million units and additionally around 2.7 million units of American Sniper.
In digital real estate services, total segment revenues increased $54 million or 35% to $208 million. Segment EBITDA was $73 million, up 28% compared to the prior year period as improving operating results at REA Group were partially offset by foreign currency fluctuations. Excluding foreign currency and reflecting the inclusion of half a quarter's results of Move, adjusted revenue and adjusted EBITDA grew 22% and 19%, respectively. REA's revenues grew 20% in local currency, and EBITDA increased at a notably higher rate in local currency due to higher listing [indiscernible] product penetration.
The acquisition of the remaining shares of iProperty, REA doesn't already own for approximately AUD 480 million or USD 340 million, should close in mid-February. REA expects to incur roughly USD 5 million in transaction cost in the second half related to this acquisition. iProperty will be consolidated into REA commencing this quarter and is expected to have no material impact on News Corp's EPS for the current fiscal year. REA will be reporting its half year results shortly after this call.
Reported segment results include $87 million in revenues from Move. Move generated mid-single digit EBITDA, excluding stock-based compensation in the quarter. Results for Move also included around $4 million of legal expenses for our litigation against Zillow, and we remain on track with our expectations to be EBITDA positive for this fiscal year.
On a standalone basis, Move's revenues would have grown 35% versus the prior year quarter, the highest rate of growth since the acquisition last November and 2.5x the rate of growth seen in Q2 of last fiscal year. The improvement was led again by the collections for co-brokerage product and near doubling of nonlisting ad revenues, benefiting from the successful integration into the Dow Jones programmatic exchange, higher audience levels and higher CPMs. We are also continuing to see healthy increases in our agent and broker customer numbers.
Unique user growth remained strong, up 37% to 39 million average for fiscal second quarter, a bit lower than the prior quarter due to seasonality, and this has increased to 50 million in January, which has been a record month. Page views and minutes both accelerated versus the prior quarter. We also saw year-over-year and sequential improvement in Move's software and services business, led by increase in subscribers through its top producer CRM product.
At Cable Network Programming, revenues decreased by $6 million or 5% compared to the prior year quarter. But on a currency adjusted basis, revenues increased 10%. Subscription revenues were down 7% as higher affiliate fees and subscriber gains were more than offset by FX headwinds. Excluding currency, subscriber revenues grew around 7%, helped by mid-single digit subscriber growth.
Advertising revenues grew 7%, benefit from -- benefiting from the Rugby World Cup and the motorsport properties combined with higher underlying market share. In local currency terms, advertising revenues grew 29%. Segment EBITDA in the quarter fell 28% due to negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations and the expected higher programming rights cost related to the Rugby World Cup of around USD 11 million.
In December last year, News Corp Australia, in conjunction with Fox Sports Australia, announced that it has secured a new 5-year deal with the National Rugby League for the 2018 through 2022 seasons. Fox Sports Australia also announced the extension of Rugby Union through 2020. These new contracts, combined with the recent extension of the AFL, means that Fox Sports and Foxtel have long-term visibility and security to the most important sports rights in Australia.
On the NRL, beginning with the 2016 season, Fox Sports will broadcast all games live, including 3 matches per week that will be simulcast with Nine Network. This will cost an incremental approximately USD 10 million with the second half of this fiscal year. This additional cost, though, will be completely offset by cost savings from the lapping of the Asian Cup and the Cricket World Cup from last year.
With respect to earnings from affiliates, Foxtel ended the quarter with approximately 2.9 million total subscribers with cable and satellite subscribers increasing over 7% compared to the prior year period and higher Presto subs despite increasing competition from SVOD players. In the quarter, cable and satellite churn improved to 10.3% from 11.8% in the prior year. ARPU has remained relatively steady since the new pricing initiative. But as expected, it's down mid-single digits compared to the prior year.
Foxtel revenues for the quarter in local currency were up 5%, an improvement from the prior quarter. And EBITDA declined at a sequentially lower rate of 7%, mainly due to planned higher programming costs, primarily sports rights and fees and an expected increase in cost associated with higher sales volume and the launch of triple play and continued marketing investment in Presto.
Turning to loss from discontinued operations. This quarter, we incurred a net loss of $24 million, which includes $17 million in severance and lease termination costs as part of the sale of the Insight and Learning businesses. We expect very minimal cost going forward to maintain support for the tablet business and expect these to conclude by the end of fiscal 2016.
In summary, whilst we faced challenges this quarter, notably at the News and Information Services segment and in Book Publishing, compounded by continued currency headwinds, we continue to invest in digital products, including the integration of Unruly and Checkout 51, as Robert mentioned. We are driving higher digital subs and audience across our key mastheads and building our digital revenue streams. We're actively addressing our cost base, particularly focused in Australia and the U.K., and we expect to see these benefits flow through from the second half onwards.
We continue to aggressively focus on digital real estate, and we believe that Move and REA Group will be core pillars of profitability for the future. We have extended our real estate reach and expertise through small investments in India and through REA's investment in Southeast Asia, magnified by its planned acquisition of iProperty. And we have also solidified our content portfolio at Fox Sports Australia and Foxtel and have long-term visibility with the most valuable domestic sports.
We believe that the steps we have been taking continue to position News Corp to drive long-term value per share. We are pivoting the company into faster growth segments and will continue to reinvest and be balanced with capital returns.
And with that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A."

The truth is that we're very happy with the mix of portfolio that we have now. You can see how complementary the assets are that we've acquired. These haven't been random investments, by any means. And so any investment we would ever contemplate has to fit that picture where we genuinely believe it becomes more than the sum of the parts. And the way that we've been able to use realtor, for example, to increase the usage and the downloading of the app for Checkout 51, the way we've been able to use MarketWatch to boost traffic for realtor and vice versa, has been an important part of this strategy. So that strategic imperative, which we articulated at the time of the spin, remains constant at the moment. As for the use of capital, look, we want to be consistent in our messaging and consistent in our returns of capital. We have, as you know, instituted a semiannual dividend, and we want to be consistent about that, and we've had a modest buyback program. We want to be consistent about that as well. And so the principle of a certain amount of return is one that we've established, and we will abide by that principle. But on the other hand, should there be a strategic opportunity for investment, we remain attuned to that possibility."

For our Australian mastheads, clearly, as both Bedi and I have articulated, it was a difficult quarter in advertising. And to that extent, we've clearly embarked on a cost-cutting program at the mastheads. Now, of course, a consequence is that cost cutting has a cost, a short-term cost and a long-term benefit. But we're not being defeatist about the power of those platforms. They are very powerful platforms. And so we will continue to invest in their digital development, and we continue to believe that print has a future as a powerful platform. If, for example, you look at all the angst over ad blockers, you know what, ad blockers don't work on newspapers and you have 100% viewability. So the relative power of print as a platform, as part of our portfolio, remains constant. And I think we're in a period of advertising experimentation, and some advertisers would be, I think, slightly surprised to find the sites that they find themselves associated with, they're not premium sites. They range from the ordinary to the tawdry, outside the premium sites and that value is an enduring value."

In our pursuit of digital and, particularly, mobile growth, we continue to develop and diversify the portfolio of our businesses and aggressively control our operating costs to free resources for further innovation and to expand margins across the company.
The third quarter results were materially affected by a $280 million pretax charge at News America Marketing to resolve a legacy lawsuit and related plans and continued currency headwinds, which impacted revenues by $72 million and EBITDA by $9 million. Excluding those factors and other special items, our revenues and total segment EBITDA declined 5% and 8%, respectively, which was disappointing. We believe, however, that the company is on track to see improvements in the fourth quarter with the expansion of our digital real estate business, foreign currency comparisons hopefully beginning to ease and cost saving initiatives that confirm the root. 
Our pursuit of digital growth continues to pace, and we enhanced our status as the world's largest digital property company with REA's completion of the iProperty acquisition in Southeast Asia where we are now the most influential player. Meanwhile, traffic and revenue growth remains robust at REA and realtor.com. We are focused on driving mobile revenue and are pleased with but not complacent about the results at realtor.com where the mobile audience grew close to 50% this quarter and now represents 60% of page views and the majority of leads. 
Despite the difficult conditions for advertising, we saw both Dow Jones and News Corp strategy contributing to segment EBITDA growth, thanks to more digital subscriptions, digital advertising growth and ongoing cost reduction. While we believe in the strength of our print properties, we are investing energetically in the rapid pursuit of digital, which is clearly evident in the transition at Dow Jones. 
At Dow Jones this quarter, digital accounted for more than 50% of total revenues, and digital-only subscribers at The Wall Street Journal grew to 893,000, representing nearly 45% of the We are building a strong digital platform on top of the WSJ print circulation, which today is double the size of its nearest rival. And 51% of The Wall Street Journal's digital origins now comes from mobile, up 6 percentage points from a year ago.
With the advertising market in the midst of our advertisers and agencies are understandably experimenting with their spend, but we firmly believe that premium brands and audiences are currently undervalued by advertising agencies, some of whom are more interested in fashion than function. With Silicon Valley's demand for quality content more voracious than ever and advertisers rightly seeking greater digital accountability, we believe News Corp is ideally positioned to capitalize on these macro trends through the power of our global mastheads, businesses and audience.
Bedi will shortly provide more granular detail in the numbers, but reported revenues fell 7% to $1.9 billion, and the reported total segment EBITDA loss was $122 million. Excluding the onetime pretax legal charge of $218 [ph] million at News America Marketing, total segment EBITDA would have been $158 million, decline of 14%. We are very focused on leveraging the key strength of our portfolio. As one example, we recently reached an agreement with a leading consumer packaged goods company that involves both News America Marketing and realtor.com and we expect many more such deals as advertisers appreciate the value of our brand and deep audience relationships.
Let me review some of our lines of business beginning with Digital Real Estate Services. With the ongoing success of REA, the completion of REA's acquisition of iProperty and the growth of realtor.com, News Corp's digital real estate business is continuing its robust expansion. iProperty is the leading digital platform in Southeast Asia, complementing our existing businesses and allowing the further repurposing of software and expertise. News Corp Australia also completed the acquisition of a leading provider of 3D visualization for the real estate industry, which we plan to incorporate more broadly at REA and around the industry. This will help differentiate News Corp's digital real estate capabilities worldwide and provide a valuable service to realtors, vendors and buyers. 
For the most recent quarter, revenues at Move, which operates realtor.com, expanded at 20% year-over-year while user engagement at move.com continued to grow briskly with page views more than 25% higher to a record 1.5 billion views and minutes spent on the site increasing nearly 30% year-over-year. 
We have momentum and the strongest engagement in the U.S. housing market, a market that we believe is yet to fully recover from the financial crisis and is still at a relatively early phase of its digital evolution.
Also in this quarter, average monthly unique users increased by 30% year-over-year, including strong growth in mobile. For the month of April, we recorded 55 million monthly uniques, and the average user of our mobile app accessed around 20 pages per visit, and that's not including We are continuing to improve our product line to enhance the services for realtors and the efficacy for users. We have a number of new products coming to market at builder.com including Turbo, which will assist the promotion of listings for agents and brokers. 
Early in fiscal 2017, we plan to roll out showcase 2.0 to provide even more direct links to properties and for realtors, vendors and buyers. We are also enhancing our software and services offerings for agents to improve the efficiency of their business and bolster the efficacy of leads and ROI. We continue to enhance the site experience to drive deeper engagement, personalization and integrating more relevant content with robust local neighborhood information.
In Australia, our digital real estate is at a more advanced stage of development, the REA group had a solid quarter with revenues expanding by 20 [ph] year-over-year excluding the impact of foreign currency, thanks primarily to the broader penetration of premium products. 
REA in Australia has more than twice the traffic of its nearest competitor, and REA continues to work ever more closely with realtor.com and other News Corp properties. One sign of that partnership was the successful launch this past week by the Australian newspaper of a glossy magazine management based on The Wall Street Journal and in conjunction with REA. Overall, excluding currency and M&A costs, adjusted revenues at the digital real estate segment grew 18%, and adjusted EBITDA grew 23% year-over-year despite the higher legal costs at Move, which is involved in ongoing litigation in tandem with the National Association of Realtors against Zillow over the theft of corporate secrets and the destruction of evidence. 
In Australia, Fox Sports posted strong EBITDA growth, in part due to the absence of costs from the Cricket World Cup and Asia Cup in the prior year. We're encouraged by the particularly robust ratings with the launch of the new season of Rugby League and Australian Football. The NRL and AFL are both up low double digits over the prior year. We believe the strong early returns in both sports this year are positive indicators for subscriber growth and advertising and highlight the value of our deals to secure NRL and rules rights until 2022. These key sports should provide a platform for the long-term growth of our franchise.
At Foxtel, we saw the appointment of Peter Tollner, as CEO and expect that he will further develop the company, which we operate in partnership with Telstra. There have been several changes to the Foxtel executive team, and we are confident that the development of products and, crucially, the marketing of those products will be enhanced over coming year. In a challenging marketplace, Foxtel grew subscribers to around 2.9 million subs, which included a roughly 6% increase in cable and satellite subs versus the prior year and higher [indiscernible] subscribers. And Foxtel is announcing today an agreement with 6 top English Premier League clubs launching 3 dedicated channels with all home and away matches at Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United, Manchester City and most significantly and profoundly, These teams account for 75% of the AFL fan base in Australia. This agreement is yet another strong sign of how Foxtel differentiates itself from the competition with its premier content, which we believe also includes Australia's best portfolio of films and other programs and a growing roster of homegrown dramas that are proven audience pleasers. We expect our new team will make that point to consumers tempered by lesser offerings from other providers who may have name recognition but are relatively limited flow of compelling content.
Foxtel, which has an approximate 14% equity stake in the 10 network is already seeing benefits from the MCN advertising joint venture. The partnership with MCN delivers a broadened sales platform and obvious operating efficiencies. It's worth nothing the was the only free-to-air network to gain market share in its fiscal first half. 
While HarperCollins faced a challenging quarter as we had foreshadowed due to tough comparisons with a strong sales of Divergent and American Sniper last year, the trends do appear to be improving. There's a stronger pipeline, including the paperback addition of Go Set a Watchman and the publication of Megan Kelly's first book scheduled to appear this November. In the next fiscal year, we look forward to launching the latest books of Daniel Sauber, Patricia Cornwall and Veronica Roth, the author of the Divergent series, who's next novel, the first part of a is due for release in January. The book's cover was released today to much acclaim by Veronica's many, many fans. As a result, we are encouraged by the outlook for the next fiscal year and expect to see improved year-over-year comparisons in the current quarter. We also continue to strengthen our international operations to make the most of the hit books globally, for example, by having taken full control of our operation in Italy and expanding in India.
At News and Information Services, while print ad market particularly in the U.K. remain somewhat challenging and News America Marketing SSI revenues were certainly under pressure, we are continuing to rightsize our cost structure while emphasizing the importance of high-quality content and providing products and quality audiences for our advertisers. This quarter, segment EBITDA reflected positive growth at both Dow Jones and at News Corp Australia, thanks in part to the benefits of earlier efficiencies.
Let me take a moment to discuss some of our cost initiatives in detail. At News Australia, we've announced an initial goal of 5% in annualized fixed cost reductions across the business, and we are well on our way to achieving that target with AUD 40 million of cost savings expected in the second half of this fiscal year. These savings range from lower production costs to the closure of loss-making businesses and reduced headcount across the divisions. This, along with the moderation in print ad declines an acceleration in digital revenue has contributed to News Corp Australia's stronger growth this quarter.
As a way to demonstrate our scale according to a new study by Nielsen and the IAB News Corp digital properties reached just under 16 million Australians above the age of 14 each month, which is higher than Facebook. At Dow Jones, expenses moderated thanks to a combination of lower sales and marketing spend and reduced newsprint expense. We continue to make strides in circulation, outpacing our peers. And as we've communicated, we have ambitious goals for ongoing digital growth. In this quarter, we also relaunched the market launch website and we've seen 20% revenue growth with quarterly traffic exceeding 20 million unique users and page views of over 150 million, up high teens versus the second quarter. 
At the professional information business, we rolled our customized newswires created a new vertical targeted at financial regulation and launched mobile, providing additional avenues and future growth and improving service for our professional subscribers. Revenues at our risk and compliance business grew 30% year-over-year, and the tougher regulatory requirement in many sectors, particularly in financial services, is clearly stimulating demand for our products.
At News UK, we still see challenges in the ad market. There was continued weakness in print demand, specifically from the supermarket sector which itself is in the midst of our peers, but variable and fixed operating costs both declines at trend, which that I will detail momentarily. In addition, the cover price of The Sun rose in March and the price increased by 20p [ph] in April. We are looking forward to the launch of a redesigned Sun website in the coming weeks, which should attract more traffic and be a stronger ad platform. We believe there is clearly room for significant growth in digital advertising, given that the site itself has just emerged from behind a table. Traffic has almost doubled to more than 35 million monthly unique visitors since October, after which the site has fully opened. 
News America Marketing continues to face pressure on freestanding insert revenues. While domestic in-store display showed solid growth, our key ambition is to complement the printed coupon business with a new mobile offering, which is why the team is focused on growth at Checkout 51. Leveraging our platform at Dow Jones, the New York Post and realtor.com, has accelerated expansion of Checkout 51, and it is now in the top 10 of all free shopping apps in the Apple store. As mentioned previously, we announced this quarter that News America Marketing has agreed to settle its legacy class action lawsuit with consumer packaged goods companies that was instigated by We're pleased that we can continue to work with our long-term business partners without the unwelcome distraction of this case.
In conclusion, we are focused on rapidly shifting News Corp into higher-growth businesses while determinedly reducing our expenses at the News information services segment to better reflect the changes in the advertising market. And we are pleased with the continuing progress in digital real estate, which has become a large and growing pillar for the company's future.
With that, I will turn you to Bedi for further details on the quarter's numbers."

We reported fiscal 2016 third quarter total revenue of $1.9 billion, down 7% from the prior year period. As Robert noted, we impacted by currency headwinds although lessening from the prior quarter, which negatively impacted Q3 total reported revenues by $72 million [ph] Excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and acquisitions, just a total revenues declined 5% compared to the prior year. Reported total segment EBITDA loss of $122 million includes a onetime pretax charge of $280 million related to News America Marketing CPG class action lawsuit and related claims. Excluding that cost, total segment EBITDA would have been a positive $158 million.
Currency fluctuations impacted total reported segment EBITDA by $9 million or 5%, and we also incurred transaction cost of $7 million related to REA's acquisition of iProperty and $3 million of legal costs related to the U.K. Newspaper Matters.
For the quarter, adjusted EPS from continuing operations were $0.04 versus $0.09 in the prior year. Reported EPS from continuing operations, which includes the News America Marketing settlement charge, net of tax, were negative $0.26 compared to $0.08 in the prior year.
Turning now to the individual operating segments. In News and Information Services, revenues for the quarter declined $122 million, down 9% versus the prior year period. Adjusted segment revenue declined 6%.
Within the segment revenues, advertising declined around 15% or roughly 11% of local currency due to weakness at the SSI business in News America Marketing and in print advertising, offset by strong digital ad growth at Dow Jones.
Circulation in subscription revenues declined 4% but overall flat in local currency.
News and Information Services reported a segment EBITDA loss of $187 million. Excluding the News America Marketing settlement charge, segment EBITDA this quarter would have been a positive $93 million with decline of 18% compared to the prior year. Adjusted segment EBITDA was down 11%, an improvement from the prior quarter rate with declines at News America Marketing partially offset by growth in our newspapers due to strong improvements at both Dow Jones and News Australia.
Looking at performance across our key units. At Dow Jones domestic, advertising at The Wall Street Journal declined 4% versus the prior year quarter, a slight improvement from last quarter. Declines in print advertising were again partially offset by continued solid growth in digital, driven by strength in programmatic and custom content. And digital accounted for approximately 1/3 of Dow Jones of ad revenues this quarter. 
Wall Street Journal circulation revenue grew 5% this quarter due to higher subscription pricing and higher digital paid subscribers as print volume remained relatively stable. Digital-only paid subscribers were 893,000 for the quarter with strong double-digit gain over the prior year. And at PIB, we saw positive net installs and stable revenues, excluding currency, led principally by continued strength in the risk and compliance business.
At News Australia, advertising revenues for the quarter declined 15% or 7% in local currency. The rate of decline in print advertising moderated due to sequential improvements in the national retail categories, and we also saw a acceleration in digital advertising growth led by strength of news.com.au.
Circulation revenue at News Australia were relatively stable at constant currency as a result of cover price increases and higher paid digital subs, largely offsetting print volume declines. We took a cover price increase for the weekday metro newspapers of $0.10 during the quarter. 
Digital paid subscribers grew over 25% year-over-year, to 273,000 [ph] for newspapers and other publications as of the quarter end.
And as expected, we are seeing the benefits of the cost reduction program implemented at the end of Q2 and realized an estimated AUD 17 million of cost savings in the quarter and are on track to meet the AUD 40 million target for the second -- fiscal second half. As a result, News Australia showed improvement both on the and local currency basis compared to the prior year.
At News UK, advertising revenue declined 21% or down mid-teens in local currency, driven by weakness in print advertising at both The Sun and Times, reflecting a weakened market growth from the prior quarter. Digital, while small, as a percentage of revenue, accelerated led by results.
Circulation revenues at News UK declined mid-single digits in local currency compared to the prior year, primarily due to newsstand volume declines and the removal of The Sun's payroll, which were partially offset by subscription and cover price increases.
The key management focus at News UK improving the performance of The Sun, particularly its digital proposition.
We will be relaunching The Sun's website eminently, which will be integrated with much more video and better align for mobile users and monetization in conjunction with our video ad platform [indiscernible] 
In Q3, The Times continued to gain circulation market share and saw modest volume growth. The Times had 174,000 digital-only subs as of the quarter end, representing more than 40% of the total paid subscribers.
Declines of News UK moderated from last quarter, primarily reflecting overhead and editorial saving initiatives, low newsprint prices across our titles and cover price increases.
At News America Marketing, revenues declined 17% versus the prior year quarter. SSI weakened this quarter due to lower volumes and pricing pressure as he had anticipated. Domestic in-store, however, rose slightly this quarter. News America Marketing also incurred higher investment spending at Checkout 51, its digital and mobile group company. Checkout 51 is a key part of the strategy to digitize News America Marketing and the current focus, as Robert mentioned, is to drive up downloads and expand usage.
Turning to the book publishing segment. Revenues decreased 11%, and segment EBITDA declined to 36% versus the prior year. Declines were due to expected tougher year-ago comps in the sales of the Divergent series and American Sniper as we in the last earnings call as well as lower e-book volume across the marketplace, similar to the second quarter.
As a result, total digital revenues for the quarter were 21% [ph] of consumer revenues, down from 25% in the prior year. Divergent saw less than 1 million units this quarter compared to 2.3 million units in Q3 last year, and HarperCollins also sold 2.7 million units of American Sniper in the prior year. Combined, those 2 franchises accounted for the majority of the year-over-year revenue [indiscernible] 
Top-selling books this quarter include [indiscernible] and Pretty Happy by Kate Hudson in general trade books and by Victoria in children's.
In Digital Real Estate Services, total segment revenues increased $24 million or 14% to $194 [ph] million, which includes the consolidation of iProperty and which closed in February and the lapping of the acquisition in November 2014. Segment EBITDA was $39 million, down from $42 million in the prior year, which reflects $7 million in onetime transaction costs for the iProperty acquisition, higher plant marketing expenses at REA group and $11 million higher legal expenses at Move related to the Zillow litigation. Importantly, adjusted revenue and adjusted segment EBITDA grew 18% and 23%, respectively, inclusive of the $11 million higher legal expense at Move. As Robert noted, Move is currently in litigation with Zillow, and we would expect to incur some additional legal costs in the fourth quarter as we prepare for trial in early June.
REA's revenues grew 9% or approximately 20% in local currency due to higher lift product penetration, partially offset by an earlier Easter as compared to the prior year.
Move revenue rose 20% [ph] versus the prior year driven by strong growth in the collection for co-brokers product and higher media revenues partially offset by reduced at inventory as part of the site 3 design. Unique user growth at realtor remains strong, up 30% to 50 million average per month for fiscal Q3 and hitting a record 55 million users in April.
In Cable Network Programming, revenue decreased by $9 million or 8% compared to the prior year but on a currency adjusted basis, revenue were flat. Subscription revenues declined 5% as higher affiliate fees and subscriber gains were more than offset by FX headwinds. Excluding currencies, subscriber revenues grew around 3%.
Advertising revenues declined 18% due to the absence of the Asian Cup and the Cricket World Cup in the prior year and in local currency, ad revenues declined around 12% [ph]. 
Segment EBITDA in the quarter, however, rose 26% on a reported basis and 33% adjusted for currency due to lower acquisition costs from the absence of sporting events.
With respect to earnings from affiliates, Foxtel ended the quarter with approximately 2.9 million total subscribers subs increasing approximately 6% compared to the prior year period and higher pesto subs despite increased competition from players. Foxtel revenues for the quarter in local currency were up 3% [ph], and EBITDA declined 4% in local currency due to higher programming costs and an increase in subscriber acquisition costs driven by new launch in January. Foxtel no longer expect to increase EBITDA over fiscal 2015 due to these factors and continued focus on sales and marketing. Foxtel posted record growth cable satellite ads this quarter, driven by favorable consumer to the market. Churn in the quarter rose to 14.3% from 10.9%, which was largely driven by subscribers on no contract offers and we expect churn to remain higher than normal in the short term. However, year-to-date churn was stable and long-tenured subscribers remains near record low levels.
Heading into the fiscal fourth quarter, there are a few points to note. First, as we disclosed in our filings, this being a 53-week fiscal year for us, we have an extra week in fiscal third quarter, which should have a modest positive impact on revenue and EBITDA. We expect to see continued cost savings at NIS segment across each of our key mastheads and the flow-through of recent cost-saving initiatives. But publishing will benefit from the normalizing of comparables given the absence of Divergent comps and the strong pipeline this quarter, including the release of Watchman. We expect had to benefit from the early Easter, which should be a positive on listing volume in Q4 and Move continues to expect strong revenue growth of the back of increased audience.
And finally, CapEx for continuing operations for the year is likely to be in the $240 million to $250 [ph] million range, below the $308 million from last year. And with that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A."

And you saw today, from the announcement of the acquisition of EPL at Premier League rights fired the 6 most important clubs the day after day, week after week Peter and the team are both improving the product and most crucially, improving the projection because we believe that there's no doubt that Foxtel has the best suite of programs, there's no doubt that, that portfolio is starting to resonate. It already is resonating with long-term subscribers. It's obviously a little bit more churn when you have a lot of offers out there, but long term, we believe that the health of Foxtel is, and we have the new executive team. And I think the cleverness of the deal they've done on Premier League rights the tells you that were certainly going to look after our fans who like EPL but we were never acquire EPL in a way that would hurt EPS. Now you might want to watch a game in the middle of the night and pay a lot of money to do that. That's what Australians would call a nocturnal marsupial, but you're a rather sad and sultry person in the middle of the night. You could watch the game with your family at lunchtime and cheer on your favorite players and one other thing about particularly interesting offering the team have Foxtel is also be able to see all reserve games, the under 21 games. And so we have well known players like Jack come back into the intermediate teams ahead of playing in the mountain, you'll be able to watch those games as well."

In our pursuit of digital and particularly, mobile growth, we continue to develop and to diversify the portfolio of our businesses and aggressively control our operating costs to free resources for further innovation and to expand margins",2369,"Thank you, Mike. In our pursuit of digital and particularly, mobile growth, we continue to develop and to diversify the portfolio of our businesses and aggressively control our operating costs to free resources for further innovation and to expand margins across the company.
The third quarter results were materially affected by a $280 million pretax charge at News America Marketing to resolve a legacy lawsuit and related plans and continued currency headwinds, which impacted revenues by $72 million and EBITDA by $9 million. Excluding those factors and other special items, our revenues and total segment EBITDA declined 5% and 8%, respectively, which was disappointing. We believe, however, that the company is on track to see improvements in the fourth quarter with the expansion of our digital real estate business, foreign currency comparisons hopefully beginning to ease and cost saving initiatives that confirm the root. 
Our pursuit of digital growth continues apace, and we enhanced our status as the world's largest digital property company with REA's completion of the iProperty acquisition in Southeast Asia, where we are now the most influential player. Meanwhile, traffic and revenue growth remains robust at REA and realtor.com. We are focused on driving mobile revenue and are pleased with, but not complacent about, the results at realtor.com, where the mobile audience grew close to 50% this quarter and now represents 60% of page views and the majority of leads. 
Despite the difficult conditions for advertising, we saw both Dow Jones and News Corp Australia contributing to segment EBITDA growth, thanks to more digital subscriptions, digital advertising growth and ongoing cost reduction. 
While we believe in the strength of our print properties, we are investing energetically in the rapid pursuit of digital, which is clearly evident in the transition at Dow Jones. 
At Dow Jones this quarter, digital accounted for more than 50% of total revenues, and digital-only subscribers at The Wall Street Journal grew to 893,000, representing nearly 45% of the base. 
We are building a strong digital platform on top of the WSJ print circulation, which today is double the size of its nearest rival. And 51% of The Wall Street Journal digital audience now comes from mobile, up 6 percentage points from a year ago.
With the advertising market in the midst of upheaval, advertisers and agencies are understandably experimenting with their spend, but we firmly believe that premium brands and audiences are currently undervalued by advertising agencies, some of whom are more interested in fashion than function. 
With Silicon Valley's demand for quality content more voracious than ever and advertisers rightly seeking greater digital accountability, we believe News Corp is ideally positioned to capitalize on these macro trends through the power of our global mastheads, businesses and audiences.
Bedi will shortly provide more granular detail of the numbers, but reported revenues fell 7% to $1.9 billion, and the reported total segment EBITDA loss was $122 million. Excluding the onetime pretax legal charge of $280 million at News America Marketing, total segment EBITDA would have been $158 million, a decline of 14%. We are very focused on leveraging the key strength of our portfolio. As one example, we recently reached an agreement with a leading consumer packaged goods company that involves both News America Marketing and realtor.com, and we expect many more such deals as advertisers appreciate the value of our brand and deep audience relationships.
Let me review some of our lines of business, beginning with Digital Real Estate Services. With the ongoing success of REA, the completion of REA's acquisition of iProperty and the growth of realtor.com, News Corp's digital real estate business is continuing its robust expansion. iProperty is the leading digital platform in Southeast Asia, complementing our existing businesses and allowing the further repurposing of software and of expertise. 
News Corp Australia also completed the acquisition of DIAKRIT, a leading provider of 3D visualization for the real estate industry, which we plan to incorporate more broadly at REA and around the industry. This will help differentiate News Corp's digital real estate capabilities worldwide and provide a valuable service to realtors, vendors and buyers. 
For the most recent quarter, revenues at Move, which operates realtor.com, expanded at 20% year-over-year, while user engagement at realtor.com continued to grow briskly, with page views more than 25% higher to a record 1.5 billion views and minutes spent on the site increasing nearly 30% year-over-year. 
We have momentum and the strongest engagement in the U.S. housing market. A market that we believe is yet to fully recover from the financial crisis and is still at a relatively early phase of its digital evolution.
Also in this quarter, average monthly unique users increased by 30% year-over-year, including strong growth in mobile. For the month of April, we recorded 55 million monthly uniques, and the average user of our mobile app accessed around 20 pages per visit, and that's not including photo galleries. We are continuing to improve our product line to enhance the services for realtors and the efficacy for users. We have a number of new products coming to market at realtor.com, including Turbo, which will assist the promotion of listings for agents and brokers. 
Early in fiscal 2017, we plan to roll out Showcase 2.0 to provide even more direct links to properties and leads for realtors, vendors and buyers. We are also enhancing our software and services offerings for agents to improve the efficiency of their business and bolster the efficacy of leads and ROI. We continue to enhance the site experience to drive deeper engagement, personalization and integrating more relevant content with robust local neighborhood information.
In Australia, where digital real estate is at a more advanced stage of development, the REA group had a solid quarter with revenues expanding by 20% year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign currency, thanks primarily to the broader penetration of premium products. 
REA in Australia has more than twice the traffic of its nearest competitor, and REA continues to work ever more closely with realtor.com and other News Corp properties. One modest sign of that partnership was the successful launch this past week by the Australian newspaper of a glossy magazine, Mansion, based on The Wall Street Journal's well-known section and in conjunction with REA. 
Overall, excluding currency and M&A costs, adjusted revenues at the Digital Real Estate Services segment grew 18% and adjusted EBITDA grew 23% year-over-year despite the higher legal costs at Move, which is involved in ongoing litigation in tandem with the National Association of Realtors against Zillow over the theft of corporate secrets and the destruction of evidence. 
In Australia, Fox Sports posted strong EBITDA growth, in part due to the absence of costs [ph] from the Cricket World Cup and Asia Cup in the prior year. We are encouraged by the particularly robust ratings with the launch of the new season of Rugby League and Australian Rules Football. 
The NRL and AFL are both up low double digits over the prior year. We believe the strong early returns in both sports this year are positive indicators for subscriber growth and advertising and highlight the value of our deals to secure NRL and Aussie Rules rights until 2022. These key sports should provide a platform for the long-term growth of our franchise.
At Foxtel, we saw the appointment of Peter Tonagh as CEO, and expect that he will further develop the company, which we operate in partnership with Telstra in Australia. There have been several changes to the Foxtel executive team, and we are confident that the development of products and, crucially, the marketing of those products will be enhanced over the coming year. In a challenging marketplace, Foxtel grew subscribers to around 2.9 million subs, which included a roughly 6% increase in cable and satellite subs versus the prior year and higher Presto subscribers. 
And Foxtel is announcing today an agreement with 6 top English Premier League clubs, launching 3 dedicated channels with all home and away matches for Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United, Manchester City, Tottenham Hotspur and most significantly and profoundly, Arsenal. These teams account for 75% of the EPL fan base in Australia. 
This agreement is yet another strong sign of how Foxtel differentiates itself from the competition with its premier content, which we believe also includes Australia's best portfolio of films and other programs and a growing roster of homegrown dramas that are proven audience pleasers. We expect our new team will make that point to consumers tempted by lesser offerings from other providers who may have name recognition but a relatively limited flow of compelling content.
Foxtel, which has an approximate 14% equity stake in the Ten Network, is already seeing benefits from the MCN advertising joint venture. The partnership with MCN delivers a broadened sales platform and obvious operating efficiencies. It is worth noting that Ten was the only free-to-air network to gain market share in its fiscal first half. 
While HarperCollins faced a challenging quarter as we had foreshadowed due to tough comparisons with the strong sales of Divergent and American Sniper last year, the trends do appear to be improving. There is a stronger pipeline, including the paperback edition of Go Set a Watchman and the publication of Megan Kelly's first book, scheduled to appear this November. 
In the next fiscal year, we look forward to launching the latest books from Daniel Silva, Patricia Cornwall and Veronica Roth, the author of the Divergent series, whose next novel, Carve The Mark, the first part of a duology is due for release in January. 
The book's cover was released today to much acclaim by Veronica's many, many fans. As a result, we are encouraged by the outlook for the next fiscal year and expect to see improved year-over-year comparisons in the current quarter. We also continue to strengthen our international operations to make the most of hit books globally. For example, by having taken full control of our operations in Italy and France and expanding in India.
At News and Information Services, while print ad market, particularly in the U.K., remains somewhat challenging and News America Marketing's FSI revenues were certainly under pressure, we are continuing to rightsize our cost structure while emphasizing the importance of high-quality content and providing creative products and quality audiences for our advertisers. 
This quarter, segment EBITDA reflected positive growth at both Dow Jones and at News Corp Australia, thanks in part to the benefits of earlier efficiencies.
Let me take a moment to discuss some of our cost initiatives in detail. At News Australia, we've announced an initial goal of 5% in annualized fixed cost reductions across the business, and we are well on the way to achieving that target with AUD 40 million of cost savings expected in the second half of this fiscal year. 
These savings range from lower production costs to the closure of loss-making businesses and reduced headcount across the divisions. This, along with the moderation in print ad declines and acceleration in digital revenue, has contributed to News Corp Australia's stronger growth this quarter. As a way to demonstrate our scale, according to a new study by Nielsen and the IAB, News Corp digital properties reached just under 16 million Australians above the age of 14 each month, which is higher than Facebook. 
At Dow Jones, expenses moderated, thanks to a combination of lower sales and marketing spend and reduced newsprint expense. We continue to make strides in circulation, outpacing our peers, and as we've communicated, we have ambitious goals for ongoing digital growth. In this quarter, we also relaunched the MarketWatch website and we've seen 20% revenue growth with quarterly traffic exceeding 20 million unique users and page views of over 150 million, up high teens versus the second quarter. 
At the professional information business, we rolled our customized newswires, created a new vertical targeted at financial regulation and launched Factiva Mobile, providing additional avenues of future growth and improving the service for our professional subscribers. Revenues at our risk and compliance business grew 30% year-over-year, and the tougher regulatory climate in many sectors, particularly in financial services, is clearly stimulating demand for our products.
At News UK, we still see challenges in the ad market. There was continued weakness in print demand, specifically from the supermarket sector, which itself is in the midst of upheaval. But variable and fixed operating costs have both declined, a trend which Bedi will detail momentarily. In addition, the cover price of The Sun rose 10p in March and The Times cover price increased by 20p in April. We are looking forward to the launch of a redesigned Sun website in the coming weeks, which should attract more traffic and be a stronger ad platform. 
We believe there is clearly room for significant growth in digital advertising at The Sun, given that the site itself has just emerged from behind a payable. Traffic has almost doubled to more than 35 million monthly unique visitors since October, after which the site was fully opened. 
News America Marketing continues to face pressure on freestanding insert revenues, while domestic in-store display showed solid growth. Our key ambition is to complement the printed coupon business with a new mobile offering, which is why the team is focused on growth at Checkout 51. Leveraging our platforms at Dow Jones, the New York Post and realtor.com, NAM has accelerated expansion of Checkout 51 and it is now in the top 10 of all free shopping apps in the Apple store. 
As mentioned previously, we announced this quarter that News America Marketing has agreed to settle its legacy class action lawsuit with consumer packaged good companies that was instigated by trial lawyers. We're pleased that we can continue to work with our long-term business partners without the unwelcome distraction of this case.
In conclusion, we are focused on rapidly shifting News Corp into higher-growth businesses while determinedly reducing our expenses at the News and Information Services segment to better reflect the changes in the advertising market. And we are pleased with the continuing progress in digital real estate, which has become a large and growing pillar for the company's future.
With that, I'll turn you to Bedi for further details on the quarter's numbers."

As Robert noted, we were again impacted by currency headwinds, although lessening from the prior quarter, which negatively impacted Q3",1772,"Thanks, Robert. We reported fiscal 2016 third quarter total revenue of $1.9 billion, down 7% from the prior year period. As Robert noted, we were again impacted by currency headwinds, although lessening from the prior quarter, which negatively impacted Q3 total reported revenues by $72 million. Excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and acquisitions, adjusted total revenues declined 5% compared to the prior year. 
Reported total segment EBITDA loss of $122 million includes a onetime pretax charge of $280 million related to News America Marketing settlement of the CPG class-action lawsuit and related claims. Excluding that cost, total segment EBITDA would have been a positive $158 million.
Currency fluctuations impacted total reported segment EBITDA by $9 million or 5%, and we also incurred transaction cost of $7 million related to REA's acquisition of iProperty and $3 million of legal costs related to the UK newspaper matters.
For the quarter, adjusted EPS from continuing operations was $0.04 versus $0.09 in the prior year. Reported EPS from continuing operations, which includes the News America Marketing settlement charge net of tax, were negative $0.26 compared to $0.08 in the prior year.
Turning now to the individual operating segments. In News and Information Services, revenues for the quarter declined $122 million, down 9% versus the prior year period. Adjusted segment revenue declined 6%.
Within the segment revenues, advertising declined around 15% or roughly 11% in local currency due to weakness at the FSI business in News America Marketing and in print advertising, offset by strong digital ad growth at Dow Jones.
Circulation and subscription revenues declined 4%, but were overall flat in local currency.
News and Information Services reported a segment EBITDA loss of $187 million. Excluding the News America Marketing settlement charge, segment EBITDA this quarter would have been a positive $93 million, a decline of 18% compared to the prior year. Adjusted segment EBITDA was down 11%, an improvement from the prior quarter rate, with declines at News America Marketing partially offset by growth in our newspapers due to strong improvements at both Dow Jones and News Australia.
Looking at performance across our key units. At Dow Jones, domestic advertising at The Wall Street Journal declined 4% versus the prior year quarter, a slight improvement from last quarter. Declines in print advertising were again partially offset by continued solid growth in digital, driven by strength in programmatic and custom content. And digital accounted for approximately 1/3 of Dow Jones' ad revenues this quarter. 
Wall Street Journal circulation revenue grew 5% this quarter due to higher subscription pricing and higher digital paid subscribers as print volume remained relatively stable. Digital-only paid subscribers were 893,000 for the quarter, a strong double-digit gain over the prior year. And at PIB, we saw positive net installs and stable revenues excluding currency, led principally by continued strength in the risk and compliance business.
At News Australia, advertising revenues for the quarter declined 15% or 7% in local currency. The rate of decline in print advertising moderated due to sequential improvements in the national and retail categories, and we also saw an acceleration in digital advertising growth compared to last quarter, led by strength at news.com.au.
Circulation revenues at News Australia were relatively stable in constant currency as a result of cover price increases and higher paid digital subs, largely offsetting print volume declines. We took a cover price increase for the weekday Metro newspapers of $0.10 during the quarter. 
Digital paid subscribers grew over 25% year-over-year, to 273,000 for newspapers and other publications as of the quarter end.
And as expected, we are seeing the benefit of the cost reduction program implemented at the end of Q2 and realized an estimated AUD 17 million of cost savings in the quarter and are on track to meet the AUD 40 million target for the second -- fiscal second half. As a result, News Australia showed improvement both on reported and local currency basis compared to the prior year.
At News UK, advertising revenues declined 21% or down mid-teens in local currency, driven by weakness in print advertising at both The Sun and Times, reflecting a weakened marketplace from the prior quarter. Digital, while small, as a percentage of revenue, accelerated led by The Sun.
Circulation revenues at News UK declined mid-single digits in local currency compared to the prior year, primarily due to news stand volume declines and the removal of The Sun's paywall, which were partially offset by subscription and cover price increases.
The key management focus at News UK is on improving the performance at The Sun, particularly its digital proposition.
We will be relaunching The Sun's website imminently, which will be integrated with much more video and better align for mobile usage and monetization in conjunction with our video ad platform unruly.
In Q3, The Times continued to gain circulation market share and saw modest volume growth. The Times had 174,000 digital-only subs as of the quarter end, representing more than 40% of the total paid subscribers.
Declines at News UK moderated from last quarter, primarily reflecting overhead and editorial saving initiatives, lower newsprint prices across our titles and cover price increases.
At News America Marketing, revenues declined 17% versus the prior year quarter. FSI weakened this quarter due to lower volumes and pricing pressure as we had anticipated. Domestic in-store, however, rose slightly this quarter. News America Marketing also incurred higher investment spending at Checkout 51, its digital and mobile coupon company. Checkout 51 is a key part of the strategy to digitize News America Marketing, and the current focus, as Robert mentioned, is to drive up downloads and expand usage.
Turning to the Book Publishing segment. Revenues decreased 11%, and segment EBITDA declined 36% versus the prior year. Declines were due to expected tougher year ago comps from the sales of the Divergent series and American Sniper, as we noted in the last earnings call as well as lower e-book volume across the marketplace, similar to the second quarter. As a result, total digital revenues for the quarter were 21% of consumer revenues, down from 25% in the prior year. 
Divergent saw less than 1 million units this quarter compared to 2.3 million units in Q3 last year, and HarperCollins also sold 2.7 million units of American Sniper in the prior year. Combined, those 2 franchises accounted for the majority of the year-over-year revenue shortfall.
Top-selling books this quarter include The Nest by Cynthia Sweeney, and Pretty Happy by Kate Hudson in general trade books and the Glass Sword by Victoria Aveyard in children's.
In Digital Real Estate Services, total segment revenues increased $24 million or 14% to $194 million, which includes the consolidation of iProperty and DIAKRIT, which closed in February and the lapping of the Move acquisition in November 2014. Segment EBITDA was $39 million, down from $42 million in the prior year, which reflects $7 million in onetime transaction costs for the iProperty acquisition, higher planned marketing expenses at REA group and $11 million higher legal expenses at Move related to the Zillow litigation. 
Importantly, adjusted revenue and adjusted segment EBITDA grew 18% and 23%, respectively, inclusive of the $11 million higher legal expense at Move. As Robert noted, Move is currently in litigation with Zillow, and we would expect to incur some additional legal costs in the fourth quarter as we prepare for trial in early June.
REA's revenues grew 9% or approximately 20% in local currency due to higher list depth product penetration, partially offset by an earlier Easter as compared to the prior year.
Move revenue rose 20% versus the prior year, driven by strong growth in the connection for core brokers product and higher non-listing media revenues, partially offset by reduced ad inventory as part of the site redesign. Unique user growth at Realtor remains strong, up 30% to 50 million average per month for fiscal Q3 and hitting a record 55 million users in April.
In Cable Network Programming, revenues decreased by $9 million or 8% compared to the prior year, but on a currency adjusted basis, revenues were flat. Subscription revenues declined 5% as higher affiliate fees and subscriber gains were more than offset by FX headwinds. Excluding currency, subscriber revenues grew around 3%.
Advertising revenues declined 18% due to the absence of the Asian Cup and the Cricket World Cup in the prior year. And in local currency, ad revenues declined around 12%.
Segment EBITDA in the quarter, however, rose 26% on a reported basis and 33% adjusted for currency due to lower acquisition costs from the absence of these 2 sporting events.
With respect to earnings from affiliates, Foxtel ended the quarter with approximately 2.9 million total subscribers, with cable and satellite subs increasing approximately 6% compared to the prior year period and higher Presto subs despite increased competitions from SVOD players. 
Foxtel revenues for the quarter in local currency were up 2% and EBITDA declined 4% in local currency due to higher programming costs and an increase in subscriber acquisition costs driven by new offers launched in January. Foxtel no longer expects to increase EBITDA over fiscal 2015 due to these factors and continued focus on sales and marketing. Foxtel posted record growth cable and satellite ads this quarter, driven by favorable consumer reception to offers in the market. 
Churn in the quarter rose to 14.3% from 10.9%, which was largely driven by subscribers on no contract offers, and we expect churn to remain higher than normal in the short term. However, year-to-date churn was relatively stable and amongst longer tenured subscribers remains near record low levels.
Heading into the fiscal fourth quarter, there are a few points to note. First, as we've disclosed in our filings, this being a 53-week fiscal year for us, we have an extra week in fiscal fourth quarter, which should have a modest positive impact on revenue and EBITDA. We expect to see continued cost savings at NIS segment across each of our key mastheads and the flow-through of recent cost-saving initiatives. 
Book Publishing should benefit from the normalizing of comparables given the absence of Divergent comps and a strong pipeline this quarter, including the paperback release of Go Set a Watchman. We expect REA to benefit from the early Easter, which should be a positive on listing volume in Q4,, and Move continues to expect strong revenue growth of the back of increased audience.
And finally, CapEx for continuing operations for the year is likely to be in the $240 million to $260 million range, below the $308 million from last year. 
And with that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A."

It already is resonating with long-term subscribers. It's obviously a little bit more churn when you have a lot of offers out there, but long term, we believe that the health of Foxtel is robust and that we have full faith in the new executive team. And I think the cleverness of the deal that they've done on Premier League rights tells you that we're certainly going to look after our fans who like EPL, but we were never going to acquire EPL in a way that would hurt EPS. Now you might want to watch a game in the middle of the night and pay a lot of money to do that. That's what Australians would call a nocturnal marsupial, but you're a rather sad and sultry person in the middle of the night, or you could watch the game, frankly, with your family at lunchtime and cheer on your favorite players. And one other thing about the -- particularly interesting offering that Peter and the team have at Foxtel is that you'll also be able to see all the reserve games, the under 21 games, and so well known players like Santi Cazorla or Jack Wilshere come back into the intermediate teams ahead of playing in the mountain, you'll be able to watch those games as well."

You mentioned MarketWatch earlier. I guess, where do you see the opportunities and how are you exploiting them? And then as a follow-up, one of your publishing peers, I think, when they were at a similar level of subs, within about a year they passed 1 million. So I guess any color on -- if you could comment on what your own sort of broad timeline is for hitting that key threshold of 1 million digital-only subs."

And I think you need to see the Dow Jones offering as essentially having 3 segments, the B2C and the B2B, which -- both of which are well known, in fact, Factiva and newswires, venture capital related verticals are at the B2B side, but there's also a very strong B2P play between the consumer and the business.

You may have noticed just over 2 weeks ago, we traded a packaged libertarian site called Heat Street. Heat Street has picked up 1 million uniques in just over 2 weeks. Our external marketing spend on Heat Street, $10,000. So I mean, that is proof of the power of our platforms relative to external platforms.

In our pursuit of digital and particularly, mobile growth, we continue to develop and to diversify the portfolio of our businesses and aggressively control our operating costs to free resources for further innovation and to expand margins across the company.
The third quarter results were materially affected by a $280 million pretax charge at News America Marketing to resolve a legacy lawsuit and related plans and continued currency headwinds, which impacted revenues by $72 million and EBITDA by $9 million. Excluding those factors and other special items, our revenues and total segment EBITDA declined 5% and 8%, respectively, which was disappointing. We believe, however, that the company is on track to see improvements in the fourth quarter with the expansion of our digital real estate business, foreign currency comparisons hopefully beginning to ease and cost saving initiatives that confirm the route [ph].

Meanwhile, traffic and revenue growth remains robust at REA and realtor.com. We are focused on driving mobile revenue and are pleased with, but not complacent about, the results at realtor.com, where the mobile audience grew close to 50% this quarter and now represents 60% of page views and the majority of leads. 
Despite the difficult conditions for advertising, we saw both Dow Jones and News Corp Australia contributing to segment EBITDA growth, thanks to more digital subscriptions, digital advertising growth and ongoing cost reduction. 
While we believe in the strength of our print properties, we are investing energetically in the rapid pursuit of digital, which is clearly evident in the transition at Dow Jones. 
At Dow Jones this quarter, digital accounted for more than 50% of total revenues, and digital-only subscribers at The Wall Street Journal grew to 893,000, representing nearly 45% of the base. 
We are building a strong digital platform on top of the WSJ print circulation, which today is double the size of its nearest rival. And 51% of The Wall Street Journal digital audience now comes from mobile, up 6 percentage points from a year ago.
With the advertising market in the midst of upheaval, advertisers and agencies are understandably experimenting with their spend, but we firmly believe that premium brands and audiences are currently undervalued by advertising agencies, some of whom are more interested in fashion than function. 
With Silicon Valley's demand for quality content more voracious than ever and advertisers rightly seeking greater digital accountability, we believe News Corp is ideally positioned to capitalize on these macro trends through the power of our global mastheads, businesses and audiences.
Bedi will shortly provide more granular detail of the numbers, but reported revenues fell 7% to $1.9 billion, and the reported total segment EBITDA loss was $122 million. Excluding the onetime pretax legal charge of $280 million at News America Marketing, total segment EBITDA would have been $158 million, a decline of 14%. We are very focused on leveraging the key strength of our portfolio. As one example, we recently reached an agreement with a leading consumer packaged goods company that involves both News America Marketing and realtor.com, and we expect many more such deals as advertisers appreciate the value of our brand and deep audience relationships.
Let me review some of our lines of business, beginning with Digital Real Estate Services. With the ongoing success of REA, the completion of REA's acquisition of iProperty and the growth of realtor.com, News Corp's digital real estate business is continuing its robust expansion. iProperty is the leading digital platform in Southeast Asia, complementing our existing businesses and allowing the further repurposing of software and of expertise. 
News Corp Australia also completed the acquisition of DIAKRIT, a leading provider of 3D visualization for the real estate industry, which we plan to incorporate more broadly at REA and around the industry. This will help differentiate News Corp's digital real estate capabilities worldwide and provide a valuable service to realtors, vendors and buyers. 
For the most recent quarter, revenues at Move, which operates realtor.com, expanded at 20% year-over-year, while user engagement at realtor.com continued to grow briskly, with page views more than 25% higher to a record 1.5 billion views and minutes spent on the site increasing nearly 30% year-over-year. 
We have momentum and the strongest engagement in the U.S. housing market. A market that we believe is yet to fully recover from the financial crisis and is still at a relatively early phase of its digital evolution.
Also in this quarter, average monthly unique users increased by 30% year-over-year, including strong growth in mobile. For the month of April, we recorded 55 million monthly uniques, and the average user of our mobile app accessed around 20 pages per visit, and that's not including photo galleries. We are continuing to improve our product line to enhance the services for realtors and the efficacy for users. We have a number of new products coming to market at realtor.com, including Turbo, which will assist the promotion of listings for agents and brokers. 
Early in fiscal 2017, we plan to roll out Showcase 2.0 to provide even more direct links to properties and leads for realtors, vendors and buyers. We are also enhancing our software and services offerings for agents to improve the efficiency of their business and bolster the efficacy of leads and ROI. We continue to enhance the site experience to drive deeper engagement, personalization and integrating more relevant content with robust local neighborhood information.
In Australia, where digital real estate is at a more advanced stage of development, the REA group had a solid quarter with revenues expanding by 20% year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign currency, thanks primarily to the broader penetration of premium products. 
REA in Australia has more than twice the traffic of its nearest competitor, and REA continues to work ever more closely with realtor.com and other News Corp properties. One modest sign of that partnership was the successful launch this past week by the Australian newspaper of a glossy magazine, Mansion, based on The Wall Street Journal's well-known section and in conjunction with REA. 
Overall, excluding currency and M&A costs, adjusted revenues at the Digital Real Estate Services segment grew 18% and adjusted EBITDA grew 23% year-over-year despite the higher legal costs at Move, which is involved in ongoing litigation in tandem with the National Association of Realtors against Zillow over the theft of corporate secrets and the destruction of evidence. 
In Australia, Fox Sports posted strong EBITDA growth, in part due to the absence of costs from the Cricket World Cup and Asia Cup in the prior year. We are encouraged by the particularly robust ratings with the launch of the new season of Rugby League and Australian rules football. 
The NRL and AFL are both up low double digits over the prior year. We believe the strong early returns in both sports this year are positive indicators for subscriber growth and advertising and highlight the value of our deals to secure NRL and Aussie Rules rights until 2022. These key sports should provide a platform for the long-term growth of our franchise.
At Foxtel, we saw the appointment of Peter Tonagh as CEO, and expect that he will further develop the company, which we operate in partnership with Telstra in Australia. There have been several changes to the Foxtel executive team, and we are confident that the development of products and, crucially, the marketing of those products will be enhanced over the coming year. In a challenging marketplace, Foxtel grew subscribers to around 2.9 million subs, which included a roughly 6% increase in cable and satellite subs versus the prior year and higher Presto subscribers. 
And Foxtel is announcing today an agreement with 6 top English Premier League clubs, launching 3 dedicated channels with all home and away matches for Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United, Manchester City, Tottenham Hotspur and most significantly and profoundly, Arsenal. These teams account for 75% of the EPL fan base in Australia. 
This agreement is yet another strong sign of how Foxtel differentiates itself from the competition with its premier content, which we believe also includes Australia's best portfolio of films and other programs and a growing roster of homegrown dramas that are proven audience pleasers. We expect our new team will make that point to consumers tempted by lesser offerings from other providers who may have name recognition but a relatively limited flow of compelling content.
Foxtel, which has an approximate 14% equity stake in the Ten Network, is already seeing benefits from the MCN advertising joint venture. The partnership with MCN delivers a broadened sales platform and obvious operating efficiencies. It is worth noting that Ten was the only free-to-air network to gain market share in its fiscal first half. 
While HarperCollins faced a challenging quarter as we had foreshadowed due to tough comparisons with the strong sales of Divergent and American Sniper last year, the trends do appear to be improving. There is a stronger pipeline, including the paperback edition of Go Set a Watchman and the publication of Megyn Kelly's first book, scheduled to appear this November. 
In the next fiscal year, we look forward to launching the latest books from Daniel Silva, Patricia Cornwall and Veronica Roth, the author of the Divergent series, whose next novel, Carve The Mark, the first part of a duology is due for release in January. 
The book's cover was released today to much acclaim by Veronica's many, many fans. As a result, we are encouraged by the outlook for the next fiscal year and expect to see improved year-over-year comparisons in the current quarter. We also continue to strengthen our international operations to make the most of hit books globally. For example, by having taken full control of our operations in Italy and France and expanding in India.
At News and Information Services, while print ad market, particularly in the U.K., remains somewhat challenging and News America Marketing's FSI revenues were certainly under pressure, we are continuing to rightsize our cost structure while emphasizing the importance of high-quality content and providing creative products and quality audiences for our advertisers. 
This quarter, segment EBITDA reflected positive growth at both Dow Jones and at News Corp Australia, thanks in part to the benefits of earlier efficiencies.
Let me take a moment to discuss some of our cost initiatives in detail. At News Australia, we've announced an initial goal of 5% in annualized fixed cost reductions across the business, and we are well on the way to achieving that target with AUD 40 million of cost savings expected in the second half of this fiscal year. 
These savings range from lower production costs to the closure of loss-making businesses and reduced headcount across the divisions. This, along with the moderation in print ad declines and acceleration in digital revenue, has contributed to News Corp Australia's stronger growth this quarter. As a way to demonstrate our scale, according to a new study by Nielsen and the IAB, News Corp digital properties reached just under 16 million Australians above the age of 14 each month, which is higher than Facebook. 
At Dow Jones, expenses moderated, thanks to a combination of lower sales and marketing spend and reduced newsprint expense. We continue to make strides in circulation, outpacing our peers, and as we've communicated, we have ambitious goals for ongoing digital growth. In this quarter, we also relaunched the MarketWatch website and we've seen 20% revenue growth with quarterly traffic exceeding 20 million unique users and page views of over 150 million, up high teens versus the second quarter. 
At the professional information business, we rolled out customized newswires, created a new vertical targeted at financial regulation and launched Factiva Mobile, providing additional avenues of future growth and improving the service for our professional subscribers. Revenues at our risk and compliance business grew 30% year-over-year, and the tougher regulatory climate in many sectors, particularly in financial services, is clearly stimulating demand for our products.
At News UK, we still see challenges in the ad market. There was continued weakness in print demand, specifically from the supermarket sector, which itself is in the midst of upheaval. But variable and fixed operating costs have both declined, a trend which Bedi will detail momentarily. In addition, the cover price of The Sun rose 10p in March and The Times cover price increased by 20p in April. We are looking forward to the launch of a redesigned Sun website in the coming weeks, which should attract more traffic and be a stronger ad platform. 
We believe there is clearly room for significant growth in digital advertising at The Sun, given that the site itself has just emerged from behind a payable. Traffic has almost doubled to more than 35 million monthly unique visitors since October, after which the site was fully opened. 
News America Marketing continues to face pressure on freestanding insert revenues, while domestic in-store display showed solid growth. Our key ambition is to complement the printed coupon business with a new mobile offering, which is why the team is focused on growth at Checkout 51. Leveraging our platforms at Dow Jones, the New York Post and realtor.com, NAM has accelerated expansion of Checkout 51 and it is now in the top 10 of all free shopping apps in the Apple store. 
As mentioned previously, we announced this quarter that News America Marketing has agreed to settle its legacy class action lawsuit with consumer packaged goods companies that was instigated by trial lawyers. We're pleased that we can continue to work with our long-term business partners without the unwelcome distraction of this case.
In conclusion, we are focused on rapidly shifting News Corp into higher-growth businesses while determinedly reducing our expenses at the News and Information Services segment to better reflect the changes in the advertising market. And we are pleased with the continuing progress in digital real estate, which has become a large and growing pillar for the company's future.
With that, I'll turn you to Bedi for further details on the quarter's numbers."
212741644,331123738,976685,"News Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, May 05, 2016",2016-05-05,"Earnings Calls","News Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Robert. We reported fiscal 2016 third quarter total revenue of $1.9 billion, down 7% from the prior year period. As Robert noted, we were again impacted by currency headwinds, although lessening from the prior quarter, which negatively impacted Q3",1773,"Thanks, Robert. We reported fiscal 2016 third quarter total revenue of $1.9 billion, down 7% from the prior year period. As Robert noted, we were again impacted by currency headwinds, although lessening from the prior quarter, which negatively impacted Q3 total reported revenues by $72 million. Excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and acquisitions, adjusted total revenues declined 5% compared to the prior year. 
Reported total segment EBITDA loss of $122 million includes a onetime pretax charge of $280 million related to News America Marketing settlement of the CPG class-action lawsuit and related claims. Excluding that cost, total segment EBITDA would have been a positive $158 million.
Currency fluctuations impacted total reported segment EBITDA by $9 million or 5%, and we also incurred transaction cost of $7 million related to REA's acquisition of iProperty and $3 million of legal costs related to the UK newspaper matters.
For the quarter, adjusted EPS from continuing operations was $0.04 versus $0.09 in the prior year. Reported EPS from continuing operations, which includes the News America Marketing settlement charge net of tax, was negative $0.26 compared to $0.08 in the prior year.
Turning now to the individual operating segments. In News and Information Services, revenues for the quarter declined $122 million, down 9% versus the prior year period. Adjusted segment revenue declined 6%.
Within the segment revenues, advertising declined around 15% or roughly 11% in local currency due to weakness at the FSI business in News America Marketing and in print advertising, offset by strong digital ad growth at Dow Jones.
Circulation and subscription revenues declined 4%, but were overall flat in local currency.
News and Information Services reported a segment EBITDA loss of $187 million. Excluding the News America Marketing settlement charge, segment EBITDA this quarter would have been a positive $93 million, a decline of 18% compared to the prior year. Adjusted segment EBITDA was down 11%, an improvement from the prior quarter rate, with declines at News America Marketing partially offset by growth in our newspapers due to strong improvements at both Dow Jones and News Australia.
Looking at performance across our key units. At Dow Jones, domestic advertising at The Wall Street Journal declined 4% versus the prior year quarter, a slight improvement from last quarter. Declines in print advertising were again partially offset by continued solid growth in digital, driven by strength in programmatic and custom content. And digital accounted for approximately 1/3 of Dow Jones' ad revenues this quarter. 
Wall Street Journal circulation revenue grew 5% this quarter due to higher subscription pricing and higher digital paid subscribers as print volume remained relatively stable. Digital-only paid subscribers were 893,000 for the quarter, a strong double-digit gain over the prior year. And at PIB, we saw positive net installs and stable revenues excluding currency, led principally by continued strength in the risk and compliance business.
At News Australia, advertising revenues for the quarter declined 15% or 7% in local currency. The rate of decline in print advertising moderated due to sequential improvements in the national and retail categories, and we also saw an acceleration in digital advertising growth compared to last quarter, led by strength at news.com.au.
Circulation revenues at News Australia were relatively stable in constant currency as a result of cover price increases and higher paid digital subs, largely offsetting print volume declines. We took a cover price increase for the weekday Metro newspapers of $0.10 during the quarter. 
Digital paid subscribers grew over 25% year-over-year, to 273,000 for newspapers and other publications as of the quarter end.
And as expected, we are seeing the benefit of the cost reduction program implemented at the end of Q2 and realized an estimated AUD 17 million of cost savings in the quarter and are on track to meet the AUD 40 million target for the second -- fiscal second half. As a result, News Australia showed improvement both on reported and local currency basis compared to the prior year.
At News UK, advertising revenues declined 21% or down mid-teens in local currency, driven by weakness in print advertising at both The Sun and Times, reflecting a weakened marketplace from the prior quarter. Digital, while small, as a percentage of revenue, accelerated led by The Sun.
Circulation revenues at News UK declined mid-single digits in local currency compared to the prior year, primarily due to news stand volume declines and the removal of The Sun's paywall, which were partially offset by subscription and cover price increases.
The key management focus at News UK is on improving the performance at The Sun, particularly its digital proposition.
We will be relaunching The Sun's website imminently, which will be integrated with much more video and better align for mobile usage and monetization in conjunction with our video ad platform, Unruly.
In Q3, The Times continued to gain circulation market share and saw modest volume growth. The Times had 174,000 digital-only subs as of the quarter end, representing more than 40% of the total paid subscribers.
Declines at News UK moderated from last quarter, primarily reflecting overhead and editorial saving initiatives, lower newsprint prices across our titles and cover price increases.
At News America Marketing, revenues declined 17% versus the prior year quarter. FSI weakened this quarter due to lower volumes and pricing pressure as we had anticipated. Domestic in-store, however, rose slightly this quarter. News America Marketing also incurred higher investment spending at Checkout 51, its digital and mobile coupon company. Checkout 51 is a key part of the strategy to digitize News America Marketing, and the current focus, as Robert mentioned, is to drive up downloads and expand usage.
Turning to the Book Publishing segment. Revenues decreased 11%, and segment EBITDA declined 36% versus the prior year. Declines were due to expected tougher year ago comps from the sales of the Divergent series and American Sniper, as we noted in the last earnings call as well as lower e-book volume across the marketplace, similar to the second quarter. As a result, total digital revenues for the quarter were 21% of consumer revenues, down from 25% in the prior year. 
Divergent sold less than 1 million units this quarter compared to 2.3 million units in Q3 last year, and HarperCollins also sold 2.7 million units of American Sniper in the prior year. Combined, those 2 franchises accounted for the majority of the year-over-year revenue shortfall.
Top-selling books this quarter include The Nest by Cynthia Sweeney, and Pretty Happy by Kate Hudson in general trade books and the Glass Sword by Victoria Aveyard in children's.
In Digital Real Estate Services, total segment revenues increased $24 million or 14% to $194 million, which includes the consolidation of iProperty and DIAKRIT, which closed in February and the lapping of the Move acquisition in November 2014. Segment EBITDA was $39 million, down from $42 million in the prior year, which reflects $7 million in onetime transaction costs for the iProperty acquisition, higher planned marketing expenses at REA group and $11 million higher legal expenses at Move related to the Zillow litigation. 
Importantly, adjusted revenue and adjusted segment EBITDA grew 18% and 23%, respectively, inclusive of the $11 million higher legal expense at Move. As Robert noted, Move is currently in litigation with Zillow, and we would expect to incur some additional legal costs in the fourth quarter as we prepare for trial in early June.
REA's revenues grew 9% or approximately 20% in local currency due to higher list depth product penetration, partially offset by an earlier Easter as compared to the prior year.
Move revenue rose 20% versus the prior year, driven by strong growth in the connection for core brokers product and higher non-listing media revenues, partially offset by reduced ad inventory as part of the site redesign. Unique user growth at Realtor remains strong, up 30% to 50 million average per month for fiscal Q3 and hitting a record 55 million users in April.
In Cable Network Programming, revenues decreased by $9 million or 8% compared to the prior year, but on a currency adjusted basis, revenues were flat. Subscription revenues declined 5% as higher affiliate fees and subscriber gains were more than offset by FX headwinds. Excluding currency, subscriber revenues grew around 3%.
Advertising revenues declined 18% due to the absence of the Asian Cup and the Cricket World Cup in the prior year. And in local currency, ad revenues declined around 12%.
Segment EBITDA in the quarter, however, rose 26% on a reported basis and 33% adjusted for currency due to lower acquisition costs from the absence of these 2 sporting events.
With respect to earnings from affiliates, Foxtel ended the quarter with approximately 2.9 million total subscribers, with cable and satellite subs increasing approximately 6% compared to the prior year period and higher Presto subs despite increased competitions from SVOD players. 
Foxtel revenues for the quarter in local currency were up 2% and EBITDA declined 4% in local currency due to higher programming costs and an increase in subscriber acquisition costs driven by new offers launched in January. Foxtel no longer expects to increase EBITDA over fiscal 2015 due to these factors and continued focus on sales and marketing. Foxtel posted record growth cable and satellite ads this quarter, driven by favorable consumer reception to offers in the market. 
Churn in the quarter rose to 14.3% from 10.9%, which was largely driven by subscribers on no [ph] contract offers, and we expect churn to remain higher than normal in the short term. However, year-to-date churn was relatively stable and amongst longer tenured subscribers remains near record low levels.
Heading into the fiscal fourth quarter, there are a few points to note. First, as we've disclosed in our filings, this being a 53-week fiscal year for us, we have an extra week in fiscal fourth quarter, which should have a modest positive impact on revenue and EBITDA. We expect to see continued cost savings at NIS segment across each of our key mastheads and the flow-through of recent cost-saving initiatives. 
Book Publishing should benefit from the normalizing of comparables given the absence of Divergent comps and a strong pipeline this quarter, including the paperback release of Go Set a Watchman. We expect REA to benefit from the early Easter, which should be a positive on listing volume in Q4, and Move continues to expect strong revenue growth of the back of increased audience.
And finally, CapEx for continuing operations for the year is likely to be in the $240 million to $260 million range, below the $308 million from last year. 
And with that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A."

And you saw today from -- with the announcement of the acquisition of EPL, the Premier League rights fired [ph], the 6 most important clubs, that day after day, week after week Peter and their team are both improving the product and most crucially, improving the projection, because we believe that there's no doubt that Foxtel has the best suite of programs, there's no doubt that, that portfolio is starting to resonate. It already is resonating with long-term subscribers. There's obviously a little bit more churn when you have a lot of offers out there, but long term, we believe that the health of Foxtel is robust and that we have full faith in the new executive team. And I think the cleverness of the deal that they've done on Premier League rights tells you that we're certainly going to look after our fans who like EPL, but we were never going to acquire EPL in a way that would hurt EPS. Now you might want to watch a game in the middle of the night and pay a lot of money to do that. That's what Australians would call a nocturnal marsupial, but you're a rather sad and sultry person in the middle of the night, or you could watch the game, frankly, with your family at lunchtime and cheer on your favorite players. And one other thing about the -- particularly interesting offering that Peter and the team have at Foxtel is that you'll also be able to see all the reserve games, the under 21 games, and so well-known players like Santi Cazorla or Jack Wilshere come back into the intermediate teams ahead of playing in the main team, you'll be able to watch those games as well."

And I'll tell you one story, which we use our own platforms to create new products and generate new audiences. You may have noticed just over 2 weeks ago, we traded a packaged libertarian site called Heat Street. Heat Street has picked up 1 million uniques in just over 2 weeks. Our external marketing spend on Heat Street, $10,000. So I mean, that is proof of the power of our platforms relative to external platforms. We have to do a better job of explaining it, but quite frankly, I think advertisers need to challenge agencies. Because at times, the interest of the agency and the interest of the advertiser are not in alignment."

We ended fiscal year 2016 with strong results in the fourth quarter, highlighted by robust year-over-year growth in revenues and EBITDA at Digital Real Estate Services and a probable upturn at Harpe",2382,"Thank you, Mike, and thank you all for joining the call. We ended fiscal year 2016 with strong results in the fourth quarter, highlighted by robust year-over-year growth in revenues and EBITDA at Digital Real Estate Services and a probable upturn at HarperCollins. 
For the fourth quarter, reported revenues were $2.2 billion, a 5% increase versus the prior year. Total reported segment EBITDA was $361 million, up 68% compared to the prior year. This figure includes a $122 million benefit from the Zillow legal settlement. But even absent that adjustment, EBITDA still improved tangibly in the quarter. 
In Digital Real Estate, we experienced 21% growth in revenues in the fourth quarter, further illustrating the key role the segment is playing in News Corp's success. In fact, since our separation 3 years ago, revenues at Digital Real Estate have more than doubled, and the segment is expected to become the biggest contributor to EBITDA in the future, thanks to the ongoing growth of REA and the renaissance of realtor.com in the U.S. This increasing role in one of the world's fastest-growing digital sectors all bodes well for our future. 
Book Publishing ended the year with much momentum, highlighting the value of high-quality content and the ability to leverage that content across both print and digital platforms. HarperCollins' success this quarter, with revenues rising 11% and EBITDA surging 52% year-over-year, was driven by new releases and thoughtful cost initiatives. 
Fox Sports Australia had another good quarter, with increased revenues, thanks in part to record ratings, which came from capitalizing on its top-tier content and developing a long-term franchises in the country's most popular sports. The quarter's results certainly underscored the tremendous power of live sports, which have increased in relative value in a world of viewer fragmentation and program promiscuity. 
While global print ad trends remained volatile, we saw modest sequential improvement in the News and Information Services sector this quarter, thanks to reduced costs and the continued development of digital. 
In the fourth quarter, digital revenues accounted for 23% of segment revenues, up from 19% last year. In particular, the success of The Wall Street Journal is a testament to the importance of high-quality content with global appeal. This past quarter, the WSJ reached 948,000 digital-only subscribers, and that total will clearly surpass print subscribers in the near future. 
In the fourth quarter, we also relaunched The Sun's website, now reaching over 42 million unique monthly users compared with 15 million uniques last September before the lifting of the payable. Our U.K. team is focused on leveraging that immensely valuable brand across platforms, including through our recently announced offer for Wireless Group. We hope to complete the deal in early fiscal 2017 and take full advantage of this valuable media asset, whose recent ratings have continued their handsome growth. Talk Sport, the flagship station, experienced an 8.4% increase in audience in the most recent quarter to 3.29 million listeners, according to official metrics. 
Ruminating on fiscal year 2016 as a whole, we have shown continued progress on our primary goals: To become more digital, global and diversified while containing costs and mixing prudent divestments with strategic investments. We are certainly proud of our providence, and we are more focused company than we were at our rebirth in 2013. We assuredly believe that we have laid the foundation for sustainable growth and positive returns for our shareholders. 
Now for the business highlights before Bedi provides the financial granularity. Digital Real Estate continues to burgeon, and it's reshaping the growth profile of News Corp. Our renovation of realtor.com has propelled Move to improve profitability on an operational basis, excluding Zillow legal costs even as we have significantly reinvested in the business. We now look forward to building Move's profitability in the coming fiscal year. With a refurbished reputation, increased marketing and innovative products, Move and realtor.com are attractive record audiences and ever more advertising, thanks to the freshest listings, unique content and tools that benefit both realtors and consumers. 
Traffic to realtor lead its sites grew to a record 53 million unique users in the fourth quarter and has continued to grow in July. Significantly, realtor.com leads the way in engagement. Its users view double the number of pages as the average visitor to Zillow and in fact, realtor.com has greater user engagement as measured by page views per user than LinkedIn, Amazon, Google and Twitter, according to comScore. That is concrete commitment and serious stickiness and patently valuable for advertisers as well as for realtors to benefit from the precious leads that realtor.com provides.
Realtor.com has significantly grown its global presence, with mobile traffic increasing to more than 50% of overall traffic in the fourth quarter. Additionally, 60% of page views occurred on mobile devices, with mobile accounting for a majority of lead volume in the fourth quarter. 
Finally, one must note the $122 million gain from the amicable settlement of our litigation with Zillow. We are naturally pleased with this proceeds, which assisted cash flow can use in the fourth quarter. We can now focus squarely on execution without legal distractions, however, co-pathetic the outcome. 
REA continues to strengthen its business in the Australian market. The company had another record year in reported revenues and profitability despite the acquisition cost for iProperty, the leading Southeast Asian property portal. We recently announced the formation of a global property network, which will bring together listings from REA, realtor.com, Matching Global, PropTarget and iProperty into a comprehensive database accessible to people everywhere, accentuating our position as to the world's leading digital property business. 
HarperCollins had faced some challenges during the year to -- due to the Virgin trilogy comps and changes in the e-book marketplace. But with those conditions normalizing, the publisher ended the year strongly. Among the notable success stories are Harper Lee's Go Set a Watchman, Daniel Silver's English spy and books by Anderson Cooper and his mother, Gloria Vanderbilt. And in the U.K., the Polymath, David Williams now one of the country's leading authors of children's fiction. 
Looking ahead to the coming year, we are optimistic about Meeting Kelly's much discussed book, Settle For More, scheduled for November, the highly anticipated Veronica Roth release and Jesus Always by Young, the legendary author of Jesus Calling, which has been a bestseller for many years. 
The Harlequin acquisition has contributed to growing global impact of HarperCollins, including in France, Italy and Brazil. And the publication of best-selling authors like Daniel Silver, Karin Slaughter, Stephanie Lawrence and Allison Knowle in multiple international markets. Worth noting is the fact that we achieved our targeted $20 million cost savings following the acquisition and had increased the distribution of leading Harlequin titles. 
Foxtel, under new leadership, is driving higher subscriber volume, which is a priority for the business. The network had more than 2.9 million total subscribers at the end of the fiscal year. Foxtel continues to improve its content offerings notably with the acquisition of the rights to the AFL through 2022 and the new agreement with top EPL clubs for broadcast rights, which means that devoted fans won't have to watch their favorite teams in the middle of the night. With the continuing emphasis on sports, original content and enhanced IP devices and offerings, such as the Foxtel go-mobile product, Foxtel will remain focused on driving higher subscriptions, which we believe is key to unlocking value for itself News Corp throughout fiscal 2017. 
At Fox Sports, we saw a record ratings this quarter, driven by the extremely popular NRL, the AFL and V8 Supercars, the Aussie variant of NASCAR. Our airing of all NRL matches live through the simulcast with Channel 9 is proving to be particularly popular, and the resonance should increase with the launch of a dedicated NRL channel later in fiscal 2017. As a result, we expect advertising trends will remain more positive for Fox Sports than for the industry as a whole, with the network continuing to gain audience share. 
Dow Jones experienced strong digital subscription growth over the past year. Circulation revenue for the year at The Wall Street Journal grew mid-single-digits, thanks to digital expansion and improve pricing. In fact, this year, circulation revenues were higher than advertising revenues, underlining the balanced revenue streams at Dow Jones. 
Overall, more than 50% of Dow Jones revenues came from digital this year. That's part of a calculated realignment of the revenue stream and also a testament to the strong and growing value of premium content. Custom content is also a big driver of advertising revenues, and we expect it to represent a larger part of Dow Jones growth going forward. 
Dow Jones also continued to roll out new and improved products in fiscal year 2016, including WSJ Pro, the Watch News app and the WSJ City app in the U.K. And importantly, a Factiva mobile app. Factiva is a treasure trove of valuable content, and we are working to customize and enhance the experience for subscribers. 
On the institutional side, Dow Jones will continue to push high-growth segments, including risk and compliance. As companies are under increasing scrutiny and must necessarily be strictly compliant, we have firm faith in that business, which expanded 34% last quarter compared to a year ago. 
At News UK, we will continue to leverage The Sun's popular daily news and entertainment features as we enhance our mobile-first strategy. We are bolstering reader engagement through such initiatives as the, Bingo and Sports Bidding, all of which we expect to see driving incremental revenues in fiscal year 2017. 
While advertising remains challenging, The Times continues to benefit from its premium content and audiences. According to ABC figures, at the end of June, there were 413,600 subscribers to The Times and Sunday Times, an increases of 3.4% year-over-year. More than 800 -- 182,000 of the subscriptions are digital-only, an increase from 172,000 in the prior year. This past quarter, total print sales for The Times were up double digits versus the prior year. That highlights the power of print as a platform and vindicates our commitment to quality journalism when other media companies were slashing and burning their budgets. 
News Corp Australia benefited from initiatives that took out 2.5% of fixed costs in the second half of fiscal year 2016, and further savings are expected in the current fiscal year. The company also entered into an agreement to purchase the APN Australian regional media portfolio, which reaches 1.6 million people across print, online and mobile. We expect the purchase, subject to regulatory and APN shareholder approval, to help us grow in Northern Australia and result in significant cost and efficiency synergies in our production and distribution operations. 
Meanwhile, the Australian newspaper has grown to a record high readership of more than 3.4 million print and digital readers as of May. This represents an 11% jump over the prior 3 months. 
In the United States, the New York Post had 54 million monthly unique users in June, and 40% of advertising revenues were digital, a figure that could soon surpass 50%. The team has just launched Page 6 TV, which has been performing strongly in a 3-week trial across a number of Fox television stations in the U.S., showing the value of that brand in that post table. 
News America Marketing end of the year on a strong note, thanks to muscular growth in the install business. Meanwhile, the company's focused on accelerating mobile adoption, notably through Checkout 51. This increasingly popular app consistently ranked in the top 10 of all retail-related apps above Walmart and Walgreens helps consume the country, save money and generates a wealth of data, which can be leveraged across a number of News Corp businesses. 
In fiscal 2017, we expect to continue investing in Checkout 51, with a goal of reaching 10 million users by the end of this calendar year, which we believe is a key milestone in drawing additional offers from our CPG partners. The larger the audience, the more compelling the offers we can present and the greater the loyalty we will win from users. We are seeing that virtuous cycle in motion now at Checkout 51. 
We have aimed to make the new news more than sum of its parts, and that is particularly the case in our exponential digital development. We aspire to be ever more digital and global, and helping us in that mission is a concentration on collaboration as well as on the selective acquisition of tech startups that extend our digital capabilities. For example, the Journal realtor.com and Imagine Global has collaborated to turbocharge realtor.com and distribute content of interest to potential property owners, helping drive engagement across their platforms. Our property sites around the world know we routinely share software, market metrics and listings data. 
Storyful supplies video to a variety of News Corp mastheads, including the Sun, the New York Post and The Wall Street Journal as well as sharing expertise with HarperCollins to extend its video outreach. Unruly is providing valuable advertising metrics to enhance the brand building of our companies as well as assisting external clients with its unique expertise. 
The rapid pace, which the contemporary world is turning with attendant economic and social upheaval has put a premium on premium content, fast, accurate news and information upon which investors and all their decisions rely. Insight is invaluable in these complex times. We believe News Corp is ideally positioned to meet this broad-based societal demand whether it's Storyful, separating user-generated video facts from video fiction where our global digital real estate platforms giving them the most complete and accurate data to consumers, along with independent analysis to inform investment decisions. 
In particular, our strategy will focus on areas including: Product development, particularly in mobile and video, to drive engagement across our properties; leveraging and further monetizing data, beginning with an important initiative this year linking our U.S. audiences to create a powerful digital network to advertising clients; and capitalizing on opportunistic acquisitions to further our revenue stream and to fortify the foundations of future growth. This strategy is designed to enhance our businesses in transition, to accelerate revenue growth, particularly at our real estate franchise, and to ensure long-term robust return to our investors. 
For the fine detail, I now hand you over to Bedi."

Starting with our fourth quarter results. We reported fiscal '16 fourth quarter total revenues of $2.2 billion, up 5% from the prior year. As we had hoped, currency headwinds moderated during the quarter, with an impact of only $54 million",1855,"Thanks, Robert. Starting with our fourth quarter results. We reported fiscal '16 fourth quarter total revenues of $2.2 billion, up 5% from the prior year. As we had hoped, currency headwinds moderated during the quarter, with an impact of only $54 million to reported revenues. 
As we mentioned previously, this being a 53-week fiscal year for us, fiscal fourth quarter includes an extra week, which positively impacted revenues by $112 million, but the majority of that News Information Services segment. Excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, acquisitions and divestitures, adjusted revenues grew 6% compared to the prior year, including the extra week, and we're relatively flat excluding that. 
Reported total segment EBITDA was $361 million, which includes a benefit of $122 million related to the Zillow settlement. Excluding that benefit, total segment EBITDA would have been $239 million. Adjusted EBITDA, which excludes the settlement benefit as well as acquisitions, the impact of currency and legal costs related to the U.K. Newspaper Matters grew 23% versus the prior year period. Both reported and adjusted EBITDA also include the impact of the extra week that I mentioned earlier. 
For the quarter, EPS from continuing operations, which includes the Zillow settlement benefit net of tax, were $0.16 compared to $0.01 in the prior year. Adjusted EPS from continuing operations were $0.10 versus $0.08 in the prior year. 
For the full year fiscal '16, we reported total revenues of $8.3 billion, a 3% decline compared to the prior year. The decline in revenues included a negative impact from foreign currency of $455 million. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, acquisitions and divestitures, adjusted revenues for the year were flat compared to the prior year. 
Reported total segment EBITDA was $684 million, which includes a onetime charge of $280 million for the settlement of litigation and related claims at News America Marketing and the onetime gain for the Zillow settlement I mentioned earlier. Negative foreign currency impact reduced segment EBITDA by $70 million this year. Adjusted EBITDA, which excludes both the settlement as well as acquisitions, the impact of currency and legal costs related to the U.K. Newspaper Matters, declined 4%. And for the year, EPS from continuing operations were $0.28 compared to $0.51 in the prior year, and adjusted EPS from continuing operations were $0.40 versus $0.59 from the prior year. 
Now let's turn to the individual operating segments to the fourth quarter review and some full year highlights. In News and Information Services, revenues for the quarter rose 1% from the prior year to $1.4 billion. Adjusted segment revenues rose 2%. The extra week added $77 million to revenues or approximately 5%. Within segment revenues, advertising declined around 5% or down 7% in local currency and excluding the impact of the 53rd week, which was similar to the full year rate and the prior year rate. This was also a sequential improvement from the lower double-digit rate decline in the prior quarter. 
Circulation and subscription revenues increased 5% or up 1% in local currency, and excluding the 53rd week, were relatively stable with last quarter and the prior year. News and Information Services reported segment EBITDA this quarter with $160 million, down 5% versus the prior period. The decline was driven by lower advertising revenues as well as investment spending and acquisition-related costs in connection with Checkout 51 and Unruly. These declines were partially offset by the impact from the additional week in the quarter and lower operating expenses. Adjusted segment EBITDA increased 10% compared to the prior year. 
Looking at performance across our key units and excluding the extra week in each case. At Dow Jones, domestic advertising at The Wall Street Journal declined around 12% versus the prior year quarter, with declines in print being partially offset by modest growth in digital. Digital accounted for approximately 1/3 of Dow Jones in ad revenues this quarter. 
Wall Street Journal circulation revenues grew 5% this quarter due to higher subscription pricing and higher digital paid subscribers. We implemented a $4 subscription price increase in July, which will be phased in over the next 12 months. In circulation, revenues at The Wall Street Journal has now surpassed total ad revenues in the current fiscal year. Dow Jones' contribution to segment EBITDA increased this quarter and for fiscal 2016. At News Australia, advertising revenues for the quarter declined 13% or about 9% in local currency, relatively similar to last quarter with local outpacing national. Circulation revenues at News Australia declined 3%, but was slightly up in constant currency as a result of cover price increases and higher paid digital subs, offsetting print volume declines. As expected, we continue to see the benefit of the cost-reduction program implemented at the end of Q2 and realized approximately AUD 40 million in the second half and expect to capture further savings in fiscal 2017. 
At News UK, advertising revenues declined 16% or down 10% in local currency, an improvement from the prior quarter. Circulation revenues at News UK were relatively flat versus the prior quarter, driven by a lift in paid volume at The Times and cover price increases taken this quarter for both The Sun and Times. In Q4, The Times saw high single-digits paid volume growth, likely benefiting from Brexit coverage. At News America Marketing, revenues were relatively flat versus the prior year, excluding the extra week, a marked improvement from the prior quarter. 
Domestic FSI revenue declined 14%, although the rate moderated from the prior quarter. In-store revenues grew mid-teens and digital, which only accounted for 5% of revenues this quarter, doubled partially benefiting from the expansion of Checkout 51. 
Turning to the Book Publishing segment. Revenues increased 11% and segment EBITDA improved 52% versus the prior year as comparables versus the prior year have begun to normalize. This quarter benefited from a strong news release late from Anderson Cooper, Cameron Diaz, Cynthia Sweeney, David Williams in the U.K. as an improvement in Christian publishing as well as the impact of the 53rd week. Total digital revenues for the quarter were 19% of consumer revenues, down from 23%. 
In Digital Real Estate Services, total segment revenues increased $40 million or 21% to $229 million, which includes the consolidation of iProperty and DIAKRIT, both of which closed in February. Total reported segment EBITDA was $175 million, which reflects the impact of the settlement with Zillow. Excluding that, segment EBITDA would have been $53 million, up from $45 million in the prior year. Adjusted revenue grew 17% and adjusted EBITDA, which is inclusive of the $15 million of legal expenses at Move related to Zillow, grew 24%. 
REA's revenue grew 17% or approximately 21% in local currency due to higher list depth product penetration. Move revenues rose 21% versus the prior year, driven by strong growth in the connection for co-broke product, higher nonlisting media revenues and an improvement in the professional software revenues led by Top Producer. Unique user growth at realtor.com remained strong, up 17% year-over-year to 53 million average per month for fiscal Q4. 
For the full year, Move's revenue was $357 million, up 27% on a stand-alone basis and as we had expected, Move had a positive contribution to segment EBITDA, excluding the impact of legal costs and the settlement gain would include stock-based compensation. This improvement came despite reinvesting for growth, and we expect to build on that momentum in fiscal 2017. 
In Cable Network Programming, revenues increased by $14 million or 11% compared to the prior year quarter. On a currency-adjusted basis and excluding the 53rd week, revenues rose around 7%. In local currency, and again, excluding the 53rd week, subscription revenues improved around 6%, and advertising revenues rose high single digits, reflecting record ratings, with viewership up mid-teens, driven by the NRL and V8 Supercars. 
Segment EBITDA in the quarter rose 5% on a reported basis and 14% adjusted for currency and reflects additional costs related to the cost of 3 additional NRL matches per week from Channel 9, as we indicated on the last earnings call as well as a modest benefit from the extra week. 
With respect to earnings from affiliates, Foxtel ended the quarter with more than 2.9 million total subscribers, with cable and satellite subscribers increasing approximately 5% compared to the prior year period and higher Presto subs despite ongoing competition from SVOD players. Foxtel revenues for the quarter declined 2%, but were up 2% in local currency, and EBITDA declined 5% or down 1% in local currency due to higher programming costs and an increase in subscriber acquisition costs, driven by new offers launched in January. 
As expected, churn in the quarter rose to 14% from around 10%, a similar trend to the prior quarter, largely due to nonrenewal of no contract offers. Importantly, underlying year-on-year churn data, when adjusting for the impact of new customer offers, has been stable. ARPU for the quarter is down approximately 3% to around AUD 89. 
Capital expenditures from continuing operations for fiscal '16 was $256 million, down from $308 million in the prior year, in line with our expectations. Fiscal 2016 included a tax benefit of $106 million from the release of valuation allowances resulting from the disposal of the Digital Education business in our fiscal first quarter. As a result, the company recorded an income tax benefit of $54 million for the fiscal year. 
On an adjusted basis, which excludes that benefit, restructuring and other onetime items, our underlying tax rate was 32.9% for the full year. We expect in fiscal 2017 our normalized tax rate will be in a similar range to fiscal '16. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash at 30th of June was $1.8 billion, and we had total borrowings of $369 million related to iProperty. Subject to court approval, we expect to pay out the remainder of the News America settlement accrual of around $250 million in the first quarter of fiscal '17. 
On June 30, we announced an offer for Wireless Group plc in the U.K., which is expected to close in the first half of this fiscal year, pending regulatory approval and satisfaction of other conditions. We have said aside $315 million for this acquisition our restricted cash on the balance sheet as a result of U.K. takeover panel rules. 
Heading into the new fiscal year, there are a few points to note. Advertising trends remain volatile, and visibility continues to be limited, and we continue to aggressively seek out cost reductions. Fox Sports Australia will face an incremental AUD 10 million in Q1, similar to fiscal fourth quarter related to the costs of NRL matches. No major sports rates renewals are expected this fiscal year. 
For Digital Real Estate and REA, listing volume in July was negatively impacted by uncertainty around the federal election and first half revenue growth will likely be skewed to the second quarter. 
And finally, on currency, if the spot rate for the Australian dollar holds at current levels at around $0.75, we would expect a modest benefit to the full year as compared to fiscal '16. 
And with that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A."

On top of that, I know the Australian operation continues to examine a number of opportunities in sort of shared service function, et cetera. So I think we would expect to see slightly higher cost savings even than that in Australia. In the U.S., Dow Jones has been cutting costs 6% lower this year than it was the year before. In addition to that, they are looking at a lot of the structural issues at Dow Jones, and we expect further cost-reduction programs to be implemented this year. In the U.K., there was a big cost-reduction program we announced, if you recall, like in January, February. That's being implemented, FD the down 8% year-over-year and other marketing spend is slightly higher. But the U.K. are also looking at backroom savings, and they're looking at some consolidation opportunities."

Print is still very precious to us, but digital ever more important, and our teams are being realigned accordingly. The other aspect that we're focusing on and we're certainly seeing savings in a little difficult to qualify, but it would be articulated over time to you more precisely is in sharing services. And that's, for example, particularly the case in the U.K., where the businesses occupy a single building, which gives us an opportunity to examine what is the right size of services for the contemporary business. As for our performances, Bedi had previously indicated, there is problem with visibility certain amount of political instability that has been in Australia with an election and the uncertainty that followed it. As you know, we're in the midst of an interesting election in the U.S., and there has been some upheaval in the U.K. There's no doubt that that has had something of an impact on the business in the last quarter. Looking ahead, visibility is a bit of an issue. But I think lot more fundamental, more profound issue, which is there's a lot of instability in the ad market itself. A lot of advertisers are questioning the return on investment, and we see a particular opportunity being host to a portfolio of premium sites to provide them not only with settings appropriate for their advertisements, i.e., high-quality content, but measurability. And we talk about visibility, of course, but viewerability is very important, and it's interesting it's an angst ridden debate in the advertising world about the viewerability of ads. As I've said before and it's worth emphasizing again, every print ad is a 100% viewable."

But also to use it, to develop the Sun platforms because you can see a wonderful overlap of demography and also an enduring growth in its audience. Radio is, these days, unlike some content forms, not subject to the vicissitudes of piracy. So we're very optimistic about Wireless Group. We're very optimistic about its potential for all of the News UK properties. And just for example, its potential impact on Sun Betz, which is being rolled out this year in U.K. by Rebecca Books and the team. Obviously, during a football match, making the football match exciting, compelling or quite a lot of listeners and quite a lot of readers the opportunity to have a flatter is something that they're interested in.

And we're also seeing good growth in physical books. So in terms of international, we don't break out international revenue. But I think we've been very pleased with the Harlequin acquisition. I think we've announced in the past a number of authors whose books we've taken in different languages. We used to be just predominantly an English-language publisher.

And just one example of the synergistic relationship between Harlequin and HarperCollins traditionally, Harlequin was just a mass-market publisher. And so you didn't see it in trade locations, your typical corner or independent bookstore. And now because of HarperCollins power placement, you are, and for some of those titles, traditional Harlequin titles combined with an enhancement of covers and presentation generally, you're seeing that Harlequin authors are getting anywhere between certain authors, not all authors. Certain authors getting anywhere between a 50% to 100% increase in revenue per title."

We ended fiscal year 2016 with strong results in the fourth quarter, highlighted by robust year-over-year growth in revenues and EBITDA at Digital Real Estate Services and a probable upturn at Harpe",2388,"Thank you, Mike, and thank you all for joining the call. We ended fiscal year 2016 with strong results in the fourth quarter, highlighted by robust year-over-year growth in revenues and EBITDA at Digital Real Estate Services and a probable upturn at HarperCollins. 
For the fourth quarter, reported revenues were $2.2 billion, a 5% increase versus the prior year. Total reported segment EBITDA was $361 million, up 68% compared to the prior year. This figure includes a $122 million benefit from the Zillow legal settlement. But even absent that adjustment, EBITDA still improved tangibly in the quarter. 
In Digital Real Estate, we experienced 21% growth in revenues in the fourth quarter, further illustrating the key role the segment is playing in News Corp's success. In fact, since our separation 3 years ago, revenues at Digital Real Estate have more than doubled, and the segment is expected to become the biggest contributor to EBITDA in the future, thanks to the ongoing growth of REA and the renaissance of realtor.com in the U.S. This increasing role in one of the world's fastest-growing digital sectors all goes well for our future. 
Book Publishing ended the year with much momentum, highlighting the value of high-quality content and the ability to leverage that content across both print and digital platforms. HarperCollins' success this quarter, with revenues rising 11% and EBITDA surging 52% year-over-year, was driven by new releases and thoughtful cost initiatives. 
Fox Sports Australia had another good quarter, with increased revenues, thanks in part to record ratings, which came from capitalizing on its top-tier content and developing our long-term franchises in the country's most popular sports. The quarter's results certainly underscored the tremendous power of live sports, which have increased in relative value in a world of viewer fragmentation and program promiscuity.
While global print ad trends remained volatile, we saw modest sequential improvement in the News and Information Services sector this quarter, thanks to reduced costs and the continued development of  digital.
In the fourth quarter, digital revenues accounted for 23% of segment revenues, up from 19% last year. In particular, the success of The Wall Street Journal is a testament to the importance of high-quality content with global appeal. This past quarter, the WSJ reached 948,000 digital-only subscribers, and that total will clearly surpass print subscribers in the near future. 
In the fourth quarter, we also relaunched the Sun's website, now reaching over 42 million unique monthly users compared with 15 million uniques last September before the lifting of the payable. Our U.K. team is focused on leveraging that immensely valuable brand across platforms, including through our recently announced offer for Wireless Group. We hope to complete the deal in early fiscal 2017 and take full advantage of this valuable media asset, whose recent ratings have continued their handsome growth. TalkSport, the flagship station, experienced an 8.4% increase in audience in the most recent quarter to 3.29 million listeners, according to official metrics. 
Ruminating on fiscal year 2016 as a whole, we have shown continued progress on our primary goals: to become more digital, global and diversified while containing costs and mixing prudent divestments with strategic investments. We are certainly proud of our providence, and we are a more focused company than we were at our rebirth in 2013. We assuredly believe that we have laid the foundation for sustainable growth and positive returns for our shareholders. 
Now for the business highlights before Bedi provides the financial granularity. Digital Real Estate continues to burgeon, and it's reshaping the growth profile of News Corp. Our renovation of realtor.com has propelled Move to improve profitability on an operational basis, excluding Zillow legal costs even as we have significantly reinvested in the business. We now look forward to building Move's profitability in the coming fiscal year. With a refurbished reputation, increased marketing and innovative products, Move and realtor.com are attractive record audiences and ever more advertising, thanks to the freshest listings, unique content and tools that benefit both realtors and consumers. 
Traffic to realtor-related sites grew to a record 53 million unique users in the fourth quarter and has continued to grow in July. Significantly, realtor.com leads the way in engagement. Its users view double the number of pages as the average visitor to Zillow and in fact, realtor.com has greater user engagement as measured by page views per user than LinkedIn, Amazon, Google and Twitter, according to comScore. That is concrete commitment and serious stickiness and patently valuable for advertisers as well as for realtors to benefit from the precious leads that realtor.com provides.
realtor.com has significantly grown its mobile presence, with mobile traffic increasing to more than 50% of overall traffic in the fourth quarter. Additionally, 60% of page views occurred on mobile devices, with mobile accounting for a majority of lead volume in the fourth quarter. 
Finally, one must note the $122 million gain from the amicable settlement of our litigation with Zillow. We are naturally pleased with these proceeds, which assisted cash flow for News Corp in the fourth quarter. We can now focus squarely on execution without legal distractions, however, co-pathetic the outcome. 
REA continues to strengthen its business in the Australian market. The company had another record year in reported revenues and profitability despite the acquisition cost for iProperty, the leading Southeast Asian property portal. We recently announced the formation of a global property network, which will bring together listings from REA, realtor.com, Mansion Global, PropTiger and iProperty into a comprehensive database accessible to people everywhere, accentuating our position as to the world's leading digital property business. 
HarperCollins had faced some challenges during the year to -- due to the Divergent Trilogy comps and changes in the e-book marketplace. But with those conditions normalizing, the publisher ended the year strongly. Among the notable success stories are Harper Lee's Go Set a Watchman; Daniel Silva's The English Spy; and books by Anderson Cooper and his mother, Gloria Vanderbilt; and in the U.K., the polymath, David Walliams, now one of the country's leading authors of children's fiction. 
Looking ahead to the coming year, we are optimistic about Megyn Kelly's much discussed book, Settle For More, scheduled for November; the highly anticipated Veronica Roth release; and Jesus Always by Sarah Young, the legendary author of Jesus Calling, which has been a bestseller for many years. 
The Harlequin acquisition has contributed to the growing global impact of HarperCollins, including in France, Italy and Brazil. And the publication of best-selling authors like Daniel Silva, Karin Slaughter, Stephanie Laurens and Allison Knowles in multiple international markets. Worth noting is the fact that we achieved our targeted $20 million cost savings following the acquisition and have increased the distribution of leading Harlequin titles. 
Foxtel, under new leadership, is driving higher subscriber volume, which is a priority for the business. The network had more than 2.9 million total subscribers at the end of the fiscal year. Foxtel continues to improve its content offerings, notably with the acquisition of the rights to the AFL through 2022 and the new agreement with top EPL clubs for broadcast rights, which means that devoted fans won't have to watch their favorite teams in the middle of the night. With the continuing emphasis on sports, original content and enhanced IP devices and offerings, such as the Foxtel Go mobile product, Foxtel will remain focused on driving higher subscriptions, which we believe is key to unlocking value for itself and News Corp throughout fiscal 2017. 
At Fox Sports, we saw record ratings this quarter, driven by the extremely popular NRL, the AFL and V8 Supercars, the Aussie variant of NASCAR. Our airing of all NRL matches live through the simulcast here with Channel 9 is proving to be particularly popular, and the resonance should increase with the launch of a dedicated NRL channel later in fiscal 2017. As a result, we expect advertising trends will remain more positive for Fox Sports than for the industry as a whole, with the network continuing to gain audience share. 
Dow Jones experienced strong digital subscription growth over the past year. Circulation revenue for the year at The Wall Street Journal grew mid-single-digits, thanks to digital expansion and improved pricing. In fact, this year, circulation revenues were higher than advertising revenues, underlining the balanced revenue streams at Dow Jones. 
Overall, more than 50% of Dow Jones' revenues came from digital this year. That's part of a calculated realignment of the revenue stream and also a testament to the strong and growing value of premium content. Custom content is also a big driver of advertising revenues, and we expect it to represent a larger part of Dow Jones growth going forward. 
Dow Jones also continued to roll out new and improved products in fiscal year 2016, including WSJ PRO, a watch news app, and the WSJ City app in the U.K., and importantly, a Factiva Mobile app. Factiva is a treasure trove of valuable content, and we are working to customize and enhance the experience for subscribers. 
On the institutional side, Dow Jones will continue to push high-growth segments, including risk and compliance. As companies are under increasing scrutiny and must necessarily be strictly compliant, we have firm faith in that business, which expanded 34% last quarter compared to a year ago. 
At News UK, we will continue to leverage The Sun's popular daily news and entertainment features as we enhance our mobile-first strategy. We are bolstering reader engagement through such initiatives as the Dream Team, bingo and sports betting, all of which we expect to see driving incremental revenues in fiscal year 2017. 
While advertising remains challenging, The Times continues to benefit from its premium content and audiences. According to ABC figures, at the end of June, there were 413,600 subscribers to The Times and Sunday Times, an increase of 3.4% year-over-year. More than 800 -- 182,000 of the subscriptions are digital-only, an increase from 172,000 in the prior year. This past quarter, total print sales for The Times were up double digits versus the prior year. That highlights the power of print as a platform and vindicates our commitment to quality journalism when other media companies were slashing and burning their budgets. 
News Corp Australia benefited from initiatives that took out 2.5% of fixed costs in the second half of fiscal year 2016, and further savings are expected in the current fiscal year. The company also entered into an agreement to purchase the APN Australian regional media portfolio, which reaches 1.6 million people across print, online and mobile. We expect the purchase, subject to regulatory and APN shareholder approval, to help us grow in Northern Australia and result in significant cost and efficiency synergies in our production and distribution operations. 
Meanwhile, the Australian newspaper has grown to a record high readership of more than 3.4 million print and digital readers as of May. This represents an 11% jump over the prior 3 months. 
In the United States, the New York Post had 54 million monthly unique users in June, and 40% of advertising revenues were digital, a figure that could soon surpass 50%. The team has just launched Page Six TV, which has been performing strongly in a 3-week trial across a number of Fox television stations in the U.S., showing the value of that brand in the post table. 
News America Marketing ended the year on a strong note, thanks to muscular growth in the install business. Meanwhile, the company is focused on accelerating mobile adoption, notably through Checkout 51. This increasingly popular app consistently ranked in the top 10 of all retail-related apps, above Walmart and Walgreens, helps consumers across country, save money and generates a wealth of data, which can be leveraged across a number of News Corp businesses. 
In fiscal 2017, we expect to continue investing in Checkout 51, with the goal of reaching 10 million users by the end of this calendar year, which we believe is a key milestone in drawing additional offers from our CPG partners, the larger the audience, the more compelling the offers we can present and the greater the loyalty we will win from users. We are seeing that virtuous cycle in motion now at Checkout 51. 
We have aimed to make the new news more than a sum of its parts, and that is particularly the case in our exponential digital development. We aspire to be ever more digital and global, and helping us in that mission is a concentration on collaboration as well as on the selective acquisition of tech startups that extend our digital capabilities. For example, the journal realtor.com and Imagine Global have collaborated to turbocharge realtor.com and distribute content of interest to potential property owners, helping drive engagement across their platforms. Our property sites around the world know we routinely share software, market metrics and listings data. 
Storyful supplies video to a variety of News Corp mastheads, including the Sun, the New York Post and The Wall Street Journal as well as sharing expertise with HarperCollins to extend its video outreach. Unruly is providing valuable advertising metrics to enhance the brand building of our companies as well as assisting external clients with its unique expertise. 
The rapid pace, which the contemporary world is turning, with attendant economic and social upheaval, has put a premium on premium content, fast, accurate news and information upon which investors and all citizens rely. Insight is invaluable in these complex times. 
We believe News Corp is ideally positioned to meet this broad-based societal demand, whether it's Storyful, separating user-generated video facts from video fiction, or our global Digital Real Estate platforms, giving the most complete and accurate data to consumers, along with independent analysis to inform investment decisions. 
In particular, our strategy will focus on areas including: product development, particularly in mobile and video, to drive engagement across our properties; leveraging and further monetizing data, beginning with an important initiative this year, linking our U.S. audiences to create a powerful digital network for advertising clients; and capitalizing on opportunistic acquisitions to further buttress our revenue stream and to fortify the foundations of future growth. This strategy is designed to enhance our businesses in transition, to accelerate revenue growth, particularly at our real estate franchise, and to ensure long-term robust return to our investors. 
For the fine detail, I now hand you over to Bedi."

Starting with our fourth quarter results. We reported fiscal '16 fourth quarter total revenues of $2.2 billion, up 5% from the prior year. As we had hoped, currency headwinds moderated during the quarter, with an impact of only $54 million",1856,"Thanks, Robert. Starting with our fourth quarter results. We reported fiscal '16 fourth quarter total revenues of $2.2 billion, up 5% from the prior year. As we had hoped, currency headwinds moderated during the quarter, with an impact of only $54 million to reported revenues. 
As we mentioned previously, this being a 53-week fiscal year for us, fiscal fourth quarter includes an extra week, which positively impacted revenues by $112 million, with the majority of that at News and Information Services segment. Excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, acquisitions and divestitures, adjusted revenues grew 6% compared to the prior year, including the extra week, and we're relatively flat excluding that. 
Reported total segment EBITDA was $361 million, which includes a benefit of $122 million related to the Zillow settlement. Excluding that benefit, total segment EBITDA would have been $239 million. Adjusted EBITDA, which excludes the settlement benefit as well as acquisitions, the impact of currency and legal costs related to the U.K. Newspaper Matters grew 23% versus the prior year period. Both reported and adjusted EBITDA also include the impact of the extra week that I mentioned earlier. 
For the quarter, EPS from continuing operations, which includes the Zillow settlement benefit net of tax, were $0.16 compared to $0.01 in the prior year. Adjusted EPS from continuing operations were $0.10 versus $0.08 in the prior year. 
For the full year fiscal '16, we reported total revenues of $8.3 billion, a 3% decline compared to the prior year. The decline in revenues included a negative impact from foreign currency of $455 million. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, acquisitions and divestitures, adjusted revenues for the year were flat compared to the prior year. 
Reported total segment EBITDA was $684 million, which includes a onetime charge of $280 million for the settlement of litigation and related claims at News America Marketing and the onetime gain for the Zillow settlement I mentioned earlier. Negative foreign currency impact reduced segment EBITDA by $70 million this year. Adjusted EBITDA, which excludes both the settlements as well as acquisitions, the impact of currency and legal costs related to the U.K. Newspaper Matters, declined 4%. And for the year, EPS from continuing operations were $0.28 compared to $0.51 in the prior year, and adjusted EPS from continuing operations were $0.40 versus $0.59 from the prior year. 
Now let's turn to the individual operating segments through a fourth quarter review and some full year highlights. In News and Information Services, revenues for the quarter rose 1% from the prior year to $1.4 billion. Adjusted segment revenues rose 2%. The extra week added $77 million to revenues or approximately 5%. Within segment revenues, advertising declined around 5%, or down 7% in local currency and excluding the impact of the 53rd week, which was similar to the full year rate and the prior year rate. This was also a sequential improvement from the lower double-digit rate decline in the prior quarter. 
Circulation and subscription revenues increased 5% or up 1% in local currency, and excluding the 53rd week, were relatively stable with last quarter and the prior year. News and Information Services reported segment EBITDA this quarter with $160 million, down 5% versus the prior period. The decline was driven by lower advertising revenues as well as investment spending and acquisition-related costs in connection with Checkout 51 and Unruly. These declines were partially offset by the impact from the additional week in the quarter and lower operating expenses. Adjusted segment EBITDA increased 10% compared to the prior year. 
Looking at performance across our key units and excluding the extra week in each case. At Dow Jones, domestic advertising at The Wall Street Journal declined around 12% versus the prior year quarter, with declines in print being partially offset by modest growth in digital. Digital accounted for approximately 1/3 of Dow Jones' ad revenues this quarter. 
Wall Street Journal circulation revenues grew 5% this quarter due to higher subscription pricing and higher digital paid subscribers. We implemented a $4 subscription price increase in July, which will be phased in over the next 12 months. And circulation revenues at The Wall Street Journal have now surpassed total ad revenues in the current fiscal year. Dow Jones' contribution to segment EBITDA increased this quarter and for fiscal 2016. At News Australia, advertising revenues for the quarter declined 13% or about 9% in local currency, relatively similar to last quarter, with local outpacing national. Circulation revenues at News Australia declined 3%, but were slightly up in constant currency as a result of cover price increases and higher paid digital subs, offsetting print volume declines. As expected, we continue to see the benefit of the cost-reduction program implemented at the end of Q2 and realized approximately AUD 40 million in the second half and expect to capture further savings in fiscal 2017. 
At News UK, advertising revenues declined 16% or down 10% in local currency, an improvement from the prior quarter. Circulation revenues at News UK were relatively flat versus the prior quarter, driven by a lift in paid volume at The Times and cover price increases taken this quarter for both The Sun and Times. In Q4, The Times saw high single-digits paid volume growth, likely benefiting from Brexit coverage. At News America Marketing, revenues were relatively flat versus the prior year, excluding the extra week, a marked improvement from the prior quarter. 
Domestic FSI revenues declined 14%, although the rate moderated from the prior quarter. In-store revenues grew mid-teens and digital, which only accounted for 5% of revenues this quarter, doubled, partially benefiting from the expansion of Checkout 51. 
Turning to the Book Publishing segment. Revenues increased 11% and segment EBITDA improved 52% versus the prior year as comparables versus the prior year have begun to normalize. This quarter benefited from a strong new release slate from Anderson Cooper, Cameron Diaz, Cynthia Sweeney, David Walliams in the U.K. and an improvement in Christian publishing as well as the impact of the 53rd week. Total digital revenues for the quarter were 19% of consumer revenues, down from 23%. 
In Digital Real Estate Services, total segment revenues increased $40 million or 21% to $229 million, which includes the consolidation of iProperty and DIAKRIT, both of which closed in February. Total reported segment EBITDA was $175 million, which reflects the impact of the settlement with Zillow. Excluding that, segment EBITDA would have been $53 million, up from $45 million in the prior year. Adjusted revenue grew 17% and adjusted EBITDA, which is inclusive of the $15 million of legal expenses at Move related to Zillow, grew 24%. 
REA's revenue grew 17% or approximately 21% in local currency due to higher list depth product penetration. Move revenues rose 21% versus the prior year, driven by strong growth in the connection for co-broke product, higher non-listing media revenues and an improvement in the professional software revenues led by Top Producer. Unique user growth at realtor.com remained strong, up 17% year-over-year to 53 million average per month for fiscal Q4. 
For the full year, Move's revenue was $357 million, up 27% on a stand-alone basis. And as we had expected, Move had a positive contribution to segment EBITDA, excluding the impact of legal costs and the settlement gain, but including stock-based compensation. This improvement came despite reinvesting for growth, and we expect to build on that momentum in fiscal 2017. 
In Cable Network Programming, revenues increased by $14 million or 11% compared to the prior year quarter. On a currency-adjusted basis and excluding the 53rd week, revenues rose around 7%. In local currency, and again, excluding the 53rd week, subscription revenues improved around 6%, and advertising revenues rose high single digits, reflecting record ratings, with viewership up mid-teens, driven by the NRL and V8 Supercars. 
Segment EBITDA in the quarter rose 5% on a reported basis and 14% adjusted for currency and reflects additional costs related to the simulcast of 3 additional NRL matches per week from Channel 9, as we indicated on the last earnings call as well as a modest benefit from the extra week. 
With respect to earnings from affiliates, Foxtel ended the quarter with more than 2.9 million total subscribers, with cable and satellite subscribers increasing approximately 5% compared to the prior year period and higher Presto subs despite ongoing competition from SVOD players. Foxtel revenues for the quarter declined 2%, but were up 2% in local currency, and EBITDA declined 5% or down 1% in local currency due to higher programming costs and an increase in subscriber acquisition costs, driven by new offers launched in January. 
As expected, churn in the quarter rose to 14% from around 10%, a similar trend with the prior quarter, largely due to nonrenewal of no contract offers. Importantly, underlying year-on-year churn data, when adjusting for the impact of new customer offers, had been stable. ARPU for the quarter was down approximately 3% to around AUD 89. 
Capital expenditures from continuing operations for fiscal '16 was $256 million, down from $308 million in the prior year, in line with our expectations. Fiscal 2016 included a tax benefit of $106 million from the release of valuation allowances resulting from the disposal of the Digital Education business in our fiscal first quarter. As a result, the company recorded an income tax benefit of $54 million for the fiscal year. 
On an adjusted basis, which excludes that benefit, restructuring and other onetime items, our underlying tax rate was 32.9% for the full year. We expect in fiscal 2017, our normalized tax rate will be in a similar range to fiscal '16. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash at 30th of June was $1.8 billion, and we had total borrowings of $369 million related to iProperty. Subject to court approval, we expect to pay out the remainder of the News America settlement accrual of around $250 million in the first quarter of fiscal '17. 
On June 30, we announced an offer for Wireless Group plc in the U.K., which is expected to close in the first half of this fiscal year, pending regulatory approval and satisfaction of other conditions. We have said aside $315 million for this acquisition as restricted cash on the balance sheet as a result of U.K. takeover panel rules. 
Heading into the new fiscal year, there are a few points to note. Advertising trends remained volatile and visibility continues to be limited, and we continue to aggressively seek out cost reductions. Fox Sports Australia will face an incremental AUD 10 million in Q1, similar to fiscal fourth quarter related to the simulcast of NRL matches. No major sports rights renewals are expected this fiscal year. 
For Digital Real Estate and REA, listing volume in July was negatively impacted by uncertainty around the federal election, and first half revenue growth will likely be skewed to the second quarter. 
And finally, on currency, if the spot rate for the Australian dollar holds at current levels at around $0.75, we would expect a modest benefit to the full year as compared to fiscal '16. 
And with that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A."

On top of that, I know the Australian operation continues to examine a number of opportunities in sort of shared service functions, et cetera. So I think we would expect to see slightly higher cost savings even than that in Australia. In the U.S., Dow Jones has been cutting costs, headcount was 6% lower this year than it was the year before. In addition to that, they are looking at a lot of the structural issues at Dow Jones, and we expect further cost-reduction programs to be implemented this year. In the U.K., there was a big cost-reduction program we announced, if you recall, in late January, February, that's being implemented. FTEs are down 8% year-over-year and the marketing spend is slightly higher, but the guys in the U.K. are also looking at backroom savings, and they're looking at some consolidation opportunities."

John, generally, there's a culture of cost consciousness in the company, as Bedi explained, clearly, there's a shift transition going on in the businesses. Print is still very precious to us, but digital ever more important, and our teams are being realigned accordingly. The other aspect that we're focusing on and we're certainly seeing savings, and a little difficult to qualify, but we'd be able to articulate it, over time, to you more precisely is in sharing services. And that's, for example, particularly the case in the U.K., where the businesses occupy a single building, which gives us an opportunity to examine what is the right size of services for contemporary business. As for ad performances, as Bedi had previously indicated, there is a problem with visibility. There's a certain amount of political instability that has been in Australia with an election and the uncertainty that followed it. As you know, we're in the midst of an interesting election in the U.S., and there has been some upheaval in the U.K. There's no doubt that, that has had something of an impact on the business in the last quarter. Looking ahead, visibility is a bit of an issue. But I think there's a lot more fundamental, more profound issue, which is, there's a lot of instability in the ad market itself. A lot of advertisers are questioning the return on investment, and we see a particular opportunity being host to a portfolio of premium sites to provide them not only with settings appropriate for their advertisements, i.e., high-quality content, but measurability. And we talk about visibility, of course, but viewerability is very important. And it's interesting that there's an angst-driven debate in the advertising world about the viewerability of ads. As I've said before, and it's worth emphasizing again, every print ad is a 100% viewable."

Radio is, these days, unlike some content forms, not subject to the vicissitudes of piracy. So we're very optimistic about Wireless Group. We're very optimistic about its potential for all of the News U.K. Properties. And just for example, its potential impact on Sun Bets,  which is -- they've rolled out this year in the U.K. by Rebekah Books and the team. Obviously, during a football match, making the broadcast for football match exciting, compelling for quite a lot of listeners and quite a lot of readers, the opportunity to have a flutter is something that they're interested in.

We ended fiscal year 2016 with strong results in the fourth quarter, highlighted by robust year-over-year growth in revenues and EBITDA at Digital Real Estate Services and a palpable upturn at Harpe",2387,"Thank you, Mike, and thank you all for joining the call. We ended fiscal year 2016 with strong results in the fourth quarter, highlighted by robust year-over-year growth in revenues and EBITDA at Digital Real Estate Services and a palpable upturn at HarperCollins. 
For the fourth quarter, reported revenues were $2.2 billion, a 5% increase versus the prior year. Total reported segment EBITDA was $361 million, up 68% compared to the prior year. This figure includes a $122 million benefit from the Zillow legal settlement. But even absent that adjustment, EBITDA still improved tangibly in the quarter. 
In Digital Real Estate, we experienced 21% growth in revenues in the fourth quarter, further illustrating the key role the segment is playing in News Corp's success. In fact, since our separation 3 years ago, revenues at Digital Real Estate have more than doubled, and the segment is expected to become the biggest contributor to EBITDA in the future, thanks to the ongoing growth of REA and the renaissance of realtor.com in the U.S. This increasing role in one of the world's fastest-growing digital sectors augers well for our future. 
Book Publishing ended the year with much momentum, highlighting the value of high-quality content and the ability to leverage that content across both print and digital platforms. HarperCollins' success this quarter, with revenues rising 11% and EBITDA surging 52% year-over-year, was driven by new releases and thoughtful cost initiatives. 
Fox Sports Australia had another good quarter, with increased revenues, thanks in part to record ratings, which came from capitalizing on its top-tier content and developing our long-term franchises in the country's most popular sports. The quarter's results certainly underscored the tremendous power of live sports, which have increased in relative value in a world of viewer fragmentation and program promiscuity.
While global print ad trends remained volatile, we saw modest sequential improvement in the News and Information Services sector this quarter, thanks to reduced costs and the continued development of digital.
In the fourth quarter, digital revenues accounted for 23% of segment revenues, up from 19% last year. In particular, the success of The Wall Street Journal is a testament to the importance of high-quality content with global appeal. This past quarter, the WSJ reached 948,000 digital-only subscribers, and that total will clearly surpass print subscribers in the near future. 
In the fourth quarter, we also relaunched the Sun's website, now reaching over 42 million unique monthly users compared with 15 million uniques last September before the lifting of the payable. Our U.K. team is focused on leveraging that immensely valuable brand across platforms, including through our recently announced offer for Wireless Group. We hope to complete the deal in early fiscal 2017 and take full advantage of this valuable media asset, whose recent ratings have continued their handsome growth. TalkSport, the flagship station, experienced an 8.4% increase in audience in the most recent quarter to 3.29 million listeners, according to official metrics. 
Ruminating on fiscal year 2016 as a whole, we have shown continued progress on our primary goals: to become more digital, global and diversified while containing costs and mixing prudent divestments with strategic investments. We are certainly proud of our providence, and we are a more focused company than we were at our rebirth in 2013. We assuredly believe that we have laid the foundation for sustainable growth and positive returns for our shareholders. 
Now for the business highlights before Bedi provides the financial granularity. Digital Real Estate continues to burgeon, and it's reshaping the growth profile of News Corp. Our renovation of realtor.com has propelled Move to improve profitability on an operational basis, excluding Zillow legal costs even as we have significantly reinvested in the business. We now look forward to building Move's profitability in the coming fiscal year. With a refurbished reputation, increased marketing and innovative products, Move and realtor.com are attractive record audiences and ever more advertising, thanks to the freshest listings, unique content and tools that benefit both realtors and consumers. 
Traffic to realtor-related sites grew to a record 53 million unique users in the fourth quarter and has continued to grow in July. Significantly, realtor.com leads the way in engagement. Its users view double the number of pages as the average visitor to Zillow and in fact, realtor.com has greater user engagement as measured by page views per user than LinkedIn, Amazon, Google and Twitter, according to comScore. That is concrete commitment and serious stickiness and patently valuable for advertisers as well as for realtors to benefit from the precious leads that realtor.com provides.
realtor.com has significantly grown its mobile presence, with mobile traffic increasing to more than 50% of overall traffic in the fourth quarter. Additionally, 60% of page views occurred on mobile devices, with mobile accounting for a majority of lead volume in the fourth quarter. 
Finally, one must note the $122 million gain from the amicable settlement of our litigation with Zillow. We are naturally pleased with these proceeds, which assisted cash flow for News Corp in the fourth quarter. We can now focus squarely on execution without legal distractions, however, copacetic the outcome. 
REA continues to strengthen its business in the Australian market. The company had another record year in reported revenues and profitability despite the acquisition cost for iProperty, the leading Southeast Asian property portal. We recently announced the formation of a global property network, which will bring together listings from REA, realtor.com, Mansion Global, PropTiger and iProperty into a comprehensive database accessible to people everywhere, accentuating our position as to the world's leading digital property business. 
HarperCollins had faced some challenges during the year to -- due to the Divergent Trilogy comps and changes in the e-book marketplace. But with those conditions normalizing, the publisher ended the year strongly. Among the notable success stories are Harper Lee's Go Set a Watchman; Daniel Silva's The English Spy; and books by Anderson Cooper and his mother, Gloria Vanderbilt; and in the U.K., the polymath, David Walliams, now one of the country's leading authors of children's fiction. 
Looking ahead to the coming year, we are optimistic about Megyn Kelly's much discussed book, Settle For More, scheduled for November; the highly anticipated Veronica Roth release; and Jesus Always by Sarah Young, the legendary author of Jesus Calling, which has been a bestseller for many years. 
The Harlequin acquisition has contributed to the growing global impact of HarperCollins, including in France, Italy and Brazil. And the publication of best-selling authors like Daniel Silva, Karin Slaughter, Stephanie Laurens and Allison Knowles in multiple international markets. Worth noting is the fact that we achieved our targeted $20 million cost savings following the acquisition and have increased the distribution of leading Harlequin titles. 
Foxtel, under new leadership, is driving higher subscriber volume, which is a priority for the business. The network had more than 2.9 million total subscribers at the end of the fiscal year. Foxtel continues to improve its content offerings, notably with the acquisition of the rights to the AFL through 2022 and the new agreement with top EPL clubs for broadcast rights, which means that devoted fans won't have to watch their favorite teams in the middle of the night. With the continuing emphasis on sports, original content and enhanced IP devices and offerings, such as the Foxtel Go mobile product, Foxtel will remain focused on driving higher subscriptions, which we believe is key to unlocking value for itself and News Corp throughout fiscal 2017. 
At Fox Sports, we saw record ratings this quarter, driven by the extremely popular NRL, the AFL and V8 Supercars, the Aussie variant of NASCAR. Our airing of all NRL matches live through the simulcast deal with Channel 9 is proving to be particularly popular, and the resonance should increase with the launch of a dedicated NRL channel later in fiscal 2017. As a result, we expect advertising trends will remain more positive for Fox Sports than for the industry as a whole, with the network continuing to gain audience share. 
Dow Jones experienced strong digital subscription growth over the past year. Circulation revenue for the year at The Wall Street Journal grew mid-single-digits, thanks to digital expansion and improved pricing. In fact, this year, circulation revenues were higher than advertising revenues, underlining the balanced revenue streams at Dow Jones. 
Overall, more than 50% of Dow Jones' revenues came from digital this year. That's part of a calculated realignment of the revenue stream and also a testament to the strong and growing value of premium content. Custom content is also a big driver of advertising revenues, and we expect it to represent a larger part of Dow Jones growth going forward. 
Dow Jones also continued to roll out new and improved products in fiscal year 2016, including WSJ PRO, a watch news app, and the WSJ City app in the U.K., and importantly, a Factiva Mobile app. Factiva is a treasure trove of valuable content, and we are working to customize and enhance the experience for subscribers. 
On the institutional side, Dow Jones will continue to push high-growth segments, including risk and compliance. As companies are under increasing scrutiny and must necessarily be strictly compliant, we have firm faith in that business, which expanded 34% last quarter compared to a year ago. 
At News UK, we will continue to leverage The Sun's popular daily news and entertainment features as we enhance our mobile-first strategy. We are bolstering reader engagement through such initiatives as the Dream Team, bingo and sports betting, all of which we expect to see driving incremental revenues in fiscal year 2017. 
While advertising remains challenging, The Times continues to benefit from its premium content and audiences. According to ABC figures, at the end of June, there were 413,600 subscribers to The Times and Sunday Times, an increase of 3.4% year-over-year. More than 800 -- 182,000 of the subscriptions are digital-only, an increase from 172,000 in the prior year. This past quarter, total print sales for The Times were up double digits versus the prior year. That highlights the power of print as a platform and vindicates our commitment to quality journalism when other media companies were slashing and burning their budgets. 
News Corp Australia benefited from initiatives that took out 2.5% of fixed costs in the second half of fiscal year 2016, and further savings are expected in the current fiscal year. The company also entered into an agreement to purchase the APN Australian regional media portfolio, which reaches 1.6 million people across print, online and mobile. We expect the purchase, subject to regulatory and APN shareholder approval, to help us grow in Northern Australia and result in significant cost and efficiency synergies in our production and distribution operations. 
Meanwhile, the Australian newspaper has grown to a record high readership of more than 3.4 million print and digital readers as of May. This represents an 11% jump over the prior 3 months. 
In the United States, the New York Post had 54 million monthly unique users in June, and 40% of advertising revenues were digital, a figure that could soon surpass 50%. The team has just launched Page Six TV, which has been performing strongly in a 3-week trial across a number of Fox television stations in the U.S., showing the value of that brand in the post stable. 
News America Marketing ended the year on a strong note, thanks to muscular growth in the install business. Meanwhile, the company is focused on accelerating mobile adoption, notably through Checkout 51. This increasingly popular app consistently ranked in the top 10 of all retail-related apps, above Walmart and Walgreens, helps consumers across country save money and generates a wealth of data, which can be leveraged across a number of News Corp businesses. 
In fiscal 2017, we expect to continue investing in Checkout 51, with the goal of reaching 10 million users by the end of this calendar year, which we believe is a key milestone in drawing additional offers from our CPG partners, the larger the audience, the more compelling the offers we can present and the greater the loyalty we will win from users. We are seeing that virtuous cycle in motion now at Checkout 51. 
We have aimed to make the new, news more than a sum of its parts, and that is particularly the case in our exponential digital development. We aspire to be ever more digital and global, and helping us in that mission is a concentration on collaboration as well as on the selective acquisition of tech startups that extend our digital capabilities. For example, the journal, realtor.com and Imagine Global have collaborated to turbocharge realtor.com and distribute content of interest to potential property owners, helping drive engagement across their platforms. Our property sites around the world know we routinely share software, market metrics and listings data. 
Storyful supplies video to a variety of News Corp mastheads, including the Sun, the New York Post and The Wall Street Journal as well as sharing expertise with HarperCollins to extend its video outreach. Unruly is providing valuable advertising metrics to enhance the brand building of our companies as well as assisting external clients with its unique expertise. 
The rapid pace, which the contemporary world is turning, with attendant economic and social upheaval, has put a premium on premium content, fast, accurate news and information upon which investors and all citizens rely. Insight is invaluable in these complex times. 
We believe News Corp is ideally positioned to meet this broad-based societal demand, whether it's Storyful, separating user-generated video facts from video fiction, or our global Digital Real Estate platforms, giving the most complete and accurate data to consumers, along with independent analysis to inform investment decisions. 
In particular, our strategy will focus on areas including: product development, particularly in mobile and video, to drive engagement across our properties; leveraging and further monetizing data, beginning with an important initiative this year, linking our U.S. audiences to create a powerful digital network for advertising clients; and capitalizing on opportunistic acquisitions to further buttress our revenue stream and to fortify the foundations of future growth. This strategy is designed to enhance our businesses in transition, to accelerate revenue growth, particularly at our real estate franchise, and to ensure long-term robust return to our investors. 
For the fine detail, I now hand you over to Bedi."

Starting with our fourth quarter results. We reported fiscal '16 fourth quarter total revenues of $2.2 billion, up 5% from the prior year. As we had hoped, currency headwinds moderated during the quarter, with an impact of only $54 million",1856,"Thanks, Robert. Starting with our fourth quarter results. We reported fiscal '16 fourth quarter total revenues of $2.2 billion, up 5% from the prior year. As we had hoped, currency headwinds moderated during the quarter, with an impact of only $54 million to reported revenues. 
As we mentioned previously, this being a 53-week fiscal year for us, fiscal fourth quarter includes an extra week, which positively impacted revenues by $112 million, with the majority of that at News and Information Services segment. Excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, acquisitions and divestitures, adjusted revenues grew 6% compared to the prior year, including the extra week, and we're relatively flat excluding that. 
Reported total segment EBITDA was $361 million, which includes a benefit of $122 million related to the Zillow settlement. Excluding that benefit, total segment EBITDA would have been $239 million. Adjusted EBITDA, which excludes the settlement benefit as well as acquisitions, the impact of currency and legal costs related to the U.K. Newspaper Matters grew 23% versus the prior year period. Both reported and adjusted EBITDA also include the impact of the extra week that I mentioned earlier. 
For the quarter, EPS from continuing operations, which includes the Zillow settlement benefit net of tax, were $0.16 compared to $0.01 in the prior year. Adjusted EPS from continuing operations were $0.10 versus $0.08 in the prior year. 
For the full year fiscal '16, we reported total revenues of $8.3 billion, a 3% decline compared to the prior year. The decline in revenues included a negative impact from foreign currency of $455 million. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, acquisitions and divestitures, adjusted revenues for the year were flat compared to the prior year. 
Reported total segment EBITDA was $684 million, which includes a onetime charge of $280 million for the settlement of litigation and related claims at News America Marketing and the onetime gain for the Zillow settlement I mentioned earlier. Negative foreign currency impact reduced segment EBITDA by $70 million this year. Adjusted EBITDA, which excludes both the settlements as well as acquisitions, the impact of currency and legal costs related to the U.K. Newspaper Matters, declined 4%. And for the year, EPS from continuing operations were $0.28 compared to $0.51 in the prior year, and adjusted EPS from continuing operations were $0.40 versus $0.59 from the prior year. 
Now let's turn to the individual operating segments through a fourth quarter review and some full year highlights. In News and Information Services, revenues for the quarter rose 1% from the prior year to $1.4 billion. Adjusted segment revenues rose 2%. The extra week added $77 million to revenues or approximately 5%. Within segment revenues, advertising declined around 5%, or down 7% in local currency and excluding the impact of the 53rd week, which was similar to the full year rate and the prior year rate. This was also a sequential improvement from the low double-digit rate decline in the prior quarter. 
Circulation and subscription revenues increased 5% or up 1% in local currency, and excluding the 53rd week, were relatively stable with last quarter and the prior year. News and Information Services reported segment EBITDA this quarter with $160 million, down 5% versus the prior period. The decline was driven by lower advertising revenues as well as investment spending and acquisition-related costs in connection with Checkout 51 and Unruly. These declines were partially offset by the impact from the additional week in the quarter and lower operating expenses. Adjusted segment EBITDA increased 10% compared to the prior year. 
Looking at performance across our key units and excluding the extra week in each case. At Dow Jones, domestic advertising at The Wall Street Journal declined around 12% versus the prior year quarter, with declines in print being partially offset by modest growth in digital. Digital accounted for approximately 1/3 of Dow Jones' ad revenues this quarter. 
Wall Street Journal circulation revenues grew 5% this quarter due to higher subscription pricing and higher digital paid subscribers. We implemented a $4 subscription price increase in July, which will be phased in over the next 12 months. And circulation revenues at The Wall Street Journal have now surpassed total ad revenues in the current fiscal year. Dow Jones' contribution to segment EBITDA increased this quarter and for fiscal 2016. At News Australia, advertising revenues for the quarter declined 13% or about 9% in local currency, relatively similar to last quarter, with local outpacing national. Circulation revenues at News Australia declined 3%, but were slightly up in constant currency as a result of cover price increases and higher paid digital subs, offsetting print volume declines. As expected, we continue to see the benefit of the cost-reduction program implemented at the end of Q2 and realized approximately AUD 40 million in the second half and expect to capture further savings in fiscal 2017. 
At News UK, advertising revenues declined 16% or down 10% in local currency, an improvement from the prior quarter. Circulation revenues at News UK were relatively flat versus the prior quarter, driven by a lift in paid volume at The Times and cover price increases taken this quarter for both The Sun and Times. In Q4, The Times saw high single-digits paid volume growth, likely benefiting from Brexit coverage. At News America Marketing, revenues were relatively flat versus the prior year, excluding the extra week, a marked improvement from the prior quarter. 
Domestic FSI revenues declined 14%, although the rate moderated from the prior quarter. In-store revenues grew mid-teens and digital, which only accounted for 5% of revenues this quarter, doubled, partially benefiting from the expansion of Checkout 51. 
Turning to the Book Publishing segment. Revenues increased 11% and segment EBITDA improved 52% versus the prior year as comparables versus the prior year have begun to normalize. This quarter benefited from a strong new release slate from Anderson Cooper, Cameron Diaz, Cynthia Sweeney, David Walliams in the U.K. and an improvement in Christian publishing as well as the impact of the 53rd week. Total digital revenues for the quarter were 19% of consumer revenues, down from 23%. 
In Digital Real Estate Services, total segment revenues increased $40 million or 21% to $229 million, which includes the consolidation of iProperty and DIAKRIT, both of which closed in February. Total reported segment EBITDA was $175 million, which reflects the impact of the settlement with Zillow. Excluding that, segment EBITDA would have been $53 million, up from $45 million in the prior year. Adjusted revenue grew 17% and adjusted EBITDA, which is inclusive of the $15 million of legal expenses at Move related to Zillow, grew 24%. 
REA's revenue grew 17% or approximately 21% in local currency due to higher list depth product penetration. Move revenues rose 21% versus the prior year, driven by strong growth in the connection for co-broke product, higher non-listing media revenues and an improvement in the professional software revenues led by Top Producer. Unique user growth at realtor.com remained strong, up 17% year-over-year to 53 million average per month for fiscal Q4. 
For the full year, Move's revenue was $357 million, up 27% on a stand-alone basis. And as we had expected, Move had a positive contribution to segment EBITDA, excluding the impact of legal costs and the settlement gain, but including stock-based compensation. This improvement came despite reinvesting for growth, and we expect to build on that momentum in fiscal 2017. 
In Cable Network Programming, revenues increased by $14 million or 11% compared to the prior year quarter. On a currency-adjusted basis and excluding the 53rd week, revenues rose around 7%. In local currency, and again, excluding the 53rd week, subscription revenues improved around 6%, and advertising revenues rose high single digits, reflecting record ratings, with viewership up mid-teens, driven by the NRL and V8 Supercars. 
Segment EBITDA in the quarter rose 5% on a reported basis and 14% adjusted for currency and reflects additional costs related to the simulcast of 3 additional NRL matches per week from Channel 9, as we indicated on the last earnings call as well as a modest benefit from the extra week. 
With respect to earnings from affiliates, Foxtel ended the quarter with more than 2.9 million total subscribers, with cable and satellite subscribers increasing approximately 5% compared to the prior year period and higher Presto subs despite ongoing competition from SVOD players. Foxtel revenues for the quarter declined 2%, but were up 2% in local currency, and EBITDA declined 5% or down 1% in local currency due to higher programming costs and an increase in subscriber acquisition costs, driven by new offers launched in January. 
As expected, churn in the quarter rose to 14% from around 10%, a similar trend with the prior quarter, largely due to nonrenewal of no contract offers. Importantly, underlying year-on-year churn data, when adjusting for the impact of new customer offers, has been stable. ARPU for the quarter was down approximately 3% to around AUD 89. 
Capital expenditures from continuing operations for fiscal '16 was $256 million, down from $308 million in the prior year, in line with our expectations. Fiscal 2016 included a tax benefit of $106 million from the release of valuation allowances resulting from the disposal of the Digital Education business in our fiscal first quarter. As a result, the company recorded an income tax benefit of $54 million for the fiscal year. 
On an adjusted basis, which excludes that benefit, restructuring and other onetime items, our underlying tax rate was 32.9% for the full year. We expect in fiscal 2017, our normalized tax rate will be in a similar range to fiscal '16. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash at 30th of June was $1.8 billion, and we had total borrowings of $369 million related to iProperty. Subject to court approval, we expect to pay out the remainder of the News America settlement accrual of around $250 million in the first quarter of fiscal '17. 
On June 30, we announced an offer for Wireless Group plc in the U.K., which is expected to close in the first half of this fiscal year, pending regulatory approval and satisfaction of other conditions. We have set aside $315 million for this acquisition as restricted cash on the balance sheet as a result of U.K. takeover panel rules. 
Heading into the new fiscal year, there are a few points to note. Advertising trends remained volatile and visibility continues to be limited, and we continue to aggressively seek out cost reductions. Fox Sports Australia will face an incremental AUD 10 million in Q1, similar to fiscal fourth quarter related to the simulcast of NRL matches. No major sports rights renewals are expected this fiscal year. 
For Digital Real Estate and REA, listing volume in July was negatively impacted by uncertainty around the federal election, and first half revenue growth will likely be skewed to the second quarter. 
And finally, on currency, if the spot rate for the Australian dollar holds at current levels at around $0.75, we would expect a modest benefit to the full year as compared to fiscal '16. 
And with that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A."

On top of that, I know the Australian operation continues to examine a number of opportunities in sort of shared service functions, et cetera. So I think we would expect to see slightly higher cost savings even than that in Australia. In the U.S., Dow Jones has been cutting costs, headcount was 6% lower this year than it was the year before. In addition to that, they are looking at a lot of the structural issues at Dow Jones, and we expect further cost-reduction programs to be implemented this year. In the U.K., there was a big cost-reduction program we announced, if you recall, in late January, February, that's being implemented. FTEs are down 8% year-over-year and the marketing spend is slightly higher, but the guys in the U.K. are also looking at backroom savings, and they're looking at some consolidation opportunities."

John, generally, there's a culture of cost consciousness in the company, as Bedi explained, clearly, there's a shift transition going on in the businesses. Print is still very precious to us, but digital ever more important, and our teams are being realigned accordingly. The other aspect that we're focusing on and we're certainly seeing savings, and a little difficult to quantify, but we'd be able to articulate it, over time, to you more precisely is in sharing services. And that's, for example, particularly the case in the U.K., where the businesses occupy a single building, which gives us an opportunity to examine what is the right size of services for contemporary business. As for ad performances, as Bedi had previously indicated, there is a problem with visibility. There's a certain amount of political instability that has been in Australia with an election and the uncertainty that followed it. As you know, we're in the midst of an interesting election in the U.S., and there has been some upheaval in the U.K. There's no doubt that, that has had something of an impact on the business in the last quarter. Looking ahead, visibility is a bit of an issue. But I think there's a lot more fundamental, more profound issue, which is, there's a lot of instability in the ad market itself. A lot of advertisers are questioning the return on investment, and we see a particular opportunity being host to a portfolio of premium sites to provide them not only with settings appropriate for their advertisements, i.e., high-quality content, but measurability. And we talk about visibility, of course, but viewability is very important. And it's interesting that there's an angst-driven debate in the advertising world about the viewability of ads. As I've said before, and it's worth emphasizing again, every print ad is a 100% viewable."

Radio is, these days, unlike some content forms, not subject to the vicissitudes of piracy. So we're very optimistic about Wireless Group. We're very optimistic about its potential for all of the News U.K. Properties. And just for example, its potential impact on Sun Bets,  which is -- they've rolled out this year in the U.K. by Rebekah Books and the team. Obviously, during a football match, making the broadcast for football match exciting, compelling for quite a lot of listeners and quite a lot of readers, the opportunity to have a flutter is something that they're interested in.

We ended fiscal year 2016 with strong results in the fourth quarter, highlighted by robust year-over-year growth in revenues and EBITDA at Digital Real Estate Services and a palpable upturn at Harpe",2387,"Thank you, Mike, and thank you all for joining the call. We ended fiscal year 2016 with strong results in the fourth quarter, highlighted by robust year-over-year growth in revenues and EBITDA at Digital Real Estate Services and a palpable upturn at HarperCollins. 
For the fourth quarter, reported revenues were $2.2 billion, a 5% increase versus the prior year. Total reported segment EBITDA was $361 million, up 68% compared to the prior year. This figure includes a $122 million benefit from the Zillow legal settlement. But even absent that adjustment, EBITDA still improved tangibly in the quarter. 
In Digital Real Estate, we experienced 21% growth in revenues in the fourth quarter, further illustrating the key role the segment is playing in News Corp's success. In fact, since our separation 3 years ago, revenues at Digital Real Estate have more than doubled, and the segment is expected to become the biggest contributor to EBITDA in the future, thanks to the ongoing growth of REA and the renaissance of realtor.com in the U.S. This increasing role in one of the world's fastest-growing digital sectors augers well for our future. 
Book Publishing ended the year with much momentum, highlighting the value of high-quality content and the ability to leverage that content across both print and digital platforms. HarperCollins' success this quarter, with revenues rising 11% and EBITDA surging 52% year-over-year, was driven by new releases and thoughtful cost initiatives. 
Fox Sports Australia had another good quarter, with increased revenues, thanks in part to record ratings, which came from capitalizing on its top-tier content and developing our long-term franchises in the country's most popular sports. The quarter's results certainly underscored the tremendous power of live sports, which have increased in relative value in a world of viewer fragmentation and program promiscuity.
While global print ad trends remained volatile, we saw modest sequential improvement in the News and Information Services sector this quarter, thanks to reduced costs and the continued development of digital.
In the fourth quarter, digital revenues accounted for 23% of segment revenues, up from 19% last year. In particular, the success of The Wall Street Journal is a testament to the importance of high-quality content with global appeal. This past quarter, the WSJ reached 948,000 digital-only subscribers, and that total will clearly surpass print subscribers in the near future. 
In the fourth quarter, we also relaunched the Sun's website, now reaching over 42 million unique monthly users compared with 15 million uniques last September before the lifting of the payable. Our U.K. team is focused on leveraging that immensely valuable brand across platforms, including through our recently announced offer for Wireless Group. We hope to complete the deal in early fiscal 2017 and take full advantage of this valuable media asset, whose recent ratings have continued their handsome growth. TalkSport, the flagship station, experienced an 8.4% increase in audience in the most recent quarter to 3.29 million listeners, according to official metrics. 
Ruminating on fiscal year 2016 as a whole, we have shown continued progress on our primary goals: to become more digital, global and diversified while containing costs and mixing prudent divestments with strategic investments. We are certainly proud of our providence, and we are a more focused company than we were at our rebirth in 2013. We assuredly believe that we have laid the foundation for sustainable growth and positive returns for our shareholders. 
Now for the business highlights before Bedi provides the financial granularity. Digital Real Estate continues to burgeon, and it's reshaping the growth profile of News Corp. Our renovation of realtor.com has propelled Move to improve profitability on an operational basis, excluding Zillow legal costs even as we have significantly reinvested in the business. We now look forward to building Move's profitability in the coming fiscal year. With a refurbished reputation, increased marketing and innovative products, Move and realtor.com are attractive record audiences and ever more advertising, thanks to the freshest listings, unique content and tools that benefit both realtors and consumers. 
Traffic to realtor-related sites grew to a record 53 million unique users in the fourth quarter and has continued to grow in July. Significantly, realtor.com leads the way in engagement. Its users view double the number of pages as the average visitor to Zillow and in fact, realtor.com has greater user engagement as measured by page views per user than LinkedIn, Amazon, Google and Twitter, according to comScore. That is concrete commitment and serious stickiness and patently valuable for advertisers as well as for realtors to benefit from the precious leads that realtor.com provides.
realtor.com has significantly grown its mobile presence, with mobile traffic increasing to more than 50% of overall traffic in the fourth quarter. Additionally, 60% of page views occurred on mobile devices, with mobile accounting for a majority of lead volume in the fourth quarter. 
Finally, one must note the $122 million gain from the amicable settlement of our litigation with Zillow. We are naturally pleased with these proceeds, which assisted cash flow for News Corp in the fourth quarter. We can now focus squarely on execution without legal distractions, however, copacetic the outcome. 
REA continues to strengthen its business in the Australian market. The company had another record year in reported revenues and profitability despite the acquisition cost for iProperty, the leading Southeast Asian property portal. We recently announced the formation of a global property network, which will bring together listings from REA, realtor.com, Mansion Global, PropTiger and iProperty into a comprehensive database accessible to people everywhere, accentuating our position as to the world's leading digital property business. 
HarperCollins had faced some challenges during the year to -- due to the Divergent Trilogy comps and changes in the e-book marketplace. But with those conditions normalizing, the publisher ended the year strongly. Among the notable success stories are Harper Lee's Go Set a Watchman; Daniel Silva's The English Spy; and books by Anderson Cooper and his mother, Gloria Vanderbilt; and in the U.K., the polymath, David Walliams, now one of the country's leading authors of children's fiction. 
Looking ahead to the coming year, we are optimistic about Megyn Kelly's much discussed book, Settle For More, scheduled for November; the highly anticipated Veronica Roth release; and Jesus Always by Sarah Young, the legendary author of Jesus Calling, which has been a bestseller for many years. 
The Harlequin acquisition has contributed to the growing global impact of HarperCollins, including in France, Italy and Brazil. And the publication of best-selling authors like Daniel Silva, Karin Slaughter, Stephanie Laurens and Allison Knowles in multiple international markets. Worth noting is the fact that we achieved our targeted $20 million cost savings following the acquisition and have increased the distribution of leading Harlequin titles. 
Foxtel, under new leadership, is driving higher subscriber volume, which is a priority for the business. The network had more than 2.9 million total subscribers at the end of the fiscal year. Foxtel continues to improve its content offerings, notably with the acquisition of the rights to the AFL through 2022 and the new agreement with top EPL clubs for broadcast rights, which means that devoted fans won't have to watch their favorite teams in the middle of the night. With the continuing emphasis on sports, original content and enhanced IP devices and offerings, such as the Foxtel Go mobile product, Foxtel will remain focused on driving higher subscriptions, which we believe is key to unlocking value for itself and News Corp throughout fiscal 2017. 
At Fox Sports, we saw record ratings this quarter, driven by the extremely popular NRL, the AFL and V8 Supercars, the Aussie variant of NASCAR. Our airing of all NRL matches live through the simulcast deal with Channel 9 is proving to be particularly popular, and the resonance should increase with the launch of a dedicated NRL channel later in fiscal 2017. As a result, we expect advertising trends will remain more positive for Fox Sports than for the industry as a whole, with the network continuing to gain audience share. 
Dow Jones experienced strong digital subscription growth over the past year. Circulation revenue for the year at The Wall Street Journal grew mid-single-digits, thanks to digital expansion and improved pricing. In fact, this year, circulation revenues were higher than advertising revenues, underlining the balanced revenue streams at Dow Jones. 
Overall, more than 50% of Dow Jones' revenues came from digital this year. That's part of a calculated realignment of the revenue stream and also a testament to the strong and growing value of premium content. Custom content is also a big driver of advertising revenues, and we expect it to represent a larger part of Dow Jones growth going forward. 
Dow Jones also continued to roll out new and improved products in fiscal year 2016, including WSJ PRO, a watch news app, and the WSJ City app in the U.K., and importantly, a Factiva Mobile app. Factiva is a treasure trove of valuable content, and we are working to customize and enhance the experience for subscribers. 
On the institutional side, Dow Jones will continue to push high-growth segments, including risk and compliance. As companies are under increasing scrutiny and must necessarily be strictly compliant, we have firm faith in that business, which expanded 34% last quarter compared to a year ago. 
At News UK, we will continue to leverage The Sun's popular daily news and entertainment features as we enhance our mobile-first strategy. We are bolstering reader engagement through such initiatives as the Dream Team, bingo and sports betting, all of which we expect to see driving incremental revenues in fiscal year 2017. 
While advertising remains challenging, The Times continues to benefit from its premium content and audiences. According to ABC figures, at the end of June, there were 413,600 subscribers to The Times and Sunday Times, an increase of 3.4% year-over-year. More than 800 -- 182,000 of the subscriptions are digital-only, an increase from 172,000 in the prior year. This past quarter, total print sales for The Times were up double digits versus the prior year. That highlights the power of print as a platform and vindicates our commitment to quality journalism when other media companies were slashing and burning their budgets. 
News Corp Australia benefited from initiatives that took out 2.5% of fixed costs in the second half of fiscal year 2016, and further savings are expected in the current fiscal year. The company also entered into an agreement to purchase the APN Australian regional media portfolio, which reaches 1.6 million people across print, online and mobile. We expect the purchase, subject to regulatory and APN shareholder approval, to help us grow in Northern Australia and result in significant cost and efficiency synergies in our production and distribution operations. 
Meanwhile, the Australian newspaper has grown to a record high readership of more than 3.4 million print and digital readers as of May. This represents an 11% jump over the prior 3 months. 
In the United States, the New York Post had 54 million monthly unique users in June, and 40% of advertising revenues were digital, a figure that could soon surpass 50%. The team has just launched Page Six TV, which has been performing strongly in a 3-week trial across a number of Fox television stations in the U.S., showing the value of that brand in the post stable. 
News America Marketing ended the year on a strong note, thanks to muscular growth in the install business. Meanwhile, the company is focused on accelerating mobile adoption, notably through Checkout 51. This increasingly popular app consistently ranked in the top 10 of all retail-related apps, above Walmart and Walgreens, helps consumers across country save money and generates a wealth of data, which can be leveraged across a number of News Corp businesses. 
In fiscal 2017, we expect to continue investing in Checkout 51, with the goal of reaching 10 million users by the end of this calendar year, which we believe is a key milestone in drawing additional offers from our CPG partners, the larger the audience, the more compelling the offers we can present and the greater the loyalty we will win from users. We are seeing that virtuous cycle in motion now at Checkout 51. 
We have aimed to make the new, news more than a sum of its parts, and that is particularly the case in our exponential digital development. We aspire to be ever more digital and global, and helping us in that mission is a concentration on collaboration as well as on the selective acquisition of tech startups that extend our digital capabilities. For example, the journal, realtor.com and Imagine Global have collaborated to turbocharge realtor.com and distribute content of interest to potential property owners, helping drive engagement across their platforms. Our property sites around the world know we routinely share software, market metrics and listings data. 
Storyful supplies video to a variety of News Corp mastheads, including the Sun, the New York Post and The Wall Street Journal as well as sharing expertise with HarperCollins to extend its video outreach. Unruly is providing valuable advertising metrics to enhance the brand building of our companies as well as assisting external clients with its unique expertise. 
The rapid pace, which the contemporary world is turning, with attendant economic and social upheaval, has put a premium on premium content, fast, accurate news and information upon which investors and all citizens rely. Insight is invaluable in these complex times. 
We believe News Corp is ideally positioned to meet this broad-based societal demand, whether it's Storyful, separating user-generated video facts from video fiction, or our global Digital Real Estate platforms, giving the most complete and accurate data to consumers, along with independent analysis to inform investment decisions. 
In particular, our strategy will focus on areas including: product development, particularly in mobile and video, to drive engagement across our properties; leveraging and further monetizing data, beginning with an important initiative this year, linking our U.S. audiences to create a powerful digital network for advertising clients; and capitalizing on opportunistic acquisitions to further buttress our revenue stream and to fortify the foundations of future growth. This strategy is designed to enhance our businesses in transition, to accelerate revenue growth, particularly at our real estate franchise, and to ensure long-term robust return to our investors. 
For the fine detail, I now hand you over to Bedi."

Starting with our fourth quarter results. We reported fiscal '16 fourth quarter total revenues of $2.2 billion, up 5% from the prior year. As we had hoped, currency headwinds moderated during the quarter, with an impact of only $54 million",1856,"Thanks, Robert. Starting with our fourth quarter results. We reported fiscal '16 fourth quarter total revenues of $2.2 billion, up 5% from the prior year. As we had hoped, currency headwinds moderated during the quarter, with an impact of only $54 million to reported revenues. 
As we mentioned previously, this being a 53-week fiscal year for us, fiscal fourth quarter includes an extra week, which positively impacted revenues by $112 million, with the majority of that at News and Information Services segment. Excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, acquisitions and divestitures, adjusted revenues grew 6% compared to the prior year, including the extra week, and we're relatively flat excluding that. 
Reported total segment EBITDA was $361 million, which includes a benefit of $122 million related to the Zillow settlement. Excluding that benefit, total segment EBITDA would have been $239 million. Adjusted EBITDA, which excludes the settlement benefit as well as acquisitions, the impact of currency and legal costs related to the U.K. Newspaper Matters grew 23% versus the prior year period. Both reported and adjusted EBITDA also include the impact of the extra week that I mentioned earlier. 
For the quarter, EPS from continuing operations, which includes the Zillow settlement benefit net of tax, were $0.16 compared to $0.01 in the prior year. Adjusted EPS from continuing operations were $0.10 versus $0.08 in the prior year. 
For the full year fiscal '16, we reported total revenues of $8.3 billion, a 3% decline compared to the prior year. The decline in revenues included a negative impact from foreign currency of $455 million. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, acquisitions and divestitures, adjusted revenues for the year were flat compared to the prior year. 
Reported total segment EBITDA was $684 million, which includes a onetime charge of $280 million for the settlement of litigation and related claims at News America Marketing and the onetime gain for the Zillow settlement I mentioned earlier. Negative foreign currency impact reduced segment EBITDA by $70 million this year. Adjusted EBITDA, which excludes both the settlements as well as acquisitions, the impact of currency and legal costs related to the U.K. Newspaper Matters, declined 4%. And for the year, EPS from continuing operations were $0.28 compared to $0.51 in the prior year, and adjusted EPS from continuing operations were $0.40 versus $0.59 from the prior year. 
Now let's turn to the individual operating segments through a fourth quarter review and some full year highlights. In News and Information Services, revenues for the quarter rose 1% from the prior year to $1.4 billion. Adjusted segment revenues rose 2%. The extra week added $77 million to revenues or approximately 5%. Within segment revenues, advertising declined around 5%, or down 7% in local currency and excluding the impact of the 53rd week, which was similar to the full year rate and the prior year rate. This was also a sequential improvement from the low double-digit rate decline in the prior quarter. 
Circulation and subscription revenues increased 5% or up 1% in local currency, and excluding the 53rd week, were relatively stable with last quarter and the prior year. News and Information Services reported segment EBITDA this quarter with $160 million, down 5% versus the prior period. The decline was driven by lower advertising revenues as well as investment spending and acquisition-related costs in connection with Checkout 51 and Unruly. These declines were partially offset by the impact from the additional week in the quarter and lower operating expenses. Adjusted segment EBITDA increased 10% compared to the prior year. 
Looking at performance across our key units and excluding the extra week in each case. At Dow Jones, domestic advertising at The Wall Street Journal declined around 12% versus the prior year quarter, with declines in print being partially offset by modest growth in digital. Digital accounted for approximately 1/3 of Dow Jones' ad revenues this quarter. 
Wall Street Journal circulation revenues grew 5% this quarter due to higher subscription pricing and higher digital paid subscribers. We implemented a $4 subscription price increase in July, which will be phased in over the next 12 months. And circulation revenues at The Wall Street Journal have now surpassed total ad revenues in the current fiscal year. Dow Jones' contribution to segment EBITDA increased this quarter and for fiscal 2016. At News Australia, advertising revenues for the quarter declined 13% or about 9% in local currency, relatively similar to last quarter, with local outpacing national. Circulation revenues at News Australia declined 3%, but were slightly up in constant currency as a result of cover price increases and higher paid digital subs, offsetting print volume declines. As expected, we continue to see the benefit of the cost-reduction program implemented at the end of Q2 and realized approximately AUD 40 million in the second half and expect to capture further savings in fiscal 2017. 
At News UK, advertising revenues declined 16% or down 10% in local currency, an improvement from the prior quarter. Circulation revenues at News UK were relatively flat versus the prior quarter, driven by a lift in paid volume at The Times and cover price increases taken this quarter for both The Sun and Times. In Q4, The Times saw high single-digits paid volume growth, likely benefiting from Brexit coverage. At News America Marketing, revenues were relatively flat versus the prior year, excluding the extra week, a marked improvement from the prior quarter. 
Domestic FSI revenues declined 14%, although the rate moderated from the prior quarter. In-store revenues grew mid-teens and digital, which only accounted for 5% of revenues this quarter, doubled, partially benefiting from the expansion of Checkout 51. 
Turning to the Book Publishing segment. Revenues increased 11% and segment EBITDA improved 52% versus the prior year as comparables versus the prior year have begun to normalize. This quarter benefited from a strong new release slate from Anderson Cooper, Cameron Diaz, Cynthia Sweeney, David Walliams in the U.K. and an improvement in Christian publishing as well as the impact of the 53rd week. Total digital revenues for the quarter were 19% of consumer revenues, down from 23%. 
In Digital Real Estate Services, total segment revenues increased $40 million or 21% to $229 million, which includes the consolidation of iProperty and DIAKRIT, both of which closed in February. Total reported segment EBITDA was $175 million, which reflects the impact of the settlement with Zillow. Excluding that, segment EBITDA would have been $53 million, up from $45 million in the prior year. Adjusted revenue grew 17% and adjusted EBITDA, which is inclusive of the $15 million of legal expenses at Move related to Zillow, grew 24%. 
REA's revenue grew 17% or approximately 21% in local currency due to higher list depth product penetration. Move revenues rose 21% versus the prior year, driven by strong growth in the connection for co-broke product, higher non-listing media revenues and an improvement in the professional software revenues led by Top Producer. Unique user growth at realtor.com remained strong, up 17% year-over-year to 53 million average per month for fiscal Q4. 
For the full year, Move's revenue was $357 million, up 27% on a stand-alone basis. And as we had expected, Move had a positive contribution to segment EBITDA, excluding the impact of legal costs and the settlement gain, but including stock-based compensation. This improvement came despite reinvesting for growth, and we expect to build on that momentum in fiscal 2017. 
In Cable Network Programming, revenues increased by $14 million or 11% compared to the prior year quarter. On a currency-adjusted basis and excluding the 53rd week, revenues rose around 7%. In local currency, and again, excluding the 53rd week, subscription revenues improved around 6%, and advertising revenues rose high single digits, reflecting record ratings, with viewership up mid-teens, driven by the NRL and V8 Supercars. 
Segment EBITDA in the quarter rose 5% on a reported basis and 14% adjusted for currency and reflects additional costs related to the simulcast of 3 additional NRL matches per week from Channel 9, as we indicated on the last earnings call as well as a modest benefit from the extra week. 
With respect to earnings from affiliates, Foxtel ended the quarter with more than 2.9 million total subscribers, with cable and satellite subscribers increasing approximately 5% compared to the prior year period and higher Presto subs despite ongoing competition from SVOD players. Foxtel revenues for the quarter declined 2%, but were up 2% in local currency, and EBITDA declined 5% or down 1% in local currency due to higher programming costs and an increase in subscriber acquisition costs, driven by new offers launched in January. 
As expected, churn in the quarter rose to 14% from around 10%, a similar trend with the prior quarter, largely due to nonrenewal of no contract offers. Importantly, underlying year-on-year churn data, when adjusting for the impact of new customer offers, has been stable. ARPU for the quarter was down approximately 3% to around AUD 89. 
Capital expenditures from continuing operations for fiscal '16 was $256 million, down from $308 million in the prior year, in line with our expectations. Fiscal 2016 included a tax benefit of $106 million from the release of valuation allowances resulting from the disposal of the Digital Education business in our fiscal first quarter. As a result, the company recorded an income tax benefit of $54 million for the fiscal year. 
On an adjusted basis, which excludes that benefit, restructuring and other onetime items, our underlying tax rate was 32.9% for the full year. We expect in fiscal 2017, our normalized tax rate will be in a similar range to fiscal '16. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash at 30th of June was $1.8 billion, and we had total borrowings of $369 million related to iProperty. Subject to court approval, we expect to pay out the remainder of the News America settlement accrual of around $250 million in the first quarter of fiscal '17. 
On June 30, we announced an offer for Wireless Group plc in the U.K., which is expected to close in the first half of this fiscal year, pending regulatory approval and satisfaction of other conditions. We have set aside $315 million for this acquisition as restricted cash on the balance sheet as a result of U.K. takeover panel rules. 
Heading into the new fiscal year, there are a few points to note. Advertising trends remained volatile and visibility continues to be limited, and we continue to aggressively seek out cost reductions. Fox Sports Australia will face an incremental AUD 10 million in Q1, similar to fiscal fourth quarter related to the simulcast of NRL matches. No major sports rights renewals are expected this fiscal year. 
For Digital Real Estate and REA, listing volume in July was negatively impacted by uncertainty around the federal election, and first half revenue growth will likely be skewed to the second quarter. 
And finally, on currency, if the spot rate for the Australian dollar holds at current levels at around $0.75, we would expect a modest benefit to the full year as compared to fiscal '16. 
And with that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A."

So on cost reductions in Australia, we had previously said that the annual program was around 5%, and 2.5% was realized in fiscal '16, and we expect the remainder of that to sort of flow-through in fiscal '17. On top of that, I know the Australian operation continues to examine a number of opportunities in sort of shared service functions, et cetera. So I think we would expect to see slightly higher cost savings even than that in Australia. In the U.S., Dow Jones has been cutting costs, headcount was 6% lower this year than it was the year before. In addition to that, they are looking at a lot of the structural issues at Dow Jones, and we expect further cost-reduction programs to be implemented this year. In the U.K., there was a big cost-reduction program we announced, if you recall, in late January, February, that's being implemented. FTEs are down 8% year-over-year and the marketing spend is slightly higher, but the guys in the U.K. are also looking at backroom savings, and they're looking at some consolidation opportunities."

John, generally, there's a culture of cost consciousness in the company, as Bedi explained, clearly, there's a shift transition going on in the businesses. Print is still very precious to us, but digital ever more important, and our teams are being realigned accordingly. The other aspect that we're focusing on and we're certainly seeing savings, and a little difficult to quantify, but we'd be able to articulate it, over time, to you more precisely is in sharing services. And that's, for example, particularly the case in the U.K., where the businesses occupy a single building, which gives us an opportunity to examine what is the right size of services for contemporary business. As for ad performances, as Bedi had previously indicated, there is a problem with visibility. There's a certain amount of political instability that has been in Australia with an election and the uncertainty that followed it. As you know, we're in the midst of an interesting election in the U.S., and there has been some upheaval in the U.K. There's no doubt that, that has had something of an impact on the business in the last quarter. Looking ahead, visibility is a bit of an issue. But I think there's a lot more fundamental, more profound issue, which is, there's a lot of instability in the ad market itself. A lot of advertisers are questioning the return on investment, and we see a particular opportunity being host to a portfolio of premium sites to provide them not only with settings appropriate for their advertisements, i.e., high-quality content, but measurability. And we talk about visibility, of course, but viewability is very important. And it's interesting that there's an angst-driven debate in the advertising world about the viewability of ads. As I've said before, and it's worth emphasizing again, every print ad is a 100% viewable."

Radio is, these days, unlike some content forms, not subject to the vicissitudes of piracy. So we're very optimistic about Wireless Group. We're very optimistic about its potential for all of the News U.K. Properties. And just for example, its potential impact on Sun Bets,  which is -- they've rolled out this year in the U.K. by Rebekah Books and the team. Obviously, during a football match, making the broadcast for football match exciting, compelling for quite a lot of listeners and quite a lot of readers, the opportunity to have a flutter is something that they're interested in.

The most recent quarter has highlighted the continuing digital development at News Corp at a time of great transition for media companies, many of which are struggling to cope with evolution. [ph] Our growing portfolio of Digital Products",2319,"Thank you, Mike. The most recent quarter has highlighted the continuing digital development at News Corp at a time of great transition for media companies, many of which are struggling to cope with evolution. [ph] Our growing portfolio of Digital Products and our global character have enabled us, not only to weather those profound changes, but to build a firm foundation for profitable future. There is no doubt that 2 of our core markets, the U.S. and U.K., have been characterized by a certain amount of uncertainty in the economic and political environment, but we have remained focused on developing long term and robust sources of revenue while curtailing costs without undermining the quality of our uniquely valuable content. Collaboration among our businesses has increased, with the sharing of lessons, software and data to provide more valuable insights for our clients, leaders and advertisers. 
During the first quarter of financial year 2017, despite a distinctly soft print advertising market and patent weakness in the British pound, our revenues were down only slightly. It is thus clear that our emphasis on digital real estate has given the company more resilience in even difficult trading periods. 
We are still at the early stages of that real estate development, particularly in the U.S., where we are renovating realtor.com while still living in the house. We expect the rate of growth at realtor.com will increase later in the year as new products and pricing take hold in a U.S. property market that is itself still recovering from the extreme dislocation of the financial crisis. 
In the most recent quarter, total segment EBITDA declined 21% versus the prior year, but half of that decrease was due to planned investments and onetime transaction costs, and we do not expect the quarterly performance to be reflective of the full year results. In fact, we expect to see EBITDA improvements in the remainder of the year, largely driven by growth in digital real estate and at HarperCollins. 
As our real estate business continues to evolve and expand, we are now highlighting listing-based revenues separately in the Digital Real Estate Services segment to better reflect our performance and provide a clearer indication of the trajectory in that increasingly important sector. 
Significantly, this highlights our reduced reliance on traditional advertising, which today accounts for only 1/3 of our total revenues.
In addition to the strength of digital real estate, we are also pleased with the trends in Book Publishing and at News America Marketing, which showed continuing growth in its in-store product revenue and is ahead of schedule in achieving its year-end goal of 10 million downloads of the Checkout 51 app, which provides incentives to shoppers and unique marketing opportunities for consumer goods producers and retailers. 
As mentioned, one of the more profound changes at News Corp since its reincarnation in 2013 is the burgeoning of the digital real estate business, building on our early success with REA in Australia and complementing that with investments in the U.S, East Asia and India. 
REA performed well again in the quarter despite some weakness in listing volume. Pricing improved, and services provided to agents were enhanced. 
Revenues expanded by 16% in local currency, including sales at the recently acquired iProperty. REA is a clear market leader in Australia and has proven the robustness of its business by expanding reach and revenue despite macroeconomic fluctuations in Australia. 
Move, which operates realtor.com, experienced 9% revenue growth in the first quarter as we revamped the site and retooled its products. With the rollout of Showcase 2.0 in December and deeper penetration from the recently launched stellar leads and turbo products, we are confident revenue momentum will build in coming months.
We firmly believe realtor.com will make a meaningful contribution to segment revenue and EBITDA growth this year. We are investing for the long term but not at the expense of returns for investors. 
According to comScore, engagement with realtor.com leads the competition by a significant margin. Since our acquisition of Move 2 years ago this month, realtor.com's audience has grown more than 60%, and brand awareness of realtor.com is at 87%, which is up more than 25% in the last 18 months.
In Book Publishing, HarperCollins reported a 14% increase in EBITDA despite a 5% decline in revenue, which was largely the result of the impact of the comparison with last year's sales of Go Set a Watchman, the To Kill a Mockingbird prequel-sequel. The HarperCollins team is increasingly focused on books which resonate beyond the traditional release as is evident from the popularity of such titles as J. D. Vance's Hillbilly Elegy and Sarah Young's books, including the new Jesus Always, which builds on the success of the Jesus Calling series.
Also performing well are The Black Widow by Daniel Silva, The Magnolia Story by Joanna and Chip Gaines, and Commonwealth by Ann Patchett. While a consolidation of our international operations in tandem with the Harlequin acquisition has given us a significantly more powerful global platform. We are also able to use our trade assets to market crossover successes from the Harlequin stable of writers, which is increasing both sales and margins for select titles. 
In coming weeks, we will see the release of the highly anticipated Settle For More by Megyn Kelly. That title Settle For More will be our motto in coming quarters. We also have optimistic expectations for Veronica Roth's next book, Carve The Mark. Veronica wrote the extremely successful Divergent trilogy; and For Chaos by Patricia Cornwall. 
In news and information across our mastheads, we saw a more challenging print advertising marketplace as has already been articulated by other companies in the sector. While digital advertising increased, that growth was not enough to offset the decline in print. There is no doubt that the advertising market is in upheaval, and that the renewed advertiser focus on viewability and measurability should naturally benefit trusted brands with accurate metrics. Hype and hip are not alternatives to quality and integrity. 
In the middle of this commercial commotion, it's appropriate that ad agencies are under scrutiny as too much ad tech is fad tech. 
Advertising at The Wall Street Journal was down 21%, but our circulation revenue rose 6%, and the number of paid digital subscribers at The Wall Street Journal crossed the 1 million mark in September. The transition at the WSJ was highlighted by the fact that digital accounted for a record 55% of revenues this quarter. Obviously, some of that change is due to the decline in print advertising, but it also reflects the emphasis on broadening the digital subscriber base and the long-term strategy of upselling high-yielding specialist products to those subscribers. 
Historically, advertising accounted for about half the revenues at Dow Jones, but that ratio is now closer to 1/3. Clearly, there is a renewed emphasis on cost control, including a reduction in headcount at Dow Jones and a redesign of the journal itself. You'll be able to see the results of that redesign in coming weeks, and it will be obvious that print remains a very powerful platform and that the journal has an audience of unique influence and affluence.
At News Corp Australia, we continued to confront the cost base while broadening our range of digital offerings. We experienced strong digital paid subscriber growth in the first quarter and expanded the number of markets with a premium hybrid model, allowing limited free access along with a paid-for premium subscription. That model builds on the success we have seen at The Australian. 
Meanwhile, at news.com.au, Australia's leading news website, advertising revenue rose more than 30% in local currency compared to the same period last year. 
Sport is a vital part of our offering in Australia, which is why we announced the acquisition of the Punters Paradise website in October, offering use, analysis and comparative odds for horse racing and other sports. 
At the same time, we are keen to dispose of noncore assets to sharpen the focus of our operations. To that end, we sold our stake in New Zealand media and entertainment and hope to complete the sale of CarsGuide and the Sunday Times in Perth by the end of fiscal Q2. 
At News UK, The Times continues to gain market share and drive higher volume growth, experiencing 13% gain in print circulation in the first quarter in a sector it is too often defined by a decline. 
At The Sun, while advertising revenues have fallen, the digital audience has expanded dramatically since the pay wall was lifted late last year. 
We are seeking to attract loyal readers with quality content and not digital drive-bys distracted by vacuous contentious clickbaits.  
In September, there were almost 46 million monthly visitors to The Sun compared to 15 million units in September 2015 before the listing of the payable. News UK also benefit from increases masthead and from the launch of in August. With the acquisition of Wireless Group, the payment News UK is working on the integration of this valuable asset, leveraging talent across platforms, fashioning new ad packages to take advantage of multimedia opportunities and cross promoting our brands, including Sun beds, which should be a powerful generator of future revenue for the company. 
And speaking of successful popular titles, digital ad revenue for Q1 grew 42% year-over-year at the New York Post with a broader digital postage network had a record 65.1 million unique visitors in September, an increase of 109% year-over-year based on internal metrics.
At News America Marketing, in-store continue to post strong revenue growth driven by innovative avenues point-of-purchase persuasion is a powerful asset that we have in News America Marketing, which also has valuable direct links to advertisers who rely on its unique market intelligence. In the past, digital has been a rather modest part of News America Marketing's offering, but the acquisition of Checkout 51 has changed that outlook dramatically. We had targeted the acquisition of 10 million members this calendar year at Checkout 51 that could top the that total this month, if not this week. The larger the audience, the better quality offerings, the sticker the experience. That virtual was clearly in motion at Checkout 51 where we've had an influx in new deals from companies such as Procter and Gamble,  Mondelez and General Motors. We have just launched a Spanish-language version of the app to appeal to the large Latino audience in the U.S. while we are able to gather rich permission data from users that have supreme value to advertisers wanting an insight into shopping habits. And we're looking forward to the integration of PayPal in the new Checkout 51 expected by December, which will make it even easier for consumers to receive rebates further purchases. 
Foxtel posted modest year-over-year growth in cable satellite subscribers although there was higher churn partially related to promotional low-contract offers last fiscal year. Foxtel remains keenly focused on improving the quality of experience of subscribers and providing more product focus. Hence, the decision to unwind the joint venture with 7 West. The executive team led by Peter Thanh is determined to convey the potential subscribers that clear Foxtel [indiscernible] This offering is vastly superior to that of competitors. Foxtel plays streaming service will roll out next month. We present consumers with greater choice of flexible packages as well as much easier access to Foxtel's premium content including Fox Sports. This viewer numbers have repeatedly set records in recent months. To ensure that subscribers have an unparalleled experience, Foxtel announced this quarter a new agreement with HBO that will get Foxtel even more extensive rights to HBO's larger content through 2021. Despite the focus on product enhancement and infrastructure investments, we were encouraged to see relatively stable EBITDA this quarter. As for Fox Sports, the record ratings were particularly pronounced in RL while there also strong performance in's biology rules football and motor racing. NRL viewership was up 11% roll games, and those exclusive to Fox Sports were up 15%. TotalView viewership was up 8%, while the preliminary between Giants and the western bulldogs an ultimate view was the #1 subscription TV program so far in calendar year 2016 Australia. That increased viewership as well as expanding digital advertising where catalyst for advertising growth of low double digits in local currency in the first quarter, which compares rather favorably to levels elsewhere in the industry. Costs were higher in the first quarter as we'd expected, reflecting the timing sports expenses about which maybe will have further details. Thankfully, these quarterly costs are not reflective of the full year exposure.
Globally, we continue to integrate our Storyful and Unruly acquisitions into our existing brands. News UK now brings Storyful and Unruly into joint pictures with digital advertising. Storyful, which has a unique ability to define meaningful moments of social media has become a part of the pitch for our Dow Jones risk and compliance business. The consumer has a problem with the products and uploads a video or a comment. Storyful's unique access to show social patterns globally allows it to track the incident. It also remains the worlds leaders authenticator of social video for News agencies and broadcasters around the world. 
In conclusion, News Corp is not just a news company. We are a digital real estate company and a global and information company. We are proud of our products and are leading the way in defining a digital future for media, whether it be through the strength of our mastheads, our mobile or the rapid growth of innovative News and commercial apps. That focus on long-term growth is complemented by a rigorous monitoring of costs in the here and now. We are extremely cautious of our responsibility to shareholders to create products that will prosper while ensuring that we are custodians of our traditional businesses in transition. Speaking of Kenny, I now pass you over to our CFO, Bedi Singh."

Currency had a $36 million unfavorable impact to revenues with modest year-over-year improvement in the Australian dollar, more than offset by continued weakness in the British pound. Total segment EBITDA was 130 million, including $5 million in transaction related costs for the wireless group acquisition compared to $165 million in the prior year. For the quarter EPS from continuing operations are negative $0.03 compared to positive $0.22 in the prior year. Adjusted EPS from continuing operations are negative $0.01 versus positive $0.05 in the prior year.
Before discussing segment performance, as Robert noted, listing-based revenues from our digital real estate businesses are now captured in a new real estate line on the income statement to better highlight that growth. Prior to this change, those revenues were reflected within advertising revenues. We have also adjusted prior year comparatives for this. This real estate revenue line represented 9% of total revenues this quarter and grew 19% compared to the prior year.
Turning to the individual operating segments. In News and Information Services, revenues for the quarter decreased 5% from the prior year to approximately $1.2 billion. And within segment revenues, advertising which accounted for just under 50% of revenues decreased around 11% or down 10% in local currencies, driven by weaker global print ad trends. Circulation and subscription revenues decreased 4%, but were up 1% in local currency which is relatively stable with last quarter and the prior year, driven by higher paid digital volume and price increases. 
News and Information Services segment EBITDA this quarter was $46 million, down from $83 million in the prior period. This decrease was driven by lower print advertising revenues combined with $12 million in additional investment spending at Checkout 51 and the $5 million in Wireless Group transaction costs, partially offset by cost savings initiatives.
Looking at performance across our key units. At Dow Jones, domestic advertising declined 21% versus the prior year quarter, which is greater than last fiscal fourth quarter rate, reflecting a weaker print market, most notably in the finance and technology categories. On a positive note, Wall Street Journal circulation revenues grew over 6% this quarter, due to higher subscription pricing and higher visible paying subscribers with digital-only subs surpassing the 1 million mark during the quarter, as Robert noted.
At the professional information business, revenues were a little stable. And as Robert mentioned, Dow Jones announced a series of initiatives focused on modernizing and rationalizing print circulation while shifting resources to digital. As part of the plan, we are targeting approximately 8% or $100 million reduction of the cost structure on an annualized basis by the end of fiscal '18. The restructuring program will begin implementation in Q2 this year and is expected to continue into Q3 with an anticipated restructuring charge of between $50 million to $60 million pretax during fiscal 2017 and benefits starting to phase in over the remainder of the fiscal year.
We believe this timely response to the secular print advertising declines will leave the business well positioned to maximize the digital growth opportunity.
At News Australia, advertising revenues for the quarter declined 7% or approximately 11% in local currency, relatively similar to the last fiscal fourth quarter.
Circulation revenue in Australia increased modestly for both reported and under local currency basis and as a result of cover price increases and higher paid digital subs offsetting print volume declines.
While we continue to benefit from the cost reduction program that News Australia announced in the second half of fiscal 2016, which totaled around 5% of the cost base, we are now embarking on further cost initiatives. We expect an additional AUD 40 million in cost savings this fiscal year while we continue to push digital initiatives more broadly.
At News UK, whilst reported advertising revenue decreased 28%, ad revenues were down mid-teens in local currency, primarily due to print declines.
Circulation revenues at News UK declined mid-teens versus the prior quarter but relatively flat in local currency as cover price increases of both The Sun and The Times were offset by single-volume declines.
News UK also benefited this quarter from previously announced cost savings initiatives as well as lower production costs and remains focused on identifying further cost reductions.
At News America Marketing, the business overall performed well with revenues relatively flat versus the prior year, driven by mid-teens growth in domestic in-store revenues. Domestic SSI revenue was down mid-teens due to lower volume. And at Checkout 51, we achieved over 9 million numbers adding approximately $3 million this quarter and well on pace to achieve $10 million by the end of this calendar year, which as Robert mentioned, is a key initiative for accelerating the digital transition of News America Marketing.
Turning to the Book Publishing segment. Revenue decreased 5%, but segment EBITDA improved 14% versus the prior year, which included the release of Go Set a Watchman that accounted for $32 million in revenues in the prior year quarter. EBITDA margins improved [indiscernible] 12.3% from 10.3% in the prior year, driven by the mix in titles. And this quarter benefited from a strong new release including Black widow by Daniel Sova, Hillbilly by JD vans and Sarah Youngwood of Jesus Always. Total digital revenues were approximately 20% of consumer revenues similar to the prior year.
In Digital Real Estate Services, total segment revenues increased $35 million or 18% to $226 million. Segment EBITDA was $67 million, up from $57 million in the prior year. REA's revenue grew 22% or approximately 16% in local currency due to an increase of Australian residential revenue, benefiting from favorable product mix combined with modest revenue contributions from iProperty.
Results were partially offset by a softer listing volumes in Australia declining approximately 8% versus the prior year. REA reported their fiscal first quarter earnings today and just concluded the conference call, which provided more quality detail.
Move revenues rose 9% to $93 million versus the prior year, reflecting continued strong performance from co-brokerage after more than doubling the Q1 fiscal '16 as well as growth in software services revenue albeit at a slower rate.
The Move team is focused on the next-generation showcase product, which we expect to roll out later this quarter and further penetration of recently launched new products, including and seller leads. We, therefore, expect revenue growth to accelerate in the second half of the year and are on track to deliver increasing positive contributions to segment EBITDA this fiscal year. Average monthly unique user growth at realtor.com remains strong, up 15% year-over-year to $53 million in the quarter.
In Cable Network Programming, revenues increased by 3% compared to the prior year quarter, primarily due to advertising growing mid-teens benefiting from higher rating across the board as well as higher contributions from digital advertising.
Segment EBITDA in the quarter was $14 [ph] million, which was $14 million lower than the prior year quarter due to as expected costs related to the costs of additional NRL matches from Channel 9 and airing of the Sri Lanka Australia booth, partially offset by the absence of the EPL rights costs.
We do expect EBITDA to improve in Q2 due to the absence of costs from the English Premier League and rugby World Cup which we have in the prior year.
With respect to earnings from affiliates, Foxtel ended the quarter with approximately 2.9 million total subscribers with closing cable and satellite subscribers increasing approximately 1% compared to the prior year period.
Last month, Foxtel announced that it had bought out 7 rest media shapes in the joint venture and the press those service will be subsequently closed, and Foxtel will shift its IP efforts to Foxtel Play. Existing Presto customers will be invited to moved to the newer Foxtel play, and Presto will seize operations on January 31, 2017. Foxtel recorded a $21 million loss as a result of the decision to cease Presto operations, and our equity income was $11 million lowered principally as a result of this.
Foxtel revenues for the quarter increased 5% and were up 1% in local currency, and EBITDA increased 2% but was down 2% in local currency due to higher programming costs. Churn, as expected, remained above prior year at 15.5% as we cycled through some historical no-contract offers. Importantly, underlying year-on-year churn data, when adjusting for the impact of new customer office has been more stable. ARPU for the quarter was down approximately 3% or around AUD 88.
Capital expenditures from continuing operations for the quarter were $49 million lower than $63 million in the prior year, and turning to the balance sheet, net cash of 30 September was $1.1 billion, including $377 million of debt related to iProperty. Cash on the balance sheet was down from fourth quarter 2016, principally reflecting the payout of the News America Marketing settlement of around $250 million. 
So in summary, while the quarter faced some obvious challenges as we have noted, we expect to see improvements for the remainder of the year versus the prior year. A few points to highlight. Whilst print advertising trends relate remain very volatile and visibility continues to be limited we have stepped up our cost savings initiatives, particularly at Dow Jones and expect improved EBITDA performance in the current quarter and the balance of the year. We will also be including the contribution from Wireless Group within the News and Information Services segment from October 1.
Book Publishing should see favorable comparisons and we look forward to the release of mobile Megyn Kelly, Chaos by Patricia Conwell and the Magnolia Story by Joanna Gains as well as carryover sales from Jesus always this area which do we best quarter. We had a strong roster this year and expect to see a return to growth in digital, which bodes well for the year ahead.
Fox Sports Australia, as I mentioned, should benefit from lower rates costs in the second quarter, which initiate improvement in EBITDA versus the prior year. For the full year, cost should be down modestly in local currency with no major right sales impacting this fiscal year.
For digital real estate, we expect continued revenue and EBITDA growth for the segment. While listing volumes in Australia for the second quarter remain lower than the prior year, we expect continued growth benefiting from favorable pricing and increased penetration. Realtor is expected to roll out Showcase 2.0 later this quarter, and the revenue lit as expected is to be more second half-weighted, reflecting the timing of contract renewals, and we expect to see strong improvement in EBITDA contribution from realtor this year.
And with that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A."

At Dow Jones, we are seeing some improvement in October, but beyond that, I don't have the confidence to give you forecast. Just more broadly, before we get into the granular details, what we're seeing at the moment is some ad market. Advertisers are having sites and see profit companies although their products bobbing around in water and that simply can't continue adding so at heart, we're very confident about our quality content, our quality audiences and the quality campaigns we have for advertisers. At News Australia, we saw advertising down about 11%, excluding FX in the quarter. News UK, advertising in total was down mid-teens. Print was down high teens; digital, up low teens; and at Dow Jones, advertising was down 21%. But we have experienced double-digit growth for digital at News UK and Australia. We're emphasizing the quality of our data and the quality of permission data that is in our audiences and we're building out more segmented products for advertisers so that we will be able to target those quality audiences in a meaningful way, and I think what we're talking about is a longer-term strategy but one that should have results in the short term."

There is definitely mayhem in the market some advertising is driven more by trend and by substance, and when you have that amount of volatility in the broader markets that you are going to have certain quarters a fair amount the volatility, and that was certainly the case at the Journal. Tech advertising was down to a certain degree, finance also. On the other hand in -- for the WSJ magazine, we had a record issue in September. So it's not as though advertisers have abandoned print as a sector and, print is a very powerful platform. It is -- if there is a lot of content out there. Frankly, a significant amount of that content is less notorious and more meretricious."

212741644,406689581,1078855,"News Corporation, Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Nov 07, 2016",2016-11-07,"Earnings Calls","News Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Mike. The most recent quarter has highlighted the continuing digital development at News Corp at a time of great transition for media companies, many of which are struggling to cope with evolution. Our growing portfolio of Digital Products and",2356,"Thank you, Mike. The most recent quarter has highlighted the continuing digital development at News Corp at a time of great transition for media companies, many of which are struggling to cope with evolution. Our growing portfolio of Digital Products and our global character have enabled us, not only to weather those profound changes, but to build a firm foundation for profitable future. There is no doubt that 2 of our core markets, the U.S. and U.K., have been characterized by a certain amount of uncertainty in the economic and political environment, but we have remained focused on developing long term and robust sources of revenue while curtailing costs without undermining the quality of our uniquely valuable content. Collaboration among our businesses has increased, with the sharing of lessons, software and data to provide more valuable insights for our clients, leaders and advertisers. 
During the first quarter of financial year 2017, despite a distinctly soft print advertising market and patent weakness in the British pound, our revenues were down only slightly. It is thus clear that our emphasis on digital real estate has given the company more resilience in even difficult trading periods. 
We are still at the early stages of that real estate development, particularly in the U.S., where we are renovating realtor.com while still living in the house. We expect the rate of growth at realtor.com will increase later in the year as new products and pricing take hold in a U.S. property market that is itself still recovering from the extreme dislocation of the financial crisis. 
In the most recent quarter, total segment EBITDA declined 21% versus the prior year, but half of that decrease was due to planned investments and onetime transaction costs, and we do not expect the quarterly performance to be reflective of the full year results. In fact, we expect to see EBITDA improvements in the remainder of the year, largely driven by growth in digital real estate and at HarperCollins. 
As our real estate business continues to evolve and expand, we are now highlighting listing-based revenues separately in the Digital Real Estate Services segment to better reflect our performance and provide a clearer indication of the trajectory in that increasingly important sector. 
Significantly, this highlights our reduced reliance on traditional advertising, which today accounts for only 1/3 of our total revenues.
In addition to the strength of digital real estate, we are also pleased with the trends in Book Publishing and at News America Marketing, which showed continuing growth in its in-store product revenue and is ahead of schedule in achieving its year-end goal of 10 million downloads of the Checkout 51 app, which provides incentives to shoppers and unique marketing opportunities for consumer goods producers and retailers. 
As mentioned, one of the more profound changes at News Corp since its reincarnation in 2013 is the burgeoning of the digital real estate business, building on our early success with REA in Australia and complementing that with investments in the U.S, East Asia and India. 
REA performed well again in the quarter despite some weakness in listing volume. Pricing improved, and services provided to agents were enhanced. 
Revenues expanded by 16% in local currency, including sales at the recently acquired iProperty. REA is a clear market leader in Australia and has proven the robustness of its business by expanding reach and revenue despite macroeconomic fluctuations in Australia. 
Move, which operates realtor.com, experienced 9% revenue growth in the first quarter as we revamped the site and retooled its products. With the rollout of Showcase 2.0 in December and deeper penetration from the recently launched seller leads and turbo products, we are confident revenue momentum will build in coming months.
We firmly believe realtor.com will make a meaningful contribution to segment revenue and EBITDA growth this year. We are investing for the long term but not at the expense of returns for investors. 
According to comScore, engagement with realtor.com leads the competition by a significant margin. Since our acquisition of Move 2 years ago this month, realtor.com's audience has grown more than 60%, and brand awareness of realtor.com is at 87%, which is up more than 25% in the last 18 months.
In Book Publishing, HarperCollins reported a 14% increase in EBITDA despite a 5% decline in revenue, which was largely the result of the impact of the comparison with last year's sales of Go Set a Watchman, the To Kill a Mockingbird prequel-sequel. The HarperCollins team is increasingly focused on books which resonate beyond the traditional release as is evident from the popularity of such titles as J. D. Vance's Hillbilly Elegy and Sarah Young's books, including the new Jesus Always, which builds on the success of the Jesus Calling series.
Also performing well are The Black Widow by Daniel Silva, The Magnolia Story by Joanna and Chip Gaines, and Commonwealth by Ann Patchett. While a consolidation of our international operations in tandem with the Harlequin acquisition has given us a significantly more powerful global platform. We are also able to use our trade assets to market crossover successes from the Harlequin stable of writers, which is increasing both sales and margins for select titles. 
In coming weeks, we will see the release of the highly anticipated Settle For More by Megyn Kelly. That title Settle For More will be our motto in coming quarters. We also have optimistic expectations for Veronica Roth's next book, Carve The Mark. Veronica wrote the extremely successful Divergent trilogy; and For Chaos by Patricia Cornwall. 
In news and information across our mastheads, we saw a more challenging print advertising marketplace as has already been articulated by other companies in the sector. While digital advertising increased, that growth was not enough to offset the decline in print. There is no doubt that the advertising market is in upheaval, and that the renewed advertiser focus on viewability and measurability should naturally benefit trusted brands with accurate metrics. Hype and hip are not alternatives to quality and integrity. 
In the middle of this commercial commotion, it's appropriate that ad agencies are under scrutiny as too much ad tech is fad tech. 
Advertising at The Wall Street Journal was down 21%, but our circulation revenue rose 6%, and the number of paid digital subscribers at The Wall Street Journal crossed the 1 million mark in September. The transition at the WSJ was highlighted by the fact that digital accounted for a record 55% of revenues this quarter. Obviously, some of that change is due to the decline in print advertising, but it also reflects the emphasis on broadening the digital subscriber base and the long-term strategy of upselling high-yielding specialist products to those subscribers. 
Historically, advertising accounted for about half the revenues at Dow Jones, but that ratio is now closer to 1/3. Clearly, there is a renewed emphasis on cost control, including a reduction in headcount at Dow Jones and a redesign of the journal itself. You'll be able to see the results of that redesign in coming weeks, and it will be obvious that print remains a very powerful platform and that the journal has an audience of unique influence and affluence.
At News Corp Australia, we continued to confront the cost base while broadening our range of digital offerings. We experienced strong digital paid subscriber growth in the first quarter and expanded the number of markets with a premium hybrid model, allowing limited free access along with a paid-for premium subscription. That model builds on the success we have seen at The Australian. 
Meanwhile, at news.com.au, Australia's leading news website, advertising revenue rose more than 30% in local currency compared to the same period last year. 
Sport is a vital part of our offering in Australia, which is why we announced the acquisition of the Punters Paradise website in October, offering use, analysis and comparative odds for horse racing and other sports. 
At the same time, we are keen to dispose of noncore assets to sharpen the focus of our operations. To that end, we sold our stake in New Zealand media and entertainment and hope to complete the sale of CarsGuide and the Sunday Times in Perth by the end of fiscal Q2. 
At News UK, The Times continues to gain market share and drive higher volume growth, experiencing 13% gain in print circulation in the first quarter in a sector it is too often defined by a decline. 
At The Sun, while advertising revenues have fallen, the digital audience has expanded dramatically since the paywall was lifted late last year. 
We are seeking to attract loyal readers with quality content and not digital drive-bys distracted by vacuous contentious clickbait. In September, there were almost 46 million monthly visitors to The Sun compared to 15 million uniques in September 2015 before the lifting of the paywall. 
News UK also benefited from cover price increases for its mastheads and from the launch of Sun Bets in August. 
With the acquisition of Wireless Group, the team at News UK is working on the integration of this valuable asset, leveraging talent across platforms, fashioning new ad packages to take advantage of multimedia opportunities, and cross promoting our brands, including Sun Bets, which should be a powerful generator of future revenue for the company. 
And speaking of successful popular titles, digital ad revenue for Q1 grew 42% year-over-year at the New York Post, where the broader digital postage network had a record 65.1 million unique visitors in September, an increase of 109% year-over-year based on internal metrics.
At News America Marketing, in-store price continued to post strong revenue growth driven by the creation of innovative avenues. Point-of-purchase persuasion is a powerful asset that we have in News America Marketing, which also has valuable direct links to advertisers who rely on its unique market intelligence. In the past, digital has been a rather modest part of News America Marketing's offering, but the acquisition of Checkout 51 has changed that outlook dramatically. We had targeted the acquisition of 10 million members this calendar year for Checkout 51 but could top the that total this month, if not this week. 
The larger the audience, the better quality the offerings, the stickier the experience. That virtuous is clearly in motion at Checkout 51, where we've had an influx of new deals from companies such as Procter & Gamble, Mondelez and General Mills. 
We have just launched a Spanish-language version of the app to appeal to the large and growing Latino audience in the U.S. while we are able to gather rich permission data from users that are of supreme value to advertisers wanting an insight into shopping habits. And we are looking forward to the integration of PayPal into new Checkout 51 expected by December, which will make it even easier for consumers to receive rebates for their purchases. 
Foxtel posted modest year-over-year growth in cable satellite subscribers, although there was higher churn partially related to promotional no-contract offers last fiscal year. 
Foxtel remains keenly focused on improving the quality of experience of subscribers and providing more product focus. Hence, the decision to unwind the Presto joint venture with Seven West. 
The executive team, led by Peter Tonagh, is determined to convey to potential subscribers the clear relative merits of Foxtel Play, whose offering is vastly superior to that of competitors. 
Foxtel Play's streaming service will roll out next month. We'll present consumers with greater choice and flexible passages -- packages as well as much easier access to Foxtel's premium content, including Fox Sports because viewer numbers have repeatedly set records in recent months. 
To ensure that subscribers have an unparalleled experience, Foxtel announced this quarter a new agreement with HBO that will give Foxtel even more extensive rights to HBO's larger content through 2021. 
Despite the focus on product enhancement and infrastructure investment, we are encouraged to see relatively stable EBITDA this quarter. 
As for Fox Sports, the record ratings were particularly pronounced for NRL while there were also strong performances by Aussie rules football and motor racing. NRL viewership was up 11% for all games, and those exclusive to Fox Sports were up 15%. 
For AFL, total viewership was up 8%, while the preliminary final between the Giants and the Western Bulldogs, the penultimate match of the year, was the #1 subscription TV program so far in calendar year 2016 in Australia. That increased viewership as well as expanding digital advertising were catalysts for advertising growth of low double digits in local currency in the first quarter, which compares rather favorably to the list -- levels elsewhere in the industry. 
Costs were higher in the first quarter, as was expected, reflecting the timing of sports expenses, about which Bedi will have further details. Thankfully, these quarterly costs are not reflective of the full year exposure.
Globally, we continued to integrate our Storyful and Unruly acquisitions into our existing brands. News UK now brings Storyful and Unruly into joint pitches with digital advertising. 
Storyful, which has the unique ability to divine meaningful moments in social media has become a part of the pitch for our Dow Jones risk and compliance business. The consumer has a problem with the product and uploads a video or a comment, Storyful's unique access to social platforms globally allows it to track the virality of the incident. It also remains the world's leading authenticator of social video for news agencies and broadcasters around the world. 
In conclusion, News Corp is not just a news company. We are a digital real estate company, and a global and information company. We are proud of our prominence but also leading the way in defining a digital future for media, whether it be through the strength of our mastheads, on mobile or the rapid growth of innovative news and commercial apps. That focus on long-term growth is complemented by a rigorous monitoring of costs in the here and now. 
We are extremely conscious of our responsibility to shareholders to create products that will prosper while ensuring that we are canny custodians of our traditional businesses in transition. 
Speaking of canny, I now pass you over to our CFO, Bedi Singh."

We reported fiscal 2017 first quarter total revenues of $1.97 billion, down 2% compared to the prior year. Currency had a $36 million unfavorable impact to revenues, with modest year-over-year improvement in the Australian dollar more than offset by continued weakness in the British pound. Total segment EBITDA was 130 million, including $5 million in transaction-related costs for the Wireless Group acquisition compared to $165 million in the prior year. For the quarter, EPS from continuing operations were negative $0.03 compared to positive $0.22 in the prior year. Adjusted EPS from continuing operations were negative $0.01 versus positive $0.05 in the prior year.
Before discussing segment performance, as Robert noted, listing-based revenues from our digital real estate businesses are now captured in a new real estate line on our income statement to better highlight that growth. Prior to this change, those revenues were reflected within advertising revenues. We have also adjusted prior year comparatives for this. This real estate revenue line represented 9% of total revenues this quarter and grew 19% compared to the prior year.
Turning to the individual operating segments. In News and Information Services, revenues for the quarter decreased 5% from the prior year to approximately $1.2 billion. And within segment revenues, advertising, which accounted for just under 50% of revenues, decreased around 11% or down 10% in local currencies, driven by weaker global print ad trends. 
Circulation and subscription revenues decreased 4%, but were up 1% in local currency, which is relatively stable with last quarter and the prior year, driven by higher paid digital volume and price increases. 
News and Information Services segment EBITDA this quarter was $46 million, down from $83 million in the prior period. This decrease was driven by lower print advertising revenues combined with $12 million in additional investment spending at Checkout 51, and the $5 million in Wireless Group transaction costs, partially offset by cost savings initiatives.
Looking at performance across our key units. At Dow Jones, domestic advertising declined 21% versus the prior year quarter, which is greater than last fiscal fourth quarter rate, reflecting a weaker print market, most notably in the finance and technology categories. 
On a positive note, Wall Street Journal circulation revenues grew over 6% this quarter due to higher subscription pricing and higher digital paid subscribers, with digital-only subs surpassing the 1 million mark during the quarter, as Robert noted.
At the professional information business, revenues were relatively stable. 
And as Robert mentioned, Dow Jones announced a series of initiatives focused on modernizing the newsroom and rationalizing print circulation and pagination while shifting resources to digital. 
As part of the plan, we are targeting approximately 8% or $100 million reduction of the cost structure on an annualized basis by the end of fiscal '18. The restructuring program will begin implementation in Q2 this year and is expected to continue into Q3, with an anticipated restructuring charge of between $50 million to $60 million pretax during fiscal 2017 and benefits starting to phase in over the remainder of the fiscal year.
We believe this timely response to the secular print advertising declines will leave the business well positioned to maximize the digital growth opportunity.
At News Australia, advertising revenues for the quarter declined 7%, or approximately 11% in local currency, relatively similar to the last fiscal fourth quarter.
Circulation revenues at News Australia increased modestly for both reported and on a local currency basis and as a result of cover price increases and higher paid digital subs, offsetting print volume declines.
While we continue to benefit from the cost-reduction program that News Australia announced in the second half of fiscal 2016, which totaled around 5% of the cost base, we are now embarking on further cost initiatives. We expect an additional AUD 40 million in cost savings this fiscal year while we continue to push digital initiatives more broadly.
At News UK, whilst reported advertising revenues decreased 28%, ad revenues were down mid-teens in local currency, primarily due to print declines.
Circulation revenues at News UK declined mid-teens versus the prior quarter, but were relatively flat in local currency as cover price increases of both The Sun and The Times were offset by single-copy volume declines.
News UK also benefited this quarter from previously announced cost savings initiatives as well as lower production cost and remains focused on identifying further cost reductions.
At News America Marketing, the business overall performed well, with revenues relatively flat versus the prior year, driven by mid-teens growth in domestic in-store revenues. 
Domestic FSI revenue was down mid-teens due to lower volume. And at Checkout 51, we achieved over 9 million members, adding approximately 3 million this quarter and well on pace to achieve 10 million by the end of this calendar year, which, as Robert mentioned, is a key initiative for accelerating the digital transition of News America Marketing.
Turning to the Book Publishing segment. Revenues decreased 5%, but segment EBITDA improved 14% versus the prior year, which included the release of Go Set a Watchman that had accounted for $32 million in revenues in the prior year quarter. 
EBITDA margins improved 12.3% from 10.3% in the prior year, driven by the mix of titles, and this quarter benefited from a strong new release slate, including Black Widow by Daniel Silva, Hillbilly Elegy by J.D. Vance and Sarah Young's Jesus Always. 
Total digital revenues were approximately 20% of consumer revenues similar to the prior year.
In Digital Real Estate Services, total segment revenues increased $35 million or 18% to $226 million. 
Segment EBITDA was $67 million, up from $57 million in the prior year. 
REA's revenues grew 22% or approximately 16% in local currency due to an increase in Australian residential depth revenue, benefiting from favorable product mix, combined with modest revenue contributions from iProperty. Results were partially offset by a softer listing volumes in Australia, declining approximately 8% versus the prior year. 
REA reported their fiscal first quarter earnings today and just concluded the conference call, which provided more quality detail.
Move revenues rose 9% to $93 million versus the prior year, reflecting continued strong performance from Co-Broke after more than doubling in Q1 fiscal '16 as well as growth in software services revenue, albeit at a slower rate.
The Move team is focused on the next-generation showcase product, which we expect to roll out later this quarter and further penetration of recently launched new products, including turbo and seller leads. We, therefore, expect revenue growth to accelerate in the second half of the year and are on track to deliver increasing positive contributions to segment EBITDA this fiscal year. 
Average monthly unique user growth at realtor.com remains strong, up 15% year-over-year to $53 million in the quarter.
In Cable Network Programming, revenues increased by 3% compared to the prior year quarter, primarily due to advertising growing mid-teens, benefiting from higher ratings across the board as well as higher contributions from digital advertising.
Segment EBITDA in the quarter was $14 million, which was $14 million lower than the prior year quarter due to, as expected, costs related to the simulcast of additional NRL matches from Channel 9 and the airing of the Sri Lanka-Australia cricket tour, partially offset by the absence of the EPL rights costs.
We do expect EBITDA to improve in Q2 due to the absence of costs from the English Premier League and Rugby World Cup, which we had in the prior year.
With respect to earnings from affiliates, Foxtel ended the quarter with approximately 2.9 million total subscribers, with closing cable and satellite subscribers increasing approximately 1% compared to the prior year period.
Last month, Foxtel announced that it had bought out Seven West media shares in the Presto joint venture, and the Presto service will be subsequently closed, and Foxtel will shift its IP efforts to Foxtel Play. 
Existing Presto customers will be invited to move to the new Foxtel Play, and Presto will cease operations on January 31, 2017. 
Foxtel recorded a $21 million loss as a result of the decision to cease Presto operations, and our equity income was $11 million lower, principally, as a result of this.
Foxtel revenues for the quarter increased 5% and were up 1% in local currency, and EBITDA increased 2% but was down 2% in local currency due to higher programming costs and marketing. 
Churn, as expected, remained above prior year at 15.5% as we cycled through some historical no-contract offers. Importantly, underlying year-on-year churn data, when adjusting for the impact of new customer offers, has been more stable. 
ARPU for the quarter was down approximately 3% or around AUD 88.  
Capital expenditures from continuing operations for the quarter were $49 million lower than $63 million in the prior year. 
And turning to the balance sheet, net cash at September 30 was $1.1 billion, including $377 million of debt related to iProperty. 
Cash on the balance sheet is down from fourth quarter 2016, principally reflecting the payout of the News America Marketing settlement of around $250 million. 
So in summary, while the quarter faced some obvious challenges, as we have noted, we expect to see improvements for the remainder of the year versus the prior year. 
A few points to highlight. Whilst print advertising trends remained very volatile and visibility continues to be limited, we have stepped up our cost savings initiatives, particularly at Dow Jones, and expect improved EBITDA performance in the current quarter and the balance of the year. We will also be including the contribution from Wireless Group within the News and Information Services segment from 1st of October.
Book Publishing should see favorable comparisons, and we look forward to the release of Settle for More by Megyn Kelly, Chaos by Patricia Cornwell and the Magnolia Story by Chip and Joanna Gaines as well as carryover sales from Jesus Always by Sarah Young, which debuted last quarter. 
We have a strong roster of titles this year and expect to see a return to growth in digital, which bodes well for the year ahead.
Fox Sports Australia, as I mentioned, should benefit from lower rights costs in the second quarter and should see an improvement in EBITDA versus the prior year. 
For the full year, costs should be down modestly in local currency, with no major rights renewals impacting this fiscal year.
For digital real estate, we expect continued revenue and EBITDA growth for the segment. 
While listings volumes in Australia for the second quarter remained lower than the prior year, we expect continued growth, benefiting from favorable pricing and increased penetration. 
Realtor is expected to roll out Showcase 2.0 later this quarter, and a revenue lift is expected is to be more second half weighted, reflecting the timing of contract renewals.  And we expect to see strong improvement in EBITDA contribution from realtor this year.
And with that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A."

As for the future itself, unfortunately, I don't have sibylline powers so it's difficult to divine. At Dow Jones, we are seeing some improvement in October, but beyond that, I don't have the confidence to give you a forecast. Just more broadly, before we get into the granular details, what we are seeing at the moment is some mayhem in the ad market. Advertisers are having ads placed on sites and seem almost to have contempt for profit companies. Or they have their products bobbing around in bilge water. And that ad apostasy just simply can't continue ad infinitum. So at heart, we're very confident about our quality content, our quality audiences and the quality canvass we have for advertisers. At News Australia, we saw advertising down about 11%, excluding FX in the quarter. News UK, advertising, in total was down mid-teens. Print was down high teens; digital, up low teens. And at Dow Jones, advertising was down 21%. But we have experienced double-digit growth for digital at News UK and Australia. We're emphasizing the quality of our data -- and the quality of permission data, that is, and our audiences. And we're building out more segmented products for advertisers so that we will be able to target those quality audiences in a meaningful way. And I think what we're talking about is a longer-term strategy, but one that should have results in the short term."

I mean, some advertising is driven more by trend and by substance. And when you have that amount of volatility in the broader market, that you are going to have, for certain mastheads in certain quarters, a fair amount the volatility. And that was certainly the case at the Journal. Tech advertising was down to a certain degree; finance also. On the other hand in -- for the WSJ magazine, we had a record issue in September. So it's not as though advertisers have abandoned print as a sector, and print is a very powerful platform, it is that there is a lot of content out there.

The most recent quarter has highlighted the continuing digital development at News Corp at a time of great transition for media companies, many of which are struggling to cope with e-evolution. Our growing portfolio of Digital Products an",2362,"Thank you, Mike. The most recent quarter has highlighted the continuing digital development at News Corp at a time of great transition for media companies, many of which are struggling to cope with e-evolution. Our growing portfolio of Digital Products and our global character have enabled us, not only to weather those profound changes, but to build a firm foundation for profitable future. There is no doubt that 2 of our core markets, the U.S. and U.K., have been characterized by a certain amount of uncertainty in the economic and political environment, but we have remained focused on developing long term and robust sources of revenue while curtailing costs without undermining the quality of our uniquely valuable content. Collaboration among our businesses has increased, with the sharing of lessons, software and data to provide more valuable insights for our clients, readers and advertisers. 
During the first quarter of financial year 2017, despite a distinctly soft print advertising market and patent weakness in the British pound, our revenues were down only slightly. It is thus clear that our emphasis on digital real estate has given the company more resilience in even difficult trading periods. 
We are still at the early stages of that real estate development, particularly in the U.S., where we are renovating realtor.com while still living in the house. We expect the rates of growth at realtor.com will increase later in the year as new products and pricing take hold in a U.S. property market that is itself still recovering from the extreme dislocation of the financial crisis. 
In the most recent quarter, total segment EBITDA declined 21% versus the prior year, but half of that decrease was due to planned investments and onetime transaction costs, and we do not expect the quarterly performance to be reflective of the full year results. In fact, we expect to see EBITDA improvements in the remainder of the year, largely driven by growth in digital real estate and at HarperCollins. 
As our real estate business continues to evolve and expand, we are now highlighting listing-based revenues separately in the Digital Real Estate Services segment to better reflect our performance and provide a clearer indication of the trajectory in that increasingly important sector. 
Significantly, this highlights our reduced reliance on traditional advertising, which today accounts for only 1/3 of our total revenues.
In addition to the strength of digital real estate, we are also pleased with the trends in Book Publishing and at News America Marketing, which showed continuing growth in its in-store product revenue and is ahead of schedule in achieving its year-end goal of 10 million downloads of the Checkout 51 app, which provides incentives to shoppers and unique marketing opportunities for consumer goods producers and retailers. 
As mentioned, one of the more profound changes at News Corp since its reincarnation in 2013 is the burgeoning of the digital real estate business, building on our early success with REA in Australia and complementing that with investments in the U.S, East Asia and India. 
REA performed well again in the quarter despite some weakness in listing volume. Pricing improved, and services provided to agents were enhanced. 
Revenues expanded by 16% in local currency, including sales at the recently acquired iProperty. REA is the clear market leader in Australia and has proven the robustness of its business by expanding reach and revenue despite macroeconomic fluctuations in Australia. 
Move, which operates realtor.com, experienced 9% revenue growth in the first quarter as we revamped the site and retooled its products. With the rollout of Showcase 2.0 in December and deeper penetration from the recently launched seller leads [ph] and turbo products, we are confident revenue momentum will build in coming months.
We firmly believe realtor.com will make a meaningful contribution to segment revenue and EBITDA growth this year. We are investing for the long term but not at the expense of returns for investors. 
According to comScore, engagement with realtor.com leads the competition by a significant margin. Since our acquisition of Move, 2 years ago this month, realtor.com's audience has grown more than 60%, and brand awareness of realtor.com is at 87%, which is up more than 25% in the last 18 months.
In Book Publishing, HarperCollins reported a 14% increase in EBITDA despite a 5% decline in revenue, which was largely the result of the impact of the comparison with last year's sales of Go Set a Watchman, the To Kill a Mockingbird prequel-sequel. The HarperCollins team is increasingly focused on books which resonate beyond the traditional elites as is evident from the popularity of such titles as J. D. Vance's Hillbilly Elegy and Sarah Young's books, including the new Jesus Always, which builds on the success of her Jesus Calling series.
Also performing well are The Black Widow by Daniel Silva, The Magnolia Story by Joanna and Chip Gaines, and Commonwealth by Ann Patchett. While a consolidation of our international operations in tandem with the Harlequin acquisition has given us a significantly more powerful global platform. We are also able to use our trade assets to market crossover successes from the Harlequin stable of writers, which is increasing both sales and margins for select titles. 
In coming weeks, we will see the release of the highly anticipated Settle For More by Megyn Kelly. That title Settle For More will be our motto in coming quarters. We also have optimistic expectations for Veronica Roth's next book, Carve The Mark. Veronica wrote the extremely successful Divergent trilogy; and For Chaos by Patricia Cornwall. 
In news and information across our mastheads, we saw a more challenging print advertising marketplace as has already been articulated by other companies in the sector. While digital advertising increased, that growth was not enough to offset the decline in print. There is no doubt that the advertising market is in upheaval, and that the renewed advertiser focus on view-ability and measurability should naturally benefit trusted brands with accurate metrics. Hype and hip are not alternatives to quality and integrity. 
In the middle of this commercial commotion, it's appropriate that ad agencies are under scrutiny as too much ad tech is fad tech. 
Advertising at The Wall Street Journal was down 21%, but our circulation revenue rose 6%, and the number of paid digital subscribers at The Wall Street Journal crossed the 1 million mark in September. The transition at the WSJ was highlighted by the fact that digital accounted for a record 55% of revenues this quarter. Obviously, some of that change is due to the decline in print advertising, but it also reflects the emphasis on broadening the digital subscriber base and the long-term strategy of up selling high-yielding specialist products to those subscribers. 
Historically, advertising accounted for about half the revenues at Dow Jones, but that ratio is now closer to 1/3. Clearly, there is a renewed emphasis on cost control, including a reduction in headcount at Dow Jones and a redesign of the journal itself. You'll be able to see the results of that redesign in coming weeks, and it will be obvious that print remains a very powerful platform and that the journal has an audience of unique influence and affluence.
At News Corp Australia, we continued to confront the cost base while broadening our range of digital offerings. We experienced strong digital paid subscriber growth in the first quarter and expanded the number of mastheads with a fremium hybrid model, allowing limited free access along with a paid-for premium subscription. That model builds on the success we have seen at The Australian. 
Meanwhile, at news.com.au, Australia's leading news website, advertising revenue rose more than 30% in local currency compared to the same period last year. 
Sport is a vital part of our offering in Australia, which is why we announced the acquisition of the Punters Paradise website in October, offering use, analysis and comparative odds for horse racing and other sports. 
At the same time, we are keen to dispose of noncore assets to sharpen the focus of our operations. To that end, we sold our stake in New Zealand media and entertainment and hope to complete the sale of CarsGuide and the Sunday Times in Perth by the end of fiscal Q2. 
At News UK, The Times continues to gain market share and drive higher volume growth, experiencing 13% gain in print circulation in the first quarter in a sector it is too often defined by decline. 
At The Sun, while advertising revenues have fallen, the digital audience has expanded dramatically since the pay wall was lifted late last year. 
We are seeking to attract loyal readers with quality content and not digital drive-bys distracted by vacuous contentious click-bait. In September, there were almost 46 million monthly visitors to The Sun compared to 15 million uniques in September 2015 before the lifting of the pay wall. 
News UK also benefited from cover price increases for its mastheads and from the launch of Sun Bets in August. 
With the acquisition of Wireless Group, the team at News UK is working on the integration of this valuable asset, leveraging talent across platforms, fashioning new ad packages to take advantage of multimedia opportunities, and cross promoting our brands, including Sun Bets, which should be a powerful generator of future revenue for the company. 
And speaking of successful popular titles, digital ad revenue for Q1 grew 42% year-over-year at the New York Post, where the broader digital -- post-digital network had a record 65.1 million unique visitors in September, an increase of 109% year-over-year based on internal metrics
At News America Marketing, in-store price continued to post strong revenue growth driven by the creation of innovative avenues. Point-of-purchase persuasion is a powerful asset that we have in News America Marketing, which also has valuable direct links to advertisers who rely on its unique market intelligence. In the past, digital has been a rather modest part of News America Marketing's offering, but the acquisition of Checkout 51 has changed that outlook dramatically. We had targeted the acquisition of 10 million members this calendar year for Checkout 51 but could top the that total this month, if not this week. 
The larger the audience, the better quality the offerings, the stickier the experience. That virtuous cycle is clearly in motion at Checkout 51, where we've had an influx of new deals from companies such as Procter & Gamble, Mondelez and General Mills. 
We have just launched a Spanish-language version of the app to appeal to the large and growing Latino audience in the U.S. while we are able to gather rich permission data from users that are of supreme value to advertisers wanting an insight into shopping habits. And we are looking forward to the integration of PayPal into new Checkout 51 expected by December, which will make it even easier for consumers to receive rebates for their purchases. 
Foxtel posted modest year-over-year growth in cable satellite subscribers, although there was higher churn partially related to promotional no-contract offers last fiscal year. 
Foxtel remains keenly focused on improving the quality of experience for subscribers and providing more product focus. Hence, the decision to unwind the Presto joint venture with Seven West. 
The executive team, led by Peter Tonagh, is determined to convey to potential subscribers the clear relative merits of Foxtel Play, whose offering is vastly superior to that of competitors. 
Foxtel Play's streaming service will roll out next month. We'll present consumers with greater choice and flexible passages -- packages as well as much easier access to Foxtel's premium content, including Fox Sports because viewer numbers have repeatedly set records in recent months. 
To ensure that subscribers have an unparalleled experience, Foxtel announced this quarter a new agreement with HBO that will give Foxtel even more extensive rights to HBO's library of content through 2021. 
Despite the focus on product enhancement and infrastructure investment, we are encouraged to see relatively stable EBITDA this quarter. 
As for Fox Sports, the record ratings were particularly pronounced for NRL while there were also strong performances by Aussie rules football and motor racing. NRL viewership was up 11% for all games, and those exclusive to Fox Sports were up 15%. 
For AFL, total viewership was up 8%, while the preliminary final between the Giants and the Western Bulldogs, the penultimate match of the year, was the #1 subscription TV program so far in calendar year 2016 in Australia. That increased viewership as well as expanding digital advertising were catalysts for advertising growth of low double digits in local currency in the first quarter, which compares rather favorably to the listless levels elsewhere in the industry. 
Costs were higher in the first quarter, as was expected, reflecting the timing of sports expenses, about which Bedi will have further details. Thankfully, these quarterly costs are not reflective of the full year exposure.
Globally, we continued to integrate our Storyful and Unruly acquisitions into our existing brands. News UK now brings Storyful and Unruly into joint pitches with digital advertising. 
Storyful, which has the unique ability to divine meaningful moments in social media has become a part of the pitch for our Dow Jones risk and compliance business. If the consumer has a problem with the product and uploads a video or a comment, Storyful's unique access to social platforms globally allows it to track the virality of the incident. It also remains the world's leading authenticator of social video for news agencies and broadcasters around the world. 
In conclusion, News Corp is not just a news company. We are a digital real estate company, and a global and information company. We are proud of our prominence but also leading the way in defining a digital future for media, whether it be through the strength of our mastheads, on mobile or the rapid growth of innovative news and commercial apps. That focus on long-term growth is complemented by a rigorous monitoring of costs in the here and now. 
We are extremely conscious of our responsibility to shareholders to create products that will prosper while ensuring that we are canny custodians of our traditional businesses in transition. 
Speaking of canny, I now pass you over to our CFO, Bedi Singh."

We reported fiscal 2017 first quarter total revenues of $1.97 billion, down 2% compared to the prior year. Currency had a $36 million unfavorable impact to revenues, with modest year-over-year improvement in the Australian dollar more than",1819,"Thanks, Robert. We reported fiscal 2017 first quarter total revenues of $1.97 billion, down 2% compared to the prior year. Currency had a $36 million unfavorable impact to revenues, with modest year-over-year improvement in the Australian dollar more than offset by continued weakness in the British pound. Total segment EBITDA was 130 million, including $5 million in transaction-related costs for the Wireless Group acquisition compared to $165 million in the prior year. For the quarter, EPS from continuing operations were negative $0.03 compared to positive $0.22 in the prior year. Adjusted EPS from continuing operations were negative $0.01 versus positive $0.05 in the prior year.
Before discussing segment performance, as Robert noted, listing-based revenues from our digital real estate businesses are now captured in a new real estate line on our income statement to better highlight that growth. Prior to this change, those revenues were reflected within advertising revenues. We have also adjusted prior year comparatives for this. This real estate revenue line represented 9% of total revenues this quarter and grew 19% compared to the prior year.
Turning to the individual operating segments. In News and Information Services, revenues for the quarter decreased 5% from the prior year to approximately $1.2 billion. And within segment revenues, advertising, which accounted for just under 50% of revenues, decreased around 11% or down 10% in local currencies, driven by weaker global print ad trends. 
Circulation and subscription revenues decreased 4%, but were up 1% in local currency, which is relatively stable with last quarter and the prior year, driven by higher paid digital volume and price increases. 
News and Information Services segment EBITDA this quarter was $46 million, down from $83 million in the prior period. This decrease was driven by lower print advertising revenues combined with $12 million in additional investment spending at Checkout 51, and the $5 million in Wireless Group transaction costs, partially offset by cost savings initiatives.
Looking at performance across our key units. At Dow Jones, domestic advertising declined 21% versus the prior year quarter, which is greater than last fiscal fourth quarter rate, reflecting a weaker print marketplace, most notably in the finance and technology categories. 
On a positive note, Wall Street Journal circulation revenues grew over 6% this quarter due to higher subscription pricing and higher digital paid subscribers, with digital-only subs surpassing the 1 million mark during the quarter, as Robert noted.
At the professional information business, revenues were relatively stable. 
And as Robert mentioned, Dow Jones announced a series of initiatives focused on modernizing the newsroom and rationalizing print circulation and pagination while shifting resources to digital. 
As part of the plan, we are targeting approximately 8% or $100 million reduction of the cost structure on an annualized basis by the end of fiscal '18. The restructuring program will begin implementation in Q2 this year and is expected to continue into Q3, with an anticipated restructuring charge of between $50 million to $60 million pretax during fiscal 2017 and benefits starting to phase in over the remainder of the fiscal year.
We believe this timely response to the secular print advertising declines will leave the business well positioned to maximize the digital growth opportunity.
At News Australia, advertising revenues for the quarter declined 7%, or approximately 11% in local currency, relatively similar to the last fiscal fourth quarter.
Circulation revenues at News Australia increased modestly for both reported and on a local currency basis and as a result of cover price increases and higher paid digital subs, offsetting print volume declines.
While we continue to benefit from the cost-reduction program that News Australia announced in the second half of fiscal 2016, which totaled around 5% of the cost base, we are now embarking on further cost initiatives. We expect an additional AUD 40 million in cost savings this fiscal year while we continue to push digital initiatives more broadly.
At News UK, whilst reported advertising revenues decreased 28%, ad revenues were down mid-teens in local currency, primarily due to print declines.
Circulation revenues at News UK declined mid-teens versus the prior quarter, but were relatively flat in local currency as cover price increases of both The Sun and The Times were offset by single-copy volume declines.
News UK also benefited this quarter from previously announced cost savings initiatives as well as lower production cost and remains focused on identifying further cost reductions.
At News America Marketing, the business overall performed well, with revenues relatively flat versus the prior year, driven by mid-teens growth in domestic in-store revenues. 
Domestic FSI revenue was down mid-teens due to lower volume. And at Checkout 51, we achieved over 9 million members, adding approximately 3 million this quarter and well on pace to achieve 10 million by the end of this calendar year, which, as Robert mentioned, is a key initiative for accelerating the digital transition of News America Marketing.
Turning to the Book Publishing segment. Revenues decreased 5%, but segment EBITDA improved 14% versus the prior year, which included the release of Go Set a Watchman that had accounted for $32 million in revenues in the prior year quarter. 
EBITDA margins improved 12.3% from 10.3% in the prior year, driven by the mix of titles, and this quarter benefited from a strong new release slate, including Black Widow by Daniel Silva, Hillbilly Elegy by J.D. Vance and Sarah Young's Jesus Always. 
Total digital revenues were approximately 20% of consumer revenues similar to the prior year.
In Digital Real Estate Services, total segment revenues increased $35 million or 18% to $226 million. 
Segment EBITDA was $67 million, up from $57 million in the prior year. 
REA's revenues grew 22% or approximately 16% in local currency due to an increase in Australian residential depth revenue, benefiting from favorable product mix, combined with modest revenue contributions from iProperty. Results were partially offset by softer listing volumes in Australia, declining approximately 8% versus the prior year. 
REA reported their fiscal first quarter earnings today and just concluded their conference call, which provided more quality detail.
Move revenues rose 9% to $93 million versus the prior year, reflecting continued strong performance from Co-Broke after more than doubling in Q1 fiscal '16 as well as growth in software services revenue, albeit at a slower rate.
The Move team is focused on the next-generation showcase product, which we expect to roll out later this quarter and further penetration of recently launched new products, including turbo and seller leads [ph] . We, therefore, expect revenue growth to accelerate in the second half of the year and are on track to deliver increasing positive contributions to segment EBITDA this fiscal year. 
Average monthly unique user growth at realtor.com remains strong, up 15% year-over-year to $53 million in the quarter.
In Cable Network Programming, revenues increased by 3% compared to the prior year quarter, primarily due to advertising growing mid-teens, benefiting from higher ratings across the board as well as higher contributions from digital advertising.
Segment EBITDA in the quarter was $14 million, which was $14 million lower than the prior year quarter due to, as expected, costs related to the simulcast of additional NRL matches from Channel 9 and the airing of the Sri Lanka-Australia cricket tour, partially offset by the absence of the EPL rights costs.
We do expect EBITDA to improve in Q2 due to the absence of costs from the English Premier League and Rugby World Cup, which we had in the prior year.
With respect to earnings from affiliates, Foxtel ended the quarter with approximately 2.9 million total subscribers, with closing cable and satellite subscribers increasing approximately 1% compared to the prior year period.
Last month, Foxtel announced that it had bought out Seven West media shares in the Presto joint venture, and the Presto service will be subsequently closed, and Foxtel will shift its IP efforts to Foxtel Play. 
Existing Presto customers will be invited to move to the new Foxtel Play, and Presto will cease operations on January 31, 2017. 
Foxtel recorded a $21 million loss as a result of the decision to cease Presto operations, and our equity income was $11 million lower, principally, as a result of this.
Foxtel revenues for the quarter increased 5% and were up 1% in local currency, and EBITDA increased 2% but was down 2% in local currency due to higher programming costs and marketing. 
Churn, as expected, remained above prior year at 15.5% as we cycled through some historical no-contract offers. Importantly, underlying year-on-year churn data, when adjusting for the impact of new customer offers, has been more stable. 
ARPU for the quarter was down approximately 3% or around AUD 88.  
Capital expenditures from continuing operations for the quarter were $49 million lower than $63 million in the prior year. 
And turning to the balance sheet, net cash at September 30 was $1.1 billion, including $377 million of debt related to iProperty. 
Cash on the balance sheet is down from fourth quarter 2016, principally reflecting the payout of the News America Marketing settlement of around $250 million. 
So in summary, while the quarter faced some obvious challenges, as we have noted, we expect to see improvements for the remainder of the year versus the prior year. 
A few points to highlight. Whilst print advertising trends remained very volatile and visibility continues to be limited, we have stepped up our cost savings initiatives, particularly at Dow Jones, and expect improved EBITDA performance in the current quarter and the balance of the year. We will also be including the contribution from Wireless Group within the News and Information Services segment from 1st of October.
Book Publishing should see favorable comparisons, and we look forward to the release of Settle for More by Megyn Kelly, Chaos by Patricia Cornwell and the Magnolia Story by Chip and Joanna Gaines as well as carryover sales from Jesus Always by Sarah Young, which debuted last quarter. 
We have a strong roster of titles this year and expect to see a return to growth in digital, which bodes well for the year ahead.
Fox Sports Australia, as I mentioned, should benefit from lower rights costs in the second quarter and should see an improvement in EBITDA versus the prior year. 
For the full year, costs should be down modestly in local currency, with no major rights renewals impacting this fiscal year.
For digital real estate, we expect continued revenue and EBITDA growth for the segment. 
While listings volumes in Australia for the second quarter remained lower than the prior year, we expect continued growth, benefiting from favorable pricing and increased penetration. 
Realtor is expected to roll out Showcase 2.0 later this quarter, and a revenue lift is expected is to be more second half weighted, reflecting the timing of contract renewals.  And we expect to see strong improvement in EBITDA contribution from realtor this year.
And with that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A."

As for the future itself, unfortunately, I don't have sibylline powers so it's difficult to divine. At Dow Jones, we are seeing some improvement in October, but beyond that, I don't have the confidence to give you a forecast. Just more broadly, before we get into the granular details, what we are seeing at the moment is some mayhem in the ad market. Advertisers are having ads placed on sites that seem almost to have contempt for, for profit companies. Or they have their products bobbing around in bilge water. And that ad apostasy simply can't continue ad infinitum. So at heart, we're very confident about our quality content, our quality audiences and the quality canvass we have for advertisers. At News Australia, we saw advertising down about 11%, excluding FX in the quarter. News UK, advertising, in total was down mid-teens. Print was down high teens; digital, up low teens. And at Dow Jones, advertising was down 21%. But we have experienced double-digit growth for digital at News UK and Australia. We're emphasizing the quality of our data -- and the quality of permission data, that is, and our audiences. And we're building out more segmented products for advertisers so that we will be able to target those quality audiences in a meaningful way. And I think what we're talking about is a longer-term strategy, but one that should have results in the short term."

I mean, some advertising is driven more by trend than by substance. And when you have that amount of volatility in the broader market, you are going to have, for certain mastheads in certain quarters, a fair amount the volatility. And that was certainly the case at the Journal. Tech advertising was down to a certain degree; finance also. On the other hand in -- for the WSJ magazine, we had a record issue in September. So it's not as though advertisers have abandoned print as a sector, and print is a very powerful platform, it is that there is a lot of content out there. Frankly, a significant amount of that content is less meritorious and more meretricious."

The most recent quarter has highlighted the continuing digital development at News Corp at a time of great transition for media companies, many of which are struggling to cope with e-evolution. Our growing portfolio of Digital Products and our global character have enabled us, not only to weather those profound changes, but to build a firm foundation for profitable future. There is no doubt that 2 of our core markets, the U.S. and U.K., have been characterized by a certain amount of uncertainty in the economic and political environment, but we have remained focused on developing long term and robust sources of revenue while curtailing costs without undermining the quality of our uniquely valuable content. Collaboration among our businesses has increased, with the sharing of lessons, software and data to provide more valuable insights for our clients, readers and advertisers. 
During the first quarter of financial year 2017, despite a distinctly soft print advertising market and patent weakness in the British pound, our revenues were down only slightly. It is thus clear that our emphasis on digital real estate has given the company more resilience in even difficult trading periods. 
We are still at the early stages of that real estate development, particularly in the U.S., where we are renovating realtor.com while still living in the house. We expect the rates of growth at realtor.com will increase later in the year as new products and pricing take hold in a U.S. property market that is itself still recovering from the extreme dislocation of the financial crisis. 
In the most recent quarter, total segment EBITDA declined 21% versus the prior year, but half of that decrease was due to planned investments and onetime transaction costs, and we do not expect the quarterly performance to be reflective of the full year results. In fact, we expect to see EBITDA improvements in the remainder of the year, largely driven by growth in digital real estate and at HarperCollins. 
As our real estate business continues to evolve and expand, we are now highlighting listing-based revenues separately in the Digital Real Estate Services segment to better reflect our performance and provide a clearer indication of the trajectory in that increasingly important sector. 
Significantly, this highlights our reduced reliance on traditional advertising, which today accounts for only 1/3 of our total revenues.
In addition to the strength of digital real estate, we are also pleased with the trends in Book Publishing and at News America Marketing, which showed continuing growth in its in-store product revenue and is ahead of schedule in achieving its year-end goal of 10 million downloads of the Checkout 51 app, which provides incentives to shoppers and unique marketing opportunities for consumer goods producers and retailers. 
As mentioned, one of the more profound changes at News Corp since its reincarnation in 2013 is the burgeoning of the digital real estate business, building on our early success with REA in Australia and complementing that with investments in the U.S, East Asia and India. 
REA performed well again in the quarter despite some weakness in listing volume. Pricing improved, and services provided to agents were enhanced. 
Revenues expanded by 16% in local currency, including sales at the recently acquired iProperty. REA is the clear market leader in Australia and has proven the robustness of its business by expanding reach and revenue despite macroeconomic fluctuations in Australia. 
Move, which operates realtor.com, experienced 9% revenue growth in the first quarter as we revamped the site and retooled its products. With the rollout of Showcase 2.0 in December and deeper penetration from the recently launched seller leads [ph] and turbo products, we are confident revenue momentum will build in coming months.
We firmly believe realtor.com will make a meaningful contribution to segment revenue and EBITDA growth this year. We are investing for the long term but not at the expense of returns for investors. 
According to comScore, engagement with realtor.com leads the competition by a significant margin. Since our acquisition of Move, 2 years ago this month, realtor.com's audience has grown more than 60%, and brand awareness of realtor.com is at 87%, which is up more than 25% in the last 18 months.
In Book Publishing, HarperCollins reported a 14% increase in EBITDA despite a 5% decline in revenue, which was largely the result of the impact of the comparison with last year's sales of Go Set a Watchman, the To Kill a Mockingbird prequel-sequel. The HarperCollins team is increasingly focused on books which resonate beyond the traditional elites as is evident from the popularity of such titles as J. D. Vance's Hillbilly Elegy and Sarah Young's books, including the new Jesus Always, which builds on the success of her Jesus Calling series.
Also performing well are The Black Widow by Daniel Silva, The Magnolia Story by Joanna and Chip Gaines, and Commonwealth by Ann Patchett. While a consolidation of our international operations in tandem with the Harlequin acquisition has given us a significantly more powerful global platform. We are also able to use our trade assets to market crossover successes from the Harlequin stable of writers, which is increasing both sales and margins for select titles. 
In coming weeks, we will see the release of the highly anticipated Settle For More by Megyn Kelly. That title Settle For More will be our motto in coming quarters. We also have optimistic expectations for Veronica Roth's next book, Carve The Mark. Veronica wrote the extremely successful Divergent trilogy; and For Chaos by Patricia Cornwall. 
In news and information across our mastheads, we saw a more challenging print advertising marketplace as has already been articulated by other companies in the sector. While digital advertising increased, that growth was not enough to offset the decline in print. There is no doubt that the advertising market is in upheaval, and that the renewed advertiser focus on view-ability and measurability should naturally benefit trusted brands with accurate metrics. Hype and hip are not alternatives to quality and integrity. 
In the middle of this commercial commotion, it's appropriate that ad agencies are under scrutiny as too much ad tech is fad tech. 
Advertising at The Wall Street Journal was down 21%, but our circulation revenue rose 6%, and the number of paid digital subscribers at The Wall Street Journal crossed the 1 million mark in September. The transition at the WSJ was highlighted by the fact that digital accounted for a record 55% of revenues this quarter. Obviously, some of that change is due to the decline in print advertising, but it also reflects the emphasis on broadening the digital subscriber base and the long-term strategy of up selling high-yielding specialist products to those subscribers. 
Historically, advertising accounted for about half the revenues at Dow Jones, but that ratio is now closer to 1/3. Clearly, there is a renewed emphasis on cost control, including a reduction in headcount at Dow Jones and a redesign of the journal itself. You'll be able to see the results of that redesign in coming weeks, and it will be obvious that print remains a very powerful platform and that the journal has an audience of unique influence and affluence.
At News Corp Australia, we continued to confront the cost base while broadening our range of digital offerings. We experienced strong digital paid subscriber growth in the first quarter and expanded the number of mastheads with a fremium hybrid model, allowing limited free access along with a paid-for premium subscription. That model builds on the success we have seen at The Australian. 
Meanwhile, at news.com.au, Australia's leading news website, advertising revenue rose more than 30% in local currency compared to the same period last year. 
Sport is a vital part of our offering in Australia, which is why we announced the acquisition of the Punters Paradise website in October, offering use, analysis and comparative odds for horse racing and other sports. 
At the same time, we are keen to dispose of noncore assets to sharpen the focus of our operations. To that end, we sold our stake in New Zealand media and entertainment and hope to complete the sale of CarsGuide and the Sunday Times in Perth by the end of fiscal Q2. 
At News UK, The Times continues to gain market share and drive higher volume growth, experiencing 13% gain in print circulation in the first quarter in a sector it is too often defined by decline. 
At The Sun, while advertising revenues have fallen, the digital audience has expanded dramatically since the pay wall was lifted late last year. 
We are seeking to attract loyal readers with quality content and not digital drive-bys distracted by vacuous contentious click-bait. In September, there were almost 46 million monthly visitors to The Sun compared to 15 million uniques in September 2015 before the lifting of the pay wall. 
News UK also benefited from cover price increases for its mastheads and from the launch of Sun Bets in August. 
With the acquisition of Wireless Group, the team at News UK is working on the integration of this valuable asset, leveraging talent across platforms, fashioning new ad packages to take advantage of multimedia opportunities, and cross promoting our brands, including Sun Bets, which should be a powerful generator of future revenue for the company. 
And speaking of successful popular titles, digital ad revenue for Q1 grew 42% year-over-year at the New York Post, where the broader digital -- post-digital network had a record 65.1 million unique visitors in September, an increase of 109% year-over-year based on internal metrics
At News America Marketing, in-store price continued to post strong revenue growth driven by the creation of innovative avenues. Point-of-purchase persuasion is a powerful asset that we have in News America Marketing, which also has valuable direct links to advertisers who rely on its unique market intelligence. In the past, digital has been a rather modest part of News America Marketing's offering, but the acquisition of Checkout 51 has changed that outlook dramatically. We had targeted the acquisition of 10 million members this calendar year for Checkout 51 but could top that total this month, if not this week. 
The larger the audience, the better quality the offerings, the stickier the experience. That virtuous cycle is clearly in motion at Checkout 51, where we've had an influx of new deals from companies such as Procter & Gamble, Mondelez and General Mills. 
We have just launched a Spanish-language version of the app to appeal to the large and growing Latino audience in the U.S. while we are able to gather rich permission data from users that are of supreme value to advertisers wanting an insight into shopping habits. And we are looking forward to the integration of PayPal into new Checkout 51 expected by December, which will make it even easier for consumers to receive rebates for their purchases. 
Foxtel posted modest year-over-year growth in cable satellite subscribers, although there was higher churn partially related to promotional no-contract offers last fiscal year. 
Foxtel remains keenly focused on improving the quality of experience for subscribers and providing more product focus. Hence, the decision to unwind the Presto joint venture with Seven West. 
The executive team, led by Peter Tonagh, is determined to convey to potential subscribers the clear relative merits of Foxtel Play, whose offering is vastly superior to that of competitors. 
Foxtel Play's streaming service will roll out next month. We'll present consumers with greater choice and flexible passages -- packages as well as much easier access to Foxtel's premium content, including Fox Sports because viewer numbers have repeatedly set records in recent months. 
To ensure that subscribers have an unparalleled experience, Foxtel announced this quarter a new agreement with HBO that will give Foxtel even more extensive rights to HBO's library of content through 2021. 
Despite the focus on product enhancement and infrastructure investment, we are encouraged to see relatively stable EBITDA this quarter. 
As for Fox Sports, the record ratings were particularly pronounced for NRL while there were also strong performances by Aussie rules football and motor racing. NRL viewership was up 11% for all games, and those exclusive to Fox Sports were up 15%. 
For AFL, total viewership was up 8%, while the preliminary final between the Giants and the Western Bulldogs, the penultimate match of the year, was the #1 subscription TV program so far in calendar year 2016 in Australia. That increased viewership as well as expanding digital advertising were catalysts for advertising growth of low double digits in local currency in the first quarter, which compares rather favorably to the listless levels elsewhere in the industry. 
Costs were higher in the first quarter, as was expected, reflecting the timing of sports expenses, about which Bedi will have further details. Thankfully, these quarterly costs are not reflective of the full year exposure.
Globally, we continued to integrate our Storyful and Unruly acquisitions into our existing brands. News UK now brings Storyful and Unruly into joint pitches with digital advertising. 
Storyful, which has the unique ability to divine meaningful moments in social media has become a part of the pitch for our Dow Jones risk and compliance business. If the consumer has a problem with the product and uploads a video or a comment, Storyful's unique access to social platforms globally allows it to track the virality of the incident. It also remains the world's leading authenticator of social video for news agencies and broadcasters around the world. 
In conclusion, News Corp is not just a news company. We are a digital real estate company, and a global and information company. We are proud of our prominence but also leading the way in defining a digital future for media, whether it be through the strength of our mastheads, on mobile or the rapid growth of innovative news and commercial apps. That focus on long-term growth is complemented by a rigorous monitoring of costs in the here and now. 
We are extremely conscious of our responsibility to shareholders to create products that will prosper while ensuring that we are canny custodians of our traditional businesses in transition. 
Speaking of canny, I now pass you over to our CFO, Bedi Singh."
212741644,406689581,1080666,"News Corporation, Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Nov 07, 2016",2016-11-07,"Earnings Calls","News Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Robert. We reported fiscal 2017 first quarter total revenues of $1.97 billion, down 2% compared to the prior year. Currency had a $36 million unfavorable impact to revenues, with modest year-over-year improvement in the Australian dollar more than",1819,"Thanks, Robert. We reported fiscal 2017 first quarter total revenues of $1.97 billion, down 2% compared to the prior year. Currency had a $36 million unfavorable impact to revenues, with modest year-over-year improvement in the Australian dollar more than offset by continued weakness in the British pound. Total segment EBITDA was 130 million, including $5 million in transaction-related costs for the Wireless Group acquisition compared to $165 million in the prior year. For the quarter, EPS from continuing operations were negative $0.03 compared to positive $0.22 in the prior year. Adjusted EPS from continuing operations were negative $0.01 versus positive $0.05 in the prior year.
Before discussing segment performance, as Robert noted, listing-based revenues from our digital real estate businesses are now captured in a new real estate line on our income statement to better highlight that growth. Prior to this change, those revenues were reflected within advertising revenues. We have also adjusted prior year comparatives for this. This real estate revenue line represented 9% of total revenues this quarter and grew 19% compared to the prior year.
Turning to the individual operating segments. In News and Information Services, revenues for the quarter decreased 5% from the prior year to approximately $1.2 billion. And within segment revenues, advertising, which accounted for just under 50% of revenues, decreased around 11% or down 10% in local currencies, driven by weaker global print ad trends. 
Circulation and subscription revenues decreased 4%, but were up 1% in local currency, which is relatively stable with last quarter and the prior year, driven by higher paid digital volume and price increases. 
News and Information Services segment EBITDA this quarter was $46 million, down from $83 million in the prior period. This decrease was driven by lower print advertising revenues combined with $12 million in additional investment spending at Checkout 51, and the $5 million in Wireless Group transaction costs, partially offset by cost savings initiatives.
Looking at performance across our key units. At Dow Jones, domestic advertising declined 21% versus the prior year quarter, which is greater than last fiscal fourth quarter rate, reflecting a weaker print marketplace, most notably in the finance and technology categories. 
On a positive note, Wall Street Journal circulation revenues grew over 6% this quarter due to higher subscription pricing and higher digital paid subscribers, with digital-only subs surpassing the 1 million mark during the quarter, as Robert noted.
At the professional information business, revenues were relatively stable. 
And as Robert mentioned, Dow Jones announced a series of initiatives focused on modernizing the newsroom and rationalizing print circulation and pagination while shifting resources to digital. 
As part of the plan, we are targeting approximately 8% or $100 million reduction of the cost structure on an annualized basis by the end of fiscal '18. The restructuring program will begin implementation in Q2 this year and is expected to continue into Q3, with an anticipated restructuring charge of between $50 million to $60 million pretax during fiscal 2017 and benefits starting to phase in over the remainder of the fiscal year.
We believe this timely response to the secular print advertising declines will leave the business well positioned to maximize the digital growth opportunity.
At News Australia, advertising revenues for the quarter declined 7%, or approximately 11% in local currency, relatively similar to the last fiscal fourth quarter.
Circulation revenues at News Australia increased modestly for both reported and on a local currency basis and as a result of cover price increases and higher paid digital subs, offsetting print volume declines.
While we continue to benefit from the cost-reduction program that News Australia announced in the second half of fiscal 2016, which totaled around 5% of the cost base, we are now embarking on further cost initiatives. We expect an additional AUD 40 million in cost savings this fiscal year while we continue to push digital initiatives more broadly.
At News UK, whilst reported advertising revenues decreased 28%, ad revenues were down mid-teens in local currency, primarily due to print declines.
Circulation revenues at News UK declined mid-teens versus the prior quarter, but were relatively flat in local currency as cover price increases of both The Sun and The Times were offset by single-copy volume declines.
News UK also benefited this quarter from previously announced cost savings initiatives as well as lower production cost and remains focused on identifying further cost reductions.
At News America Marketing, the business overall performed well, with revenues relatively flat versus the prior year, driven by mid-teens growth in domestic in-store revenues. 
Domestic FSI revenue was down mid-teens due to lower volume. And at Checkout 51, we achieved over 9 million members, adding approximately 3 million this quarter and well on pace to achieve 10 million by the end of this calendar year, which, as Robert mentioned, is a key initiative for accelerating the digital transition of News America Marketing.
Turning to the Book Publishing segment. Revenues decreased 5%, but segment EBITDA improved 14% versus the prior year, which included the release of Go Set a Watchman that had accounted for $32 million in revenues in the prior year quarter. 
EBITDA margins improved 12.3% from 10.3% in the prior year, driven by the mix of titles, and this quarter benefited from a strong new release slate, including Black Widow by Daniel Silva, Hillbilly Elegy by J.D. Vance and Sarah Young's Jesus Always. 
Total digital revenues were approximately 20% of consumer revenues similar to the prior year.
In Digital Real Estate Services, total segment revenues increased $35 million or 18% to $226 million. 
Segment EBITDA was $67 million, up from $57 million in the prior year. 
REA's revenues grew 22% or approximately 16% in local currency due to an increase in Australian residential depth revenue, benefiting from favorable product mix, combined with modest revenue contributions from iProperty. Results were partially offset by softer listing volumes in Australia, declining approximately 8% versus the prior year. 
REA reported their fiscal first quarter earnings today and just concluded their conference call, which provided more quality detail.
Move revenues rose 9% to $93 million versus the prior year, reflecting continued strong performance from Co-Broke after more than doubling in Q1 fiscal '16 as well as growth in software services revenue, albeit at a slower rate.
The Move team is focused on the next-generation showcase product, which we expect to roll out later this quarter and further penetration of recently launched new products, including turbo and seller leads [ph] . We, therefore, expect revenue growth to accelerate in the second half of the year and are on track to deliver increasing positive contributions to segment EBITDA this fiscal year. 
Average monthly unique user growth at realtor.com remains strong, up 15% year-over-year to $53 million in the quarter.
In Cable Network Programming, revenues increased by 3% compared to the prior year quarter, primarily due to advertising growing mid-teens, benefiting from higher ratings across the board as well as higher contributions from digital advertising.
Segment EBITDA in the quarter was $14 million, which was $14 million lower than the prior year quarter due to, as expected, costs related to the simulcast of additional NRL matches from Channel 9 and the airing of the Sri Lanka-Australia cricket tour, partially offset by the absence of the EPL rights costs.
We do expect EBITDA to improve in Q2 due to the absence of costs from the English Premier League and Rugby World Cup, which we had in the prior year.
With respect to earnings from affiliates, Foxtel ended the quarter with approximately 2.9 million total subscribers, with closing cable and satellite subscribers increasing approximately 1% compared to the prior year period.
Last month, Foxtel announced that it had bought out Seven West media shares in the Presto joint venture, and the Presto service will be subsequently closed, and Foxtel will shift its IP efforts to Foxtel Play. 
Existing Presto customers will be invited to move to the new Foxtel Play, and Presto will cease operations on January 31, 2017. 
Foxtel recorded a $21 million loss as a result of the decision to cease Presto operations, and our equity income was $11 million lower, principally, as a result of this.
Foxtel revenues for the quarter increased 5% and were up 1% in local currency, and EBITDA increased 2% but was down 2% in local currency due to higher programming costs and marketing. 
Churn, as expected, remained above prior year at 15.5% as we cycled through some historical no-contract offers. Importantly, underlying year-on-year churn data, when adjusting for the impact of new customer offers, has been more stable. 
ARPU for the quarter was down approximately 3% or around AUD 88.  
Capital expenditures from continuing operations for the quarter were $49 million lower than $63 million in the prior year. 
And turning to the balance sheet, net cash at September 30 was $1.1 billion, including $377 million of debt related to iProperty. 
Cash on the balance sheet is down from fourth quarter 2016, principally reflecting the payout of the News America Marketing settlement of around $250 million. 
So in summary, while the quarter faced some obvious challenges, as we have noted, we expect to see improvements for the remainder of the year versus the prior year. 
A few points to highlight. Whilst print advertising trends remained very volatile and visibility continues to be limited, we have stepped up our cost savings initiatives, particularly at Dow Jones, and expect improved EBITDA performance in the current quarter and the balance of the year. We will also be including the contribution from Wireless Group within the News and Information Services segment from 1st of October.
Book Publishing should see favorable comparisons, and we look forward to the release of Settle for More by Megyn Kelly, Chaos by Patricia Cornwell and the Magnolia Story by Chip and Joanna Gaines as well as carryover sales from Jesus Always by Sarah Young, which debuted last quarter. 
We have a strong roster of titles this year and expect to see a return to growth in digital, which bodes well for the year ahead.
Fox Sports Australia, as I mentioned, should benefit from lower rights costs in the second quarter and should see an improvement in EBITDA versus the prior year. 
For the full year, costs should be down modestly in local currency, with no major rights renewals impacting this fiscal year.
For digital real estate, we expect continued revenue and EBITDA growth for the segment. 
While listings volumes in Australia for the second quarter remained lower than the prior year, we expect continued growth, benefiting from favorable pricing and increased penetration. 
Realtor is expected to roll out Showcase 2.0 later this quarter, and a revenue lift is expected is to be more second half weighted, reflecting the timing of contract renewals.  And we expect to see strong improvement in EBITDA contribution from realtor this year.
And with that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A."

As for the future itself, unfortunately, I don't have sibylline powers so it's difficult to divine. At Dow Jones, we are seeing some improvement in October, but beyond that, I don't have the confidence to give you a forecast. Just more broadly, before we get into the granular details, what we are seeing at the moment is some mayhem in the ad market. Advertisers are having ads placed on sites that seem almost to have contempt for, for profit companies. Or they have their products bobbing around in bilge water. And that ad apostasy simply can't continue ad infinitum. So at heart, we're very confident about our quality content, our quality audiences and the quality canvass we have for advertisers. At News Australia, we saw advertising down about 11%, excluding FX in the quarter. News UK, advertising, in total was down mid-teens. Print was down high teens; digital, up low teens. And at Dow Jones, advertising was down 21%. But we have experienced double-digit growth for digital at News UK and Australia. We're emphasizing the quality of our data -- and the quality of permission data, that is, and our audiences. And we're building out more segmented products for advertisers so that we will be able to target those quality audiences in a meaningful way. And I think what we're talking about is a longer-term strategy, but one that should have results in the short term."

I mean, some advertising is driven more by trend than by substance. And when you have that amount of volatility in the broader market, you are going to have, for certain mastheads in certain quarters, a fair amount the volatility. And that was certainly the case at the Journal. Tech advertising was down to a certain degree; finance also. On the other hand in -- for the WSJ magazine, we had a record issue in September. So it's not as though advertisers have abandoned print as a sector, and print is a very powerful platform, it is that there is a lot of content out there. Frankly, a significant amount of that content is less meritorious and more meretricious."

As I mentioned, it's mainly driven by the fact that we had a payment to make for settling the News America Marketing litigation, which was $250 million. We'd accrued for that last year, and now, we paid it out this quarter. We also had slightly higher working capital this quarter. Some of it was due to the acquisitions around iProperty. And obviously, we had lower EBITDA. So all of those factors contributed to that. You shouldn't take the first quarter as being indicative for the rest of the year. We're very focused on generating healthy positive free cash flow, and I would say, mainly, it's all timing things this quarter. So without giving a specific number, though, I think we are striving to make sure that we are very healthy for the remainder of the year."

They will have broad impact in society and a positive impact on our accounts. And we think FOXNews, as we get into the spring selling season in Australia for sports, given the record audiences of last year and the buzz around both Rugby League in Aussie Rules next year that, that will be efficacious also."
