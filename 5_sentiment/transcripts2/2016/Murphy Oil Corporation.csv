Consolidated results in the fourth quarter of 2015 were a loss of $587 million, that's $3.41 per diluted share, and that compares to a profit of $375 million or $2.11 per diluted share a year ago. Excludin",666,"Thank you, Kelly, and good afternoon to everyone. Consolidated results in the fourth quarter of 2015 were a loss of $587 million, that's $3.41 per diluted share, and that compares to a profit of $375 million or $2.11 per diluted share a year ago. Excluding discontinued operations, continuing operations had a loss of $583 million in the fourth quarter of '15, $3.39 per diluted share, and that compares to the fourth quarter '14 of $442 million profit, $2.48, per diluted share a year ago. The fourth quarter results for 2015 from continuing operations included noncash property impairments of $192.2 million, which after taxes amounted to $123.5 million charge. These impairments were attributable to a decline in future periods oil prices and primarily were related to an oil and gas property in the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico. The just completed quarter also included an after-tax expense of $183.3 million to reflect the cost to exit 2 Deepwater drilling rig contracts in the Gulf of Mexico. We chose to stack these rigs as low oil prices led to significant reductions in our capital expenditure program in the Gulf of Mexico, and the company was no longer able to obtain partner support for U.S. Deepwater drilling as these partners are experiencing significant capital constraints. 
Murphy also recorded a U.S. income tax charge of $188.5 million in the fourth quarter due to U.S. taxable income generated foreign dividend declared in December. The company had previously recorded U.S. income tax benefits earlier in 2015 associated with an anticipated U.S. operating loss carryforward prior to our decision to make this foreign distribution to the parent. The foreign distribution was made through a combination of $800 million in cash and the remainder in the form of a 10-year note. This distribution effectively was cash tax neutral in 2015 due to operating losses and availability of foreign tax credits. This U.S. tax charge was recorded in the company's corporate reporting area, which led to a higher corporate net cost overall in the 2015 quarter compared to the prior year. 
Let me speak about adjusted earnings. These adjusted earnings adjust our GAAP numbers for various items that affect comparability of earnings between periods. And this adjusted earnings was a loss of $130.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, down from a profit of $69 million a year ago. This decline in adjusted earnings was primarily attributable to lower oil and natural gas sales prices in the current period. Our schedule of adjusted earnings is included as part of our earnings release and the amounts in this schedule are reported on an after-tax basis. 
The company's average realized price for its crude oil production fell more than $28 per barrel in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year which amounted to a 40% drop between periods. Natural gas prices also were weaker in the fourth quarter compared to the prior-year quarter. 
Realized oil index natural gas process offshore Sarawak fell 31% to an average of $3.81 per Mcf following the decline in global crude oil prices. Sales prices continue to be soft in January and, therefore, revenues continue to be under pressure as quarter 1 2016 prices remain significantly below prices a year ago. As a reminder, however, the company has oil price hedges for 20,000 barrels per day at a WTI price of $52.01 for the remainder of 2016.
At December 31, 2015, Murphy's long-term debt amounted to slightly more than $3 billion, which represented 36.4% of total capital employed, while net debt amounted to 32.8%. As of year end, we had $600 million borrowed under our $2 billion revolver. Plus we had a total of cash and invested cash for about $450 million worldwide. Murphy sold debt covenant is a total debt to total capital ratio of 60%, which obviously were well below. I believe we have adequate liquidity to weather the lower for longer oil price environment currently being experienced. 
That concludes my comments, and I'll pass it now to Roger."

Good afternoon, everybody, and thanks for listening to our call today. Our company remains focused on balance sheet metrics as the entire industry experiences further commodity price drops. But this focus comes in extensive drop in capita",2104,"Thank you, John. Good afternoon, everybody, and thanks for listening to our call today. Our company remains focused on balance sheet metrics as the entire industry experiences further commodity price drops. But this focus comes in extensive drop in capital spending; however, Murphy intends to be in the business for the long haul and is evidenced with news of our 2 purchase and sales agreements we released yesterday when closed will allow Murphy to sell the natural gas midstream business and use a portion of the proceeds to purchase a long-term asset that deliver value to shareholders say, especially in a price recovery. 
Looking back at operations over the course of the year, the following highlights stand out. We spent $2.2 billion in capital, which is 42% down from the prior year, while still growing production with the prior year when factoring in the 30% fell down in Malaysia. 
On the coal side, we made significant improvements in reducing both operating and G&A expenses. We lowered our operating costs excluding Syncrude by $1.82 per BOE to $9.21 per BOE or 17% over the course of 2015 and lowered our G&A expenses by over $57 million or 16% compared to 2014 levels. 
In our onshore business, the Eagle Ford Shale continues to outperform expectations, where we averaged just over 57,000 barrel equivalents per day for the year, delivering a frontloaded schedule of 136 new wells, of which 27 were in the fourth quarter. We drilled our first thousand well in Orange County, achieving a very successful IP 30 flow rate of 1,500 barrels equivalent per day. We're planning on doing our second [indiscernible] well in the first quarter of 2016. 
In Canada, our recently completed wells in the Montney continue to produce above plan where we averaged 194 million cubic feet per day for the year. 
In the Gulf of Mexico, the Dalmatian South 2 well which was drilled in the third quarter achieved first production ahead of plan late in 2015, the world's currently facility. 
Development work continues at the nonoperated Kodiak project where the first 2 wells will flow in the coming days. 
In Malaysia, fourth quarter Sarawak natural gas production is over 134 million per day net and oil production was over 14,000 barrels a day. Full year production for Malaysia was over 65,200-barrel equivalents per day. 
We are seeing continued drilling success at our South axis drill in Sarawak where we announced the Sergeant volumes double. In addition, we drilled the Keratau well offshore Brunei, finding commercial natural gas that were in line with pre drill estimates adding to our resources in the field. 
On the fourth quarter, production was just over 200,700 barrel equivalents per day and a full-year for the year, we produced close to 208,000 barrel equivalents per day.
We are pleased with the ongoing efforts we're making on cost reductions. Our LOE for quarter 4 2015, excluding Syncrude, is 8 25 per BOE, showing a reduction of 19% from the fourth quarter of '14. This is in line with the 17% reduction for full-year 2014 on LOE. 
In Eagle Ford Shale, our fourth quarter operating expenses just under 8 50 per BOE, and we expect this to be a reasonable runway going forward. 
In 2015, we produced over 207 barrel of oil equivalent per day, our strong production variance over the course of the year is attributable to Sarawak oil and natural gas fields is performing better. The Eagle Ford Shale, new well volumes exceeding plan due to EUR increases and completion performance and how our natural gas production from the Montney. 
More importantly, we spent $2.19 billion as compared to our original CapEx plan of $2.3 billion. Even with the significant reduction in capital for 2015, we grew annual production by 3%. 
In 2015, based on preliminary data, we expect to add reserves at a replacement rate of 123% for the funding and development costs of $18.70 per BOE. Year end 2015 reserve volumes represented Reserve Life Index of 10.2 years, an increase from 9.2 years from a year ago. This is consistent with our five-year average reserve replacement rate greater than 180% and is our 10th consecutive year over 100%. During the same time frame, we have more than doubled our production, including the sell down of our Malaysia assets. 
The capital program for 2016 is currently $825 million, which is approximately 62% lower than $2.19 billion we invested in 2015. We expect production for full-year to be 180,000 to 185,000 barrel equivalents per day, which is lower than 2015 due to significant CapEx cuts. As common in our industry, the capital program still remains in review for further reductions as commodity prices persist.
Moving on to the subsequent year events, as you've heard in our news release last night, we signed 2 purchase and sale agreements announcing the monetization of our midstream Montney and the joint venture of the Kaybob Duvernay and liquids rich Montney on the area. We signed a definitive agreement with Enbridge to divest our natural gas processing sales pipeline assets that support our Montney natural gas field in topper and upper West. The cash consideration is expected to be CAD 538 million and expected to be closed early in the second quarter. 
In a separate but related transaction, we signed a definitive agreement for a joint venture with Athabasca Oil Corporation to acquire 70% operated working interest in Athabasca's acreage infrastructure and facilities in the Kaybob Duvernay lands and a 30% nonoperated working interest in the liquids rich Montney. The total consideration is CAD 475 million, of which CAD 250 million is in cash at closing and the remaining CAD 225 million is a carry for a period up to 5 years. 
In the Kaybob Duvernay, there were 230,000 gross acres, 200,000 currently perspective that are currently producing 6,900-barrel equivalent gross per day of production, of which 58% is liquids. This area also includes 247,000 gross acres with over rights in the conventional Montney. 
In the liquids rich Montney area, there are 60,000 gross acres, 21,000 currently perspective that are currently producing 900-barrel equivalent a day gross at 44% liquids. 
Very excited to enter to the Kaybob Duvernay and liquid rich Montney that complements our current onshore North America and resources, fits well with our in-house expertise and will be our third significant North American unconventional position. The CAD 225 million carry in Long Beach term associated with the Kaybob Duvernay is flexible over 5 years, which is key in this period of low commodity prices where we are able to control the pace of spend. We're allocating partial proceeds from our Montney midstream monetization into this project sufficient use of capital that has a positive impact to cash on hand for our balance sheet this year as well as use of Canadian funds in Canada in a tax efficient manner and enter a project that's expected to be self funding within Canada over the life of the period. 
The primary markable product hearing is realized will be produced condensate, which is used for oil Sands vitamin production and transport. The Western Canadian oil Sands project along been demonstrated record of production resiliency that will continue to generate demand well in the excess of regional supply results in the relative price stability for the foreseeable future. Our joint venture has oil battery capacity of 30,000 barrels today of oil and gas pipeline with over 100 million [indiscernible] per day of capacity.
The Kaybob Duvernay is an emerging play and has 3 same segments seen in the Eagle Ford Shale, natural gas, gas condensate and light oil. The gas condensate area is including several prolific wells of late in the light oil area that we now have a significant position in is in the early stages of development. We are seeing all signs of the shale place success with increasing EURs, improving completion techniques as well as lowering the drilling and completion costs. We feel that with 3 to 4 wells per section, we will have over 500 gross locations in the play and this number will greatly increase should downspacing opportunities exist here as seen in other successful North American plays. 
We are seeing many successful wells across the play now approaching 30 test centers [indiscernible] over 2,000-barrel equivalent per day with yields ranging from 200 to 950 barrel per million and a clear indicator of the oil-rich nature of this basin. 
The Duvernay areas have been heavily drilled for other types of plays through the years in the basin which leads to thousands of penetrations and knowledge of the shale characteristics. Additionally, we have a black hole area in the play, again matching success seen in the Eagle Ford Shale area.
Our new joint venture partner, Athabasca, has been successful in the play with the results the condensate region and most importantly, in the light oil area of the play. Athabasca's recently released information about our key oil and the gas condensate light oil area that's flowed 1,300-barrel equivalents per day with 62% liquids. This appears to be a very good well by any measure. 
As in any shale play, the optimization of the fracture treatments are key to the learning curve in the light higher prop and concentrations have used in the region. This slide highlights the increase in EUR seen that data up to 2 years in duration illustrating recent higher treatments consistent EUR levels. Some wells are announcing above the 1,000 -- 1 million, rather, barrel type curve. This will shown here in the condensate window are now partnered in the 33,000 acres with a 70% working interest. We've seen the same well performance with higher stimulation treatments in the Duvernay light oil area as well as where we are working a 7% working interest with our partner in 67,000 acres. We believe there's significant upside in the black hole area where our partnership has 110,000 gross acres. Current data showing high prop content at the 607 -- 670,000-barrel equivalent EUR level. 
Our joint venture also includes our liquids rich Montney, which is among the top active plays in Canada. We participate here in the nonop 30% working interest. The region has a minimum of 30% of the flow stream containing liquids, similar to the condensate in light oil areas. The results in the liquid rich area are also shown increasingly EURs completion enhancements and the lowering of cost with 750,000-barrel equivalent EURs seen in the data set. This area has significant running room in the range of 100 to 200 locations with downspacing. We see a tightening leased up area around our newer acreage with many no North American shale players. Rates here are also prolific in the range of 800 barrel equivalents with high liquid yields.
Like all major shale plays in North America, the key economic drivers is lowering the drilling and completion cost while simultaneously improving the completion techniques for each area. We are seeing the early stages of a major improvement in cost per region and our expertise in 2 other plays where we are top quartile drilling and completion company will enhance our ability to quickly move up the learning curve here. Our partner Athabasca is active in the cost reduction business, and we will be able to quickly adapt to the area where they have recently seen incredible improvements as we see great upside in lowering cost from the current CAD 9.4 million per well don to CAD 6.5 million per well. Athabasca has recently seen wells being drilled for as low as CAD 3.25 million, which is an outstanding performance. 
As I close our call today, if you a few takeaways we are focusing on our balance sheet at Murphy. The purchase and sale agreements to monetize our natural gas midstream and use a portion of proceeds whether new onshore oil conventionally shale play that allows for balance sheet neutrality with a 5-year carrying liquidity this year for our cash positions. We see this venture as an investment to the long term with total spend flexibility over a five-year period as we anticipate a price recovery. Cost reductions will continue to be our focus. Our Eagle Ford Shale continues to perform very well for us. The budget reductions will lead to a very limited exploration spend this year. We continue to illustrate the execution advantages we have in the offshore. We had an excellent year operationally in our company with the reserve additions, significant capital reductions and lowering costs leading the way. 
I would now like to open the phone lines up for your questions, and thank you."

It's very rare to get into M&A in North America and have flexibility in the first year of capital spend and have no continuous drilling causes, be able to drag out the carryover a very long period of time and a very low oil price. I've said for a long time that I would like a 10% cost of capital type return at a strip price. And with the drilling costs we are seeing here, we are able to do that here, even on strip that we used on January 19, which is probably $4 behind where we are today. So I see this as transformative as far as Roger, honestly, because it has a 200 million, 300 million barrel ability for us. It's pretty low cost entry. It's different from buying a company that's flipping acres because we have a partner that's working there and has drilled there, has infrastructure there, and we're able to work with them and take over as the operator. They're able to operate a piece where they've been very successful. It's in Canada. We'll have Canadian proceeds. There's a low 4x right now for this transaction. Where the U.S. the equivalent of that would not get you at least to get you here in the United States. And all of those factors led to this decision."

The condensate well, oil window well up in Canada competes very well with Lower Eagle Ford Shale and Karnes. That's what's so interesting around, about this deal and about the shale plays is that 4 years ago, the Catarina area, where we have an enormous acreage position in Western Eager ford shale was one our lowest rate of return areas in the company in -- in the Eagle Ford, I mean. So over this time, the EURs have doubled, the drilling costs and went from the bottom the best. So it's the best individual well, economics around 25% on that January 19 strip date where we normalize all our costs. And this project up there is competing there. But the point is, these things change. Some areas become better than others. Prices not so good last time, it's better this time.

Consolidated results in the fourth quarter of 2015 were a loss of $587 million, that's $3.41 per diluted share, and that compares to a profit of $375 million or $2.11 per diluted share a year ago. Excludin",667,"Thank you, Kelly, and good afternoon to everyone. Consolidated results in the fourth quarter of 2015 were a loss of $587 million, that's $3.41 per diluted share, and that compares to a profit of $375 million or $2.11 per diluted share a year ago. Excluding discontinued operations, continuing operations had a loss of $583 million in the fourth quarter of '15, $3.39 per diluted share, and that compares to the fourth quarter '14 of $442 million profit, $2.48 per diluted share a year ago. 
The fourth quarter results for 2015 from continuing operations included noncash property impairments of $192.2 million, which after taxes amounted to $123.5 million charge. These impairments were attributable to a decline in future periods oil prices and primarily were related to an oil and gas property in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. The just completed quarter also included an after-tax expense of $183.3 million to reflect the cost to exit 2 deepwater drilling rig contracts in the Gulf of Mexico. We chose to stack these rigs as low oil prices led to significant reductions in our capital expenditure program in the Gulf of Mexico, and the company was no longer able to obtain partner support for U.S. deepwater drilling as these partners are experiencing significant capital constraints. 
Murphy also recorded a U.S. income tax charge of $188.5 million in the fourth quarter due to U.S. taxable income generated foreign dividend declared in December. The company had previously recorded U.S. income tax benefits earlier in 2015 associated with an anticipated U.S. operating loss carryforward prior to our decision to make this foreign distribution to the parent. The foreign distribution was made through a combination of $800 million in cash and the remainder in the form of a 10-year note. This distribution effectively was cash tax neutral in 2015 due to operating losses and availability of foreign tax credits. This U.S. tax charge was recorded in the company's corporate reporting area, which led to a higher corporate net cost overall in the 2015 quarter compared to the prior year. 
Let me speak about adjusted earnings. These adjusted earnings adjust our GAAP numbers for various items that affect comparability of earnings between periods. And this adjusted earnings was a loss of $130.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, down from a profit of $69 million a year ago. This decline in adjusted earnings was primarily attributable to lower oil and natural gas sales prices in the current period. Our schedule of adjusted earnings is included as part of our earnings release and the amounts in this schedule are reported on an after-tax basis. 
The company's average realized price for its crude oil production fell more than $28 per barrel in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year which amounted to a 40% drop between periods. Natural gas prices also were weaker in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year quarter. 
Realized oil index natural gas process offshore Sarawak fell 31% to an average of $3.81 per Mcf, following the decline in global crude oil prices. Sales prices continue to be soft in January and, therefore, revenues continue to be under pressure as quarter 1 2016 prices remain significantly below prices a year ago. As a reminder, however, the company has oil price hedges for 20,000 barrels per day at a WTI price of $52.01 for the remainder of 2016.
At December 31, 2015, Murphy's long-term debt amounted to slightly more than $3 billion, which represented 36.4% of total capital employed, while net debt amounted to 32.8%. As of year end, we had $600 million borrowed under our $2 billion revolver. Plus we had a total of cash and invested cash for about $450 million worldwide. Murphy sold debt covenant is a total debt to total capital ratio of 60%, which obviously were well below. I believe we have adequate liquidity to weather the lower for longer oil price environment currently being experienced. 
That concludes my comments, and I'll pass it now to Roger."

Our company remains focused on balance sheet metrics as the entire industry experiences further commodity price drops. But this focus comes in extensive drop in capital spending; however, Murphy intends to be in the business for the long haul and is evidenced with news of our 2 purchase and sales agreements we released yesterday when closed will allow Murphy to sell a natural gas midstream business and use a portion of the proceeds to purchase a long-term asset that deliver value to shareholders, especially in a price recovery. 
Looking back at operations over the course of the year, the following highlights stand out. We spent $2.2 billion in capital, which is 42% down from the prior year, while still growing production with the prior year when factoring in the 30% sell-down in Malaysia. 
On the coal side, we made significant improvements in reducing both operating and G&A expenses. We lowered our operating costs, excluding Syncrude, by $1.82 per BOE to $9.21 per BOE or 17% over the course of 2015 and lowered our G&A expenses by over $57 million or 16% compared to 2014 levels. 
In our onshore business, the Eagle Ford Shale continues to outperform expectations, where we averaged just over 57,000 barrel equivalents per day for the year, delivering a front-loaded schedule of 136 new wells, of which 27 were in the fourth quarter. We drilled our first Austin Chalk well in  Karnes County, achieving a very successful IP 30 flow rate of 1,500 barrels equivalent per day. We're planning on drilling our second Austin Chalk well in the first quarter of 2016. 
In Canada, we recently completed -- our recently completed wells in the Montney continue to produce above plan where we averaged 194 million cubic feet per day for the year. 
In the Gulf of Mexico, the Dalmatian South 2 well which was drilled in the third quarter achieved first production ahead of plan late in 2015. The well is currently flowing back to Petronius facility. Development work continues at the non-operated Kodiak project where the first 2 wells will flow in the coming days. 
In Malaysia, fourth quarter Sarawak natural gas production is over 134 million per day net and oil production was over 14,000 barrels a day. Full year production for Malaysia was over 65,200-barrel equivalents per day. 
We are seeing continued drilling success at our South Acis field in Sarawak, where we announced the sanctioned volumes doubling. In addition, we drilled the Keratau well offshore Brunei, finding commercial natural gas that were in line with pre-drill estimates adding to our resources in the Kelidang field. 
On the fourth quarter, production was just over 200,700 barrel equivalents per day and our full year for the year, we produced close to 208,000 barrel equivalents per day.
We are pleased with the ongoing efforts we're making on cost reductions. Our LOE for quarter 4 2015, excluding Syncrude, is $8.25 per BOE, showing a reduction of 19% from the fourth quarter of '14. This is in line with the 17% reduction for full year 2014 on LOE. 
In Eagle Ford Shale, our fourth quarter operating expenses are just under $8.50 per BOE, and we expect this to be a reasonable run rate going forward. 
In 2015, we produced over 207 barrel oil equivalent per day, our strong production variance over the course of the year is attributable to Sarawak oil and natural gas fields is performing better. The Eagle Ford Shale, new well volumes exceeding plan due to EUR increases and completion performance and how our natural gas production from the Montney. 
More importantly, we spent $2.19 billion as compared to our original CapEx plan of $2.3 billion. Even with the significant reduction in capital for 2015, we grew annual production by 3%. 
In 2015, based on preliminary data, we expect to add reserves at a replacement rate of 123% for the finding and development costs of $18.70 per BOE. Year end 2015 reserve volumes represented Reserve Life Index of 10.2 years, an increase from 9.2 years from a year ago. This is consistent with our 5-year average reserve replacement rate greater than 180% and is our 10th consecutive year over 100%. During the same time frame, we have more than doubled our production, including a sell-down of our Malaysia assets. 
The capital program for 2016 is currently $825 million, which is approximately 62% lower than $2.19 billion we invested in 2015. We expect production for full year to be 180,000 to 185,000 barrel equivalents per day, which is lower than 2015 due to significant CapEx cuts. As common in our industry, the capital program still remains under review for further reductions, should the commodity prices persist.
Moving on to the subsequent year-end events, as you have read in our news release from last night, we signed 2 purchase and sale agreements announcing the monetization of our midstream Montney and the joint venture in the Kaybob Duvernay and liquids-rich Montney area. We signed a definitive agreement with Enbridge to divest our natural gas processing sales pipeline assets that support our Montney natural gas field in Tupper and Tupper West. The cash consideration is expected to be CAD 538 million and expected to be closed early in the second quarter. 
In a separate but related transaction, we signed a definitive agreement for a joint venture with Athabasca Oil Corp. to acquire 70% operated working interest in Athabasca's acreage infrastructure and facilities in the Kaybob Duvernay lands and a 30% non-operated working interest in the liquids-rich Montney. The total consideration is CAD 475 million, of which CAD 250 million is in cash at closing and the remaining CAD 225 million is a carry for a period up to 5 years. 
In the Kaybob Duvernay, there were 230,000 gross acres, 200,000 currently perspective that are currently producing 6,900-barrel equivalent gross per day of production, of which 58% is liquids. This area also includes 247,000 gross acres with overlying rights in the conventional Montney. 
In the liquids-rich Montney area, there are 60,000 gross acres, 21,000 currently viewed as perspective that are currently producing 900-barrel equivalent a day gross at 44% liquids. 
We're very excited to enter to the Kaybob Duvernay and liquid-rich Montney as it complements our current onshore North American resources, fits well with our in-house expertise and will be our third significant North American unconventional position. The CAD 225 million carry in long lease term associated with the Kaybob Duvernay is flexible over 5 years, which is key in this period of low commodity prices where we're able to control the pace of spend. We're allocating partial proceeds from our Montney midstream monetization into this project. And I see as efficient use of capital that has a positive impact to cash on hand for our balance sheet this year as well as use of Canadian funds in Canada in a tax efficient manner and enter a project that's expected to be self funding within Canada over the life of the period. 
The primary marketable product here as realized will be produced condensate, which is used as diluent for oil sands bitumen production and transport. The Western Canadian oil sands project have long demonstrated a record of production resiliency that will continue to generate demand well in the excess of regional supply, resulting in relative price stability for foreseeable future. Our joint venture has oil battery capacity of 30,000 barrels per day of oil and gas pipeline with over 100 million scf per day of capacity.
The Kaybob Duvernay is an emerging play and has 3 same segments seen in the Eagle Ford Shale, natural gas, gas condensate and light oil. The gas condensate area has included several prolific wells of late in the light oil area that we now have a significant position in is in the early stages of development. We are seeing all signs of a shale play success with increasing EURs, improving completion techniques, as well as lowering of drilling and completion costs. We feel that with 3 to 4 wells per section, we will have over 500 gross locations in the play and this number can greatly increase should downspacing opportunities exist here as seen in other successful North American plays. 
We are seeing many successful wells across the play now approaching 30 test intervals of over 2,000-barrel equivalent per day with yields ranging from 200 to 950 barrel per million and a clear indicator of the oil-rich nature of this basin. 
The Duvernay areas have been heavily drilled for other types of plays through the years in the basin which leads to thousands of penetrations and knowledge of the shale characteristics. Additionally, we have a black hole area in the play, again matching success seen in the Eagle Ford Shale area.
Our new joint venture partner, Athabasca, has been successful in the play with the results the condensate region and most importantly, in the light oil area of the play. Athabasca's recently released information about a key well in the gas condensate light oil area that's flowed 1,300-barrel equivalents per day with 62% liquids. This appears to be a very good well by any measure. 
As in any shale play, the optimization of the fracture treatments are key to the learning curve. Of late, higher proppant concentrations have been used in the region. This slide highlights the increase in EUR seen with data up to 2 years in duration, illustrating recent higher treatments lead to consistent EUR levels. Some wells announcing above the 1,000 -- 1 million, rather, barrel type curve. This well shown here in the condensate window are now partnered in the 33,000 acres with a 70% working interest. We're seeing the same -- we see the same well performance with higher stimulation treatments in the Duvernay light oil area as well as where we are working a 70% working interest with our partner in 67,000 acres. We believe there's significant upside in the black hole area where our partnership has 110,000 gross acres. Current data showing high proppant content at the 607 -- 670,000-barrel equivalent EUR level. 
Our joint venture also includes our liquids-rich Montney, which is among the top active plays in Canada. We participate here in the non-op 30% working interest. The region has a minimum of 30% of the flow stream containing liquids, similar to the condensate in light oil areas. The results in the liquid-rich area are also showing increasing EURs due to completion enhancements and the lowering of cost with 750,000-barrel equivalent EURs seen in the data set. This area has significant running room in the range of 100 to 200 locations with downspacing. We see a tightly leased up area around our new acreage with many non-North American shale players. Rates here are also prolific in the range of 800 barrel equivalents with high-liquid yields.
Like all major shale plays in North America, the key economic drivers is lowering the drilling and completion cost while simultaneously improving the completion techniques for each area. We are seeing the early stages of a major improvement in cost for the region and our expertise in 2 other plays where we are top quartile drilling and completion company will enhance our ability to quickly move up the learning curve here. Our partner Athabasca is active in the cost reduction business, and we will be able to quickly adapt to the area where they have recently seen incredible improvements as we see great upside in lowering cost from the current CAD 9.4 million per well down to CAD 6.5 million per well. Athabasca has recently seen wells being drilled for as low as CAD 3.25 million, which is an outstanding performance. 
As I close our call today, here are a few takeaways: We're focusing on our balance sheet at Murphy. The purchase and sale agreements to monetize our natural gas midstream and use a portion of proceeds to enter in the onshore conventional shale play that allows for balance sheet neutrality with a 5-year carry and further liquidity this year for our cash positions. We see this venture as an investment for the long term with total spend flexibility over a 5-year period as we anticipate a price recovery. Cost reductions will continue to be our focus. Our Eagle Ford Shale continues to perform very well for us. The budget reductions will lead to a very limited exploration spend this year. We continue to illustrate the execution advantages we have in the offshore. We had an excellent year operationally in our company with the reserve additions, significant capital reductions and lowering costs leading the way. 
I would now like to open the phone lines up for your questions, and thank you."

It's very rare to get into M&A in North America and have flexibility on the first year of capital spend and have no continuous drilling clauses, be able to drag out the carryover a very long period of time and a very low oil price. I've said for a long time that I would like a 10% cost of capital-type return at a strip price. And with the drilling costs we're seeing here, we're able to do that here, even on strip that we used on January 19, which was probably $4 behind where we are today. So I see this as transformative as far as Roger, honestly, because it has a 200 million, 300 million barrel ability for us. It's pretty low-cost entry. It's different from buying a -- from a company that's flipping acres because we have a partner that's working there and has drilled there and has infrastructure there, and we're able to work with them and take over as the operator. They're able to operate a piece where they've been very successful. It's in Canada. We'll have Canadian proceeds. There's a low 4x right now for this transaction. Where the USD equivalent of that would not get you what used to get you here in the United States. And all of those factors led to this decision."

It will always be slightly ahead of wells up there. But then you have this balance sheet issue of U.S. cost and repatriation and tax efficiency and working in the MOCAL [ph] area. But if we remove it around pretty good, they compete very well. A condensate well and an oil window well up in Canada competes very well with lower Eagle Ford Shale and Karnes. That's what's so interesting, Ryan, about this deal and about the shale plays is that 4 years ago, the Catarina area, where we have an enormous acreage position in Western Eagle Ford Shale was one of our lowest rate of return areas in the company in -- in the Eagle Ford, I mean. So over this time, the EURs have doubled, the drilling costs have halved and it went from the bottom to the best. So it's a best individual well, economics around 25% on that January 19 strip date where we normalized all our costs. And this project up there is competing there. But the point is, these things change. Some areas become better than others. Price is not so good last time or better this time. The cost in this northern light oil area are very, very good, getting much better and we put those costs in here. This project is going to compete with the Eagle Ford very well for us.

And this acreage is quite derisked and the gas condensate area is a successful wells all around it, and we'll use a no downspacing there and use no downspacing anywhere to arrive that number, Ed. And we then took a -- over in the Western part of this thing called light oil on Page 12, some very successful wells. And we took a higher EUR curve there, you can see some of the EUR results in the back here as to the concentration of proppant, Ed. And moving to the east, we took a more conservative one. These wells have a rate of return in the 14%, 15% range, $30 oil type strip. I think in the black oil area, it's a matter of there would be some experimentation there to figure out how to make that work. That's the issue now with capital allocation. But the advantage here is that a lot of long life leases like leasing in the Gulf of Mexico, if you will, it's a government ground lease and no continuous drilling clauses, a lot of flexibility, a lot of information to come to us, there's constantly wells being released for information in this region. And we're going to be monitoring that and real excited about just a portion of it working is incredibly valuable to us, Ed."

Consolidated results in the fourth quarter of 2015 were a loss of $587 million, that's $3.41 per diluted share, and that compares to a profit of $375 million or $2.11 per diluted share a year ago. Excludin",669,"Thank you, Kelly, and good afternoon to everyone. Consolidated results in the fourth quarter of 2015 were a loss of $587 million, that's $3.41 per diluted share, and that compares to a profit of $375 million or $2.11 per diluted share a year ago. Excluding discontinued operations, continuing operations had a loss of $583 million in the fourth quarter of '15, $3.39 per diluted share, and that compares to the fourth quarter '14 of $442 million profit, $2.48 per diluted share a year ago. 
The fourth quarter results for 2015 from continuing operations included noncash property impairments of $192.2 million, which after taxes amounted to $123.5 million charge. These impairments were attributable to a decline in future periods oil prices and primarily were related to an oil and gas property in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. The just completed quarter also included an after-tax expense of $183.3 million to reflect the cost to exit 2 deepwater drilling rig contracts in the Gulf of Mexico. We chose to stack these rigs as low oil prices led to significant reductions in our capital expenditure program in the Gulf of Mexico, and the company was no longer able to obtain partner support for U.S. deepwater drilling as these partners are experiencing significant capital constraints. 
Murphy also recorded a U.S. income tax charge of $188.5 million in the fourth quarter due to U.S. taxable income generated by a foreign dividend declared in December. The company had previously recorded U.S. income tax benefits earlier in 2015 associated with an anticipated U.S. operating loss carryforward prior to our decision to make this foreign distribution to the parent. The foreign distribution was made through a combination of $800 million in cash and the remainder in the form of a 10-year note. This distribution effectively was cash tax neutral in 2015 due to operating losses and availability of foreign tax credits. This U.S. tax charge was recorded in the company's corporate reporting area, which led to a higher corporate net cost overall in the 2015 quarter compared to the prior year. 
Let me speak about adjusted earnings. These adjusted earnings adjust our GAAP numbers for various items that affect comparability of earnings between periods. And this adjusted earnings was a loss of $130.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, down from a profit of $69 million a year ago. This decline in adjusted earnings was primarily attributable to lower oil and natural gas sales prices in the current period. Our schedule of adjusted earnings is included as part of our earnings release and the amounts in this schedule are reported on an after-tax basis. 
The company's average realized price for its crude oil production fell more than $28 per barrel in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year which amounted to a 40% drop between periods. Natural gas prices also were weaker in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year quarter. 
Realized oil index natural gas prices offshore Sarawak fell 31% to an average of $3.81 per Mcf, following the decline in global crude oil prices. Sales prices continue to be soft in January and, therefore, revenues continue to be under pressure as quarter 1 2016 prices remain significantly below prices a year ago. As a reminder, however, the company has oil price hedges for 20,000 barrels per day at a WTI price of $52.01 for the remainder of 2016.
At December 31, 2015, Murphy's long-term debt amounted to slightly more than $3 billion, which represented 36.4% of total capital employed, while net debt amounted to 32.8%. As of year end, we had $600 million borrowed under our $2 billion revolver. Plus we had a total of cash and invested cash of about $450 million worldwide. Murphy's sole debt covenant is a total debt to total capital ratio of 60%, which obviously we're well below. I believe we have adequate liquidity to weather the lower for longer oil price environment currently being experienced. 
That concludes my comments, and I'll pass it now to Roger."

Our company remains focused on balance sheet metrics as the entire industry experiences further commodity price drops. With this focus comes an extensive drop in capital spending; however, Murphy intends to be in the business for the long haul and as evidenced with news of our 2 purchase and sales agreements we released yesterday when closed will allow Murphy to sell a natural gas midstream business and use a portion of the proceeds to purchase a long-term asset that will deliver value to shareholders, especially in a price recovery. 
Looking back at operations over the course of the year, the following highlights stand out. We spent $2.2 billion in capital, which is 42% down from the prior year, while still growing production with the prior year when factoring in the 30% sell-down in Malaysia. 
On the coal side, we made significant improvements in reducing both operating and G&A expenses. We lowered our operating costs, excluding Syncrude, by $1.82 per BOE to $9.21 per BOE or 17% over the course of 2015 and lowered our G&A expenses by over $57 million or 16% compared to 2014 levels. 
In our onshore business, the Eagle Ford Shale continues to outperform expectations, where we averaged just over 57,000 barrel equivalents per day for the year, delivering a front-loaded schedule of 136 new wells, of which 27 were in the fourth quarter. We drilled our first Austin Chalk well in  Karnes County, achieving a very successful IP 30 flow rate of 1,500 barrels equivalent per day. We're planning on drilling our second Austin Chalk well in the first quarter of 2016. 
In Canada, we recently completed -- our recently completed wells in the Montney continue to produce above plan where we averaged 194 million cubic feet per day for the year. 
In the Gulf of Mexico, the Dalmatian South 2 well which was drilled in the third quarter achieved first production ahead of plan late in 2015. The well is currently flowing back to the Petronius facility. Development work continues at the non-operated Kodiak project where the first 2 wells will flow in the coming days. 
In Malaysia, fourth quarter Sarawak natural gas production was over 134 million per day net and oil production was over 14,000 barrels a day. Full year production for Malaysia was over 65,200-barrel equivalents per day. 
We are seeing continued drilling success at our South Acis field in Sarawak, where we announced the sanctioned volumes doubling. In addition, we drilled the Keratau well offshore Brunei, finding commercial natural gas that were in line with pre-drill estimates adding to our resources in the Kelidang field. 
On the fourth quarter, production was just over 200,700 barrel equivalents per day and our full year for the year, we produced close to 208,000 barrel equivalents per day.
We are pleased with the ongoing efforts we're making on cost reductions. Our LOE for quarter 4 2015, excluding Syncrude, is $8.25 per BOE, showing a reduction of 19% from the fourth quarter of '14. This is in line with the 17% reduction for full year 2014 on LOE. 
In Eagle Ford Shale, had fourth quarter operating expenses of just under $8.50 per BOE, and we expect this to be a reasonable run rate going forward. 
In 2015, we produced over 207 barrel oil equivalent per day, our strong production variance over the course of the year is attributable to Sarawak oil and natural gas fields performing better. The Eagle Ford Shale, new well volumes exceeding plan due to EUR increases and completion performance and higher natural gas production from the Montney. 
More importantly, we spent $2.19 billion as compared to our original CapEx plan of $2.3 billion. Even with the significant reduction in capital for 2015, we grew annual production by 3%. 
In 2015, based on preliminary data, we expect to add reserves at a replacement rate of 123% with finding and development costs of $18.70 per BOE. Year end 2015 reserve volumes represented Reserve Life Index of 10.2 years, an increase from 9.2 years from a year ago. This is consistent with our 5-year average reserve replacement rate greater than 180% and is our 10th consecutive year over 100%. During the same time frame, we have more than doubled our production, including a sell-down of our Malaysia assets. 
The capital program for 2016 is currently $825 million, which is approximately 62% lower than $2.19 billion we invested in 2015. We expect production for full year to be 180,000 to 185,000 barrel equivalents per day, which is lower than 2015 due to significant CapEx cuts. As common in our industry, the capital program still remains under review for further reductions, should the commodity prices persist.
Moving on to the subsequent year-end events, as you have read in our news release from last night, we signed 2 purchase and sale agreements announcing the monetization of our midstream Montney and the joint venture in the Kaybob Duvernay and liquids-rich Montney area. We signed a definitive agreement with Enbridge to divest our natural gas processing sales pipeline assets that support our Montney natural gas fields in Tupper and Tupper West. The cash consideration is expected to be CAD 538 million and expected to be closed early in the second quarter. 
In a separate but related transaction, we signed a definitive agreement for a joint venture with Athabasca Oil Corp. to acquire 70% operated working interest in Athabasca's acreage, infrastructure and facilities in the Kaybob Duvernay lands and a 30% non-operated working interest in the liquids-rich Montney. The total consideration is CAD 475 million, of which CAD 250 million is in cash at closing and the remaining CAD 225 million is a carry for a period up to 5 years. 
In the Kaybob Duvernay, there were 230,000 gross acres, 200,000 currently prospective that are currently producing 6,900-barrel equivalent gross per day of production, of which 58% is liquids. This area also includes 247,000 gross acres with overlying rights in the conventional Montney. 
In the liquids-rich Montney area, there are 60,000 gross acres, 21,000 currently viewed as prospective that are currently producing 900-barrel equivalent a day gross at 44% liquids. 
We're very excited to enter to the Kaybob Duvernay and liquid-rich Montney as it complements our current onshore North American resources, fits well with our in-house expertise and will be our third significant North American unconventional position. The CAD 225 million carry in long lease term associated with the Kaybob Duvernay is flexible over 5 years, which is key in this period of low commodity prices where we're able to control the pace of spend. We're allocating partial proceeds from our Montney midstream monetization into this project. And I see it as efficient use of capital that has a positive impact to cash on hand for our balance sheet this year as well as use of Canadian funds in Canada in a tax efficient manner and enter a project that's expected to be self funding within Canada over the life of the period. 
The primary marketable product here as realized will be produced condensate, which is used as diluent for oil sands bitumen production and transport. The Western Canadian oil sands projects have long demonstrated a record of production resiliency that will continue to generate demand well in the excess of regional supply, resulting in relative price stability for foreseeable future. Our joint venture has oil battery capacity of 30,000 barrels per day of oil, and gas pipeline with over 100 million scf per day of capacity.
The Kaybob Duvernay is an emerging play and has 3 same segments seen in the Eagle Ford Shale, natural gas, gas condensate and light oil. The gas condensate area has included several prolific wells of late, and the light oil area that we now have a significant position in is in the early stages of development. We are seeing all signs of a shale play success with increasing EURs, improving completion techniques, as well as lowering of drilling and completion costs. We feel that with 3 to 4 wells per section, we will have over 500 gross locations in the play and this number can greatly increase should downspacing opportunities exist here as seen in other successful North American plays. 
We are seeing many successful wells across the play now approaching 30 test intervals of over 2,000-barrel equivalent per day with yields ranging from 200 to 950 barrel per million and a clear indicator of the oil-rich nature of this basin. 
The Duvernay areas have been heavily drilled through other types of plays through the years in the basin which leads to thousands of penetrations and knowledge of the shale characteristics. Additionally, we have a black oil area in the play, again matching success seen in the Eagle Ford Shale area.
Our new joint venture partner, Athabasca, has been successful in the play with results the condensate region and most importantly, in the light oil area of the play. Athabasca's recently released information about a key well in the gas condensate light oil area that's flowed 1,300-barrel equivalents per day with 62% liquids. This appears to be a very good well by any measure. 
As in any shale play, the optimization of the fracture treatments are key to the learning curve. Of late, higher proppant concentrations have been used in the region. This slide highlights the increase in EUR seen with data up to 2 years in duration, illustrating recent higher treatments lead to consistent EUR levels. Some wells are now seeing above the 1,000 -- 1 million, rather, barrel type curve. These wells shown here in the condensate window are now partnered in the 33,000 acres with a 70% working interest. We're seeing the same -- we see the same well performance with higher stimulation treatments in the Duvernay light oil area as well as where we are working a 70% working interest with our partner in 67,000 acres. We believe there's significant upside in the black oil area where our partnership has 110,000 gross acres. Current data is showing high proppant content at the 607 -- 670,000-barrel equivalent EUR level. 
Our joint venture also includes our liquids-rich Montney, which is among the top active plays in Canada. We participate here in the non-op 30% working interest. The region has a minimum of 30% of the flow stream containing liquids, similar to the condensate in light oil areas. The results in the liquid-rich area are also showing increasing EURs due to completion enhancements and the lowering of costs with 750,000-barrel equivalent EURs seen in the data set. This area has significant running room in the range of 100 to 200 locations with downspacing. We see a tightly leased up area around our new acreage with many non-North American shale players. Rates here are also prolific in the range of 800 barrel equivalents with high-liquid yields.
Like all major shale plays in North America, the key economic driver is the lowering of drilling and completion costs while simultaneously improving the completion techniques for each area. We are seeing the early stages of a major improvement in costs for the region and our expertise in 2 other plays where we are a top quartile drilling and completion company will enhance our ability to quickly move up the learning curve here. Our partner Athabasca is active in the cost reduction business, and we will be able to quickly adapt to the area where they have recently seen incredible improvements as we see great upside in lowering costs from the current CAD 9.4 million per well down to CAD 6.5 million per well. Athabasca has recently seen wells being drilled for as low as CAD 3.25 million, which is an outstanding performance. 
As I close our call today, here are a few takeaways: We're focusing on our balance sheet at Murphy. The purchase and sale agreement to monetize our natural gas midstream and use a portion of proceeds to enter into an onshore conventional shale play that allows for balance sheet neutrality with a 5-year carry and further liquidity this year for our cash positions. We see this venture as an investment for the long term with total spend flexibility over a 5-year period as we anticipate a price recovery. Cost reductions will continue to be our focus. Our Eagle Ford Shale continues to perform very well for us. The budget reductions will lead to a very limited exploration spend this year. We continue to illustrate the execution advantages we have in the offshore. We had an excellent year operationally in our company with the reserve additions, significant capital reductions and lowering costs leading the way. 
I would now like to open the phone lines up for your questions, and thank you."

It's very rare to get into M&A in North America and have flexibility on the first year of capital spend and have no continuous drilling clauses, be able to drag out the carry over a very long period of time at a very low oil price. I've said for a long time that I would like a 10% cost of capital-type return at a strip price. And with the drilling costs we're seeing here, we're able to do that here, even on strip that we used on January 19, which was probably $4 behind where we are today. So I see this as transformative for us, Roger, honestly, because it has a 200 million, 300 million barrel ability for us. It's pretty low-cost entry. It's different from buying a -- from a company that's flipping acres because we have a partner that's working there and has drilled there and has infrastructure there, and we're able to work with them and take over as the operator. They're able to operate a piece where they've been very successful. It's in Canada. We'll have Canadian proceeds. There's a low ForEx right now for this transaction. Where the USD equivalent of that would not get you what it used to get you here in the United States. And all of those factors led to this decision."

It will always be slightly ahead of wells up there. But then you have this balance sheet issue of U.S. cost and repatriation and tax efficiency and working in the Mocal area. But if we remove it around pretty good, they compete very well. A condensate well and an oil window well up in Canada competes very well with lower Eagle Ford Shale and Karnes. That's what's so interesting, Ryan, about this deal and about these shale plays is that 4 years ago, the Catarina area, where we have an enormous acreage position in Western Eagle Ford Shale was one of our lowest rate of return areas in the company in -- in the Eagle Ford, I mean. So over this time, the EURs have doubled, the drilling costs have halved and it went from the bottom to the best. So it's a best individual well, economics around 25% on that January 19 strip date where we normalized all our costs. And this project up there is competing with there. But the point is, is things change. Some areas become better than others. Places not so good last time are better this time. The cost in this northern light oil area are very, very good, getting much better and we put those costs in here. This project is going to compete with the Eagle Ford very well for us. And then, it will be a matter of our capital -- what we do about repatriation and how we want to work in our Mocal cash balance.

Murphy's consolidated results in the first quarter of 2016 were loss of $198.8 million, which is $1.16 per diluted share, and that compares to a loss of $14.4 million or $0.08 per diluted share a year ago. Excluding our discontinued operations, our continuing operations had a loss of $199.5 million, again $1.16, versus a profit in the first quarter of 2015 of $3.5 million, which was $0.02 per diluted share. 
The first quarter results from continuing operations for 2016 included noncash property impairments of $95.1 million, which after tax has amounted to $68.9 million charge. These impairments were primarily attributable to the declines in future periods oil prices as of quarter end March and the impairments related to both Terra Nova and Seal properties in Canada. 
The just completed quarter also included an after-tax expense of $6.2 million to reflect restructuring costs by the company. The 2015 first quarter a year ago benefited from $199.5 million after-tax gain on the sale of 10% of our Malaysian assets, which closed in January 2015. 
Adjusted earnings, which adjusts our GAAP numbers for various items that affect comparability of results between periods was a loss of $112.8 million in the first quarter 2016, an improvement from the adjusted net loss of $198.5 million a year ago. This improvement in adjusted results in 2016 was primarily attributable to lower exploration expenses, partially offset by significantly lower oil and natural gas sales prices compared to a year ago. Our schedule of adjusted earnings is included in this part of our earnings release and the amounts in this schedule are reported on an after-tax basis. 
The company's average realized price for its crude oil production was $34.19 per barrel sold, which was almost $13 per barrel lower, 27% in the first quarter 2016 compared to the prior year. 
Natural gas prices also were weaker in the first quarter compared to the prior year's quarter average North American gas price realizations of $1.57 per 1,000 cubic feet dropped $0.89 per Mcf or a decline of 36%. Realized oil index natural gas prices offshore Sarawak fell 18% to an average of $3.67 per Mcf following the decline in global crude oil prices. 
The company's cash flow from continuing operations for the first 3 months of 2016 was burdened by deepwater rig contract exit payments of $253.2 million. The income statement charge associated with these deepwater rig exits was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015. 
For the second quarter 2016, the company has WTI-based oil price hedges for 20,000 barrels per day at a WTI average price of $52.01. For the last 6 months of 2016, the company has entered into an additional 5,000 barrels per day hedge at $45.30 per barrel or a blended average WTI price of $50.67 covering 25,000 barrels per day for the last 6 months of 2016. 
Additionally, the company has forward sales contracts for Canadian natural gas in the amount of 59 million cubic feet a day at an average AECO price of CAD 3.19 per thousand cubic feet on the remaining 9 months of 2016. 
At quarter end March 31, 2016, Murphy's long-term debt amounted to $3.4 billion, 39.6% percent of total capital employed, while net debt amounted to 35.5%. 
As of quarter end, we had $971 million of combined borrowings under our $2 billion revolver and uncommitted credit facilities. We also had a total of cash and invested cash of about $569 million worldwide. The closing of the Montney midstream asset sale for CAD 538 million on April 1 added to our cash position early in the second quarter. And the future completion of the recently announced Syncrude sale will also add to our cash position. 
Murphy's sole debt covenant at the present time is a total debt to capital ratio of 60%. 
Thank you, and that concludes my comments. And I'll pass it over to Roger at this time."

Looking back at the first quarter, the following highlights stand out. We produced 196,600 barrel equivalents. We were able to exceed our quarterly guidance with high level of execution, which [indiscernible] close to 0 planned downtime or maintenance across our diversified production base and higher field performance in many of our key fields. 
From a safety standpoint, we had 0 recordable incidents across our entire company during the quarter, which are a remarkable feat for our operating team. 
We remain laser focused on reducing cost across our business. During the quarter, we reduced our 2016 annual capital to $580 million from the previously announced $825 million plan and, most importantly, after a 73% reduction from our 2015 capital spend of $2.2 billion. 
We also reduced lease operating expenses, excluding Syncrude, by 22% quarter-over-quarter. 
Also we continue to reposition our portfolio, including closing the previously announced noncore asset sale of our Montney midstream assets as well as recently signing a purchase sale agreement to divest 5% nonoperated working interest at Syncrude. We are working diligently to close our previously announced joint venture focused on expanding our footprint the North American onshore and conventional business in the Kaybob Duvernay and liquid-rich Montney areas in Canada. We continue review our portfolio and we'll act when opportunities present themselves.
I'm pleased with the ongoing efforts our team is making on cost reductions. Our lease operating expenses in quarter 1, excluding Syncrude, of $7.50 per BOE shown a reduction some 22% from the first quarter of '15 and a reduction of 9% from the fourth quarter last year. As a result, our decreased activities following ore commodity process and implemented a companywide workforce reduction, [indiscernible] stacking levels by about 20% in 2016. 
We've been able to lower our G&A cost excluding restructuring charges approximately 26% quarter-over-quarter. 
The capital program for 2016 being maintained as the press release said at $580 million while maintaining our production guidance range of 180,000 to 185,000-barrel equivalents per day. Our first quarter spending is roughly 25% of our annual CapEx, which is on our plan. Our annual and quarter capital and production plans have not yet been adjusted for pending asset divestment and assets should be acquired. Updating for production in capital spending would be released on the closing of these transactions. Production for the second quarter 2016 is estimated to be in the range of 177,000 to 180,000-barrel equivalents per day.
Looking at production. As I said, we produced 196,600 equivalents per day, exceeding guidance. The stronger-than-forecasted first quarter volumes were primarily due to higher production from Eagle Ford Shale, higher natural gas prod from the Montney, higher oil production from both offshore Sabah, Malaysia and offshore Canada. And these increases were partially offset by delays in bringing on our Kodiak subsea well in the Gulf of Mexico as well as increased downtime in Sarawak and Kikeh involved in our natural gas production in that area. It's important to note that our second quarter production guidance of 177,000 to 180,000 compared to first quarter's negatively impacted a planned downtime and maintenance across many of our assets, including 10 days at Sarawak natural gas, [indiscernible] subsea well 2 subsea wells shut in for 21 days in offshore Malaysia and Terra Nova they're at working on 28 day turnaround, and we are part of the long term 45-day turnaround at Syncrude, which is ongoing. The current guidance is based on Syncrude producing at reduced rates until the planned turnaround is complete over the next 2 weeks. However, we've not updated forecast with the recent news of wildfires in this area [indiscernible] misplaced residents in the Fort McMurray area. 
Plus Eagle Ford Shale will have natural production decline this quarter as we have no new wells planned to be added in that field.
In onshore business, Eagle Ford Shale continues to perform well where we averaged near 56,000-barrel equivalents a day for the quarter, where we delivered 13 new wells online, bringing our total operating well count to over 660. 
In Eagle Ford Shale, that first quarter operating expenses just under $8, a 6% reduction from the fourth quarter 2015. We continue to making strides in increasing drilling and completion costs as we average 4.1 million per well, which is 26% below first quarter 2015. We drilled a well in only 6 days from spud to rig release in our Catarina area. It's important to note that our strategy to work inside a lower-for-longer commodity price regime, with our much lower capital spend in 2016 will lead to bringing on 28 new wells and drilling 25 wells in the Eagle Ford. This is well below the 136 operated wells we brought online in 2015. We still have significant run room ahead of us here, over 2,000 potential Eagle Ford Shale locations and reserves of oil weighted at roughly 90%. Yes, it is very meaningful to Murphy's future reserve production cash flow.
Last year, we drilled our first [indiscernible] in Orange County. We continue to be pleased with the well's performance and just recently spud another [indiscernible] in Catarina area, testing most Western part of our acreage. We have an Austin Chalk well standing in [indiscernible], which will be completed later this year. We estimate we have approximately 265 Austin Chalk well locations of which 115 are in Carnes and 115 Catarina. The Carnes area which is currently by current well being online for some 7 months could add an additional 30 million-barrel equivalent of sources to our Eagle Ford Shale business. 
In Canada, our Montney asset continues to produce above plan. We averaged 207 million a day there for the quarter. LOE was $0.26 per Mcf, a 32% reduction quarter-over-quarter. No new wells brought online in this quarter, but we plan to complete 4 wells in the second quarter, targeting 15 to 18 Bcf EUR in those wells. 
We closed the sale of our Montney natural gas processing plants early in second quarter. After incurring a new tariff associated with sale, we can expect well breakeven process for a 10% rate of return to be approximately USD 1.65 AECO at a ForEx conversion of 0.79. This significant go LOE, along with our greatly reduced drilling and completion costs and higher EUR wells, enable us to easily manage the new tariff and take advantage of the -- and took advantage of the monetization by deploying proceeds to higher return assets. 
In offshore Malaysia business, we produced over 58,000-barrel equivalents per day during the quarter, and we continued with our Sarawak development during the South access and are on track for a July installation of a new producing facility for that field. 
The [indiscernible] first quarter production averaged over 142,000 gross, with peak production 157,000 gross in that field. The field is simply incredible. 
In the Gulf of Mexico, production for the first quarter 2016 is approximately 19,200-barrel equivalents per day, 80% liquids. Kodiak well initially came online at planned rates during the first quarter, it was taken off-line as we experienced surface facilities issues. Those modifications are complete, and the well should be flowing very near term. 
In the month of April, we drilled 2 exploration commitment wells, 1 in Malaysia and 1 in Vietnam and Malaysia. [indiscernible] number 1 offsetting our South access field, and our noncommercial natural gas accumulations plugged and abandoned. Vietnam, cc 1x well in Block 11-2 found oil paint in the well but it's not commercial for planned sidetrack, and we also plugged that well. These are both shallow water low-cost opportunities and, together, will result in a total expense of near $15 million for this second quarter. 
There are exploration wells planned for this year as a result of our reduced capital plan. We continue to progress our farming agreement with PetroVietnam for the 15-1 LDD field in the Cuu Long Basin, where we have got a successful well test last year. 
We continue working to protect our balance sheet. End of the first quarter, we have $1.1 billion of availability in our revolver, with $925 million drawn. We have $569 million of cash in our corporation, which does not include the proceeds from our midstream monetization of some CAD 538 million from earlier in the second quarter. Our long-term debt to total capitalization is just under 40% at the end of first quarter, well below our sole revolver covenant of 60%. 
Takeaways today. We continue to operate at a high level in terms of drilling and completion improvements and cost reductions, as demonstrated in the first quarter results. We continue to focus on our shareholders with no issuance of equity and a price collapse, look to further strengthen our balance sheet. We significantly reduced our 2016 capital plan to $580 million while maintaining our annual guidance of 180,000 to 185,000 equivalents per day. Our key plays continue performing well, especially in North America and unconventional assets as well as our Malaysian assets. Our portfolio is under continuous review as we remain true to our strategy to focusing North American unconventional resources while maintaining our global offshore presence. We are working to reserve our balance sheet, as evidenced by monetizing non-core assets in the Montney midstream, progression of the joint venture closing in the Kaybob Duvernay and liquids-rich Montney area and the recent signing of a purchase sale agreement to monetize our Syncrude position.

I don't believe the price is that bad as to our long range planning and there have been some operational improvements here.

As we look at a price recovery type deck, we see this price to be very favorable in our long-range planning and we should know, we've been in an asset for a real long time. So if you're looking at oil being $76 in 2020 or $74 in '19, I like the position we have in Canadian dollars here, honestly. I think it's a matter of, we probably had 400 million barrels 4, 5 years ago. We have 770 million barrels now. We had real good year reserve replacement. We've increased our a good bit in our company. It becomes a matter of if not, if when -- if not now, when.

It's exactly the same money that COS paid for these barrels on a per barrel basis or metric exactly saying. This project returns free cash flow when oil is $100, but not so much when it's below $80. So we wanted to move out of that and feel like our reserves have increased, and we want to focus in unconventional, a nearby acreage there where we can get the OpEx below 10. And out of the OpEx, even if it's improved to slightly below 30, and it was a built in time to do it, I felt like it was a rare time that we could execute it and went ahead and moved on."

We're not focusing there right now. Vulcan basin Australia is a very underexplored place, where we have a very large new seismic data set, and we are onto a new play there with some hundred million barrel type opportunities and very inexpensive to drill. That would be one focus area. We have a partner there, Mitsui, we're 60-40 with them. We also, as you know, integrate Australian bite, we have the Ceduna Basin, where we have enormous acreage position with all of our seismic acquired and reprocessed. And we're setting next to BP and Statoil and also Chevron, it will be drilling upwards 6 to 8 wells over the next couple of years. This is a prolific basin, the size of the North Sea and one of the largest left undrilled basins in the world, where we have a position to be able to watch them drill. And those are our focus areas in Vietnam, it's Cuu Long Basin, and we have to think of Vietnam as a place similar to Malaysia, where we would start with shale water blocks. We also have ultra-deepwater blocks. And that entry in that long-term relationship allowed us to enter into the Cuu Long Basin, where we are working with them to add some additional acreage, and we formed into a very successful project there and have to look at Vietnam holistically because the Cuu Long Basin is the prize there. And those are areas today. We're also interested in Mexico bid round because they will not have the higher cost issues placed on the Gulf of Mexico by this administration. I think that's possible. Also of note in the exploration world today, seismic is very inexpensive. Massive seismic availability for inside our budget here. We're not looking to increase our budget in any way, especially in that. But can get lots of data today and build that positions again if needed in this low environment."

We, at Murphy, set out earlier in the year when the price collapsed to organize our capital around the lowest capital we can have. I mean, recalibrated our company because in and around that I knew of asset sales and different things we're doing. We're not a company that goes out saying we're selling all of these assets and doing that. We have a lot going on to accomplish all these purchase and sale agreements that you read about in the press. So in and around that, we're trying to get to a minimum capital spend, recalibrate our company. Once we have the closing, and we have a revolver to redo, a recalibration of our company, a focus out of non-core in North America into unconventionals, all of that takes time. And so we went into over the low CapEx. So we're going to Eagle Ford and we have continuous drilling obligations and we moved our rig around for that. And then from that, we are not a company to bill that drill in uncompleted wells and we have a low level CapEx to meet all these other goals of recalibration I spoke of. And that led to that schedule. And that schedule has on been around since around mid-February, and I'm not interested in probably breaking it back up and opening it back up to capital parade on May 5, whatever today is. So that's how we are thinking about that. It was derived on purpose from the lowest commitment basis. And we are focusing on cost in that, and it will come out of this and we are confident of an oil price recovery. Unlike any operator, we'll get to 2 50s things change a lot. And we'll have to then allocate capital among that and offshore opportunities and move forward. But today; we are looking at it more conservative view that at Murphy Oil Corp."

Murphy's consolidated results in the first quarter of 2016 were loss of $198.8 million, which is $1.16 per diluted share, and that compares to a loss of $14.4 million or $0.08 per diluted share a year ago. Excluding our discontinued operations, our continuing operations had a loss of $199.5 million, again $1.16, versus a profit in the first quarter of 2015 of $3.5 million, which was $0.02 per diluted share. 
The first quarter results from continuing operations for 2016 included noncash property impairments of $95.1 million, which after tax has amounted to $68.9 million charge. These impairments were primarily attributable to the declines in future periods oil prices as of quarter end March and the impairments related to both Terra Nova and Seal properties in Canada. 
The just completed quarter also included an after-tax expense of $6.2 million to reflect restructuring costs by the company. The 2015 first quarter a year ago benefited from $199.5 million after-tax gain on the sale of 10% of our Malaysian assets, which closed in January 2015. 
Adjusted earnings, which adjusts our GAAP numbers for various items that affect comparability of results between periods was a loss of $112.8 million in the first quarter 2016, an improvement from the adjusted net loss of $198.5 million a year ago. This improvement in adjusted results in 2016 was primarily attributable to lower exploration expenses, partially offset by significantly lower oil and natural gas sales prices compared to a year ago. Our schedule of adjusted earnings is included as part of our earnings release and the amounts in this schedule are reported on an after-tax basis. 
The company's average realized price for its crude oil production was $34.19 per barrel sold, which was almost $13 per barrel lower, 27% in the first quarter of 2016 compared to the prior year. 
Natural gas prices also were weaker in the first quarter compared to the prior year's quarter average North American gas price realizations of $1.57 per 1,000 cubic feet dropped $0.89 per Mcf or a decline of 36%. Realized oil index natural gas prices offshore Sarawak fell 18% to an average of $3.67 per Mcf following the decline in global crude oil prices. 
The company's cash flow from continuing operations for the first 3 months of 2016 was burdened by deepwater rig contract exit payments of $253.2 million. The income statement charge associated with these deepwater rig exits was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015. 
For the second quarter 2016, the company has WTI-based oil price hedges for 20,000 barrels per day at a WTI average price of $52.01. For the last 6 months of 2016, the company has entered into an additional 5,000 barrels per day hedge at $45.30 per barrel or a blended average WTI price of $50.67 covering 25,000 barrels per day for the last 6 months of 2016. 
Additionally, the company has forward sales contracts for Canadian natural gas in the amount of 59 million cubic feet a day at an average AECO price of CAD 3.19 per thousand cubic feet on the remaining 9 months of 2016. 
At quarter end March 31, 2016, Murphy's long-term debt amounted to $3.4 billion, 39.6% of total capital employed, while net debt amounted to 35.5%. 
As of quarter end, we had $971 million of combined borrowings under our $2 billion revolver and uncommitted credit facilities. We also had a total of cash and invested cash of about $569 million worldwide. The closing of the Montney midstream asset sale for CAD 538 million on April 1 added to our cash position early in the second quarter. And the future completion of the recently announced Syncrude sale will also add to our cash position. 
Murphy's sole debt covenant at the present time is a total debt to capital ratio of 60%. 
Thank you, and that concludes my comments. And I'll pass it over to Roger at this time."

Looking back at the first quarter, the following highlights stand out. We produced 196,600 barrel equivalents. We were able to exceed our quarterly guidance with high level of execution. We experienced  close to 0 planned downtime or maintenance across our diversified production base and higher field performance in many of our key fields. 
From a safety standpoint, we had 0 recordable incidents across our entire company during the quarter, which is a remarkable feat for our operating team. 
We remain laser focused on reducing cost across our business. During the quarter, we reduced our 2016 annual capital to $580 million from the previously announced $825 million plan and, most importantly, after a 73% reduction from our 2015 capital spend of $2.2 billion. 
We also reduced lease operating expenses, excluding Syncrude, by 22% quarter-over-quarter. 
Also we continue to reposition our portfolio, including closing the previously announced noncore asset sale of our Montney midstream assets as well as recently signing a purchase sale agreement to divest 5% nonoperated working interest at Syncrude. We are working diligently to close our previously announced joint venture focused on expanding our footprint in the North American onshore unconventional business in the Kaybob Duvernay and liquid-rich Montney areas in Canada. We'll continue to review our portfolio and we'll act when opportunities present themselves.
I'm pleased with the ongoing efforts our team is making on cost reductions. Our lease operating expenses in quarter 1, excluding Syncrude, of $7.50 per BOE shown a reduction some 22% from the first quarter of '15 and a reduction of 9% from the fourth quarter of last year. As a result of our decreased activities following oil commodity prices and implemented a companywide workforce reduction lowering our staffing levels by about 20% in 2016. 
We've been able to lower our G&A cost excluding restructuring charges approximately 26% quarter-over-quarter. 
The capital program for 2016 being maintained as I previously said at $580 million while maintaining our production guidance range of 180,000 to 185,000-barrel equivalents per day. Our first quarter spending is roughly 25% of our annual CapEx, which is on our plan. Our annual and quarter capital and production plans have not yet been adjusted for pending asset divestment and assets should be acquired. Updating for production in capital spending will be released on the closing of these transactions. Production for the second quarter 2016 is estimated to be in the range of 177,000 to 180,000-barrel equivalents per day.
Looking at production. As I said, we produced 196,600 equivalents per day, exceeding guidance. The stronger-than-forecasted first quarter volumes were primarily due to higher production from Eagle Ford Shale, higher natural gas production from the Montney, higher oil production from both offshore Sabah, Malaysia and offshore Canada. And these increases were partially offset by delays in bringing on our Kodiak subsea well in the Gulf of Mexico as well as increased downtime in Sarawak and Kikeh involved in our natural gas production in that area. It's important to note that our second quarter production guidance of 177,000 to 180,000 compared to first quarter's negatively impacted a planned downtime and maintenance across many of our assets, including 10 days at Sarawak natural gas, the Kakap-Gumusut subsea well, 2 subsea wells shut in for 21 days in offshore Malaysia and Terra Nova they're  working on 28 day turnaround, and we are part of the long term 45-day turnaround at Syncrude, which is ongoing. The current guidance is based on Syncrude producing at reduced rates until the planned turnaround is complete over the next 2 weeks. However, we've not updated forecast with the recent news of wildfires in this area  [indiscernible] residents in the Fort McMurray area. 
Plus our Eagle Ford Shale will have natural production decline this quarter as we have no new wells planned to be added in that field.
In onshore business, Eagle Ford Shale continues to perform well where we average near 56,000-barrel equivalents a day for the quarter, where we delivered 13 new wells online, bringing our total operated well count to over 660. 
In Eagle Ford Shale, first quarter operating expense is just under $8, a 6% reduction from the fourth quarter 2015. We continue making strides in increasing drilling and completion costs as we average 4.1 million per well, which is 26% below first quarter 2015. We drilled a Pacesetter Well in only 6 days from spud to rig release in our Catarina area. It's important to note that our strategy to work inside a lower-for-longer commodity price regime, with our much lower capital spend in 2016 will lead to bringing on 28 new wells and drilling 25 wells in the Eagle Ford. This is well below the 136 operated wells we brought online in 2015. We still have significant running room ahead of us here, with over 2,000 potential Eagle Ford Shale locations and reserves of oil weighted at roughly 90%. Yes, it is very meaningful to Murphy's future reserves production cash flow.
Last year, we drilled our first Austin Chalk well, in Karnes County. We continue to be pleased with the well's performance and just recently we spud another Austin Chalk well in Catarina area, testing mostly Western part of our acreage. We have an Austin Chalk well standing  in Karnes area, which will be completed later this year. We estimate we have approximately 265 Austin Chalk well locations of which 115 are in Karnes and 115 Catarina. The Karnes area which is currently de-risked by current well being online for some 7 months could add an additional 30 million-barrel equivalents of resources to our Eagle Ford Shale business. 
In Canada, our Montney asset continues to produce above plan. We average 207 million a day there for the quarter. LOE was $0.26 per Mcf, a 32% reduction quarter-over-quarter, but no new wells brought online in this quarter, but we plan to complete 4 wells in the second quarter, targeting 15 to 18 Bcf EUR in those wells. 
We closed the sale of our Montney natural gas processing plants early in the second quarter after incurring the new tariff associated with sale, we can expect well breakeven process for a 10% rate of return to be approximately USD 1.65 AECO at a ForEx conversion of 0.79. This significantly lower go LOE, along with our greatly reduced drilling and completion costs and higher EUR wells, enable us to easily manage the new tariff and take advantage of the -- and we took advantage of the monetization by deploying proceeds to the higher returning assets. 
In our offshore Malaysia business, we produced over 58,000-barrel equivalents per day during the quarter, we continued with our Sarawak development drilling in the South access and are on track for a July installation of a new producing facility for that field. 
The Kakap-Gumusut  first quarter production averaged over 142,000 gross, with peak production nearing 157,000 gross in that field. That field is simply incredible. 
In the Gulf of Mexico, production for the first quarter 2016 is approximately 19,200-barrel equivalents per day, 80% liquids. Kodiak well initially came online at planned rates during the first quarter, it was taken off-line as we experienced surface facility issues. Those modifications are complete, and the well should be flowing very near term. 
In the month of April, we drilled 2 exploration commitment wells, 1 in Malaysia and 1 in Vietnam. In Malaysia, [indiscernible] 1 offsetting our South access field, and our noncommercial natural gas accumulations plugged and abandoned. In Vietnam, the CC-1x well in Block 11-2 found oil play in the well but it was not commercial for planned sidetrack, and we also plugged that well. These are both shallow water low-cost opportunities and, together, will result in a total expense of near $15 million for this second quarter. 
There are no exploration wells planned for this year as a result of our reduced capital plan. We continue to progress our farming agreement with PetroVietnam for the 15-1 LDD field in the Cuu Long Basin, where we had a successful well test last year. 
We continue working to protect our balance sheet. End of the first quarter, we have $1.1 billion of availability under our revolver, with $925 million drawn. We have $569 million of cash in our corporation, which does not include the proceeds from our midstream monetization of some CAD 538 million from earlier in the second quarter. Our long-term debt to total capitalization is just under 40% at the end of first quarter, well below our sole revolver covenant of 60%. 
Takeaways today. We continue to operate at a high level in terms of drilling and completion improvements and cost reductions, as demonstrated in the first quarter results. We continue to focus on our shareholders with no issuance of equity and a price collapse, look to further strengthen our balance sheet. We significantly reduced our 2016 capital plan to $580 million while maintaining our annual guidance of 180,000 to 185,000 equivalents per day. Our key plays continue performing well, especially in North America unconventional assets as well as our Malaysian assets. Our portfolio is under continuous review as we remain true to our strategy of focusing on North American unconventional resources while maintaining our global offshore presence. We are working to preserve our balance sheet, as evidenced by monetizing non-core assets in the Montney midstream, progression of the joint venture closing in the Kaybob Duvernay and liquids-rich Montney area and the recent signing of a purchase sale agreement to monetize our Syncrude position.

I don't believe the price is that bad as to our long range planning and there have been some operational improvements here. They've been very short-term as opposed to the 22 years of turnaround that go over the schedule and various things of that nature. As we look at a price recovery type deck, we see this price to be very favorable in our long-range planning and we should know, we've been in an asset for a real long time. So if you're looking at oil being $76 in 2020 or $74 in '19, I like the position we have in Canadian dollars here, honestly. I think it's a matter of, we probably had 400 million barrels 4, 5 years ago. We have 770 million barrels now. We had real good year of reserve replacement. We've increased our RRP a good bit in our company and it becomes a matter of if not, if when -- if not now, when. So we have a strategic situation where I would like to leave the asset, and we have a strategic situation where Suncor wants to buy the asset at the same time that have built in price on a share base with COS, we were able to turn that into all cash, that opportunity was in stock, thought that was very good for us, and very fair. It's exactly the same money that COS paid for these barrels on a per barrel basis only metric exactly saying. This project returns free cash flow when oil is $100, but not so much when it's below $80. So we wanted to move out of that and feel like our reserves have increased, and we want to focus in unconventional, a nearby acreage there where we can get the OpEx below 10. And out of the OpEx, even if it's improved to slightly below 30, and it was a built in time to do it, I felt like it was a rare time that we could execute it and went ahead and moved on."

We're not focusing there right now. Vulcan basin Australia is a very underexplored place, where we have a very large new seismic data set, and we are onto a new play there with some hundred million barrel type opportunities and very inexpensive to drill. That would be one focus area. We have a partner there, Mitsui, we're 60-40 with them. We also, as you know, in The Great Australian Bight, we have the Ceduna Basin, where we have enormous acreage position with all of our seismic acquired and reprocessed. And we're setting next to BP and Statoil and also Chevron, it will be drilling upwards 6 to 8 wells over the next couple of years. This is a prolific basin, the size of the North Sea and one of the largest left undrilled basins in the world, where we have a position to be able to watch them drill. And those are our focus areas in Vietnam, it's Cuu Long Basin, and we have to think of Vietnam as a place similar to Malaysia, where we started with shallow water blocks. We also have ultra-deepwater blocks. And that entry in that long-term relationship allowed us to enter into the Cuu Long Basin, where we are working with them to add some additional acreage, and we formed into a very successful project there and have to look at Vietnam holistically because the Cuu Long Basin is the prize there. And those are areas today. We're also interested in Mexico bid round because they will not have the higher cost issues placed on the Gulf of Mexico by this administration. I think that's positive. Also of note in the exploration world today, seismic is very inexpensive. Massive seismic availability for inside our budget here. We're not looking to increase our budget in any way, especially in that. But can get lots of data today and build that positions again if needed in this low environment."

We, at Murphy, set out earlier in the year and the price collapsed to organize our capital around the lowest capital we could have, and then recalibrated our company because in and around that I knew of asset sales and different things we're doing. We're not a company that goes out saying we're selling all these assets and doing that, but we had a lot going on to accomplish all these purchase and sale agreements that you read about in the press. So in and around that, we're trying to get to a minimum capital spend, recalibrate our company. Once we have the closing, and we have a revolver to redo, a recalibration of our company, a focus out of non-core in North America into unconventionals, all of that takes time. And so we went into over the low CapEx. So we're going to Eagle Ford and we have continuous drilling obligations and we moved our rig around for that. And then from that, we are not a company to bill that drill in uncompleted wells and we have a low level CapEx to meet all these other goals of recalibration I spoke of. And that led to that schedule. And that schedule has on been around since around mid-February, and I'm not interested in probably breaking it back up and open it back up to capital parade on May 5, whatever today is. So that's how we are thinking about that. It was derived on purpose from a lowest commitment basis. And we are focusing on cost in that, and we will come out of this and we are confident of an oil price recovery. Unlike any operator, oil gets into the 50s things change a lot. And we'll have to then allocate capital among that and offshore opportunities and move forward. But today; we are looking at it, more conservative view of that at Murphy Oil Corp."

Murphy's consolidated results in the first quarter of 2016 were a loss of $198.8 million, which is $1.16 per diluted share, and that compares to a loss of $14.4 million or $0.08 per diluted share a year ago. Excluding our discontinued operations, our continuing operations had a loss of $199.5 million, again $1.16, versus a profit in the first quarter of 2015 of $3.5 million, which was $0.02 per diluted share. 
The first quarter results from continuing operations for 2016 included noncash property impairments of $95.1 million, which after tax has amounted to $68.9 million charge. These impairments were primarily attributable to declines in future periods oil prices as of quarter end March and the impairments related to both Terra Nova and Seal properties in Canada. 
The just completed quarter also included an after-tax expense of $6.2 million to reflect restructuring costs by the company. The 2015 first quarter a year ago benefited from a $199.5 million after-tax gain on the sale of 10% of our Malaysian assets, which closed in January 2015. 
Adjusted earnings, which adjusts our GAAP numbers for various items that affect comparability of results between periods was a loss of $112.8 million in the first quarter 2016, an improvement from the adjusted net loss of $198.5 million a year ago. This improvement in adjusted results in 2016 was primarily attributable to lower exploration expenses, partially offset by significantly lower oil and natural gas sales prices compared to a year ago. Our schedule of adjusted earnings is included as part of our earnings release and the amounts in this schedule are reported on an after-tax basis. 
The company's average realized price for its crude oil production was $34.19 per barrel sold, which was almost $13 per barrel lower, 27% in the first quarter of 2016 compared to the prior year. 
Natural gas prices also were weaker in the first quarter compared to the prior year's quarter average North American gas price realizations of $1.57 per 1,000 cubic feet dropped $0.89 per Mcf or a decline of 36%. Realized oil index natural gas prices offshore Sarawak fell 18% to an average of $3.67 per Mcf following the decline in global crude oil prices. 
The company's cash flow from continuing operations for the first 3 months of 2016 was burdened by deepwater rig contract exit payments of $253.2 million. The income statement charge associated with these deepwater rig exits was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015. 
For the second quarter 2016, the company has WTI-based oil price hedges for 20,000 barrels per day at a WTI average price of $52.01. For the last 6 months of 2016, the company has entered into an additional 5,000 barrels per day hedge at $45.30 per barrel or a blended average WTI price of $50.67 covering 25,000 barrels per day for the last 6 months of 2016. 
Additionally, the company has forward sales contracts for Canadian natural gas in the amount of 59 million cubic feet a day at an average AECO price of CAD 3.19 per thousand cubic feet on the remaining 9 months of 2016. 
At quarter end March 31, 2016, Murphy's long-term debt amounted to $3.4 billion, 39.6% of total capital employed, while net debt amounted to 35.5%. 
As of quarter end, we had $971 million of combined borrowings under our $2 billion revolver and uncommitted credit facilities. We also had a total of cash and invested cash of about $569 million worldwide. The closing of the Montney midstream asset sale for CAD 538 million on April 1 added to our cash position early in the second quarter. And the future completion of the recently announced Syncrude sale will also add to our cash position. 
Murphy's sole debt covenant at the present time is a total debt to capital ratio of 60%. 
Thank you, and that concludes my comments. And I'll pass it over to Roger at this time."

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for listening on our call today. Looking back at the first quarter, the following highlights stand out. We produced 196,600 barrel equivalents.

Looking back at the first quarter, the following highlights stand out. We produced 196,600 barrel equivalents. We were able to exceed our quarterly guidance with high level of execution. We experienced close to 0 planned downtime or maintenance across our diversified production base and higher field performance in many of our key fields. 
From a safety standpoint, we had 0 recordable incidents across our entire company during the quarter, which is a remarkable feat for our operating team. 
We remain laser focused on reducing cost across our business. During the quarter, we reduced our 2016 annual capital of $580 million from the previously announced $825 million plan and, most importantly, after a 73% reduction from our 2015 capital spend of $2.2 billion. 
We also reduced lease operating expenses, excluding Syncrude, by 22% quarter-over-quarter. 
Also we continue to reposition our portfolio, including closing the previously announced noncore asset sale of our Montney midstream assets as well as recently signing a purchase sale agreement to divest 5% nonoperated working interest at Syncrude. We are working diligently to close our previously announced joint venture focused on expanding our footprint in the North American onshore unconventional business in the Kaybob Duvernay and liquid-rich Montney areas in Canada. We'll continue to review our portfolio and we'll act when opportunities present themselves.
I'm pleased with the ongoing efforts our team is making on cost reductions. Our lease operating expenses in quarter 1, excluding Syncrude, of $7.50 per BOE shown a reduction some 22% from the first quarter of '15 and a reduction of 9% from the fourth quarter last year. As a result of our decreased activities following oil commodity prices and implemented a companywide workforce reduction, lowering our staffing levels by about 20% in 2016. 
We've been able to lower our G&A cost excluding restructuring charges approximately 26% quarter-over-quarter. 
The capital program for 2016 being maintained as I previously said at $580 million while maintaining our production guidance range of 180,000 to 185,000-barrel equivalents per day. Our first quarter spending is roughly 25% of our annual CapEx, which is on our plan. Our annual and quarter capital and production plans have not yet been adjusted for pending asset divestment and assets should be acquired. Updating for production in capital spending will be released on the closing of these transactions. Production for the second quarter 2016 is estimated to be in the range of 177,000 to 180,000-barrel equivalents per day.
Looking at production. As I said, we produced 196,600 equivalents per day, exceeding guidance. The stronger-than-forecasted first quarter volumes were primarily due to higher production from Eagle Ford Shale, higher natural gas production from the Montney, higher oil production from both offshore Sabah, Malaysia and offshore Canada. And these increases were partially offset by delays in bringing on our Kodiak subsea well in the Gulf of Mexico as well as increased downtime in Sarawak and Kikeh involved in our natural gas production in that area. It's important to note that our second quarter production guidance of 177,000 to 180,000 compared to first quarter's negatively impacted a planned downtime and maintenance across many of our assets, including 10 days at Sarawak natural gas, the Kakap-Gumusut subsea well, 2 subsea wells shut in for 21 days in offshore Malaysia and Terra Nova they're  working on 28-day turnaround, and we are part of the long term 45-day turnaround at Syncrude, which is ongoing. The current guidance is based on Syncrude producing at reduced rates until the planned turnaround is complete over the next 2 weeks. However, we've not updated forecast with the recent news of wildfires in this area. Our thoughts go to this place's residents in the Fort McMurray area. 
Plus our Eagle Ford Shale will have natural production decline this quarter as we have no new wells planned to be added in that field.
In onshore business, Eagle Ford Shale continues to perform well where we average near 56,000-barrel equivalents a day for the quarter, where we delivered 13 new wells online, bringing our total operated well count to over 660. 
In Eagle Ford Shale, first quarter operating expense is just under $8, a 6% reduction from the fourth quarter 2015. We continue making strides in increasing drilling and completion costs as we average 4.1 million per well, which is 26% below first quarter 2015. We drilled a Pacesetter Well in only 6 days from spud to rig release in our Catarina area. It's important to note that our strategy to work inside a lower-for-longer commodity price regime, with our much lower capital spend in 2016 will lead to bringing on 28 new wells and drilling 25 wells in the Eagle Ford. This is well below the 136 operated wells we brought online in 2015. We still have significant running room ahead of us here, with over 2,000 potential Eagle Ford Shale locations and reserves of oil weighted at roughly 90%. The asset is very meaningful to Murphy's future reserves production cash flow.
Last year, we drilled our first Austin Chalk well, in Karnes County. We continue to be pleased with the well's performance and just recently we spud another Austin Chalk well in Catarina area, testing most Western part of our acreage. We have an Austin Chalk well standing  in Karnes area, which will be completed later this year. We estimate we have approximately 265 Austin Chalk well locations of which 115 are in Karnes and 115 Catarina. The Karnes area, which is currently de-risked by current well being online for some 7 months, could add an additional 30 million-barrel equivalents of resources to our Eagle Ford Shale business. 
In Canada, our Montney asset continues to produce above plan. We average 207 million a day there for the quarter. LOE was $0.26 per Mcf, a 32% reduction quarter-over-quarter, but no new wells brought online in this quarter, but we plan to complete 4 wells in the second quarter, targeting 15 to 18 Bcf EUR in those wells. 
We closed the sale of our Montney natural gas processing plants early in the second quarter after incurring the new tariff associated with sale, we can expect well breakeven process for a 10% rate of return to be approximately USD 1.65 AECO at a ForEx conversion of 0.79. This significantly lower LOE, along with our greatly reduced drilling and completion costs and higher EUR wells, enable us to easily manage the new tariff and take advantage of the -- and we took advantage of the monetization by deploying proceeds into higher returning assets. 
In our offshore Malaysia business, we produced over 58,000-barrel equivalents per day during the quarter, we continued with our Sarawak development drilling in the South access and are on track for a July installation of a new producing facility for that field. 
The Kakap-Gumusut  first quarter production averaged over 142,000 gross, with peak production nearing 157,000 gross in that field. That field is simply incredible. 
In the Gulf of Mexico, production for the first quarter 2016 is approximately 19,200-barrel equivalents per day, 80% liquids. Kodiak well initially came online at planned rates during the first quarter, it was taken off-line as we experienced surface facility issues. Those modifications are complete, and the well should be flowing very near term. 
In the month of April, we drilled 2 exploration commitment wells, 1 in Malaysia and 1 in Vietnam. In Malaysia, [indiscernible] 1 offsetting our South access field, and our noncommercial natural gas accumulations plugged and abandoned. In Vietnam, the CC-1x well in Block 11-2 found oil play in the well but it was not commercial for planned sidetrack, and we also plugged that well. These are both shallow water low-cost opportunities and, together, will result in a total expense of near $15 million for this second quarter. 
There are no exploration wells planned for this year as a result of our reduced capital plan. We continue to progress our farming agreement with PetroVietnam for the 15-1 LDD field in the Cuu Long Basin, where we had a successful well test last year. 
We continue working to protect our balance sheet. End of the first quarter, we have $1.1 billion of availability under our revolver, with $925 million drawn. We have $569 million of cash in our corporation, which does not include the proceeds from our midstream monetization of some CAD 538 million from earlier in the second quarter. Our long-term debt to total capitalization is just under 40% at the end of first quarter, well below our sole revolver covenant of 60%. 
Takeaways today. We continue to operate at a high level in terms of drilling and completion improvements and cost reductions, as demonstrated in the first quarter results. We continue to focus on our shareholders with no issuance of equity and a price collapse, look to further strengthen our balance sheet. We significantly reduced our 2016 capital plan of $580 million while maintaining our annual guidance of 180,000 to 185,000 equivalents per day. Our key plays continue performing well, especially in North America unconventional assets as well as our Malaysian assets. Our portfolio is under continuous review as we remain true to our strategy of focusing on North American unconventional resources while maintaining our global offshore presence. We are working to preserve our balance sheet, as evidenced by monetizing non-core assets in the Montney midstream, progression of the joint venture closing in the Kaybob Duvernay and liquids-rich Montney area and the recent signing of a purchase sale agreement to monetize our Syncrude position.

I don't believe the price is that bad as to our long range planning and there have been some operational improvements here. They've been very short-term as opposed to the 22 years of turnaround that go over the schedule and various things of that nature. As we look at a price recovery type deck, we see this price to be very fair in our long-range planning and we should know, we've been in an asset for a real long time. So if you're looking at oil being $76 in 2020 or $74 in '19, then I like the position we have in Canadian dollars here, honestly. I think it's a matter of, we probably had 400 million barrels 4, 5 years ago. We have 770 million barrels now. We had real good year of reserve replacement. We've increased our RRP a good bit in our company and it becomes a matter of if not, if when -- if not now, when. So we have a strategic situation where I would like to leave the asset, and we have a strategic situation where Suncor wants to buy the asset at the same time that have built in price on a share base with COS, we were able to turn that into all cash, that opportunity was in stock, thought that was very good for us, and very fair. It's exactly the same money that COS paid for these barrels on a per barrel basis only metric exactly saying. This project returns free cash flow when oil is $100, but not so much when it's below $80. So we wanted to move out of that and feel like our reserves have increased, and we want to focus in unconventional, a nearby acreage there where we can get the OpEx below 10. And out of the OpEx, even if it's improved to slightly below 30, and it was a built-in time to do it, I felt like it was a rare time that we could execute it and went ahead and moved on."

So that one is fairly constant. Also still cash flow providing field for us at 3 60 type dollar per Mcf.

We're not focusing there right now. Vulcan basin Australia is a very underexplored place, where we have a very large new seismic data set, and we are onto a new play there with some hundred million barrel type opportunities and very inexpensive to drill. That would be one focus area. We have a partner there, Mitsui, we're 60-40 with them. We also, as you know, in The Great Australian Bight, we have the Ceduna Basin, where we have enormous acreage position with all of our seismic acquired and reprocessed. And we're setting next to BP and Statoil and also Chevron, it will be drilling upwards 6 to 8 wells over the next couple of years. This is a prolific basin, the size of the North Sea and one of the largest left undrilled basins in the world, where we have a position to be able to watch them drill. And those are our focus areas in Vietnam, it's Cuu Long Basin, and we have to think of Vietnam as a place similar to Malaysia, where we started with shallow water blocks. We also have ultra-deepwater blocks. And that entry in that long-term relationship allowed us to enter into the Cuu Long Basin, where we are working with them to add some additional acreage, and we formed into a very successful project there and have to look at Vietnam holistically because the Cuu Long Basin is the prize there. And those are areas today. We're also interested in Mexico bid round because they will not have the higher cost issues placed on the Gulf of Mexico by this administration. I think that's positive. Also of note in the exploration world today, seismic is very inexpensive. Massive seismic availability for inside our budget here. We're not looking to increase our budget in any way, especially in that. But can get lots of data today and build up positions again if needed in this low environment."

We, at Murphy, set out earlier in the year and the price collapsed to organize our capital around the lowest capital we could have, and then recalibrated our company because in and around that I knew of asset sales and different things we're doing. We're not a company that goes out saying we're selling all these assets and doing that, but we had a lot going on to accomplish all these purchase and sale agreements that you read about in the press. So in and around that, we're trying to get to a minimum capital spend, recalibrate our company. Once we had the closing, and then we have our revolver to redo, a recalibration of our company, a focus out of non-core in North America into unconventionals, all of that takes time. And so we went into it with a low CapEx. So we're going to Eagle Ford and we have continuous drilling obligations and we move our rig around for that. And then from that, we are not a company to bill that drill in uncompleted wells and we have a low level CapEx to meet all these other goals of recalibration I spoke of. And that led to that schedule. And that schedule has on been around since around mid-February, and I'm not interested in probably breaking it back up and open it back up to capital parade on May 5, whatever today is. So that's how we are thinking about that. It was derived on purpose from a lowest commitment basis. And we are focusing on cost in that, and we will come out of this when we are confident of an oil price recovery. Unlike any operator, oil gets into the 50s things change a lot. And we'll have to then allocate capital among that and offshore opportunities and move forward. But today, we are looking at it, more conservative view of that at Murphy Oil Corp."

Murphy's consolidated results in the first quarter of 2016 were a loss of $198.8 million, which is $1.16 per diluted share, and that compares to a loss of $14.4 million or $0.08 per diluted share a year ago. Excluding our discontinued operations, our continuing operations had a loss of $199.5 million, again $1.16, versus a profit in the first quarter of 2015 of $3.5 million, which was $0.02 per diluted share. 
The first quarter results from continuing operations for 2016 included noncash property impairments of $95.1 million, which after tax has amounted to $68.9 million charge. These impairments were primarily attributable to declines in future periods oil prices as of quarter end March and the impairments related to both Terra Nova and Seal properties in Canada. 
The just completed quarter also included an after-tax expense of $6.2 million to reflect restructuring costs by the company. The 2015 first quarter a year ago benefited from a $199.5 million after-tax gain on the sale of 10% of our Malaysian assets, which closed in January 2015. 
Adjusted earnings, which adjusts our GAAP numbers for various items that affect comparability of results between periods was a loss of $112.8 million in the first quarter 2016, an improvement from the adjusted net loss of $198.5 million a year ago. This improvement in adjusted results in 2016 was primarily attributable to lower exploration expenses, partially offset by significantly lower oil and natural gas sales prices compared to a year ago. Our schedule of adjusted earnings is included as part of our earnings release and the amounts in this schedule are reported on an after-tax basis. 
The company's average realized price for its crude oil production was $34.19 per barrel sold, which was almost $13 per barrel lower, 27% in the first quarter of 2016 compared to the prior year. 
Natural gas prices also were weaker in the first quarter compared to the prior year's quarter average North American gas price realizations of $1.57 per 1,000 cubic feet dropped $0.89 per Mcf or a decline of 36%. Realized oil index natural gas prices offshore Sarawak fell 18% to an average of $3.67 per Mcf following the decline in global crude oil prices. 
The company's cash flow from continuing operations for the first 3 months of 2016 was burdened by deepwater rig contract exit payments of $253.2 million. The income statement charge associated with these deepwater rig exits was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015. 
For the second quarter 2016, the company has WTI-based oil price hedges for 20,000 barrels per day at a WTI average price of $52.01. For the last 6 months of 2016, the company has entered into an additional 5,000 barrels per day hedge at $45.30 per barrel or a blended average WTI price of $50.67 covering 25,000 barrels per day for the last 6 months of 2016. 
Additionally, the company has forward sales contracts for Canadian natural gas in the amount of 59 million cubic feet a day at an average AECO price of CAD 3.19 per thousand cubic feet on the remaining 9 months of 2016. 
At quarter end March 31, 2016, Murphy's long-term debt amounted to $3.4 billion, 39.6% of total capital employed, while net debt amounted to 35.5%. 
As of quarter end, we had $971 million of combined borrowings under our $2 billion revolver and uncommitted credit facilities. We also had a total of cash and invested cash of about $569 million worldwide. The closing of the Montney midstream asset sale for CAD 538 million on April 1 added to our cash position early in the second quarter. And the future completion of the recently announced Syncrude sale will also add to our cash position. 
Murphy's sole debt covenant at the present time is a total debt to capital ratio of 60%. 
Thank you, and that concludes my comments. And I'll pass it over to Roger at this time."

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for listening on our call today. Looking back at the first quarter, the following highlights stand out. We produced 196,600 barrel equivalents.

Looking back at the first quarter, the following highlights stand out. We produced 196,600 barrel equivalents. We were able to exceed our quarterly guidance with high level of execution. We experienced close to 0 planned downtime or maintenance across our diversified production base and higher field performance in many of our key fields. 
From a safety standpoint, we had 0 recordable incidents across our entire company during the quarter, which is a remarkable feat for our operating team. 
We remain laser focused on reducing cost across our business. During the quarter, we reduced our 2016 annual capital of $580 million from the previously announced $825 million plan and, most importantly, after a 73% reduction from our 2015 capital spend of $2.2 billion. 
We also reduced lease operating expenses, excluding Syncrude, by 22% quarter-over-quarter. 
Also we continue to reposition our portfolio, including closing the previously announced noncore asset sale of our Montney midstream assets as well as recently signing a purchase sale agreement to divest 5% nonoperated working interest at Syncrude. We are working diligently to close our previously announced joint venture focused on expanding our footprint in the North American onshore unconventional business in the Kaybob Duvernay and liquid-rich Montney areas in Canada. We'll continue to review our portfolio and we'll act when opportunities present themselves.
I'm pleased with the ongoing efforts our team is making on cost reductions. Our lease operating expenses in quarter 1, excluding Syncrude, of $7.50 per BOE shown a reduction some 22% from the first quarter of '15 and a reduction of 9% from the fourth quarter last year. As a result of our decreased activities following oil commodity prices and implemented a companywide workforce reduction, lowering our staffing levels by about 20% in 2016. 
We've been able to lower our G&A cost excluding restructuring charges approximately 26% quarter-over-quarter. 
The capital program for 2016 being maintained as I previously said at $580 million while maintaining our production guidance range of 180,000 to 185,000-barrel equivalents per day. Our first quarter spending is roughly 25% of our annual CapEx, which is on our plan. Our annual and quarter capital and production plans have not yet been adjusted for pending asset divestment and assets should be acquired. Updating for production in capital spending will be released on the closing of these transactions. Production for the second quarter 2016 is estimated to be in the range of 177,000 to 180,000-barrel equivalents per day.
Looking at production. As I said, we produced 196,600 equivalents per day, exceeding guidance. The stronger-than-forecasted first quarter volumes were primarily due to higher production from Eagle Ford Shale, higher natural gas production from the Montney, higher oil production from both offshore Sabah, Malaysia and offshore Canada. And these increases were partially offset by delays in bringing on our Kodiak subsea well in the Gulf of Mexico as well as increased downtime in Sarawak and Kikeh involved in our natural gas production in that area. It's important to note that our second quarter production guidance of 177,000 to 180,000 compared to first quarter's negatively impacted a planned downtime and maintenance across many of our assets, including 10 days at Sarawak natural gas, the Kakap-Gumusut subsea well, 2 subsea wells shut in for 21 days in offshore Malaysia and Terra Nova they're working on 28-day turnaround, and we are part of the long term 45-day turnaround at Syncrude, which is ongoing. The current guidance is based on Syncrude producing at reduced rates until the planned turnaround is complete over the next 2 weeks. However, we've not updated forecast with the recent news of wildfires in this area. Our thoughts go to this place's residents in the Fort McMurray area. 
Plus our Eagle Ford Shale will have natural production decline this quarter as we have no new wells planned to be added in that field.
In onshore business, Eagle Ford Shale continues to perform well where we average near 56,000-barrel equivalents a day for the quarter, where we delivered 13 new wells online, bringing our total operated well count to over 660. 
In Eagle Ford Shale, first quarter operating expense is just under $8, a 6% reduction from the fourth quarter 2015. We continue making strides in increasing drilling and completion costs as we average 4.1 million per well, which is 26% below first quarter 2015. We drilled a Pacesetter Well in only 6 days from spud to rig release in our Catarina area. It's important to note that our strategy to work inside a lower-for-longer commodity price regime, with our much lower capital spend in 2016 will lead to bringing on 28 new wells and drilling 25 wells in the Eagle Ford. This is well below the 136 operated wells we brought online in 2015. We still have significant running room ahead of us here, with over 2,000 potential Eagle Ford Shale locations and reserves of oil weighted at roughly 90%. The asset is very meaningful to Murphy's future reserves production cash flow.
Last year, we drilled our first Austin Chalk well, in Karnes County. We continue to be pleased with the well's performance and just recently we spud another Austin Chalk well in Catarina area, testing most Western part of our acreage. We have an Austin Chalk well standing in Karnes area, which will be completed later this year. We estimate we have approximately 265 Austin Chalk well locations of which 115 are in Karnes and 115 Catarina. The Karnes area, which is currently derisked by current well-being online for some 7 months, could add an additional 30 million-barrel equivalents of resources to our Eagle Ford Shale business. 
In Canada, our Montney asset continues to produce above plan. We average 207 million a day there for the quarter. LOE was $0.26 per Mcf, a 32% reduction quarter-over-quarter, but no new wells brought online in this quarter, but we plan to complete 4 wells in the second quarter, targeting 15 to 18 Bcf EUR in those wells. 
We closed the sale of our Montney natural gas processing plants early in the second quarter after incurring the new tariff associated with sale, we can expect well breakeven process for a 10% rate of return to be approximately USD 1.65 AECO at a ForEx conversion of 0.79. This significantly lower LOE, along with our greatly reduced drilling and completion costs and higher EUR wells, enable us to easily manage the new tariff and take advantage of the -- and we took advantage of the monetization by deploying proceeds into higher returning assets. 
In our offshore Malaysia business, we produced over 58,000-barrel equivalents per day during the quarter, we continued with our Sarawak development drilling in the South access and are on track for a July installation of a new producing facility for that field. 
The Kakap-Gumusut first quarter production averaged over 142,000 gross, with peak production nearing 157,000 gross in that field. That field is simply incredible. 
In the Gulf of Mexico, production for the first quarter 2016 is approximately 19,200-barrel equivalents per day, 80% liquids. Kodiak well initially came online at planned rates during the first quarter, it was taken off-line as we experienced surface facility issues. Those modifications are complete, and the well should be flowing very near term. 
In the month of April, we drilled 2 exploration commitment wells, one in Malaysia and one in Vietnam and Malaysia. The Beduk-1 offsetting our South Acis field found a noncommercial natural gas accumulations plugged and abandoned. In Vietnam, the CC-1x well in Block 11-2 found oil play in the well but it was not commercial for planned sidetrack, and we also plugged that well. These are both shallow water low-cost opportunities and, together, will result in a total expense of near $15 million for this second quarter. 
There are no exploration wells planned for this year as a result of our reduced capital plan. We continue to progress our farming agreement with PetroVietnam for the 15-1 LDD field in the Cuu Long Basin, where we had a successful well test last year. 
We continue working to protect our balance sheet. End of the first quarter, we have $1.1 billion of availability under our revolver, with $925 million drawn. We have $569 million of cash in our corporation, which does not include the proceeds from our midstream monetization of some CAD 538 million from earlier in the second quarter. Our long-term debt to total capitalization is just under 40% at the end of first quarter, well below our sole revolver covenant of 60%. 
Takeaways today. We continue to operate at a high level in terms of drilling and completion improvements and cost reductions, as demonstrated in the first quarter results. We continue to focus on our shareholders with no issuance of equity and a price collapse, look to further strengthen our balance sheet. We significantly reduced our 2016 capital plan of $580 million while maintaining our annual guidance of 180,000 to 185,000 equivalents per day. Our key plays continue performing well, especially in North America unconventional assets as well as our Malaysian assets. Our portfolio is under continuous review as we remain true to our strategy of focusing on North American unconventional resources while maintaining our global offshore presence. We are working to preserve our balance sheet, as evidenced by monetizing non-core assets in the Montney midstream, progression of the joint venture closing in the Kaybob Duvernay and liquids-rich Montney area and the recent signing of a purchase sale agreement to monetize our Syncrude position.

I don't believe the price is that bad as to our long range planning and there have been some operational improvements here.

As we look at a price recovery type deck, we see this price to be very fair in our long-range planning and we should know, we've been in an asset for a real long time. So if you're looking at oil being $76 in 2020 or $74 in '19, then I like the position we have in Canadian dollars here, honestly. I think it's a matter of, we probably had 400 million barrels 4, 5 years ago. We have 770 million barrels now. We had real good year of reserve replacement. We've increased our RRP a good bit in our company and it becomes a matter of if not, if when -- if not now, when. So we have a strategic situation where I would like to leave the asset, and we have a strategic situation where Suncor wants to buy the asset at the same time that have built in price on a share base with COS, we were able to turn that into all cash, that opportunity was in stock, thought that was very good for us, and very fair. It's exactly the same money that COS paid for these barrels on a per barrel basis only metric exactly saying. This project returns free cash flow when oil is $100, but not so much when it's below $80. So we wanted to move out of that and feel like our reserves have increased, and we want to focus in unconventional, a nearby acreage there where we can get the OpEx below 10. And out of the OpEx, even if it's improved to slightly below 30, and it was a built-in time to do it, I felt like it was a rare time that we could execute it and went ahead and moved on."

So that one is fairly constant. Also still cash flow providing field for us at 3 60 type dollar per Mcf. And the rest of the fields, this Kakap-Gumusut where we have 8%, is a very, very successful field, limited decline in its own plateau.

We're not focusing there right now. Vulcan basin Australia is a very underexplored place, where we have a very large new seismic data set, and we are onto a new play there with some hundred million barrel type opportunities and very inexpensive to drill. That would be one focus area. We have a partner there, Mitsui, we're 60-40 with them. We also, as you know, in The Great Australian Bight, we have the Ceduna Basin, where we have enormous acreage position with all of our seismic acquired and reprocessed. And we're setting next to BP and Statoil and also Chevron, it will be drilling upwards 6 to 8 wells over the next couple of years. This is a prolific basin, the size of the North Sea and one of the largest left undrilled basins in the world, where we have a position to be able to watch them drill. And those are our focus areas in Vietnam, it's Cuu Long Basin, and we have to think of Vietnam as a place similar to Malaysia, where we started with shallow water blocks. We also have ultra-deepwater blocks. And that entry in that long-term relationship allowed us to enter into the Cuu Long Basin, where we are working with them to add some additional acreage, and we formed into a very successful project there and have to look at Vietnam holistically because the Cuu Long Basin is the prize there. And those are areas today. We're also interested in Mexico bid round because they will not have the higher cost issues placed on the Gulf of Mexico by this administration. I think that's positive. Also of note in the exploration world today, seismic is very inexpensive. Massive seismic availability for inside our budget here. We're not looking to increase our budget in any way, especially in that. But can get lots of data today and build up positions again if needed in this low environment."

We, at Murphy, set out earlier in the year and the price collapsed to organize our capital around the lowest capital we could have, and then recalibrated our company because in and around that I knew of asset sales and different things we're doing. We're not a company that goes out saying we're selling all these assets and doing that, but we had a lot going on to accomplish all these purchase and sale agreements that you read about in the press. So in and around that, we're trying to get to a minimum capital spend, recalibrate our company. Once we had the closing, and then we have our revolver to redo, a recalibration of our company, a focus out of non-core in North America into unconventionals, all of that takes time. And so we went into it with a low CapEx. So we're going to Eagle Ford and we have continuous drilling obligations and we move our rig around for that. And then from that, we are not a company to bill that drill in uncompleted wells and we have a low level CapEx to meet all these other goals of recalibration I spoke of. And that led to that schedule. And that schedule has on been around since around mid-February, and I'm not interested in probably breaking it back up and open it back up to capital parade on May 5, whatever today is. So that's how we are thinking about that. It was derived on purpose from a lowest commitment basis. And we are focusing on cost in that, and we will come out of this when we are confident of an oil price recovery. Unlike any operator, oil gets into the 50s things change a lot. And we'll have to then allocate capital among that and offshore opportunities and move forward. But today, we are looking at it, more conservative view of that at Murphy Oil Corp."

Murphy's consolidated results in the second quarter of 2016 were a profit of $2.9 million, $0.02 per diluted share. The comparative result from the second quarter of 2015 was a net loss of $73.8 million, which equates to $0.42 per diluted share. The improvement in 2016 net results included income tax and other benefits on dispositions of 2 former assets, including the company's 5% interest in Syncrude and the midstream gas processing plants that service the Tupper and Tupper West areas in eastern British Columbia. Excluding discontinued operations, continuing operations had a profit in the second quarter of 2016 of $2.9 million as well and $0.02 a share, and that compares to a loss in the second quarter of 2015 from continuing operations of $89 million or $0.51 per diluted share. 
Second quarter results from continuing operations in '16 included net income tax benefits of $88.9 million from sale of Syncrude and Montney midstream assets. These were mostly noncash tax benefits related to reductions and liabilities for future taxes owed on both of these disposed assets. I'll come back to these taxes and discuss them further in a moment. 
Adjusted earnings, which meant our GAAP numbers for various items that affect comparability of results between periods was a loss of $62.4 million in the second quarter '16 compared to an adjusted net loss of $83.1 million a year ago. The improvement in adjusted results in the 2016 quarter was primarily attributable to lower cost per production, exploration and administrative activities, but these were partially offset by significantly lower oil and natural gas sales prices compared to 1 year ago. Our schedule of adjusted earnings is included as part of our earnings release, and amounts on this schedule are reported on an after-tax basis, with a separate table as to the pretax and income tax impacts by area of operation. 
I now want to discuss further the Canadian transactions in the second quarter. The sale of Montney midstream assets was structured so that no cash taxes will be payable on this transaction. The company had previously recorded deferred tax liabilities for future taxes that were expected to be paid associated with these assets, and due to the structure of the transaction, the previously estimated future taxes will now not be paid so, therefore, in the second quarter, the company reversed these recorded tax liabilities and accordingly recognized the deferred tax benefit of approximately $21 million. 
The Syncrude sale was a taxable transaction, however. It did qualify for capital gain treatment, rather than ordinary tax treatment. Therefore, the tax rate was 1/2 of the standard statutory rate and equated to 13.75% rate, rather than a normal full rate of 27.5%. The overall net tax benefit of $68 million on the Syncrude disposition was mostly attributable to the reduced capital gain rate applicable to the transaction. Cash taxes apply to capital gains rate to the transaction in the amount of approximately $6 million, while deferred tax benefits were approximately $128 million to reduce future taxes payable, which had previously been accrued at the full tax rate. 
The company completed its entry into the Kaybob Duvernay and liquids-rich Montney areas during the second quarter. The initial spend upon closing the joint venture was $206.7 million, plus the company committed approximately another $171 million of future period for the seller over the next 4 to 5 years of operations. 
The company's cash flow from operations during the second quarter was $70 million. The quarter was impacted by paydown of accounts payable owed to vendors and a semiannual interest owed on outstanding debt borrowings. Since the second quarter was skewed by the timing of these cash payments, I think it is best to look at the 6 months year-to-date for understanding. 
Our first half 2016 cash flow totaled $113 million, and this included payments for canceled Deepwater drilling rig contracts of almost $262 million. In the past years, these costs would have been included as investing activity spend under the category of capital expenditures. However, since the decision was made to cancel these contracts without drilling, these costs have been recorded as cash outflows from operating activities in 2016. 
Looking at the first 6 months without these one-off rig payoffs, operating cash flow would total $375 million and annualizing this amount for a full year for pro forma purposes for 2016, operating cash flow would amount to approximately $750 million over the full 12 months, again, excluding the rig payments. 
The company's second quarter 2016 lease operating expense was lower by approximately $2.50 per barrel of oil equivalent compared to 1 year ago. Beginning in the second quarter of 2016, our average LOE costs include the new tariff associated with Montney area gas plants that were sold. Although these assets were sold above book value, for accounting purposes, the gain has been deferred. Starting in the second quarter 2016, the recorded gas processing cost is reduced to recognize a portion of the deferred gain on the asset sale, and the remainder of this gain will be recognized over the 20-year throughput commitment term. 
The company's second quarter 2016 average realized sales prices for its crude oil production was $44.42 per barrel sold, lower by $12 per barrel or 21% compared to the same period in the prior year. 
Natural gas prices also were weaker in quarter 2 compared to the prior year's quarter, with average North American gas price realizations of $1.35 per thousand cubic feet, a drop of $1.07 per Mcf or a decline of 44%. 
Realized oil index natural gas process offshore Sarawak fell 14% to an average of $3.29 per Mcf due to the decline in global crude oil prices. With crude oil prices improving during the second quarter of this year compared to the first quarter, the fair value of the company's open crude oil derivative contracts fell. Therefore, overall company revenue in the quarter was reduced by $59 million related to a lower mark-to-market fair value for open crude oil contracts. Although this revenue reduction is recorded in the second quarter, the impacts of the change in the fair value of these open contracts was not reflected -- is not reflected in the average realized sales prices recorded for the quarter, as here, only the actual cash received on contracts that matured that during the period are included in the average realized sales prices. 
Our EBITDA -- EBITDAX balances in the second quarter were hurt by well over $3 per barrel for the mark to market decline in crude contract value. 
For the remaining 6 months of 2016, the company has WTI based oil prices hedges for 25,000 barrels per day at a WTI average price of $50.67 per barrel. Additionally, the company has forward sales contracts for Canadian natural gas in the amount of 99 million cubic feet a day at an average AECO price at CAD 3 per thousand cubic feet over the remainder of '16. And we also have future Canadian gas hedges covering 59 million a day at CAD 2.81 per thousand cubic feet for the period of 2017 through 2020. 
At the end of the quarter, June 30, 2016, Murphy's long-term debt amounted to $2.44 billion, which equates to 32% of total capital employed, and net debt amounted to 28.5% of the capital employed. Both gross and net debt ratios were significant improvements from one quarter earlier. As of quarter-end, we had total cash and invested cash of almost $400 million and no outstanding borrowed balance on our $2 billion revolver that matures in June of 2017. We paid our revolving debt balance off in the second quarter using the combined net cash proceeds of approximately $1.15 billion from the Syncrude and Montney midstream dispositions. The company is working closely with our banking syndicate and expects to reach an agreement in the near term on the new revolving credit facility. 
That concludes my comment, and I'll now pass it over to Roger."

Looking back, the second quarter 2016 is a pivotal quarter for Murphy's to continued repositioning of the company. We're able to close our 2 previously announced key divestitures, our interest in Syncrude, as well as our natural gas processing plants and pipelines servicing our Tupper Montney assets. Proceeds amounted to $1.15 billion as John mentioned. This allowed us to repay all the borrowings in our revolver and retained almost $400 million of cash in the balance sheet. 
As we closed on our new -- we also closed our new North American interventional pay or a the Kaybob Duvernay and Placid Montney at a low-cost upfront entry of USD 207 million. The new asset competes well with any recent North American transaction as we're able to acquire a low-cost entry point on any measure of 2P dollar resource or acreage. We believe that our current diversified asset mix is all weighted services as the base, which will be able to recalibrate production and respond to positive lower for longer commodity prices. 
During the quarter, we had an exceptionally low capital spend of $108 million, that's primarily due to timing. This does not include the previously mentioned Joint Venture purchase. This low rate is not indicative of a poorly run rate, as we do plan to spend $620 million over the course of 2016, as originally planned and announced in February. Also maintain our annual production guidance when adjusted for asset sales and purchases. 
We're also continuing to lower cost structure. LOE was down 23% from quarter 2 '15 and G&A down approximately 15% from quarter 2 '15 as well. 
Second quarter production, 168,600 BOE per day, was slightly lower than our guidance range when adjusted per sales and purchases. As you'll recall that we stated that there was a planned maintenance across many of our assets, which is common in quarter 2 for our company as well as natural production declines in Eagle Ford Shale as there were no wells planned, nor were any broad woman in the second quarter. 
Further impacting our second quarter production is the venture of the Syncrude, wildfires in Western Canada, another third-party infrastructure and facility curtailments. We expect our third quarter production to be flat as compared to second quarter with third quarter guidance in the range of 167,500 to 169,500. The guidance takes into account the long planned 10-day turnaround at the Tupper Montney area at over 2,400 barrel oil equivalent per day. 
The capital program for '16, as I mentioned, is maintain the $620 million plus an additional $207 million attributable to our purchase in the Kaybob and Montney areas. Spending for the first half of the year was roughly 40% of our planned annual CapEx. 
Both annual and third quarter production incorporates the production associated with newly acquired joint venture of Kaybob and Placid and divesture of interest in Syncrude, as previously announced. But these include annual guidance range has not been changed. 
Lease operating expense for second quarter '16 was $8.36 per BOE, shown a reduction of over 23% from the second quarter of 2015 reduction of over 9% for the full year of 2015. Our second quarter 2016 LOE was slightly higher than quarter 1 due to production volumes being lower, as I just mentioned. 
Always operating expenses noted here exclude Syncrude. 
We also made good progress in reducing our G&A cost over the past 12 months through strategic restructuring, workforce reductions approximately 35%. Second quarter G&A is approximately 15% from second quarter '15 and, more importantly, we've been able to decrease G&A cost by 23% from first quarter 2015 when we began implementing deliberate cost reduction measures. 
We continue to reposition our portfolio. Our current assets are more streamlined and concentrated than we became an independent E&P company almost 3 years ago. However, remaining true to our history, we're still a global diversified oil-weighted E&P company that generates stable cash flow from long-lived conventional reserves, primarily in Malaysia, that oil-weighted price to Brent along with SK Gas price with oil. We're positioned from ground grassroots efforts, in 3 premier North American unconventional plays that provide us short cycle growth opportunities following our low-cost entry point. We continue to review our portfolio, and we'll act when opportunities present themselves. 
In offshore Malaysia business, we produced 56,000 BOE per day during the quarter, with natural gas production from Sarawak registering 96 million a day. During the third quarter, we are planning a topside installation at South Acis satellite platform. The wells were drilled earlier this year and expected to start producing in the fourth quarter. This topside installation will allow us to maintain our current SK production throughout the year at maximum capacity. 
As part of the improved oil recovery project in Kikeh we installed the surface jet pump systems during the quarter now to successful installation of this system, resulting enhanced production, we'll be installing electrical submersible pump later this year. Further we are planning a long-term gas project for this field as well. 
In the Gulf of Mexico, production in the second quarter was approximately 16,600-barrel equivalents per day at 83% liquids. The Kodiak well is in production mid-quarter and is currently producing over 12,500 barrel equivalents per day gross. 
Options are currently being evaluated to co-mingle into an upper zone that's expected to further enhance rates as well as an offset well opportunity. This project has been very successful for us. 
Murphy holds a large acreage position in Southern Australia basin, where we have seismic commitments only. Previously, we have acquired and evaluated seismic across our acreage and are pleased with the prospects we have seen. We feel this area could be greatly derisked by drilling that take place in the adjacent blocks with BP and Statoil plans to spud the first of 2 wells this fall. 
In Eagle Ford Shale, second quarter production was 47,500 equivalents per day. As planned, there were no new wells brought online this quarter. However, we did complete 8 wells that are online in the current quarter. These wells were completed ahead of plan to synchronize completion schedules with offset operators and require the offset wells to be shut in. In addition to these 8 wells, which are now flowing, there are 22 wells currently scheduled to be brought during the second half of the year, including 2 Austin Chalk wells, 1 in Karnes and the other testing and most Western acreage in Catarina. 
We continue making strides in decreasing driven completion cost, as we averaged $4 million per well across the play, which is 25% below the $5 million per well in the second quarter of '15. We still have significant running room ahead for us here, over 2,000 potential locations in the Eagle Ford Shale. Reserves are all weighted at roughly 90%. The asset is very meaningful for Murphy's feature reserves production cash flow. 
Over the past several months, we followed progress on 2 prior completed Karnes well, employing high concentrations sand fracs, allowing us to use a more aggressive choke technique. We employed this technique on former wells recently and plan and on plan for more in the third quarter. Initial results are impressive, with a 15% higher EUR and 30% higher IP than offset wells. As stated prior, we should in wells during the completion of the operations. After we brought these offset wells back online we experienced an uplift in production from those wells. We look forward to bringing you updates as we move this technique across more of Karnes and into our Tilden area and also Catarina area later this year. 
We're further testing our stack zone potential exists across our acreage position, we're testing a new Austin Chalk well along with 3 upper Eagle Ford wells in Karnes and our latest high concentrations and completion program. We are also completing a new Austin Chalk well in the Catarina area. 
In Canada, our Tupper Montney asset produced over 197 million a day for the quarter. There were 10 wells brought online during this quarter, including 2 wells that tested extended laterals and increased per lateral foot in the completion phase. These wells are currently cleaning up, with encouraging initial results. We look forward to bringing you updates in the third quarter call. 
I stated earlier, we closed the sale of our Montney natural gas processing plants earlier in the quarter. After including the new tariff associated for these sales, we expect well breakeven cost for a 10% return to be USD 1.65 AECO and LOE for the second quarter was $0.63 per Mcf, which includes the new tariff associated with monetizing Montney processing plants and pipeline. The greatly reduced drilling and completion costs and higher EURs and easy to manage the new tariff and take advantage of the monetization of following the proceeds and higher returning assets. Returns have further enhance for the long-term hedging program out to 2020 as part of our ongoing strategy. 
We closed our previously announced joint venture in the Kaybob Duvernay and Placid Montney area in mid-quarter. We're just getting started on our operatorship with the Kaybob asset and move forward with development plans for the rest of the year and planning 2017. This time, we are completing 4 well pad in the condensate area of the play and anticipate flowing these wells very late this quarter or early next. 
We are also picking up rig between, we plan to drill a 4 well pad in [indiscernible] area in quarter 4 and hope to have 2 wells drilled by year-end. Our plan in the Kaybob area is to increase lateral lengths over time to 9,000 feet and pump fracs 2,000 panels per foot of sand, which we feel will lead to higher rates in the area of the play and offer upside for Murphy and our partner. 
In Placid Montney, we are a nonoperating partner with 30% working interest. The current plan's to drill 12 wells this year, drilling has already begun. The first pad of wells anticipated to flow late this year. 
As we close our call today, some takeaways. Murphy continues with our plan to reposition the company, stabilize production, and ultimately, grow production as oil prices recover. We significantly reduced our 2016 capital program to $620 million as previously announced, and recalibrated our annual production to 173,000 to 177,000 range after accounting for asset mix changes. Our key plays continued performing well in Malaysia and especially in North America and conventional onshore assets, where we have significant upside. We remain focused on our cost structure. We're proud of our plan to not issue equity in the price collapse earlier this year and also during this time, with new able to's further strengthen our balance sheet by lowering debt levels. 
I'd now like to open it up for your questions, and thank you."

Murphy's consolidated results in the second quarter of 2016 were a profit of $2.9 million, $0.02 per diluted share. The comparative result from the second quarter of 2015 was a net loss of $73.8 million, whi",1328,"Thank you, Kelly, and good afternoon, everyone. Murphy's consolidated results in the second quarter of 2016 were a profit of $2.9 million, $0.02 per diluted share. The comparative result from the second quarter of 2015 was a net loss of $73.8 million, which equates to $0.42 per diluted share. The improvement in 2016 net results included income tax and other benefits on dispositions of 2 former assets, including the company's 5% interest in Syncrude and the midstream gas processing plants that service the Tupper and Tupper West areas in eastern British Columbia. Excluding discontinued operations, continuing operations had a profit in the second quarter of 2016 of $2.9 million as well and $0.02 a share, and that compares to a loss in the second quarter of 2015 from continuing operations of $89 million or $0.51 per diluted share. 
Second quarter results from continuing operations in '16 included net income tax benefits of $88.9 million from sale of Syncrude and Montney midstream assets. These were mostly noncash tax benefits related to reductions and liabilities for future taxes owed on both of these disposed assets. I'll come back to these taxes and discuss them further in a moment. 
Adjusted earnings, which amend our GAAP numbers for various items that affect comparability of results between periods was a loss of $62.4 million in the second quarter '16 compared to an adjusted net loss of $83.1 million a year ago. The improvement in adjusted results in the 2016 quarter was primarily attributable to lower cost per production, exploration and administrative activities, but these were partially offset by significantly lower oil and natural gas sales prices compared to 1 year ago. Our schedule of adjusted earnings is included as part of our earnings release and amounts in this schedule are reported on an after-tax basis with a separate table as to the pretax and income tax impacts by area of operation. 
I now want to discuss further the Canadian transactions in the second quarter. The sale of Montney midstream assets was structured so that no cash taxes will be payable on this transaction. The company had previously recorded deferred tax liabilities for future taxes that were expected to be paid associated with these assets, and due to the structure of the transaction, the previously estimated future taxes will now not be paid so, therefore, in the second quarter, the company reversed these recorded tax liabilities and accordingly recognized the deferred tax benefit of approximately $21 million. 
The Syncrude sale was a taxable transaction, however, it did qualify for capital gain treatment rather than ordinary tax treatment. Therefore, the tax rate was 1/2 of the standard statutory rate and equated to 13.75% rate rather than a normal full rate of 27.5%. The overall net tax benefit of $68 million on the Syncrude disposition was mostly attributable to the reduced capital gain rate applicable to the transaction. Cash taxes apply to capital gains rate to the transaction in the amount of approximately $6 million, while deferred tax benefits were approximately $128 million to reduce future taxes payable, which had previously been accrued at the full tax rate. 
The company completed its entry into the Kaybob Duvernay and liquids-rich Montney areas during the second quarter. The initial spend upon closing the joint venture was $206.7 million plus the company committed approximately another $171 million of future carry for the seller over the next 4 to 5 years of operations. 
The company's cash flow from operations during the second quarter was $70 million. The quarter was impacted by paydown of accounts payable owed to vendors and a semiannual interest owed on outstanding debt borrowings. Since the second quarter was skewed by the timing of these cash payments, I think it is best to look at the 6 months year-to-date for understanding. 
Our first half 2016 cash flow totaled $113 million, and this included payments for canceled Deepwater drilling rig contracts of almost $262 million. In the past years, these costs would have been included as investing activity spend under the category of capital expenditures. However, since the decision was made to cancel these contracts without drilling, these costs have been recorded as cash outflows from operating activities in 2016. 
Looking at the first 6 months without these one-off rig payoffs, operating cash flow would total $375 million and annualizing this amount for a full year for pro forma purposes for 2016, operating cash flow would amount to approximately $750 million over the full 12 months, again, excluding the rig payments. 
The company's second quarter 2016 lease operating expense was lower by approximately $2.50 per barrel of oil equivalent compared to 1 year ago. Beginning in the second quarter of 2016, our average LOE costs include the new tariff associated with Montney area gas plants that were sold. Although these assets were sold above book value, for accounting purposes, the gain has been deferred. Starting in the second quarter 2016, the recorded gas processing cost is reduced to recognize a portion of the deferred gain on the asset sale, and the remainder of this gain will be recognized over the 20-year throughput commitment term. 
The company's second quarter 2016 average realized sales prices for its crude oil production was $44.42 per barrel sold lower by $12 per barrel or 21% compared to the same period in the prior year. 
Natural gas prices also were weaker in quarter 2 compared to the prior year's quarter with average North American gas price realizations of $1.35 per thousand cubic feet, a drop of $1.07 per Mcf or a decline of 44%. 
Realized oil index natural gas process offshore Sarawak fell 14% to an average of $3.29 per Mcf due to the decline in global crude oil prices. With crude oil prices improving during the second quarter of this year compared to the first quarter, the fair value of the company's open crude oil derivative contracts fell. Therefore, overall company revenue in the quarter was reduced by $59 million related to a lower mark-to-market fair value for open crude oil contracts. Although this revenue reduction is recorded in the second quarter, the impacts of the change in the fair value of these open contracts is not reflected in the average realized sales prices recorded for the quarter, as here, only the actual cash received on contracts that matured during the period are included in the average realized sales prices. 
Our EBITDA and EBITDAX balances in the second quarter were hurt by well over $3 per barrel for the mark to market decline in crude contract value. 
For the remaining 6 months of 2016, the company has WTI based oil price hedges for 25,000 barrels per day at a WTI average price of $50.67 per barrel. Additionally, the company has forward sales contracts for Canadian natural gas in the amount of 99 million cubic feet a day at an average AECO price of CAD 3 per thousand cubic feet over the remainder of '16, and we also have future Canadian gas hedges covering 59 million a day at CAD 2.81 per thousand cubic feet for the period of 2017 through 2020. 
At the end of the quarter, June 30, 2016, Murphy's long-term debt amounted to $2.44 billion, which equates to 32% of total capital employed, and net debt amounted to 28.5% of the capital employed. Both gross and net debt ratios were significant improvements from the one quarter earlier. As of quarter-end, we had total cash and invested cash of almost $400 million and no outstanding borrowed balance on our $2 billion revolver that matures in June of 2017. We paid our revolving debt balance off in the second quarter using the combined net cash proceeds of approximately $1.15 billion from the Syncrude and Montney midstream dispositions. The company is working closely with our banking syndicate and expects to reach an agreement in the near term on a new revolving credit facility. 
Concludes my comments. And I'll now pass it over to Roger."

Good afternoon, everybody, and thanks for listening to our call today. Looking back at the second quarter, 2016 is a pivotal quarter for Murphy's, it marked to the continued repositioning of the company. We're able to close our 2 previous",1848,"Thank you, John. Good afternoon, everybody, and thanks for listening to our call today. Looking back at the second quarter, 2016 is a pivotal quarter for Murphy's, it marked to the continued repositioning of the company. We're able to close our 2 previously announced key divestitures, our interest in Syncrude, as well as our natural gas processing plants and pipelines servicing our Tupper Montney assets. Proceeds amounted to $1.15 billion, as John mentioned. This allowed us to repay all the borrowings under our revolver and retained almost $400 million of cash in the balance sheet. 
As we closed on our new -- we also closed our new North American unconventional play during the Kaybob Duvernay and Placid Montney at a low-cost upfront entry of USD 207 million. The new asset competes well with any recent North American transaction as we're able to acquire a low-cost entry point on any measure of 2P dollar resource or acreage. We believe that our current diversified asset mix is all weighted service as the base, and which should be able to recalibrate production and respond to possible lower for longer commodity prices. 
During the quarter, we had an exceptionally low capital spend of $108 million, that's primarily due to timing. This does not include the previously mentioned joint venture purchase. This low rate is not indicative of a quarterly run rate, as we do plan to spend $620 million over the course of 2016, as originally planned and announced in February. Also maintain our annual production guidance when adjusted for asset sales and purchases. 
We're also continuing to lowering cost structure. LOE was down 23% from quarter 2 '15, and G&A down approximately 15% from quarter 2 '15 as well. 
Second quarter production, 168,600 BOE per day was slightly lower than our guidance range when adjusted for sales and purchases. As you recall we stated that, there was a planned maintenance across many of our assets, which is common in quarter 2 for our company as well as natural production declines in Eagle Ford Shale as there were no wells planned, nor were any brought-on in the second quarter. 
Further impacting our second quarter production was Divestitures of Syncrude, Wildfires in Western Canada, another third-party infrastructure and facility curtailments. We expect that our third quarter production to be flat as compared to second quarter with third quarter guidance in the range of 167,500 to 169,500. The guidance takes into account a long plan 10-day turnaround at the Tupper Montney area at over 2,400 barrel oil equivalent per day. 
The capital program for '16, as I mentioned, is maintained at $620 million plus an additional $207 million attributable to our purchase in the Kaybob and Montney areas. Spending for the first half of the year was roughly 40% of our planned annual CapEx. 
Both annual and third quarter production incorporates the production associated with newly acquired joint venture of Kaybob and Placid and divesture of our interest in Syncrude, as previously announced. But these includes the annual guidance range has not been changed. 
Lease operating expense for second quarter '16 was $8.36 per BOE showing a reduction of over 23% from the second quarter of 2015, a reduction of over 9% for the full year of 2015. Our second quarter 2016 LOE was slightly higher than quarter 1 due to production volumes being lower, as I just mentioned. 
All these operating expenses noted here exclude Syncrude. 
We also made good progress in reducing our G&A costs over the past 12 months through strategic restructuring, workforce reductions approximately 35%. Second quarter G&A is approximately 15% from second quarter '15, and more importantly, we've been able to decrease G&A costs by 23% from first quarter 2015 when we began implementing deliberate cost reduction measures. 
We continue to reposition our portfolio. Our current assets are more streamlined and concentrated, and we became an independent E&P company almost 3 years ago. However, remaining true to our history, we're still a global diversified oil-weighted E&P company that generates stable cash flow from long-lived conventional reserves, primarily in Malaysia that oil-weighted and price to Brent along with SK Gas price being priced with oil. We have good positions from ground grassroots efforts, pardon me, in 3 premier North American unconventional plays that provide us short cycle growth opportunities following our low-cost entry point. We continue to review our portfolio, and we'll act when opportunities present themselves. 
In offshore Malaysia business, we're producing a 56,000 BOE per day during the quarter, with natural gas production from Sarawak registering 96 million a day. During the third quarter, we are planning a topside installation at South Acis satellite platform. The wells were drilled earlier this year and expected to start producing in the fourth quarter. This topside installation will allow us to maintain our current SK oil production throughout the year at a maximum capacity. 
As part of the improved oil recovery project in Kikeh, we installed the surface jet pump system during the quarter. And now with the successful installation of this system resulting enhanced production, we'll be installing our electrical submersible pump later this year. Further, we are planning a long-term Gas Lift project for this field as well. 
In the Gulf of Mexico, production in the second quarter was approximately 16,600 barrel equivalents per day at 83% liquids. The Kodiak well is in production mid-quarter and is currently producing over 12,500 barrel equivalents per day gross. 
Options are currently being evaluated to co-mingle into an upper zone that expected to further enhance rates as well as an offset well opportunity. This project has been very successful for us. 
Murphy holds a large acreage position in Southern Australia-Ceduna basin, where we have seismic commitments only. Previously, we have acquired and evaluated seismic across to our acreage, and are pleased with the prospects we have seen. We feel this area could be greatly derisked by drilling that will take place in adjacent blocks with BP and Statoil plans to spud the first of 2 wells this fall. 
In Eagle Ford Shale, second quarter production was 47,500 equivalents per day. As planned, there were no new wells bought online this quarter. However, we did complete 8 wells that are online in the current quarter. These wells are completed ahead of plan to synchronize completion schedules with offset operators and acquire the offset wells to be shut in. In addition to these 8 wells, which are now flowing, there are 22 wells currently scheduled to be brought on during the second half of the year, including 2 Austin Chalk wells, 1 in Karnes and the other testing and most Western acreage in Catarina. 
We continue making strides in decreasing drilling and completion costs, as we average $4 million per well across the play, which is 25% below the $5.0 million per well in the second quarter of '15. We still have significant running room ahead for us here, over 2,000 potential locations in the Eagle Ford Shale. Reserves are all weighted at roughly 90%. The asset is very meaningful for Murphy's future reserves production cash flow. 
Over the past several months, we followed progress on 2 prior completed Karnes wells employing high concentrations sand fracs, allowing us to use a more aggressive choke technique. We've employed this technique on 4 more wells recently and plan -- and on plan for more in the third quarter. Initial results are impressive, with a 15% higher EUR and 30% higher IP than offset wells. As stated prior, we shut in offset wells during the completion operations. After we brought these offset wells back online, we experienced an uplift in production from those wells. We look forward to bringing you updates as we move this technique across more of Karnes and into our Tilden area and also Catarina areas later this year. 
We're further testing our stacked zone potential to exist across our acreage position. We're testing a new Austin Chalk well along with 3 upper Eagle Ford wells in Karnes, and our latest high concentrations sand completion program. We're also completing a new Austin Chalk well in the Catarina area. 
In Canada, our Tupper Montney asset produced over 197 million a day for the quarter. There were 10 wells brought online during this quarter, including 2 wells that tested extended laterals and increased proppant per lateral foot in the completion phase. These wells are currently cleaning up with encouraging initial results. We look forward to bringing you updates in the third quarter call. 
As stated earlier, we closed the sale of our Montney natural gas processing plants earlier in the quarter. After including the new tariff associated with the sale, we expect well breakeven cost for a 10% return to be USD 1.65 AECO and LOE for the second quarter was $0.63 per Mcf, which includes the new tariff associated with monetizing Montney processing plants and pipeline.
The greatly reduced drilling and completion costs and higher EURs enable us to easy manage the new tariff and take advantage of the monetization by deploying the proceeds into higher returning assets. Returns have further enhanced for the long-term hedging program out to 2020 as part of our ongoing strategy. 
We closed our previously announced joint venture in the Kaybob Duvernay and Placid Montney area in mid-quarter. We're just getting started on our operatorship with the Kaybob asset and moving forward with development plans for the rest of the year and planning 2017. This time, we are completing a 4 well pad in the condensate area of the play and anticipate flowing these wells very late this quarter or early next. 
We are also picking up the rig and planning to drill a 4 well pad in the lateral area in quarter 4 and hope to have 2 wells drilled by year-end. Our plan in the Kaybob area is to increase lateral lengths over time to 9,000 feet and pump fracs 2,000 panels per foot of sand, which we feel will lead to higher rates in the area of the play and offer upside for Murphy and our partner. 
In the Placid Montney, we're a nonoperating partner with 30% working interest. The current plan is to drill 12 wells this year, or drilling has already begun. The first padded wells anticipated to flow late this year. 
As we close our call today, some takeaways. Murphy continues with our plan to reposition the company, stabilize production, and ultimately grow production as oil prices recover. We significantly reduced our 2016 capital program to $620 million as previously announced, and we've recalibrated our annual production to 173,000 to 177,000 range after accounting for asset mix changes. 
Our key plays continued performing well in Malaysia and especially in North America and conventional onshore assets, where we have significant upside. We remain focused on our cost structure. We're proud of our plan to not issue equity in the price collapse earlier this year and also during this time, we've been able to further strengthen our balance sheet by lowering debt levels. 
I'd now like to open it up for your questions, and thank you."

The comparative result from the second quarter of 2015 was a net loss of $73.8 million, which equates to $0.42 per diluted share. The improvement in 2016 net results included income tax and other benefits on dispositions of 2 former assets, including the company's 5% interest in Syncrude and the midstream gas processing plants that service the Tupper and Tupper West areas in eastern British Columbia. Excluding discontinued operations, continuing operations had a profit in the second quarter of 2016 of $2.9 million as well and $0.02 a share, and that compares to a loss in the second quarter of 2015 from continuing operations of $89 million or $0.51 per diluted share. 
Second quarter results from continuing operations in '16 included net income tax benefits of $88.9 million from sale of Syncrude and Montney midstream assets. These were mostly noncash tax benefits related to reductions and liabilities for future taxes owed on both of these disposed assets. I'll come back to these taxes and discuss them further in a moment. 
Adjusted earnings, which amend our GAAP numbers for various items that affect comparability of results between periods was a loss of $62.4 million in the second quarter '16 compared to an adjusted net loss of $83.1 million a year ago. The improvement in adjusted results in the 2016 quarter was primarily attributable to lower cost for production, exploration and administrative activities, but these were partially offset by significantly lower oil and natural gas sales prices compared to 1 year ago. Our schedule of adjusted earnings is included as part of our earnings release and amounts in this schedule are reported on an after-tax basis with a separate table as to the pretax and income tax impacts by area of operation. 
I now want to discuss further the Canadian transactions in the second quarter. The sale of Montney midstream assets was structured so that no cash taxes will be payable on this transaction. The company had previously recorded deferred tax liabilities for future taxes that were expected to be paid associated with these assets, and due to the structure of the transaction, the previously estimated future taxes will now not be paid so, therefore, in the second quarter, the company reversed these recorded tax liabilities and accordingly recognized the deferred tax benefit of approximately $21 million. 
The Syncrude sale was a taxable transaction, however, it did qualify for capital gain treatment rather than ordinary tax treatment. Therefore, the tax rate was 1/2 of the standard statutory rate and equated to 13.75% rate rather than a normal full rate of 27.5%. The overall net tax benefit of $68 million on the Syncrude disposition was mostly attributable to the reduced capital gain rate applicable to the transaction. Cash taxes applied at capital gains rate to the transaction in the amount of approximately $6 million, while deferred tax benefits were approximately $128 million to reduce future taxes payable, which had previously been accrued at the full tax rate. 
The company completed its entry into the Kaybob Duvernay and liquids-rich Montney areas during the second quarter. The initial spend upon closing the joint venture was $206.7 million plus the company committed approximately another $171 million of future carry for the seller over the next 4 to 5 years of operations. 
The company's cash flow from operations during the second quarter was $70 million. The quarter was impacted by paydown of accounts payable owed to vendors and a semiannual interest owed on outstanding debt borrowings. Since the second quarter was skewed by the timing of these cash payments, I think it is best to look at the 6 months year-to-date for understanding. 
Our first half 2016 cash flow totaled $113 million, and this included payments for canceled Deepwater drilling rig contracts of almost $262 million. In the past years, these costs would have been included as investing activity spend under the category of capital expenditures. However, since the decision was made to cancel these contracts without drilling, these costs have been recorded as cash outflows from operating activities in 2016. 
Looking at the first 6 months without these one-off rig payoffs, operating cash flow would total $375 million and annualizing this amount for a full year for pro forma purposes for 2016, operating cash flow would amount to approximately $750 million over the full 12 months, again, excluding the rig payments. 
The company's second quarter 2016 lease operating expense was lower by approximately $2.50 per barrel of oil equivalent compared to 1 year ago. Beginning in the second quarter of 2016, our average LOE costs include the new tariff associated with Montney area gas plants that were sold. Although these assets were sold above book value, for accounting purposes, the gain has been deferred. Starting in the second quarter 2016, the recorded gas processing cost is reduced to recognize a portion of the deferred gain on the asset sale, and the remainder of this gain will be recognized over the 20-year throughput commitment term. 
The company's second quarter 2016 average realized sales prices for its crude oil production was $44.42 per barrel sold lower by $12 per barrel or 21% compared to the same period in the prior year. 
Natural gas prices also were weaker in quarter 2 compared to the prior year's quarter with average North American gas price realizations of $1.35 per 1,000 cubic feet, a drop of $1.07 per Mcf or a decline of 44%. 
Realized oil index natural gas process offshore Sarawak fell 14% to an average of $3.29 per Mcf due to the decline in global crude oil prices. With crude oil prices improving during the second quarter of this year compared to the first quarter, the fair value of the company's open crude oil derivative contracts fell. Therefore, overall company revenue in the quarter was reduced by $59 million related to a lower mark-to-market fair value for open crude oil contracts. Although this revenue reduction is recorded in the second quarter, the impacts of the change in the fair value of these open contracts is not reflected in the average realized sales prices reported for the quarter, as here, only the actual cash received on contracts that matured during the period are included in the average realized sales prices. 
Our EBITDA and EBITDAX balances in the second quarter were hurt by well over $3 per barrel for the mark to market decline in crude contract value. 
For the remaining 6 months of 2016, the company has WTI based oil price hedges for 25,000 barrels per day at a WTI average price of $50.67 per barrel. Additionally, the company has forward sales contracts for Canadian natural gas in the amount of 99 million cubic feet a day at an average AECO price of CAD 3 per 1,000 cubic feet over the remainder of '16, and we also have future Canadian gas hedges covering 59 million a day at CAD 2.81 per 1,000 cubic feet for the period of 2017 through 2020. 
At the end of the quarter, June 30, 2016, Murphy's long-term debt amounted to $2.44 billion, which equates to 32% of total capital employed, and net debt amounted to 28.5% of the capital employed. Both gross and net debt ratios were significant improvements from the one quarter earlier. As of quarter-end, we had total cash and invested cash of almost $400 million and no outstanding borrowed balance on our $2 billion revolver that matures in June of 2017. We paid our revolving debt balance off in the second quarter using the combined net cash proceeds of approximately $1.15 billion from the Syncrude and Montney midstream dispositions. The company is working closely with our banking syndicate and expects to reach an agreement in the near term on a new revolving credit facility. 
Concludes my comments. And I'll now pass it over to Roger."

Good afternoon, everybody, and thanks for listening to our call today. Looking back at the second quarter 2016 is a pivotal quarter for Murphy's. It marked to the continued repositioning of the company. We're able to close our 2 previousl",1853,"Thank you, John. Good afternoon, everybody, and thanks for listening to our call today. Looking back at the second quarter 2016 is a pivotal quarter for Murphy's. It marked to the continued repositioning of the company. We're able to close our 2 previously announced key divestitures, our interest in Syncrude, as well as our natural gas processing plants and pipelines servicing our Tupper Montney assets. Proceeds amounted to $1.15 billion, as John mentioned. This allowed us to repay all the borrowings under our revolver and retained almost $400 million of cash in the balance sheet. 
As we closed on our new -- we also closed our new North American unconventional play during the Kaybob Duvernay and Placid Montney at a low-cost upfront entry of USD 207 million. The new asset competes well with any recent North American transaction as we're able to acquire a low-cost entry point on any measure of 2P dollar resource or acreage. We believe that our current diversified asset mix is oil weighted [ph] serves as the base in which we'd be able to recalibrate production and respond to possible lower for longer commodity prices. 
During the quarter, we had an exceptionally low capital spend of $108 million, that's primarily due to timing. This does not include the previously mentioned joint venture purchase. This low rate is not indicative of a quarterly run rate, as we do plan to spend $620 million over the course of 2016, as originally planned and announced in February. Also maintain our annual production guidance when adjusted for asset sales and purchases. 
We're also continuing to lowering cost structure. LOE was down 23% from quarter 2 '15, and G&A down approximately 15% from quarter 2 '15 as well. 
Second quarter production, 168,600 BOE per day was slightly lower than our guidance range when adjusted for sales and purchases. As you recall we stated that, there was a planned maintenance across many of our assets, which is common in quarter 2 for our company as well as natural production declines in Eagle Ford Shale as there were no wells planned, nor were any brought-on in the second quarter. 
Further impacting our second quarter production was Divestitures of Syncrude, Wildfires in Western Canada, and other third-party infrastructure and facility curtailments. We expect that our third quarter production to be flat as compared to second quarter with third quarter guidance in the range of 167,500 to 169,500. The guidance takes into account a long planned 10-day turnaround at the Tupper Montney area at over 2,400 barrel oil equivalent per day. 
The capital program for '16, as I mentioned, is maintained at $620 million plus an additional $207 million attributable to our purchase in the Kaybob and Montney areas. Spending for the first half of the year was roughly 40% of our planned annual CapEx. 
Both annual and third quarter production incorporates the production associated with newly acquired joint venture of Kaybob and Placid and divesture of our interest in Syncrude, as previously announced. With these inclusions, our annual guidance range has not been changed. 
Lease operating expense for second quarter '16 was $8.36 per BOE showing a reduction of over 23% from the second quarter of 2015, a reduction of over 9% for the full year of 2015. Our second quarter 2016 LOE was slightly higher than quarter 1 due to production volumes being lower, as I just mentioned. 
All these operating expenses noted here exclude Syncrude. 
We also made good progress in reducing our G&A costs over the past 12 months through strategic restructuring, workforce reductions approximately 35%. Second quarter G&A is approximately 15% from second quarter '15, and more importantly, we've been able to decrease G&A costs by 23% from first quarter 2015 when we began implementing deliberate cost reduction measures. 
We continue to reposition our portfolio. Our current assets are more streamlined and concentrated than when we became an independent E&P company almost 3 years ago. However, remaining true to our history, we're still a global diversified oil-weighted E&P company. We generates stable cash flow from long-lived conventional reserves, primarily in Malaysia that oil-weighted and priced to Brent along with SK Gas price being priced with oil. We have good positions from ground -- grassroots efforts, pardon me, in 3 premier North American unconventional plays that provide us short cycle growth opportunities following our low-cost entry point. We continue to review our portfolio, and we'll act when opportunities present themselves. 
In our offshore Malaysia business, we're producing our 56,000 BOE per day during the quarter, with natural gas production from Sarawak registering 96 million a day. During the third quarter, we are planning a topside installation at South Acis satellite platform. The wells were drilled earlier this year and expected to start producing in the fourth quarter. This topside installation will allow us to maintain our current SK oil production throughout the year at maximum capacity. 
As part of the improved oil recovery project in Kikeh, we installed the surface jet pump system during the quarter. And now with the successful installation of this system resulting enhanced production, we'll be installing our electrical submersible pump later this year. Further, we are planning a long-term Gas Lift project for this field as well. 
In the Gulf of Mexico, production in the second quarter was approximately 16,600 barrel equivalents per day at 83% liquids. The Kodiak well was in production mid-quarter and is currently producing over 12,500 barrel equivalents per day gross. 
Options are currently being evaluated to co-mingle into an upper zone that are expected to further enhance rates as well as an offset well opportunity. This project has been very successful for us. 
Murphy holds a large acreage position in Southern Australia-Ceduna basin, where we have seismic commitments only. Previously, we have acquired and evaluated seismic across to our acreage, and are pleased with the prospects we have seen. We feel this area could be greatly derisked by drilling that will take place in adjacent blocks where BP and Statoil plans to spud the first of 2 wells this fall. 
In Eagle Ford Shale, second quarter production was 47,500 equivalents per day. As planned, there were no new wells brought online this quarter. However, we did complete 8 wells that are online in the current quarter. These wells are completed ahead of plan to synchronize completion schedules with offset operators and acquire the offset wells to be shut in. In addition to these 8 wells, which are now flowing, there are 22 wells currently scheduled to be brought on during the second half of the year, including 2 Austin Chalk wells, 1 in Karnes and the other testing and our most western acreage in Catarina. 
We continue making strides in decreasing drilling and completion costs, as we average $4 million per well across the play, which is 25% below the $5.0 million per well in the second quarter of '15. We still have significant running room ahead for us here, with over 2,000 potential locations in the Eagle Ford Shale. Reserves are oil weighted at roughly 90%. The asset is very meaningful for Murphy's future reserves production cash flow. 
Over the past several months, we followed progress on 2 prior completed Karnes wells employing high concentrations sand fracs, allowing us to use a more aggressive choke technique. We've employed this technique on 4 more wells recently and plan -- and on plan for more in the third quarter. Initial results are impressive, with a 15% higher EUR and 30% higher IP than offset wells. As stated prior, we shut in offset wells during the completion operations. After we brought these offset wells back online, we experienced an uplift in production from those wells. We look forward to bringing you updates as we move this technique across more of Karnes and into our Tilden area and also Catarina areas later this year. 
We're further testing our stacked zone potential to exists across our acreage position. We're testing a new Austin Chalk well along with 3 upper Eagle Ford wells in Karnes, and our latest high concentrations sand completion program. We're also completing a new Austin Chalk well in the Catarina area. 
In Canada, our Tupper Montney asset produced over 197 million a day for the quarter. There were 10 wells brought online during this quarter, including 2 wells that tested extended laterals and increased proppant per lateral foot in the completion phase. These wells are currently cleaning up with encouraging initial results. We look forward to bringing you updates in the third quarter call. 
As stated earlier, we closed the sale of our Montney natural gas processing plants earlier in the quarter. After including the new tariff associated with the sale, we expect well breakeven cost for a 10% return to be USD 1.65 AECO and LOE for the second quarter was $0.63 per Mcf, which includes the new tariff associated with monetizing Montney processing plants and pipeline.
The greatly reduced drilling and completion costs and higher EURs enable us to easily manage the new tariff and take advantage of the monetization by deploying the proceeds into higher returning assets. Returns are further enhanced for the long-term hedging program out to 2020 as part of our ongoing strategy. 
We closed our previously announced joint venture in the Kaybob Duvernay and Placid Montney area in mid-quarter. We're just getting started on our operatorship with the Kaybob asset and moving forward with development plans for the rest of the year and planning 2017. This time, we are completing a 4-well pad in the condensate area of the play and anticipate flowing these wells very late this quarter or early next. 
We are also picking up the rig and planning to drill a 4-well pad in the lateral area in quarter 4 and hope to have 2 wells drilled by year-end. Our plan in the Kaybob area is to increase lateral lengths over time to 9,000 feet and pump fracs 2,000 pounds per foot of sand, which we feel will lead to higher rates in the area of the play and offer upside for Murphy and our partner. 
In the Placid Montney, we're a nonoperating partner with 30% working interest. The current plan is to drill 12 wells this year. Our drilling has already begun. The first padded wells anticipated to flow late this year. 
As we close our call today, some takeaways. Murphy continues with our plan to reposition the company, stabilize production, and ultimately grow production as oil prices recover. We significantly reduced our 2016 capital program to $620 million as previously announced, and have recalibrated our annual production to 173,000 to 177,000 range after accounting for asset mix changes. 
Our key plays continued performing well in Malaysia and especially in North America and conventional onshore assets, where we have significant upside. We remain focused on our cost structure. We're proud of our plan to not issue equity in the price collapse earlier this year and also during this time, we've been able to further strengthen our balance sheet by lowering debt levels. 
I'd now like to open it up for your questions, and thank you."

We're in the middle of doing all that right now. I'm very pleased with this ground floor buildup result, we will be reviewing that in more detail quickly.

Murphy's consolidated results in the second quarter of 2016 were a profit of $2.9 million, $0.02 per diluted share. The comparative result from the second quarter of 2015 was a net loss of $73.8 million, whi",1328,"Thank you, Kelly, and good afternoon, everyone. Murphy's consolidated results in the second quarter of 2016 were a profit of $2.9 million, $0.02 per diluted share. The comparative result from the second quarter of 2015 was a net loss of $73.8 million, which equates to $0.42 per diluted share. The improvement in 2016 net results included income tax and other benefits on dispositions of 2 former assets, including the company's 5% interest in Syncrude and the midstream gas processing plants that service the Tupper and Tupper West areas in eastern British Columbia. Excluding discontinued operations, continuing operations had a profit in the second quarter of 2016 of $2.9 million as well and $0.02 a share, and that compares to a loss in the second quarter of 2015 from continuing operations of $89 million or $0.51 per diluted share. 
Second quarter results from continuing operations in '16 included net income tax benefits of $88.9 million from sale of Syncrude and Montney midstream assets. These were mostly noncash tax benefits related to reductions and liabilities for future taxes owed on both of these disposed assets. I'll come back to these taxes and discuss them further in a moment. 
Adjusted earnings, which amend our GAAP numbers for various items that affect comparability of results between periods was a loss of $62.4 million in the second quarter '16 compared to an adjusted net loss of $83.1 million a year ago. The improvement in adjusted results in the 2016 quarter was primarily attributable to lower cost for production, exploration and administrative activities, but these were partially offset by significantly lower oil and natural gas sales prices compared to 1 year ago. Our schedule of adjusted earnings is included as part of our earnings release and amounts in this schedule are reported on an after-tax basis with a separate table as to the pretax and income tax impacts by area of operation. 
I now want to discuss further the Canadian transactions in the second quarter. The sale of Montney midstream assets was structured so that no cash taxes will be payable on this transaction. The company had previously recorded deferred tax liabilities for future taxes that were expected to be paid associated with these assets, and due to the structure of the transaction, the previously estimated future taxes will now not be paid so, therefore, in the second quarter, the company reversed these recorded tax liabilities and accordingly recognized the deferred tax benefit of approximately $21 million. 
The Syncrude sale was a taxable transaction, however, it did qualify for capital gain treatment rather than ordinary tax treatment. Therefore, the tax rate was 1/2 of the standard statutory rate and equated to 13.75% rate rather than a normal full rate of 27.5%. The overall net tax benefit of $68 million on the Syncrude disposition was mostly attributable to the reduced capital gain rate applicable to the transaction. Cash taxes applied at capital gains rate to the transaction in the amount of approximately $6 million, while deferred tax benefits were approximately $128 million to reduce future taxes payable, which had previously been accrued at the full tax rate. 
The company completed its entry into the Kaybob Duvernay and liquids-rich Montney areas during the second quarter. The initial spend upon closing the joint venture was $206.7 million plus the company committed approximately another $171 million of future carry for the seller over the next 4 to 5 years of operations. 
The company's cash flow from operations during the second quarter was $70 million. The quarter was impacted by paydown of accounts payable owed to vendors and a semiannual interest owed on outstanding debt borrowings. Since the second quarter was skewed by the timing of these cash payments, I think it is best to look at the 6 months year-to-date for understanding. 
Our first half 2016 cash flow totaled $113 million, and this included payments for canceled Deepwater drilling rig contracts of almost $262 million. In the past years, these costs would have been included as investing activity spend under the category of capital expenditures. However, since the decision was made to cancel these contracts without drilling, these costs have been recorded as cash outflows from operating activities in 2016. 
Looking at the first 6 months without these one-off rig payoffs, operating cash flow would total $375 million and annualizing this amount for a full year for pro forma purposes for 2016, operating cash flow would amount to approximately $750 million over the full 12 months, again, excluding the rig payments. 
The company's second quarter 2016 lease operating expense was lower by approximately $2.50 per barrel of oil equivalent compared to 1 year ago. Beginning in the second quarter of 2016, our average LOE costs include the new tariff associated with Montney area gas plants that were sold. Although these assets were sold above book value, for accounting purposes, the gain has been deferred. Starting in the second quarter 2016, the recorded gas processing cost is reduced to recognize a portion of the deferred gain on the asset sale, and the remainder of this gain will be recognized over the 20-year throughput commitment term. 
The company's second quarter 2016 average realized sales prices for its crude oil production was $44.42 per barrel sold lower by $12 per barrel or 21% compared to the same period in the prior year. 
Natural gas prices also were weaker in quarter 2 compared to the prior year's quarter with average North American gas price realizations of $1.35 per 1,000 cubic feet, a drop of $1.07 per Mcf or a decline of 44%. 
Realized oil index natural gas process offshore Sarawak fell 14% to an average of $3.29 per Mcf due to the decline in global crude oil prices. With crude oil prices improving during the second quarter of this year compared to the first quarter, the fair value of the company's open crude oil derivative contracts fell. Therefore, overall company revenue in the quarter was reduced by $59 million related to a lower mark-to-market fair value for open crude oil contracts. Although this revenue reduction is recorded in the second quarter, the impacts of the change in the fair value of these open contracts is not reflected in the average realized sales prices reported for the quarter, as here, only the actual cash received on contracts that matured during the period are included in the average realized sales prices. 
Our EBITDA and EBITDAX balances in the second quarter were hurt by well over $3 per barrel for the mark to market decline in crude contract value. 
For the remaining 6 months of 2016, the company has WTI based oil price hedges for 25,000 barrels per day at a WTI average price of $50.67 per barrel. Additionally, the company has forward sales contracts for Canadian natural gas in the amount of 99 million cubic feet a day at an average AECO price of CAD 3 per 1,000 cubic feet over the remainder of '16, and we also have future Canadian gas hedges covering 59 million a day at CAD 2.81 per 1,000 cubic feet for the period of 2017 through 2020. 
At the end of the quarter, June 30, 2016, Murphy's long-term debt amounted to $2.44 billion, which equates to 32% of total capital employed, and net debt amounted to 28.5% of the capital employed. Both gross and net debt ratios were significant improvements from the one quarter earlier. As of quarter-end, we had total cash and invested cash of almost $400 million and no outstanding borrowed balance on our $2 billion revolver that matures in June of 2017. We paid our revolving debt balance off in the second quarter using the combined net cash proceeds of approximately $1.15 billion from the Syncrude and Montney midstream dispositions. The company is working closely with our banking syndicate and expects to reach an agreement in the near term on a new revolving credit facility. 
Concludes my comments. And I'll now pass it over to Roger."

Looking back at the second quarter 2016 is a pivotal quarter for Murphy's. It marked to the continued repositioning of the company. We're able to close our 2 previously announced key divestitures, our interest in Syncrude, as well as our natural gas processing plants and pipelines servicing our Tupper Montney assets. Proceeds amounted to $1.15 billion, as John mentioned. This allowed us to repay all the borrowings under our revolver and retained almost $400 million of cash in the balance sheet. 
As we closed on our new -- we also closed our new North American unconventional play during the Kaybob Duvernay and Placid Montney at a low-cost upfront entry of USD 207 million. The new asset competes well with any recent North American transaction as we're able to acquire a low-cost entry point on any measure of 2P dollar resource or acreage. We believe that our current diversified asset mix is oil weighted [ph] serves as the base in which we'd be able to recalibrate production and respond to possible lower for longer commodity prices. 
During the quarter, we had an exceptionally low capital spend of $108 million, that's primarily due to timing. This does not include the previously mentioned joint venture purchase. This low rate is not indicative of a quarterly run rate, as we do plan to spend $620 million over the course of 2016, as originally planned and announced in February. Also maintain our annual production guidance when adjusted for asset sales and purchases. 
We're also continuing to lowering cost structure. LOE was down 23% from quarter 2 '15, and G&A down approximately 15% from quarter 2 '15 as well. 
Second quarter production, 168,600 BOE per day was slightly lower than our guidance range when adjusted for sales and purchases. As you recall we stated that, there was a planned maintenance across many of our assets, which is common in quarter 2 for our company as well as natural production declines in Eagle Ford Shale as there were no wells planned, nor were any brought-on in the second quarter. 
Further impacting our second quarter production was Divestitures of Syncrude, Wildfires in Western Canada, and other third-party infrastructure and facility curtailments. We expect that our third quarter production to be flat as compared to second quarter with third quarter guidance in the range of 167,500 to 169,500. The guidance takes into account a long planned 10-day turnaround at the Tupper Montney area at over 2,400 barrel oil equivalent per day. 
The capital program for '16, as I mentioned, is maintained at $620 million plus an additional $207 million attributable to our purchase in the Kaybob and Montney areas. Spending for the first half of the year was roughly 40% of our planned annual CapEx. 
Both annual and third quarter production incorporates the production associated with newly acquired joint venture of Kaybob and Placid and divesture of our interest in Syncrude, as previously announced. With these inclusions, our annual guidance range has not been changed. 
Lease operating expense for second quarter '16 was $8.36 per BOE showing a reduction of over 23% from the second quarter of 2015, a reduction of over 9% for the full year of 2015. Our second quarter 2016 LOE was slightly higher than quarter 1 due to production volumes being lower, as I just mentioned. 
All these operating expenses noted here exclude Syncrude. 
We also made good progress in reducing our G&A costs over the past 12 months through strategic restructuring, workforce reductions approximately 35%. Second quarter G&A is approximately 15% from second quarter '15, and more importantly, we've been able to decrease G&A costs by 23% from first quarter 2015 when we began implementing deliberate cost reduction measures. 
We continue to reposition our portfolio. Our current assets are more streamlined and concentrated than when we became an independent E&P company almost 3 years ago. However, remaining true to our history, we're still a global diversified oil-weighted E&P company. We generate stable cash flow from long-lived conventional reserves, primarily in Malaysia that oil-weighted and priced to Brent along with SK Gas price being priced with oil. We have good positions from ground -- grassroots efforts, pardon me, in 3 premier North American unconventional plays that provide us short cycle growth opportunities following our low-cost entry point. We continue to review our portfolio, and we'll act when opportunities present themselves. 
In our offshore Malaysia business, we're producing our 56,000 BOE per day during the quarter, with natural gas production from Sarawak registering 96 million a day. During the third quarter, we are planning a topside installation at South Acis satellite platform. The wells were drilled earlier this year and expected to start producing in the fourth quarter. This topside installation will allow us to maintain our current SK oil production throughout the year at maximum capacity. 
As part of the improved oil recovery project in Kikeh, we installed the surface jet pump system during the quarter. And now with the successful installation of this system resulting enhanced production, we'll be installing our electrical submersible pump later this year. Further, we are planning a long-term Gas Lift project for this field as well. 
In the Gulf of Mexico, production in the second quarter was approximately 16,600 barrel equivalents per day at 83% liquids. The Kodiak well was in production mid-quarter and is currently producing over 12,500 barrel equivalents per day gross. 
Options are currently being evaluated to co-mingle into an upper zone that are expected to further enhance rates as well as an offset well opportunity. This project has been very successful for us. 
Murphy holds a large acreage position in Southern Australia-Ceduna basin, where we have seismic commitments only. Previously, we have acquired and evaluated seismic across to our acreage, and are pleased with the prospects we have seen. We feel this area could be greatly derisked by drilling that will take place in adjacent blocks where BP and Statoil plans to spud the first of 2 wells this fall. 
In Eagle Ford Shale, second quarter production was 47,500 equivalents per day. As planned, there were no new wells brought online this quarter. However, we did complete 8 wells that are online in the current quarter. These wells are completed ahead of plan to synchronize completion schedules with offset operators and acquire the offset wells to be shut in. In addition to these 8 wells, which are now flowing, there are 22 wells currently scheduled to be brought on during the second half of the year, including 2 Austin Chalk wells, 1 in Karnes and the other testing and our most western acreage in Catarina. 
We continue making strides in decreasing drilling and completion costs, as we average $4 million per well across the play, which is 25% below the $5.0 million per well in the second quarter of '15. We still have significant running room ahead for us here, with over 2,000 potential locations in the Eagle Ford Shale. Reserves are oil weighted at roughly 90%. The asset is very meaningful for Murphy's future reserves production cash flow. 
Over the past several months, we followed progress on 2 prior completed Karnes wells employing high concentrations sand fracs, allowing us to use a more aggressive choke technique. We've employed this technique on 4 more wells recently and plan -- and on plan for more in the third quarter. Initial results are impressive, with a 15% higher EUR and 30% higher IP than offset wells. As stated prior, we shut in offset wells during the completion operations. After we brought these offset wells back online, we experienced an uplift in production from those wells. We look forward to bringing you updates as we move this technique across more of Karnes and into our Tilden area and also Catarina areas later this year. 
We're further testing our stacked zone potential to exists across our acreage position. We're testing a new Austin Chalk well along with 3 upper Eagle Ford wells in Karnes, and our latest high concentrations sand completion program. We're also completing a new Austin Chalk well in the Catarina area. 
In Canada, our Tupper Montney asset produced over 197 million a day for the quarter. There were 10 wells brought online during this quarter, including 2 wells that tested extended laterals and increased proppant per lateral foot in the completion phase. These wells are currently cleaning up with encouraging initial results. We look forward to bringing you updates in the third quarter call. 
As stated earlier, we closed the sale of our Montney natural gas processing plants earlier in the quarter. After including the new tariff associated with the sale, we expect well breakeven cost for a 10% return to be USD 1.65 AECO and LOE for the second quarter was $0.63 per Mcf, which includes the new tariff associated with monetizing Montney processing plants and pipeline.
The greatly reduced drilling and completion costs and higher EURs enable us to easily manage the new tariff and take advantage of the monetization by deploying the proceeds into higher returning assets. Returns are further enhanced for the long-term hedging program out to 2020 as part of our ongoing strategy. 
We closed our previously announced joint venture in the Kaybob Duvernay and Placid Montney area in mid-quarter. We're just getting started on our operatorship with the Kaybob asset and moving forward with development plans for the rest of the year and planning 2017. This time, we are completing a 4-well pad in the condensate area of the play and anticipate flowing these wells very late this quarter or early next. 
We are also picking up the rig and planning to drill a 4-well pad in the lateral area in quarter 4 and hope to have 2 wells drilled by year-end. Our plan in the Kaybob area is to increase lateral lengths over time to 9,000 feet and pump fracs 2,000 pounds per foot of sand, which we feel will lead to higher rates in the area of the play and offer upside for Murphy and our partner. 
In the Placid Montney, we're a nonoperating partner with 30% working interest. The current plan is to drill 12 wells this year. Our drilling has already begun. The first padded wells anticipated to flow late this year. 
As we close our call today, some takeaways. Murphy continues with our plan to reposition the company, stabilize production, and ultimately grow production as oil prices recover. We significantly reduced our 2016 capital program to $620 million as previously announced, and have recalibrated our annual production to 173,000 to 177,000 range after accounting for asset mix changes. 
Our key plays continued performing well in Malaysia and especially in North America and conventional onshore assets, where we have significant upside. We remain focused on our cost structure. We're proud of our plan to not issue equity in the price collapse earlier this year and also during this time, we've been able to further strengthen our balance sheet by lowering debt levels. 
I'd now like to open it up for your questions, and thank you."

And we are looking to drill and complete our own wells in the Kaybob, light oil area and the northern condensate area of what we own for around CAD 7.9 million going in as our goal, which is USD 6 million, and we've been really lowering cost in our Montney, which is 60 miles away from here, learned a lot about that, pad drilling, fracking et cetera.

Murphy's consolidated results in the second quarter of 2016 were a profit of $2.9 million, $0.02 per diluted share. The comparative result from the second quarter of 2015 was a net loss of $73.8 million, whi",1328,"Thank you, Kelly, and good afternoon, everyone. Murphy's consolidated results in the second quarter of 2016 were a profit of $2.9 million, $0.02 per diluted share. The comparative result from the second quarter of 2015 was a net loss of $73.8 million, which equates to $0.42 per diluted share. The improvement in 2016 net results included income tax and other benefits on dispositions of 2 former assets, including the company's 5% interest in Syncrude and the midstream gas processing plants that service the Tupper and Tupper West areas in eastern British Columbia. Excluding discontinued operations, continuing operations had a profit in the second quarter of 2016 of $2.9 million as well and $0.02 a share, and that compares to a loss in the second quarter of 2015 from continuing operations of $89 million or $0.51 per diluted share. 
Second quarter results from continuing operations in '16 included net income tax benefits of $88.9 million from sale of Syncrude and Montney midstream assets. These were mostly noncash tax benefits related to reductions and liabilities for future taxes owed on both of these disposed assets. I'll come back to these taxes and discuss them further in a moment. 
Adjusted earnings, which amend our GAAP numbers for various items that affect comparability of results between periods was a loss of $62.4 million in the second quarter '16 compared to an adjusted net loss of $83.1 million a year ago. The improvement in adjusted results in the 2016 quarter was primarily attributable to lower cost for production, exploration and administrative activities, but these were partially offset by significantly lower oil and natural gas sales prices compared to 1 year ago. Our schedule of adjusted earnings is included as part of our earnings release and amounts in this schedule are reported on an after-tax basis with a separate table as to the pretax and income tax impacts by area of operation. 
I now want to discuss further the Canadian transactions in the second quarter. The sale of Montney midstream assets was structured so that no cash taxes will be payable on this transaction. The company had previously recorded deferred tax liabilities for future taxes that were expected to be paid associated with these assets, and due to the structure of the transaction, the previously estimated future taxes will now not be paid so, therefore, in the second quarter, the company reversed these recorded tax liabilities and accordingly recognized the deferred tax benefit of approximately $21 million. 
The Syncrude sale was a taxable transaction, however, it did qualify for capital gain treatment rather than ordinary tax treatment. Therefore, the tax rate was 1/2 of the standard statutory rate and equated to 13.75% rate rather than a normal full rate of 27.5%. The overall net tax benefit of $68 million on the Syncrude disposition was mostly attributable to the reduced capital gain rate applicable to the transaction. Cash taxes applied at capital gains rate to the transaction in the amount of approximately $6 million, while deferred tax benefits were approximately $128 million to reduce future taxes payable, which had previously been accrued at the full tax rate. 
The company completed its entry into the Kaybob Duvernay and liquids-rich Montney areas during the second quarter. The initial spend upon closing the joint venture was $206.7 million plus the company committed approximately another $171 million of future carry for the seller over the next 4 to 5 years of operations. 
The company's cash flow from operations during the second quarter was $70 million. The quarter was impacted by paydown of accounts payable owed to vendors and a semiannual interest owed on outstanding debt borrowings. Since the second quarter was skewed by the timing of these cash payments, I think it is best to look at the 6 months year-to-date for understanding. 
Our first half 2016 cash flow totaled $113 million, and this included payments for canceled Deepwater drilling rig contracts of almost $262 million. In the past years, these costs would have been included as investing activity spend under the category of capital expenditures. However, since the decision was made to cancel these contracts without drilling, these costs have been recorded as cash outflows from operating activities in 2016. 
Looking at the first 6 months without these one-off rig payoffs, operating cash flow would total $375 million and annualizing this amount for a full year for pro forma purposes for 2016, operating cash flow would amount to approximately $750 million over the full 12 months, again, excluding the rig payments. 
The company's second quarter 2016 lease operating expense was lower by approximately $2.50 per barrel of oil equivalent compared to 1 year ago. Beginning in the second quarter of 2016, our average LOE costs include the new tariff associated with Montney area gas plants that were sold. Although these assets were sold above book value, for accounting purposes, the gain has been deferred. Starting in the second quarter 2016, the recorded gas processing cost is reduced to recognize a portion of the deferred gain on the asset sale, and the remainder of this gain will be recognized over the 20-year throughput commitment term. 
The company's second quarter 2016 average realized sales prices for its crude oil production was $44.42 per barrel sold lower by $12 per barrel or 21% compared to the same period in the prior year. 
Natural gas prices also were weaker in quarter 2 compared to the prior year's quarter with average North American gas price realizations of $1.35 per 1,000 cubic feet, a drop of $1.07 per Mcf or a decline of 44%. 
Realized oil index natural gas process offshore Sarawak fell 14% to an average of $3.29 per Mcf due to the decline in global crude oil prices. With crude oil prices improving during the second quarter of this year compared to the first quarter, the fair value of the company's open crude oil derivative contracts fell. Therefore, overall company revenue in the quarter was reduced by $59 million related to a lower mark-to-market fair value for open crude oil contracts. Although this revenue reduction is recorded in the second quarter, the impacts of the change in the fair value of these open contracts is not reflected in the average realized sales prices reported for the quarter, as here, only the actual cash received on contracts that matured during the period are included in the average realized sales prices. 
Our EBITDA and EBITDAX balances in the second quarter were hurt by well over $3 per barrel for the mark to market decline in crude contract value. 
For the remaining 6 months of 2016, the company has WTI based oil price hedges for 25,000 barrels per day at a WTI average price of $50.67 per barrel. Additionally, the company has forward sales contracts for Canadian natural gas in the amount of 99 million cubic feet a day at an average AECO price of CAD 3 per 1,000 cubic feet over the remainder of '16, and we also have future Canadian gas hedges covering 59 million a day at CAD 2.81 per 1,000 cubic feet for the period of 2017 through 2020. 
At the end of the quarter, June 30, 2016, Murphy's long-term debt amounted to $2.44 billion, which equates to 32% of total capital employed, and net debt amounted to 28.5% of the capital employed. Both gross and net debt ratios were significant improvements from the one quarter earlier. As of quarter-end, we had total cash and invested cash of almost $400 million and no outstanding borrowed balance on our $2 billion revolver that matures in June of 2017. We paid our revolving debt balance off in the second quarter using the combined net cash proceeds of approximately $1.15 billion from the Syncrude and Montney midstream dispositions. The company is working closely with our banking syndicate and expects to reach an agreement in the near term on a new revolving credit facility. 
Concludes my comments. And I'll now pass it over to Roger."

Good afternoon, everybody, and thanks for listening to our call today. Looking back at the second quarter 2016 is a pivotal quarter for Murphy's.

Looking back at the second quarter 2016 is a pivotal quarter for Murphy's. It marked to the continued repositioning of the company. We're able to close our 2 previously announced key divestitures, our interest in Syncrude, as well as our natural gas processing plants and pipelines servicing our Tupper Montney assets. Proceeds amounted to $1.15 billion, as John mentioned. This allowed us to repay all the borrowings under our revolver and retained almost $400 million of cash in the balance sheet. 
As we closed on our new -- we also closed our new North American unconventional play during the Kaybob Duvernay and Placid Montney at a low-cost upfront entry of USD 207 million. The new asset competes well with any recent North American transaction as we're able to acquire a low-cost entry point on any measure of 2P dollar resource or acreage. We believe that our current diversified asset mix is oil weighted [ph] serves as the base in which we'd be able to recalibrate production and respond to possible lower for longer commodity prices. 
During the quarter, we had an exceptionally low capital spend of $108 million, that's primarily due to timing. This does not include the previously mentioned joint venture purchase. This low rate is not indicative of a quarterly run rate, as we do plan to spend $620 million over the course of 2016, as originally planned and announced in February. Also maintain our annual production guidance when adjusted for asset sales and purchases. 
We're also continuing to lowering cost structure. LOE was down 23% from quarter 2 '15, and G&A down approximately 15% from quarter 2 '15 as well. 
Second quarter production, 168,600 BOE per day was slightly lower than our guidance range when adjusted for sales and purchases. As you recall we stated that, there was a planned maintenance across many of our assets, which is common in quarter 2 for our company as well as natural production declines in Eagle Ford Shale as there were no wells planned, nor were any brought-on in the second quarter. 
Further impacting our second quarter production was Divestitures of Syncrude, Wildfires in Western Canada, and other third-party infrastructure and facility curtailments. We expect that our third quarter production to be flat as compared to second quarter with third quarter guidance in the range of 167,500 to 169,500. The guidance takes into account a long planned 10-day turnaround at the Tupper Montney area at over 2,400 barrel oil equivalent per day. 
The capital program for '16, as I mentioned, is maintained at $620 million plus an additional $207 million attributable to our purchase in the Kaybob and Montney areas. Spending for the first half of the year was roughly 40% of our planned annual CapEx. 
Both annual and third quarter production incorporates the production associated with newly acquired joint venture of Kaybob and Placid and divesture of our interest in Syncrude, as previously announced. With these inclusions, our annual guidance range has not been changed. 
Lease operating expense for second quarter '16 was $8.36 per BOE showing a reduction of over 23% from the second quarter of 2015, a reduction of over 9% for the full year of 2015. Our second quarter 2016 LOE was slightly higher than quarter 1 due to production volumes being lower, as I just mentioned. 
All these operating expenses noted here exclude Syncrude. 
We also made good progress in reducing our G&A costs over the past 12 months through strategic restructuring, workforce reductions approximately 35%. Second quarter G&A is approximately 15% from second quarter '15, and more importantly, we've been able to decrease G&A costs by 23% from first quarter 2015 when we began implementing deliberate cost reduction measures. 
We continue to reposition our portfolio. Our current assets are more streamlined and concentrated than when we became an independent E&P company almost 3 years ago. However, remaining true to our history, we're still a global diversified oil-weighted E&P company. We generate stable cash flow from long-lived conventional reserves, primarily in Malaysia that oil-weighted and priced to Brent along with SK Gas price being priced with oil. We have good positions from ground -- grassroots efforts, pardon me, in 3 premier North American unconventional plays that provide us short cycle growth opportunities following our low-cost entry point. We continue to review our portfolio, and we'll act when opportunities present themselves. 
In our offshore Malaysia business, we're producing our 56,000 BOE per day during the quarter, with natural gas production from Sarawak registering 96 million a day. During the third quarter, we are planning a topside installation at South Acis satellite platform. The wells were drilled earlier this year and expected to start producing in the fourth quarter. This topside installation will allow us to maintain our current SK oil production throughout the year at maximum capacity. 
As part of the improved oil recovery project in Kikeh, we installed the surface jet pump system during the quarter. And now with the successful installation of this system resulting enhanced production, we'll be installing our electrical submersible pump later this year. Further, we are planning a long-term Gas Lift project for this field as well. 
In the Gulf of Mexico, production in the second quarter was approximately 16,600 barrel equivalents per day at 83% liquids. The Kodiak well was in production mid-quarter and is currently producing over 12,500 barrel equivalents per day gross. 
Options are currently being evaluated to co-mingle into an upper zone that are expected to further enhance rates as well as an offset well opportunity. This project has been very successful for us. 
Murphy holds a large acreage position in Southern Australia-Ceduna basin, where we have seismic commitments only. Previously, we have acquired and evaluated seismic across to our acreage, and are pleased with the prospects we have seen. We feel this area could be greatly derisked by drilling that will take place in adjacent blocks where BP and Statoil plans to spud the first of 2 wells this fall. 
In Eagle Ford Shale, second quarter production was 47,500 equivalents per day. As planned, there were no new wells brought online this quarter. However, we did complete 8 wells that are online in the current quarter. These wells are completed ahead of plan to synchronize completion schedules with offset operators and acquire the offset wells to be shut in. In addition to these 8 wells, which are now flowing, there are 22 wells currently scheduled to be brought on during the second half of the year, including 2 Austin Chalk wells, 1 in Karnes and the other testing and our most western acreage in Catarina. 
We continue making strides in decreasing drilling and completion costs, as we average $4 million per well across the play, which is 25% below the $5.0 million per well in the second quarter of '15. We still have significant running room ahead for us here, with over 2,000 potential locations in the Eagle Ford Shale. Reserves are oil weighted at roughly 90%. The asset is very meaningful for Murphy's future reserves production cash flow. 
Over the past several months, we followed progress on 2 prior completed Karnes wells employing high concentrations sand fracs, allowing us to use a more aggressive choke technique. We've employed this technique on 4 more wells recently and plan -- and on plan for more in the third quarter. Initial results are impressive, with a 15% higher EUR and 30% higher IP than offset wells. As stated prior, we shut in offset wells during the completion operations. After we brought these offset wells back online, we experienced an uplift in production from those wells. We look forward to bringing you updates as we move this technique across more of Karnes and into our Tilden area and also Catarina areas later this year. 
We're further testing our stacked zone potential to exists across our acreage position. We're testing a new Austin Chalk well along with 3 upper Eagle Ford wells in Karnes, and our latest high concentrations sand completion program. We're also completing a new Austin Chalk well in the Catarina area. 
In Canada, our Tupper Montney asset produced over 197 million a day for the quarter. There were 10 wells brought online during this quarter, including 2 wells that tested extended laterals and increased proppant per lateral foot in the completion phase. These wells are currently cleaning up with encouraging initial results. We look forward to bringing you updates in the third quarter call. 
As stated earlier, we closed the sale of our Montney natural gas processing plants earlier in the quarter. After including the new tariff associated with the sale, we expect well breakeven cost for a 10% return to be USD 1.65 AECO and LOE for the second quarter was $0.63 per Mcf, which includes the new tariff associated with monetizing Montney processing plants and pipeline.
The greatly reduced drilling and completion costs and higher EURs enable us to easily manage the new tariff and take advantage of the monetization by deploying the proceeds into higher returning assets. Returns are further enhanced for the long-term hedging program out to 2020 as part of our ongoing strategy. 
We closed our previously announced joint venture in the Kaybob Duvernay and Placid Montney area in mid-quarter. We're just getting started on our operatorship with the Kaybob asset and moving forward with development plans for the rest of the year and planning 2017. This time, we are completing a 4-well pad in the condensate area of the play and anticipate flowing these wells very late this quarter or early next. 
We are also picking up the rig and planning to drill a 4-well pad in the lateral area in quarter 4 and hope to have 2 wells drilled by year-end. Our plan in the Kaybob area is to increase lateral lengths over time to 9,000 feet and pump fracs 2,000 pounds per foot of sand, which we feel will lead to higher rates in the area of the play and offer upside for Murphy and our partner. 
In the Placid Montney, we're a nonoperating partner with 30% working interest. The current plan is to drill 12 wells this year. Our drilling has already begun. The first padded wells anticipated to flow late this year. 
As we close our call today, some takeaways. Murphy continues with our plan to reposition the company, stabilize production, and ultimately grow production as oil prices recover. We significantly reduced our 2016 capital program to $620 million as previously announced, and have recalibrated our annual production to 173,000 to 177,000 range after accounting for asset mix changes. 
Our key plays continued performing well in Malaysia and especially in North America and conventional onshore assets, where we have significant upside. We remain focused on our cost structure. We're proud of our plan to not issue equity in the price collapse earlier this year and also during this time, we've been able to further strengthen our balance sheet by lowering debt levels. 
I'd now like to open it up for your questions, and thank you."

Again, subject to whatever prices do to us and maybe they won't hold up very well, but we'll see. But interest -- for example, interest in the second quarter was $40 million that we paid on our notes. So it's -- that comes in lump -- in a lumpy fashion because we pay at semiannually instead of monthly or quarterly. So the things of that nature, $10 million -- $9 million plus worth of restructuring costs and things of that nature that were paid this quarter."

Murphy's consolidated results in the third quarter of 2016 were a net loss of $16.2 million or $0.09 per diluted share. The comparative result from the same quarter in 2015 was a net loss of $1.6 million [ph] or $9.26 per diluted share. Prior year quarter included a pretax impairment charge of $2.3 million [ph] associated with oil prices that were weakening a year ago. Excluding the impairment in the prior year, operating results in the 2016 third quarter were improved compared to 2015 due to lower operating expenses and lower administrative expenses that more than offset lower oil and gas sales prices.
Excluding discontinued operations, continuing operations had a net loss of $14.6 million in the third quarter or $0.08 per diluted share.
Adjusted earnings, which normalize our quarterly results for various items that affect comparability between periods, was a net loss of $31.7 million in the third quarter of 2016 compared to an adjusted net loss of $124.5 million a year ago. This improvement in adjusted results in the 2016 quarter was primarily attributable to lower cost per production, exploration and administrative activities, but these were partially offset by somewhat lower oil and natural gas sales prices compared to last year.
Our third quarter 2016 lease operating expense, excluding Syncrude, [ph] which has been sold, was lower by approximately $0.44 per barrel of oil equivalent compared to a year ago. We have continued to bring down our operating cost due to efficiency improvements, aggressive rebidding of services and onetime benefits from operated and nonoperated field.
Our third quarter 2016 average realized sales price for crude oil production was $44.64 per barrel sold, and that's 3% lower than the same period in the prior year. Natural gas prices also were weaker in quarter 3 compared to the prior year's quarter with average North American gas price realizations of $1.96 per thousand cubic feet, a drop of $0.46 per Mcf or a decline of 19%.
Realized oil index natural gas prices offshore Sarawak [ph] fell 20% to an average of $3.01 per Mcf due to decline in global crude oil prices between periods.
For the remaining 3 months of 2016, we have WTI-based oil sales contracts hedged [ph] 25,000 barrels per day at a WTI average fixed price of $50.67 per barrel. Additionally, we have forward sales contracts for Canadian natural gas in the amount of 99 million cubic feet per day at an average AECO [ph] fixed price of CAD 3 per thousand feet over the remainder of 2016.
For subsequent years, we also have WTI contracts for 18,000 barrels per day in 2017 at an average price of $50.66 per barrel. Plus we have Canadian gas forward sales contracts covering 99 million cubic feet a day at CAD 2.89 per thousand cubic feet for 2017 plus 59 million cubic feet a day at CAD 2.81 for 2018 through 2020.
As previously announced, in the third quarter, we reduced our quarterly dividend from $0.35 per share to $0.25 per share, thereby reducing our annualized distribution by approximately $69 million per year.
At September 30, 2016, Murphy's long-term debt amounted to $2.97 billion [ph], representing 36.9% of total capital employed.
Excluding capital leases, total debt was $2.8 billion. Net debt at the quarter end amounted to 29.5%.
Also as of quarter end, we had total cash and invested cash of $871 million and no outstanding borrowed balance on our revolving credit facilities, providing us ample liquidity for the future.
We currently anticipate that fourth quarter oil sales volumes will be approximately 13,000 barrels per day below our average daily production. This is due to the periodic timing of offshore oil listings primarily for our operations in Malaysia. The lifting schedule calls for 4 liftings [ph] from offshore storage facilities during the first week of January, 3 of these occur in the first 2 days of the new year, and these account for the noted reduction in sales volumes in the fourth quarter compared to production.
In August, we successfully completed a new $1.2 billion 3-year unsecured credit facility and also issued $550 million of 8-year notes at a coupon rate of 6.875%, with these notes maturing in 2024. Further details regarding these financial transactions might be found in our 8-K reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on August 12 and August 17.
And that concludes my comments. I'd like now to turn it back over to Roger."
290060,403981256,1063620,"Murphy Oil Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2016",2016-10-27,"Earnings Calls","Murphy Oil Corporation","Executives","Thank you, John, and good afternoon everybody, and thanks for listening to our call today. We had a solid quarter operationally across our business. Our legacy offshore business achieved just over $30 per BOE cash margin, and our onshore business achieved",1990,"Thank you, John, and good afternoon everybody, and thanks for listening to our call today. We had a solid quarter operationally across our business. Our legacy offshore business achieved just over $30 per BOE cash margin, and our onshore business achieved continued success in pulling [indiscernible] concentration fracs in the Eagle Ford Shale and Tupper Montney. [ph] Furthermore, we brought on our first 4 well pad in our new Kaybob Duvernay [ph] asset and are encouraged by the early results.
On the expense side, we continued lowering our cost structure. In the quarter, our capital expenditures were $172 million and year-to-date are $429 million, in line with our 2016 previously announced capital expenditure program of $620 million.
As John mentioned, we also successfully obtained our new [ph] unsecured revolver and issued a new bond, which allows for continued flexibility, ample liquidity and continued preservation of our balance sheet. We also adjusted our dividend while remaining top quartile dividend yield. We believe there are current diversified oil-weighted asset mix such as foundation [ph] which we'll be able to recalibrate production, forming a new base in which to grow in the future.
Third quarter production is just over 169,800 barrel equivalents per day, which exceeded the high end of our production guidance. The higher third quarter production is largely attributable to better-than-planned performance and facility uptime in Sabah, Malaysia [ph] as well as offshore Canada and the Gulf of Mexico. We expect our fourth quarter production will be in the range of 162,000 to 164,000-barrel equivalents a day. Our fourth quarter guidance takes into account the following: a planned 10-day shut in [ph] at Kikeh [indiscernible] north [indiscernible] fields in Malaysia; and also in Malaysia, a planned 2-day shut in at our Sarawak oil and gas [ph] field, where we changes out [ph] our field-based FPSO. [ph] These 2 major shut-ins account for nearly 5,000 barrel equivalents of production this quarter of [ph] downtime and risk well recovery. Both of these major shut-ins have now been completed on time, and we're very pleased with the recovery, especially in the Kikeh wells and the facility following the first major shut-in in the field's 9-year history. As expected, we will have some fuel decline impact [ph] small field shut in across our business as well as positive production impacts in our Canadian business from quarter-to-quarter.
The capital program for 2016 is maintained at $620, as I've just said. However, there's a change in allocation as more capital is being allocated toward our Eagle Ford Shale business at the end of the year, where we place additional wells online.
The fourth quarter production guidance is 162 to 164 due to impacts of our shut-ins as I previously discussed, and our annual production range has been tightened to 174,000 to 175,000 equivalents per day, within guidance, post divestitures and proceeds announced earlier this year. Our lease operating expense for the first 9 months of '16 is 7 83 per BOE, showing an 18% reduction same period a year ago. Our Quarter 3 LOE was $7.65 as compared to $8.09 per BOE in quarter 3 '15. All LOE expenses noted exclude Syncrude. 
We also made good progress and the team reduced our G&A cost over the year. Third quarter G&A is down approximately 24% from the first quarter of '16. More importantly, we've been able to decrease G&A about 36% from the first quarter of 2015 when we began implementing deliberate cost reduction measures. 
Our current assets are more Streamlining concentrating when became an independent E&P company 3 years ago. However, remaining true to our strategy, we'll still maintain a global diversified oil weighted E&P company. We build positions from grassroots efforts in 3 premier North American unconventional plays that provide short cycle growth opportunities following our low cost entry points. We continue to review our portfolio, and we'll act when opportunities present themselves.
We generate free cash flow from our long list of [ph] offshore conventional fields that are all [ph] weighted and priced to Brent.
In our offshore Malaysia business, we produced over 39,000 barrels of liquids per day during the quarter, with natural gas production from Sarawak at 116 million a day. We successfully installed a second platform in our South Acis [ph] field as part of the original fuel [ph] development plan. The resource size of the field is doubled since it came online in December of '13. As part of the improvement of the oil recovery project at Kikeh, we installed a surface jet pump system, which is in the first -- which is our first of 3 planned improved [ph] oil recovery projects for the field. Over the course of the next couple of years, we're going to install an electrical [ph] submersible pump followed by a gas lift [ph] project on our Kikeh Start. [ph] 
In the Gulf of Mexico and East Coast Canada, production for the third quarter was 25,000-barrel equivalents per day at 89% liquids. Subsequent to quarter-end, the Kodiak field [ph] received gain -- Kodiak field recently gained approval to comingle production between reservoirs and [ph] expecting additional zone to be online by year-end.
We've maintained our offshore capabilities and continued its focused evaluation in the Gulf of Mexico, [indiscernible] and basins of Australia, Malaysia and Vietnam. We believe that our offshore execution abilities serve as competitive advantage allow [ph] for assessment and entry into discovered resource opportunities that we could access through expanding alliances with other operators.
In the Eagle Ford Shale, third quarter production was just over 46,000-barrel equivalents per day [ph] comprised of 87% liquids. The 23 new wells brought online in the quarter included 2 in Austin Chalk [ph] and 4 Upper Eagle Ford [ph] wells. In the fourth quarter, the company expects to bring online 17 wells, including 2 Austin Chalk wells and 2 Upper Eagle Ford wells.
The fourth quarter online wells [ph] increased of 10 from previous guidance, with the majority planned for very late in the quarter. Due to timing, they will have minimal impact on 2016 production.
We continue making strides in decreasing drilling and completion costs as we average $4.3 million per well across the entire play, which is 18% below the $5.3 million per well in the third quarter of '15. We drilled pacesetter [ph] wells in both our Karnes and Catarina [ph] areas. The spudded TD [ph] for Karnes is 7.9 days versus 13 in 2015, a 39% reduction. In Catarina, it was 7.3 versus 9.3 in 2015, a 21% reduction. We still have significant running room ahead for us there with over 2,000 potential Eagle Ford Shale locations. Our reserves are all weighted at roughly 9%. This asset is very meaningful to Murphy's future reserves [ph] production and cash flow.
We've continued to employ sand [ph] concentration fracs over this last quarter, which have continued to yield higher [indiscernible] rates and enhanced tight curves. In our Karnes area, [indiscernible] rates have been up to 50% higher. We've seen 1 year [indiscernible] rates over 35% higher in our older vintage wells.
In our Catarina area, [indiscernible] rates have exceeded the type curve by up to 17%. We're now forecasting increased EURs [ph] of high sand [ph] concentration fracs and are in the evaluation phase as to the EUR increases.
In the quarter, we completed our second Austin Chalk well in the [indiscernible] boundaries. The Austin Chalk was source. [ph] And the first Austin Chalk well is completed in what I'd describe as a wildcat test in our Catarina areas. [ph] Both wells are flowing and still in the clean up phase, and we'll bring more information [ph] on our fourth quarter call.
In Canada, our Tupper Montney asset produced about 119 million a day for the third quarter. We are pleased with the performance of our recent extended lateral high sand concentration wells that were brought online in the second quarter. Results [ph] are compelling and are trending toward our 10 to 14 Bcf type curve.
These results, coupled with our continued lower drilling and completion cost, continued to support our ongoing field [ph] development plan. We've reduced our drilling days and [ph] cost in the Montney by approximately 30% since 2014. As John spoke earlier, we are taking on additional hedges for 2017 through 2020 as part of our strategy to lock in the terms given our low breakeven in PV at natural gas prices of CAD 2.10.
In the Kaybob Duvernay and Placid Montney, [ph] production's over 3,100 equivalents for the quarter at 44% liquids. In Kaybob Duvernay, our 4 well pad was brought online in [ph] the gas condensate area during the quarter and [ph] previously drilled by our partner. 2 of these wells have an average effective lateral length of 4,150 feet, and the other 2 have an effective lateral length of 2,665 feet. While these lateral lengths are well below our future development plan, the pad is flowing in excess of 2,100 barrel equivalents per day with nearly 70% liquids after flowing for only 40 days utilizing our conservative choke management approach. Initial result was encouraging as the wells are trending [ph] along the type curve and accounting through [ph] effective lateral length.
With the 2 varying exposed stimulator horizontal [ph] sections we can tie lateral length to full [ph] performance. We've been very impressed with the condensate to gas ratio as the wells are maintained at stabilized CGR of near 500, which is higher-than-average length [ph] number. We further expect that as we move up the learning curve in this play, we will continue to refine completion techniques based on the first operated production Globex.[ph]
We're [ph] drilling our first operated new 2-well pad in the fourth quarter in the gas condensate region with production online in the first quarter of next year. Drilling and completion costs for this 2 well pad are expected to be $5.6 million per well. The average lateral length for these wells is near 4,500 feet, and we're previously permitted by our partner and are [ph] limited by lease boundary shape. We'll be implementing a similar completion design that [ph] has done in Eagle Ford Shale, which includes pumping fracs of 2,000 pounds per foot.
Moving forward, we are working a plan in the Kaybob [ph] area to increase lateral lengths to over 9,000 feet, and we [ph] continue to pump fracs at 2,000 pounds per foot and tweak spacing of stages, et cetera, which will lead to higher rates in this area of the play and offer upside for Murphy. Over time, we've been very successful at lowering our drilling and completion costs in Eagle Ford and Montney and expect we'll do the same in the Duvernay play over time.
In our nonoperated Placid Montney, 4 wells were drilled and 8 more are planned for this winter. 4 of these wells will be completed late in the year and the remainder online in 2017.
As we close our call today, some takeaways. We're pleased with our overall results this year. As we move forward, we're focused on continuing well efficiencies, improving cost structure and preserving our balance sheet. Our high cash margin offshore assets provide the cash flow required to ramp up our new unconventional assets in the Duvernay as well as unlocking value in our Eagle Ford Shale and Montney businesses. As you can appreciate, oil and gas price have been very volatile over the past 2 years. However, we believe prices are stabilizing. We're in the middle of our internal budgeting process with the goal of maintaining cash flow neutrality, including our dividend. We have many great opportunities across our assets as we do every year, and we'll be releasing our 2017 guidance and CapEx in late January. We look forward to discussing those with you at that time.
This concludes our opening remarks. I'd like to open it up for your usual questions, and we'll go from there. Thank you."

Murphy's consolidated results in the third quarter of 2016 were a net loss of $16.2 million or $0.09 per diluted share. The comparative result from the same quarter in 2015 was a net loss of $1",744,"Thank you, Kelly, and good afternoon to everyone on the call. Murphy's consolidated results in the third quarter of 2016 were a net loss of $16.2 million or $0.09 per diluted share. The comparative result from the same quarter in 2015 was a net loss of $1.6 billion or $9.26 per diluted share. Prior year quarter included a pretax impairment charge of $2.3 billion associated with oil prices that were weakening a year ago. Excluding the impairment in the prior year, operating results in the 2016 third quarter were improved compared to 2015 due to lower operating expenses and lower administrative expenses that more than offset lower oil and gas sales prices.
Excluding discontinued operations, continuing operations had a net loss of $14.6 million in the third quarter or $0.08 per diluted share.
Adjusted earnings, which normalize our quarterly results for various items that affect comparability between periods, was a net loss of $31.7 million in the third quarter of 2016 compared to an adjusted net loss of $124.5 million a year ago. This improvement in adjusted results in the 2016 quarter was primarily attributable to lower cost per production, exploration and administrative activities, but these were partially offset by somewhat lower oil and natural gas sales prices compared to last year.
Our third quarter 2016 lease operating expense, excluding Syncrude, which has been sold, was lower by approximately $0.44 per barrel of oil equivalent compared to a year ago. We have continued to bring down our operating cost due to efficiency improvements, aggressive rebidding of services and onetime benefits from operated and nonoperated field.
Our third quarter 2016 average realized sales price for crude oil production was $44.64 per barrel sold, and that's 3% lower than the same period in the prior year. Natural gas prices also were weaker in quarter 3 compared to the prior year's quarter with average North American gas price realizations of $1.96 per thousand cubic feet, a drop of $0.46 per Mcf or a decline of 19%.
Realized oil index natural gas prices offshore Sarawak fell 20% to an average of $3.01 per Mcf due to decline in global crude oil prices between periods.
For the remaining 3 months of 2016, we have WTI-based oil sales contracts that hedged 25,000 barrels per day at a WTI average fixed price of $50.67 per barrel. Additionally, we have forward sales contracts for Canadian natural gas in the amount of 99 million cubic feet per day at an average AECO fixed price of CAD 3 per thousand feet over the remainder of 2016.
For subsequent years, we also have WTI contracts for 18,000 barrels per day in 2017 at an average price of $50.66 per barrel. Plus we have Canadian gas forward sales contracts covering 99 million cubic feet a day at CAD 2.89 per thousand cubic feet for 2017 plus 59 million cubic feet a day at CAD 2.81 for 2018 through 2020.
As previously announced, in the third quarter, we reduced our quarterly dividend from $0.35 per share to $0.25 per share, thereby reducing our annualized distribution by approximately $69 million per year.
At September 30, 2016, Murphy's long-term debt amounted to $2.97 billion, representing 36.9% of total capital employed.
Excluding capital leases, total debt was $2.8 billion. Net debt at the quarter end amounted to 29.5%.
Also as of quarter end, we had total cash and invested cash of $871 million and no outstanding borrowed balance on our revolving credit facilities, providing us ample liquidity for the future.
We currently anticipate that fourth quarter oil sales volumes will be approximately 13,000 barrels per day below our average daily production. This is due to the periodic timing of offshore oil listings primarily for our operations in Malaysia. The lifting schedule calls for 4 liftings from offshore storage facilities during the first week of January, 3 of these occur in the first 2 days of the new year, and these account for the noted reduction in sales volumes in the fourth quarter compared to production.
In August, we successfully completed a new $1.2 billion 3-year unsecured credit facility and also issued $550 million of 8-year notes at a coupon rate of 6.875%, with these notes maturing in 2024. Further details regarding these financial transactions might be found in our 8-K reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on August 12 and August 17.
And that concludes my comments. I'd like now to turn it back over to Roger."
290060,403981256,1063989,"Murphy Oil Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2016",2016-10-27,"Earnings Calls","Murphy Oil Corporation","Executives","Thank you, John, and good afternoon everybody, and thanks for listening to our call today. We had a solid quarter operationally across our business. Our legacy offshore business achieved just over $30 per BOE cash margin, and our onshore business achieved",1948,"Thank you, John, and good afternoon everybody, and thanks for listening to our call today. We had a solid quarter operationally across our business. Our legacy offshore business achieved just over $30 per BOE cash margin, and our onshore business achieved continued success in pulling high sand concentration fracs in the Eagle Ford Shale and Tupper Montney. Furthermore, we brought on our first 4 well pad in our new Kaybob Duvernay asset and are encouraged by the early results.
On the expense side, we continued lowering our cost structure. In the quarter, our capital expenditures were $172 million and year-to-date are $429 million, in line with our 2016 previously announced capital expenditure program of $620 million.
As John mentioned, we also successfully obtained our new unsecured revolver and issued a new bond, which allows for continued flexibility, ample liquidity and continued preservation of our balance sheet. We also adjusted our dividend while remaining top quartile dividend yield. We believe there are current diversified oil-weighted asset mix such as the foundation which we'll be able to recalibrate production, forming a new base in which to grow in the future.
Third quarter production is just over 169,800 barrel equivalents per day, which exceeded the high end of our production guidance. The higher third quarter production is largely attributable to better-than-planned performance and facility uptime in Sabah, Malaysia as well as offshore Canada and the Gulf of Mexico. We expect our fourth quarter production will be in the range of 162,000 to 164,000-barrel equivalents a day. Our fourth quarter guidance takes into account the following: a planned 10-day shut in at Kikeh and Siakap North Petai fields in Malaysia; and also in Malaysia, a planned 2-day shut in at our Sarawak oil and gas field, where we change out our field-based FSO. These 2 major shut-ins account for nearly 5,000 barrel equivalents of production this quarter from downtime and risk well recovery. Both of these major shut-ins have now been completed on time, and we're very pleased with the recovery, especially in the Kikeh wells and the facility following the first major shut-in in the field's 9-year history. As expected, we will have some fuel decline back impact and small field shut-in across our business as well as positive production impacts in our Canadian business from quarter-to-quarter.
The capital program for 2016 is maintained at $620, as I've just said. However, there's a change in allocation as more capital is being allocated toward our Eagle Ford Shale business at the end of the year, where we place additional wells online.
The fourth quarter production guidance is 162 to 164 due to impacts of our shut-ins as I previously discussed, and our annual production range has been tightened to 174,000 to 175,000 equivalents per day within guidance, post divestitures and purchases announced earlier this year. Our lease operating expense for the first 9 months of '16 is $7.83 per BOE, showing an 18% reduction from the same period a year ago. Our quarter 3 LOE was $7.65 as compared to $8.09 per BOE in quarter 3 '15. All LOE expenses noted exclude Syncrude. We also made good progress, and the team reduced our G&A cost over the year. Third quarter G&A is down approximately 24% from the first quarter of '16. More importantly, we've been able to decrease G&A about 36% from the first quarter of 2015 when we began implementing deliberate cost reduction measures.
Our current assets are more streamlined and concentrated when we became an independent E&P company 3 years ago. However, remaining true to our strategy, we'll still maintain a global diversified oil-weighted E&P company. We build positions from grassroots efforts in 3 premier North American unconventional plays that provide short cycle growth opportunities following our low cost entry points. We continue to review our portfolio, and we'll act when opportunities present themselves.
We generate free cash flow from our long-lived offshore conventional fields that are oil-weighted and priced to Brent.
In our offshore Malaysia business, we produced over 39,000 barrels of liquids per day during the quarter, with natural gas production from Sarawak at 116 million a day. We successfully installed a second platform in our South Acis field as part of the original field development plan. The resource size of the field is doubled since it came online in December of '13. As part of the improvement of the oil recovery project at Kikeh, we installed a surface jet pump system, which is in the first -- which is our first of 3 planned improved oil recovery projects for the field. Over the course of the next couple of years, we're going to install an electrical submersible pump followed by a gas lift project on our Kikeh spar. 
In the Gulf of Mexico and East Coast Canada, production for the third quarter was 25,000-barrel equivalents per day at 89% liquids. Subsequent to quarter-end, the Kodiak field received gain -- Kodiak field recently gained approval to comingle production between reservoirs and expecting additional zone to be online by year-end.
We've maintained our offshore capabilities and continued its focused evaluation in the Gulf of Mexico, Vulcan and Ceduna basins of Australia, Malaysia and Vietnam. We believe that our offshore execution abilities serve as competitive advantage and allow for assessment and entry into discovered resource opportunities that we could access through expanding alliances with other operators.
The Eagle Ford Shale third quarter production result was just over 46,000-barrel equivalents today comprised of 87% liquids. The 23 new wells brought online in the quarter included 2 in Austin Chalk and 4 Upper Eagle Ford wells. In the fourth quarter, the company expects to bring online 17 wells, including 2 Austin Chalk wells and 2 Upper Eagle Ford wells.
The fourth quarter online wells is an increase of 10 from previous guidance, with the majority planned for very late in the quarter. Due to timing, they will have minimal impact on 2016 production.
We continue making strides in decreasing drilling and completion costs as we average $4.3 million per well across the entire play, which is 18% below the $5.3 million per well in the third quarter of '15. We drilled pacesetter wells in both our Karnes and Catarina areas. The spud-to-TD for Karnes is 7.9 days versus 13 in 2015, a 39% reduction. In Catarina, it was 7.3 versus 9.3 in 2015, a 21% reduction. We still have significant running room ahead for us there with over 2,000 potential Eagle Ford Shale locations. Our reserves are oil-weighted at roughly 9%. This asset is very meaningful to Murphy's future reserves production and cash flow.
We've continued to employ high sand concentration fracs over this last quarter, which have continued to yield higher IP rates and enhanced type curves. In our Karnes area, recent IP rates have been up to 50% higher. We've seen 1 year cumulative oil rates over 35% higher in our older vintage wells.
In our Catarina area, recent IP30 rates have exceeded the type curve by up to 17%. We're now forecasting increased EURs of high sand concentration fracs and are in the evaluation phase as to the EUR increases.
In the quarter, we completed our second Austin Chalk well in the Karnes area and tested boundaries, the Austin Chalk resource. And the first Austin Chalk well is completed in what I'd describe as a wildcat test in our Catarina areas. Both wells are flowing and still in the clean up phase, and we'll bring more information on our fourth quarter call.
In Canada, our Tupper Montney asset produced about 119 million a day for the third quarter. We are pleased with the performance of our recent extended lateral high sand concentration wells that were brought online in the second quarter. Results are compelling and are trending toward our 10 to 14 Bcf type curve.
These results, coupled with our continued lower drilling and completion cost, continued to support our ongoing field development plan. We've reduced our drilling days and cost in the Montney by approximately 30% since 2014. As John spoke earlier, we are taking on additional hedges for 2017 through 2020 as part of our strategy to lock in the terms given our low breakeven NPV at natural gas prices of CAD 2.10.
In the Kaybob Duvernay and Placid Montney, production's over 3,100 equivalents for the quarter at 44% liquids. In Kaybob Duvernay, our 4 well pad was brought online in the gas condensate area during the quarter and was previously drilled by our partner. 2 of these wells have an average effective lateral length of 4,150 feet, and the other 2 have an effective lateral length of 2,665 feet. While these lateral lengths are well below our future development plan, the pad is flowing in excess of 2,100 barrel equivalents per day with nearly 70% liquids after flowing for only 40 days utilizing our conservative choke management approach. Initial result was encouraging as the wells are trending along the tight curve and accounting through effective lateral length.
With the 2 varying exposed stimulator horizontal sections, we can tie lateral length to flow performance. We've been very impressed with the condensate to gas ratio as the wells are maintained at stabilized CGR of near 500, which is higher-than-average length number. We further expect that as we move up the learning curve in this play, we will continue to refine completion techniques based on the first operated production flowbacks.
We'd be drilling our first operated new 2-well pad in the fourth quarter in the gas condensate region with production online in the first quarter of next year. Drilling and completion costs for this 2 well pad are expected to be $5.6 million per well. The average lateral length for these wells is near 4,500 feet, and we're previously permitted by our partner and limited by lease boundary shape. We'll be implementing a similar completion design we have done in Eagle Ford Shale, which includes pumping fracs of 2,000 pounds per foot.
Moving forward, we are working a plan in the Kaybob area to increase lateral lengths to over 9,000 feet, and we continue to pump fracs at 2,000 pounds per foot and tweak spacing of stages, et cetera, which will lead to higher rates in this area of the play and offer upside for Murphy. Over time, we've been very successful at lowering our drilling and completion costs in Eagle Ford and Montney and expect we'll do the same in the Duvernay play over time.
In our nonoperated Placid Montney, 4 wells were drilled and 8 more are planned for this winter. 4 of these wells will be completed late in the year and the remainder online in 2017.
As we close our call today, some takeaways. We're pleased with our overall results this year. As we move forward, we're focused on continuing well efficiencies, improving cost structure and preserving our balance sheet. Our high cash margin offshore assets provide the cash flow required to ramp up our new unconventional assets in the Duvernay as well as unlocking value in our Eagle Ford Shale and Montney businesses. As you can appreciate, oil and gas price have been very volatile over the past 2 years. However, we believe prices are stabilizing. We're in the middle of our internal budgeting process with the goal of maintaining cash flow neutrality, including our dividend. We have many great opportunities across our assets as we do every year, and we'll be releasing our 2017 guidance and CapEx in late January. We look forward to discussing those with you at that time.
This concludes our opening remarks. I'd like to open it up for your usual questions, and we'll go from there. Thank you."

So working on that. It's a tough call, but we're going to be spending capital in all 3 of those areas to both delineate and be able to production primarily for 2018 of that asset, Paul."

But we have an ability to move capital around for different production areas back to Ryan's question a few minutes ago. And that would be about the same as in the past. And it gets back into working on our budget and what we wanted to about the new unconventional asset and high rate of returns, specific projects in the offshore, which are not enormous capital, but every capital amount is precious now more than ever before. So that 8.50, 9.50 that I said in the past is maintained in my view."

Murphy's consolidated results in the third quarter of 2016 were a net loss of $16.2 million or $0.09 per diluted share. The comparative result from the same quarter in 2015 was a net loss of $1",744,"Thank you, Kelly, and good afternoon to everyone on the call. Murphy's consolidated results in the third quarter of 2016 were a net loss of $16.2 million or $0.09 per diluted share. The comparative result from the same quarter in 2015 was a net loss of $1.6 billion or $9.26 per diluted share. Prior year quarter included a pretax impairment charge of $2.3 billion associated with oil prices that were weakening a year ago. Excluding the impairment in the prior year, operating results in the 2016 third quarter were improved compared to 2015 due to lower operating expenses and lower administrative expenses that more than offset lower oil and gas sales prices.
Excluding discontinued operations, continuing operations had a net loss of $14.6 million in the third quarter or $0.08 per diluted share.
Adjusted earnings, which normalize our quarterly results for various items that affect comparability between periods, was a net loss of $31.7 million in the third quarter of 2016 compared to an adjusted net loss of $124.5 million a year ago. This improvement in adjusted results in the 2016 quarter was primarily attributable to lower cost per production, exploration and administrative activities, but these were partially offset by somewhat lower oil and natural gas sales prices compared to last year.
Our third quarter 2016 lease operating expense, excluding Syncrude, which has been sold, was lower by approximately $0.44 per barrel of oil equivalent compared to a year ago. We have continued to bring down our operating cost due to efficiency improvements, aggressive rebidding of services and onetime benefits from operated and nonoperated fields.
Our third quarter 2016 average realized sales price for crude oil production was $44.64 per barrel sold, and that's 3% lower than the same period in the prior year. Natural gas prices also were weaker in quarter 3 compared to the prior year's quarter with average North American gas price realizations of $1.96 per thousand cubic feet, a drop of $0.46 per Mcf or a decline of 19%.
Realized oil index natural gas prices offshore Sarawak fell 20% to an average of $3.01 per Mcf due to decline in global crude oil prices between periods.
For the remaining 3 months of 2016, we have WTI-based oil sales contracts that hedged 25,000 barrels per day at a WTI average fixed price of $50.67 per barrel. Additionally, we have forward sales contracts for Canadian natural gas in the amount of 99 million cubic feet per day at an average AECO fixed price of CAD 3 per thousand feet over the remainder of 2016.
For subsequent years, we also have WTI contracts for 18,000 barrels per day in 2017 at an average price of $50.66 per barrel. Plus we have Canadian gas forward sales contracts covering 99 million cubic feet a day at CAD 2.89 per thousand cubic feet for 2017 plus 59 million cubic feet a day at CAD 2.81 for 2018 through 2020.
As previously announced, in the third quarter, we reduced our quarterly dividend from $0.35 per share to $0.25 per share, thereby reducing our annualized distribution by approximately $69 million per year.
At September 30, 2016, Murphy's long-term debt amounted to $2.97 billion, representing 36.9% of total capital employed.
Excluding capital leases, total debt was $2.8 billion. Net debt at the quarter end amounted to 29.5%.
Also as of quarter end, we had total cash and invested cash of $871 million and no outstanding borrowed balance on our revolving credit facilities, providing us ample liquidity for the future.
We currently anticipate that fourth quarter oil sales volumes will be approximately 13,000 barrels per day below our average daily production. This is due to the periodic timing of offshore oil listings primarily for our operations in Malaysia. The lifting schedule calls for 4 liftings from offshore storage facilities during the first week of January, 3 of these occur in the first 2 days of the new year, and these account for the noted reduction in sales volumes in the fourth quarter compared to production.
In August, we successfully completed a new $1.2 billion 3-year unsecured credit facility and also issued $550 million of 8-year notes at a coupon rate of 6.875%, with these notes maturing in 2024. Further details regarding these financial transactions may be found in our 8-K reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on August 12 and August 17.
And that concludes my comments. I'd like now to turn it back over to Roger."
290060,403981256,1064304,"Murphy Oil Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2016",2016-10-27,"Earnings Calls","Murphy Oil Corporation","Executives","Thank you, John, and good afternoon everybody, and thanks for listening to our call today. We had a solid quarter operationally across our business. Our legacy offshore fields achieved just over $30 per BOE cash margin, and our onshore business achieved c",1957,"Thank you, John, and good afternoon everybody, and thanks for listening to our call today. We had a solid quarter operationally across our business. Our legacy offshore fields achieved just over $30 per BOE cash margin, and our onshore business achieved continued success in pulling high sand concentration fracs in the Eagle Ford Shale and Tupper Montney. Furthermore, we brought on our first 4 well pad in our new Kaybob Duvernay asset and are encouraged by the early results.
On the expense side, we continued lowering our cost structure. During the quarter, our capital expenditures were $172 million and year-to-date are $429 million, in line with our 2016 previously announced capital expenditure program of $620 million.
As John mentioned, we were also successful in  obtaining our new unsecured revolver and issued a new bond, which allows for continued flexibility, ample liquidity and continued preservation of our balance sheet. We also adjusted our dividend while remaining top quartile dividend yield. We believe there are current diversified oil-weighted asset mix such as the foundation which will be able to recalibrate production, forming a new base in which to grow in the future.
Third quarter production is just over 169,800 barrel equivalents per day, which exceeded the high end of our production guidance. The higher third quarter production is largely attributable to better-than-planned performance and facility uptime in Sabah, Malaysia as well as offshore Canada and the Gulf of Mexico. We expect our fourth quarter production will be in the range of 162,000 to 164,000-barrel equivalents a day. Our fourth quarter guidance takes into account the following: a planned 10-day shut-in at Kikeh and Siakap North Petai fields in Malaysia; and also in Malaysia, a planned 2-day shut-in at our Sarawak oil and gas field, where we changed out our field-based FSO. These 2 major shut-ins account for nearly 5,000 barrel equivalents of production this quarter from downtime and risked well recovery. Both of these major shut-ins have now been completed on time, and we're very pleased with the recovery, especially in the Kikeh wells and the facility following the first major shut-in in the field's 9-year history. As expected, we will have some fuel decline, frac impact and small field shut-in across our business as well as positive production impacts in our Canadian business from quarter-to-quarter.
The capital program for 2016 is maintained at $620 million as I've just said. However, there's a change in allocation as more capital is being allocated toward our Eagle Ford Shale business at the end of the year, where we place additional wells online.
The fourth quarter production guidance is 162 to 164 due to impacts of our shut-ins as I previously discussed, and our annual production range has been tightened to [Audio Gap} 174,000 to 175,000 equivalents per day within guidance, post divestitures and purchases announced earlier this year. Our lease operating expense for the first 9 months of '16 is $7.83 per BOE, showing an 18% reduction from the same period a year ago. Our quarter 3 LOE was $7.65 as compared to $8.09 per BOE in quarter 3 '15. All LOE expenses noted exclude Syncrude. We also made good progress, and the team reduced our G&A cost over the year. Third quarter G&A is down approximately 24% from the first quarter of '16. More importantly, we've been able to decrease G&A about 36% from the first quarter of 2015 when we began implementing deliberate cost reduction measures.
Our current assets are more streamlined and concentrated when we became an independent E&P company 3 years ago. However, remaining true to our strategy, we'll still maintain a global diversified oil-weighted E&P company. We build positions from grassroots efforts in [Audio Gap Ends] 3 premier North American unconventional plays that provide short cycle growth opportunities following our low cost entry points. We continue to review our portfolio, and we'll act when opportunities present themselves.
We generate free cash flow from our long-lived offshore conventional fields that are oil-weighted and priced to Brent.
In our offshore Malaysia business, we produced over 39,000 barrels of liquids per day during the quarter, with natural gas production from Sarawak at 116 million a day. We successfully installed a second platform in our South Acis field as part of the original field development plan. The resource size of the field is doubled since it came online in December of '13. As part of the improved oil recovery project at Kikeh, we installed a surface jet pump system, which is in the first -- which is our first of 3 planned improved oil recovery projects for the field. Over the course of the next couple of years, we're going to install an electrical submersible pump followed by a gas lift project on our Kikeh spar. 
In the Gulf of Mexico and East Coast Canada, production for the third quarter was 25,000-barrel equivalents per day at 89% liquids. Subsequent to quarter-end, the Kodiak field received gain -- Kodiak field recently gained approval to co mingle production between reservoirs and expecting additional zone to be online by year-end.
We've maintained our offshore capabilities and continued its focused evaluation in the Gulf of Mexico, Vulcan and Ceduna basins of Australia, Malaysia and Vietnam. We believe that our offshore execution abilities serve as a competitive advantage and allow for assessment and entry into discovered resource opportunities that we could access through expanding alliances with other operators.
The Eagle Ford Shale third quarter production result was just over 46,000-barrel equivalents to date comprised of 87% liquids. The 23 new wells brought online in the quarter included 2 in Austin Chalk and 4 Upper Eagle Ford wells. In the fourth quarter, the company expects to bring online 17 wells, including 2 Austin Chalk wells and 2 Upper Eagle Ford wells.
The fourth quarter online wells is an increase of 10 from previous guidance, with the majority planned for very late in the quarter. Due to timing, they will have minimal impact on 2016 production.
We continue making strides in decreasing drilling and completion costs as we average $4.3 million per well across the entire play, which is 18% below the $5.3 million per well in the third quarter of '15. We drilled pacesetter wells in both our Karnes and Catarina areas. The spud-to-TD for Karnes is 7.9 days versus 13 in 2015, a 39% reduction. In Catarina, it was 7.3 versus 9.3 in 2015, a 21% reduction. We still have significant running room ahead for us there with over 2,000 potential Eagle Ford Shale locations. Our reserves are oil-weighted at roughly 9%. This asset is very meaningful to Murphy's future reserves production and cash flow.
We've continued to employ high sand concentration fracs over this last quarter, which have continued to yield higher IP rates and enhanced type curves. In our Karnes area, recent IP rates have been up to 50% higher. We've seen 1 year cumulative oil rates over 35% higher in our older vintage wells.
In our Catarina area, recent IP30 rates have exceeded the type curve by up to 17%. We're now forecasting increased EURs of high sand concentration fracs and are in the evaluation phase as to the EUR increases.
In the quarter, we completed our second Austin Chalk well in the Karnes area and tested boundaries, the Austin Chalk resource. And the first Austin Chalk well is completed in what I'd describe as a wildcat test in our Catarina areas. Both wells are flowing and still in the clean up phase, and we'll bring more information on our fourth quarter call.
In Canada, our Tupper Montney asset produced about 119 million a day for the third quarter. We are pleased with the performance of our recent extended lateral high sand concentration wells that were brought online in the second quarter. Results are compelling and are trending toward our 10 to 14 Bcf type curve.
These results, coupled with our continued lower drilling and completion cost, continued to support our ongoing field development plan. We've reduced our drilling days and cost in the Montney by approximately 30% since 2014. As John spoke earlier, we have taken on additional hedges for 2017 through 2020 as part of our strategy to lock in the terms given our low breakeven NPV at natural gas prices of CAD 2.10.
In the Kaybob Duvernay and Placid Montney, production's over 3,100 equivalents for the quarter at 44% liquids. In Kaybob Duvernay, our 4 well pad was brought online in the gas condensate area during the quarter and was previously drilled by our partner. 2 of these wells have an average effective lateral length of 4,150 feet, and the other 2 have an effective lateral length of 2,665 feet. While these lateral lengths are well below our future development plan, the pad is flowing in excess of 2,100 barrel equivalents per day with nearly 70% liquids after flowing for only 40 days utilizing our conservative choke management approach. Initial result was encouraging as the wells are trending along the tight curve and accounting through effective lateral length.
With the 2 varying exposed stimulator horizontal sections, we can tie lateral length to flow performance. We've been very impressed with the condensate to gas ratio as the wells are maintained at stabilized CGR of near 500, which is higher-than-average length in number. We further expect that as we move up the learning curve in this play, we will continue to refine completion techniques based on the first operated production flowbacks.
We'll be drilling our first operated new 2-well pad in the fourth quarter in the gas condensate region with production online in the first quarter of next year. Drilling and completion costs for this 2 well pad are expected to be $5.6 million per well. The average lateral length for these wells is near 4,500 feet, they were previously permitted by our partner on a limited by lease boundary shape. We'll be implementing a similar completion design we have done in Eagle Ford Shale, which includes pumping fracs of 2,000 pounds per foot.
Moving forward, we are working a plan in the Kaybob area to increase lateral lengths to over 9,000 feet, and we continue to pump fracs at 2,000 pounds per foot and tweak spacing of stages, et cetera, which will lead to higher rates in this area of the play and offer upside for Murphy. Over time, we've been very successful at lowering our drilling and completion costs in Eagle Ford and Montney and expect we'll do the same in the Duvernay play over time.
In our nonoperated Placid Montney, 4 wells were drilled and 8 more are planned for this winter. 4 of these wells will be completed late in the year and the remainder online in 2017.
As we close our call today, some takeaways. We're pleased with our overall results this year. As we move forward, we're focused on continuing well efficiencies, improving cost structure and preserving our balance sheet. Our high cash margin offshore assets provide the cash flow required to ramp up our new unconventional assets in the Duvernay as well as unlocking value in our Eagle Ford Shale and Montney businesses. As you can appreciate, oil and gas price have been very volatile over the past 2 years. However, we believe prices are stabilizing. We're in the middle of our internal budgeting process with the goal of maintaining cash flow neutrality, including our dividend. We have many great opportunities across our assets as we do every year, and we'll be releasing our 2017 guidance and CapEx in late January. We look forward to discussing those with you at that time.
This concludes our opening remarks. I'd like to open it up for your usual questions, and we'll go from there. Thank you."

We're going to step into longer lateral lengths early there than we did in Eagle Ford, for sure. In a very short notice, you would probably go to Eagle Ford over that, but it will depend on the outcomes of this well. We're very happy about the results, very happy about what we planned and what we're seeing, very happy about the CGR, really nice wells to drill coming up this quarter that are next to some very high performing wells, some of the better performing wells from our partner. And all that will take into account some flexibility as to our field development plan, the pad layouts that we have, the areas in which we receive permits, comparing that back to Eagle Ford. But I'm glad to have the ability to move between them pretty easily, Paul."

Murphy's consolidated results in the third quarter of 2016 were a net loss of $16.2 million or $0.09 per diluted share. The comparative result from the same quarter in 2015 was a net loss of $1.6 billion or $9.26 per diluted share. Prior year quarter included a pretax impairment charge of $2.3 billion associated with oil prices that were weakening a year ago. Excluding the impairment in the prior year, operating results in the 2016 third quarter were improved compared to 2015 due to lower operating expenses and lower administrative expenses that more than offset lower oil and gas sales prices.
Excluding discontinued operations, continuing operations had a net loss of $14.6 million in the third quarter or $0.08 per diluted share.
Adjusted earnings, which normalize our quarterly results for various items that affect comparability between periods, was a net loss of $31.7 million in the third quarter of 2016 compared to an adjusted net loss of $124.5 million a year ago. This improvement in adjusted results in the 2016 quarter was primarily attributable to lower cost per production, exploration and administrative activities, but these were partially offset by somewhat lower oil and natural gas sales prices compared to last year.
Our third quarter 2016 lease operating expense, excluding Syncrude, which has been sold, was lower by approximately $0.44 per barrel of oil equivalent compared to a year ago. We have continued to bring down our operating cost due to efficiency improvements, aggressive rebidding of services and onetime benefits from operated and nonoperated fields.
Our third quarter 2016 average realized sales price for crude oil production was $44.64 per barrel sold, and that's 3% lower than the same period in the prior year. Natural gas prices also were weaker in quarter 3 compared to the prior year's quarter with average North American gas price realizations of $1.96 per thousand cubic feet, a drop of $0.46 per Mcf or a decline of 19%.
Realized oil index natural gas prices offshore Sarawak fell 20% to an average of $3.01 per Mcf due to decline in global crude oil prices between periods.
For the remaining 3 months of 2016, we have WTI-based oil sales contracts that hedged 25,000 barrels per day at a WTI average fixed price of $50.67 per barrel. Additionally, we have forward sales contracts for Canadian natural gas in the amount of 99 million cubic feet per day at an average AECO fixed price of CAD 3 per thousand feet over the remainder of 2016.
For subsequent years, we also have WTI contracts for 18,000 barrels per day in 2017 at an average price of $50.66 per barrel. Plus we have Canadian gas forward sales contracts covering 99 million cubic feet a day at CAD 2.89 per thousand cubic feet for 2017 plus 59 million cubic feet a day at CAD 2.81 for 2018 through 2020.
As previously announced, in the third quarter, we reduced our quarterly dividend from $0.35 per share to $0.25 per share, thereby reducing our annualized distribution by approximately $69 million per year.
At September 30, 2016, Murphy's long-term debt amounted to $2.97 billion, representing 36.9% of total capital employed.
Excluding capital leases, total debt was $2.8 billion. Net debt at the quarter end amounted to 29.5%.
Also as of quarter end, we had total cash and invested cash of $871 million and no outstanding borrowed balance on our revolving credit facilities, providing us ample liquidity for the future.
We currently anticipate that fourth quarter oil sales volumes will be approximately 13,000 barrels per day below our average daily production. This is due to the periodic timing of offshore oil listings primarily for our operations in Malaysia. The lifting schedule calls for 4 liftings from offshore storage facilities during the first week of January, 3 of these occur in the first 2 days of the new year, and these account for the noted reduction in sales volumes in the fourth quarter compared to production.
In August, we successfully completed a new $1.2 billion 3-year unsecured credit facility and also issued $550 million of 8-year notes at a coupon rate of 6.875%, with these notes maturing in 2024. Further details regarding these financial transactions may be found in our 8-K reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on August 12 and August 17.
And that concludes my comments. I'd like now to turn it back over to Roger."

We had a solid quarter operationally across our business. Our legacy offshore fields achieved just over $30 per BOE cash margin, and our onshore business achieved continued success in pulling high sand concentration fracs in the Eagle Ford Shale and Tupper Montney. Furthermore, we brought on our first 4 well pad in our new Kaybob Duvernay asset and are encouraged by the early results.
On the expense side, we continued lowering our cost structure. During the quarter, our capital expenditures were $172 million and year-to-date are $429 million, in line with our 2016 previously announced capital expenditure program of $620 million.
As John mentioned, we were also successful in  obtaining our new unsecured revolver and issued a new bond, which allows for continued flexibility, ample liquidity and continued preservation of our balance sheet. We also adjusted our dividend while remaining top quartile dividend yield. We believe there are current diversified oil-weighted asset mix such as the foundation which will be able to recalibrate production, forming a new base in which to grow in the future.
Third quarter production is just over 169,800 barrel equivalents per day, which exceeded the high end of our production guidance. The higher third quarter production is largely attributable to better-than-planned performance and facility uptime in Sabah, Malaysia as well as offshore Canada and the Gulf of Mexico. We expect our fourth quarter production will be in the range of 162,000 to 164,000-barrel equivalents a day. Our fourth quarter guidance takes into account the following: a planned 10-day shut-in at Kikeh and Siakap North Petai fields in Malaysia; and also in Malaysia, a planned 2-day shut-in at our Sarawak oil and gas field, where we changed out our field-based FSO. These 2 major shut-ins account for nearly 5,000 barrel equivalents of production this quarter from downtime and risked well recovery. Both of these major shut-ins have now been completed on time, and we're very pleased with the recovery, especially in the Kikeh wells and the facility following the first major shut-in in the field's 9-year history. As expected, we will have some fuel decline, frac impact and small field shut-in across our business as well as positive production impacts in our Canadian business from quarter-to-quarter.
The capital program for 2016 is maintained at $620 million as I've just said. However, there's a change in allocation as more capital is being allocated toward our Eagle Ford Shale business at the end of the year, where we place additional wells online.
The fourth quarter production guidance is 162 to 164 due to impacts of our shut-ins as I previously discussed, and our annual production range has been tightened to [Audio Gap} 174,000 to 175,000 equivalents per day within guidance, post divestitures and purchases announced earlier this year. Our lease operating expense for the first 9 months of '16 is $7.83 per BOE, showing an 18% reduction from the same period a year ago. Our quarter 3 LOE was $7.65 as compared to $8.09 per BOE in quarter 3 '15. All LOE expenses noted exclude Syncrude. We also made good progress, and the team reduced our G&A cost over the year. Third quarter G&A is down approximately 24% from the first quarter of '16. More importantly, we've been able to decrease G&A about 36% from the first quarter of 2015 when we began implementing deliberate cost reduction measures.
Our current assets are more streamlined and concentrated when we became an independent E&P company 3 years ago. However, remaining true to our strategy, we'll still maintain a global diversified oil-weighted E&P company. We build positions from grassroots efforts in [Audio Gap Ends] 3 premier North American unconventional plays that provide short cycle growth opportunities following our low cost entry points. We continue to review our portfolio, and we'll act when opportunities present themselves.
We generate free cash flow from our long-lived offshore conventional fields that are oil-weighted and priced to Brent.
In our offshore Malaysia business, we produced over 39,000 barrels of liquids per day during the quarter, with natural gas production from Sarawak at 116 million a day. We successfully installed a second platform in our South Acis field as part of the original field development plan. The resource size of the field is doubled since it came online in December of '13. As part of the improved oil recovery project at Kikeh, we installed a surface jet pump system, which is in the first -- which is our first of 3 planned improved oil recovery projects for the field. Over the course of the next couple of years, we're going to install an electrical submersible pump followed by a gas lift project on our Kikeh spar. 
In the Gulf of Mexico and East Coast Canada, production for the third quarter was 25,000-barrel equivalents per day at 89% liquids. Subsequent to quarter-end, the Kodiak field received gain -- Kodiak field recently gained approval to co mingle production between reservoirs and expecting additional zone to be online by year-end.
We've maintained our offshore capabilities and continued its focused evaluation in the Gulf of Mexico, Vulcan and Ceduna basins of Australia, Malaysia and Vietnam. We believe that our offshore execution abilities serve as a competitive advantage and allow for assessment and entry into discovered resource opportunities that we could access through expanding alliances with other operators.
The Eagle Ford Shale third quarter production result was just over 46,000-barrel equivalents to date comprised of 87% liquids. The 23 new wells brought online in the quarter included 2 in Austin Chalk and 4 Upper Eagle Ford wells. In the fourth quarter, the company expects to bring online 17 wells, including 2 Austin Chalk wells and 2 Upper Eagle Ford wells.
The fourth quarter online wells is an increase of 10 from previous guidance, with the majority planned for very late in the quarter. Due to timing, they will have minimal impact on 2016 production.
We continue making strides in decreasing drilling and completion costs as we average $4.3 million per well across the entire play, which is 18% below the $5.3 million per well in the third quarter of '15. We drilled pacesetter wells in both our Karnes and Catarina areas. The spud-to-TD for Karnes is 7.9 days versus 13 in 2015, a 39% reduction. In Catarina, it was 7.3 versus 9.3 in 2015, a 21% reduction. We still have significant running room ahead for us there with over 2,000 potential Eagle Ford Shale locations. Our reserves are oil-weighted at roughly 9%. This asset is very meaningful to Murphy's future reserves production and cash flow.
We've continued to employ high sand concentration fracs over this last quarter, which have continued to yield higher IP rates and enhanced type curves. In our Karnes area, recent IP rates have been up to 50% higher. We've seen 1 year cumulative oil rates over 35% higher in our older vintage wells.
In our Catarina area, recent IP30 rates have exceeded the type curve by up to 17%. We're now forecasting increased EURs of high sand concentration fracs and are in the evaluation phase as to the EUR increases.
In the quarter, we completed our second Austin Chalk well in the Karnes area and tested boundaries, the Austin Chalk resource. And the first Austin Chalk well is completed in what I'd describe as a wildcat test in our Catarina areas. Both wells are flowing and still in the cleanup phase, and we'll bring more information on our fourth quarter call.
In Canada, our Tupper Montney asset produced about 119 million a day for the third quarter. We are pleased with the performance of our recent extended lateral high sand concentration wells that were brought online in the second quarter. Results are compelling and are trending toward our 10 to 14 Bcf type curve.
These results, coupled with our continued lower drilling and completion cost, continued to support our ongoing field development plan. We've reduced our drilling days and cost in the Montney by approximately 30% since 2014. As John spoke earlier, we have taken on additional hedges for 2017 through 2020 as part of our strategy to lock in the terms given our low breakeven NPV at natural gas prices of CAD 2.10.
In the Kaybob Duvernay and Placid Montney, production's over 3,100 equivalents for the quarter at 44% liquids. In Kaybob Duvernay, our 4 well pad was brought online in the gas condensate area during the quarter and was previously drilled by our partner. 2 of these wells have an average effective lateral length of 4,150 feet, and the other 2 have an effective lateral length of 2,665 feet. While these lateral lengths are well below our future development plan, the pad is flowing in excess of 2,100 barrel equivalents per day with nearly 70% liquids after flowing for only 40 days utilizing our conservative choke management approach. Initial result was encouraging as the wells are trending along the tight curve and accounting through effective lateral length.
With the 2 varying exposed stimulator horizontal sections, we can tie lateral length to flow performance. We've been very impressed with the condensate to gas ratio as the wells are maintained at stabilized CGR of near 500, which is higher-than-average length in number. We further expect that as we move up the learning curve in this play, we will continue to refine completion techniques based on the first operated production flowbacks.
We'll be drilling our first operated new 2-well pad in the fourth quarter in the gas condensate region with production online in the first quarter of next year. Drilling and completion costs for this 2 well pad are expected to be $5.6 million per well. The average lateral length for these wells is near 4,500 feet, they were previously permitted by our partner on a limited by lease boundary shape. We'll be implementing a similar completion design we have done in Eagle Ford Shale, which includes pumping fracs of 2,000 pounds per foot.
Moving forward, we are working a plan in the Kaybob area to increase lateral lengths to over 9,000 feet, and we continue to pump fracs at 2,000 pounds per foot and tweak spacing of stages, et cetera, which will lead to higher rates in this area of the play and offer upside for Murphy. Over time, we've been very successful at lowering our drilling and completion costs in Eagle Ford and Montney and expect we'll do the same in the Duvernay play over time.
In our nonoperated Placid Montney, 4 wells were drilled and 8 more are planned for this winter. 4 of these wells will be completed late in the year and the remainder online in 2017.
As we close our call today, some takeaways. We're pleased with our overall results this year. As we move forward, we're focused on continuing well efficiencies, improving cost structure and preserving our balance sheet. Our high cash margin offshore assets provide the cash flow required to ramp up our new unconventional assets in the Duvernay as well as unlocking value in our Eagle Ford Shale and Montney businesses. As you can appreciate, oil and gas price have been very volatile over the past 2 years. However, we believe prices are stabilizing. We're in the middle of our internal budgeting process with the goal of maintaining cash flow neutrality, including our dividend. We have many great opportunities across our assets as we do every year, and we'll be releasing our 2017 guidance and CapEx in late January. We look forward to discussing those with you at that time.
This concludes our opening remarks. I'd like to open it up for your usual questions, and we'll go from there. Thank you."

And we'll -- through next year, a year from now, we'll be setting up for what we're going to do in '18. And the goal here is to replace the production, the higher margin that we sold in Syncrude, and I see us well on that ability and happy with the costs, operating expenses and all that. And real pleased about how that's going. And we're hitting this ground running pretty hard. With our experiences in Eagle Ford and Montney and what we learned about going to higher sand and going to longer laterals early is really helping us here, relocate a lot of staff around, building up that ability, doing things quicker and -- while still maintaining some of the Murphy conservatism we have like in flowback. These wells are flowing only on 14, 16 choke. So real happy about how all that's going right now."

It's the best these downspace wells in Catarina, some of the top in the company, and it's a matter of capital allocation around -- to put all the capital in there if we would like. But our Duvernay shale, we have to delineate this black oil, volatile oil, condensate, and we have to also prove that we can lower cost. And the only way to prove you can lower costs is to drill some pads. And you have to drill those pads aggressively with longer laterals. So it's going to be one of those kind of calls, Roger. We make production what you want it to be if you put all the capital and the best IP type wells, which lead to the better returns mostly -- usually. But we have a new unconventional shale business that has 0 ducks in it. So that's not that common, and we have that as a capital allocation decision.

This is from the last 5 years. So -- and then in the last 2, incredible continuation of efficiency here on the wells. From a service perspective, we have a frac crew lined up for the entire year and are outbidding for spot crews as we need. They are about 50% less than they were in 2014 to accomplish these services. We feel firm about the contract that we have to deliver our fracturing services in Eagle Ford. We have a rig there that doesn't expire for some time into late next year. And we're seeing spot rigs in there for 15,000 a day to add additional rig, and we're probably at to a couple of rigs in that play. And I'm happy with the procurement and the bidding structure that we have to go through '17 and are able to maintain our cost, and that's not one of our main concerns in our budgeting at this time."

I'm real happy with the EUR curves we're seeing, well like -- you know there are many, many wells in the Eagle Ford Shale or across plays in North America that deliver around 450,000 or 500,000 barrels, and we're looking very positive toward doing that and tying up a very 1 barrel per feet of horizontal length there. So it's going well, and those are the type of EURs we anticipated coming out of the well. Only flowed the well for 40 days, still have the well on a very low choke. So I'm happy about how much it cost to frac it. I'm happy about where we're headed to drill the next 2 wells and how that will incredibly add value to us. And the CGR is a big deal, 100 units in that game is big, and we have drawn some lines as to what we felt CGR would be and it's better. And just have limited data and only flowed for 40 days, but from what I'm seeing, I'm real happy about how we evaluated and I'm very happy about how the well's performing. I just have 4 wells, and in the Eagle Ford, I have 798 or something like that. So from a differentiated perspective, I mean, we purchased the asset for $9.00 per foot. It's quite low. Massive [Audio Gap] volatile. What's that?"

And I see this as a very unique opportunity for us, but just like everything else, we have to get in there, get capital in there. And if the EURs are the same, we have some very prolific EURs coming on the next well, for example, higher than we have in the Eagle Ford. And so the EUR from a daily perspective, I'm very happy about. And we just got to get the drilling costs lower, and I'm really excited about being able to do it, because I've done it everywhere else we've been. And have the same people, supervising it, same team, and we're going to do it."

To our east there is a very large acreage position that Chevron holds also with drilling commitments. They're quite large and rigs to be moved there, et cetera. Also in blocks next door to us, which BP has left, and Statoil remains their partner, which they formed in with BP at the time, so it's a very unique circumstance, I just know that we have some very large prospects and many of them on our block. It would be preferable for Murphy someone to drill next door. But I feel in things like this that there will be a well drilled down there by some of these folks at some period of time. And we will be there to take advantage of that at that time. And all I know is the blocks we have and the data we have and the prospectivity that we have is very good.
