Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. We've got to lot go over today. We'll start with David Santee providing some color on operations, talk a little bit about how last year ended up, a discussion on our core markets and our overall outlook for 2016. I'll then discuss the acquisition and disposition activity that we are planning this year that will be in addition to the recently completed $5.365 billion sale to Starwood. And finally, Mark Parrell will take you through how our operating outlook and transactional and others assumptions impact our 2016 earnings guidance, our regular and special dividends, our recent debt repayment activities, filing the Starwood sale and liquidity.
Before we get started, I wanted to make a couple general comments, because we all read and listen to the same things the rest of you do, and we know that there is a lot of volatility around the globe and across the financial markets. And there are a lot of questions about how that is currently impacting or might soon impact, the domestic economy, in general; and our business, in particular. Because also been some reports of increasing apartment vacancy and declining rental rates. Like you, we don't have a crystal ball. All we can tell you is what we're seeing real time in our business. And what we're seeing is, some markets are bit behind while we had expected at this point, and others a bit ahead. But in total, portfolio wide, we are where we expected to be 1 month into the year with 30 days forward visibility. And as in recent years, renewals, tell a lot for the story. Renewal increases in November, December and January were all plus 6%. We also achieved plus 6% growth in renewal rents in February.
Portfolio occupancy today is 96.1%, very much inline with our expectations, and quite strong for this time of the year. Overall, the much right way to be thought they would be when we gave our initial guidance for 2016 back in late October.
So with that said, I'll let David go into more detail about our markets, our current outlook for 2016 and why we think this year will be another good year in the apartment business and for Equity Residential."
28209,322068815,925675,"Equity Residential, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2016",2016-02-03,"Earnings Calls","Equity Residential","Executives","Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone. During Q4, turnover continued to decline with the quarter-over-quarter reduction of 7% and growth move-outs. For the full year, turnover declined 40 basis points from 54.9% to 54.5%. And in net of intra-property t",1914,"Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone. During Q4, turnover continued to decline with the quarter-over-quarter reduction of 7% and growth move-outs. For the full year, turnover declined 40 basis points from 54.9% to 54.5%. And in net of intra-property transfers turnover degree is 50 basis points to 48.5% from 49%. 
Our continued focus on minimizing Q4 and Q1 lease explorations continues to produce more operational stability, as occupancy once again remained stronger through the historical Q4 seasonal slowdown. Move-outs to buy homes increased only slightly across many markets for the quarter and the full year. With rents continuing to rapid ascent across most markets, it should come as no surprise that affordability, our second largest category for move-outs, increased from 13% to 14.1% for full year. Yet demand for quality apartments in great locations has remained steady thus far.
Similar to 2015, we again start the year from a solid foundation of occupancy, exposure and pricing levels across most of our markets. Today, occupancy, as David mentioned, is 96.1%, and exposure is 20 basis points lower with net effective new-lease rents up 3% year-over-year versus same week last year. While not to reference setting new increase we enjoyed in 2015, we achieved a 6.4% increase on our January offers, and February will deliver in the same range. These early indicators coupled with continued favorable job growth, fewer deliveries on our core markets, but more importantly, the submarkets that we operate in, gives us the confidence to stand by our preliminary revenue guidance range of 4.5% to 5.25%. However, we are mindful of the headwinds from the headline and the potential odds and impact of the U.S. economy in recessionary environment.
Our 2016 revenue guidance, is again led by the West Coast, the San Francisco leading the way, followed by Los Angeles, which continues to show momentum in both new lease and renewal gains. Our 2016 buckets of revenue growth again includes San Francisco, Los Angeles, Seattle and the remainder of the Southern California, all expect to exceed 5% revenue growth for the full year. Boston and New York Metro remained in the 3% to 5% bucket, as concentrated new supply in each submarkets continue to dampen pricing power for new leases. Washington, DC, once again remains in a bucket of their own -- we've projected revenue growth of 1% to 1.3% for full year 2016.
Our total portfolio assumptions based on 75,123 same-store units that drive the midpoint of guidance, our 2.3% embedded growth from 2015, 3.5% average new lease rent growth and 6% average grain on renewals. Occupancy in turnover for 2016 are modeled to be flat.
Expense results of 2% for the quarter were extremely favorable versus our forecast of 4.3%. Even with our optimistic adjustments that were made prior to our last earnings release, we were unable to predict the full impact of our commodities and record high temperatures, which allowed us to deliver full year expense growth of 2.5% versus the guidance of 3.1%. 
The 2 drivers of the 230 basis point pick up were approximately $4 million in Q4, or spread almost evenly between utilities and payroll. With the unseasonably warm weather materially influencing both. The rapid price decline across all relevant commodities combined with record warm temperatures through December, allowed us to be our original forecast of savings, almost 3 folders, through the quarter, resulting in an additional $2 million pick up across heating oil, natural gas and electric. Also the warm temperatures combined with the 7% decline in Q4 move-outs, allowed us to achieve our historical salary forecast, but the need for contract labor and overtime was virtually nonexistent. This in addition to favorable employee bonus and health insurance accruals, allowed us to achieve an additional $1.7 million in payroll savings for Q4, bringing our forecast total of 4.3% down to the 2% for the quarter and 2.5% for the whole year.
Expense guidance for 2016 of 2.5% to 3.5% is once again driven by real estate tax growth of 5.25% with 190 basis points of that 5.25% attributable to our New York portfolio tax abatement Like 2015, we would expect minimal growth across the utility accounts. between 2.5% and 3% and all other will show flat-to-minimal growth as the impact of increased minimum wages and Affordable Care Act cost incurred by our outside vendors were already absorbed into our cost structure over the past 2 years.
So going around the horn and starting with Seattle, I'll give some pretty working highlights, some revenue expectations and expected deliveries that combined influence our thought process for our full year 2016 revenue guidance.
Seattle will see an 8% decline in new deliveries from a little over 9,000 units in 2015 to approximately 7,200. Knowing that Amazon will continue its large capital investment and delivery of almost 4 million square feet of new office space in Downtown and the continued migration of regional and corporate headquarters in the suburbs, Seattle should be able to observe this new inventory with minimal disruption, just as it is done over the past 2 years, and as evidenced by the 3,100 units that have been absorbed over the past 2 quarters.
San Francisco will once again EQR markets, as constraints to new development are all ramp. However, like any market, where there is concentration of new supply, near-term pricing pressure will almost follow. As a result of the new deliveries in the urban core, pricing has appeared to be normal seasonal patterns with net effective new lease rents up only 4% today. As expected, properties closes to the urban core are experiencing the most pressure, while properties further down the peninsula continued to enjoy year-over-year rental rate growth in the mid-teens. With lease up velocity exceeding normalized expectations, San Francisco Metro should experience rapid absorption and deliver another year of high single-digit revenue growth as evidenced by year-to-date billings that exce 9.6%. While headlines are quick to recognize slowdown in tax spending, the large giants continue to buy, lease or build new office space in anticipation of future growth and elevated hiring. But as we all know grow to the sky, but our dashboard tells us the fundamentals remain strong. Renewal offered issued through March remain in double-digit, and if history plays out, we would expect new lease rents to seasonally adjust up from the mid-single digits we see today to higher levels as we move closer to peek 
With embedded revenue growth of 5.5%, renewal rates achieved averaging almost 10% and new lease rents averaging 7%-plus for the full year, we would expect our portfolio to deliver full year revenue growth in the high single digits.
Los Angeles fundamentals appear to be coming on strong. With the anticipation of a breakout year for the L.A. economy and the Pro business city government, the rebranding of Downtown as a world-class city coupled with meaningful additions to infrastructure and transportation cause us to be very optimistic in L.A.'s ability to absorb the 7,600 new deliveries expected in 2016.
Given the concentrated nature of deliveries in the South Park and Hollywood submarkets, we see no major hurdles to strengthening fundamentals and revenue growth as net effective new lease rents are up 7.3% with both occupancy and exposure, significantly, better positioned versus the same week last year.
Orange County and San Diego should continue to see above average growth with 2016 deliveries of 3,600 and 2,400, respectively. These levels are in par or slightly less than 2015. With the concentration of assets delivered during 2015 been Irvine and in close proximity -- the percentage of our assets, we would expect to see better results in 2016, as pressure our new lease pricing subside.
Our Boston portfolio continues to face pricing pressure, as 2015 back loaded deliveries remain in lease up. With only 2,200 deliveries scheduled for 2016, which is a 62% decline, and a lower concentration in the financial District and Downtown, we would anticipate a window of improvement late this year and early into 2017 before an estimated 5,000 units are again delivered in 2017. To-date, 19,000 units have been absorbed in the past 2 years, without the disruption of one might expect. With GE announcing their headquarter relocation and the continued biotech related job growth, Boston should deliver results very similar to what we achieved in 2015.
For New York Metro, we expect to deliver 3% revenue growth, as new supply will impact certain submarkets. After delivering average annual revenue growth of 4.9% for the last 16 quarters, the performance of our Manhattan portfolio will be greatly influenced by almost 2,000 new units on the Upper West Side, which makes up almost 30% of total revenue for our New York Metro area. Most of these projects are luxury with unit mixes that skewed towards agreed by the And off-late, have been more difficult to lease. And as a result, it ends up with a greater economic vacancy loss. While occupancies remain above 95%, we expect Upper West Side new lease rates to be flat or slightly positive until majority of these new deliveries are absorbed. We continue to see strong fundamentals pricing and our other Manhattan submarkets, the financial District, and Chelsea, collectively these neighborhoods to deliver revenue growth inline with our historical averages that I noted earlier.
Another New York Metro hotspot is Jersey City or the Hudson Waterfront, where 1,000 new units were delivered in late 2015 and another 1,500 expected in 2016. All in a 1- to 2-mile radius. Thus far we've not felt the full impact, as year-to-date revenue growth is holding at 3%. Brooklyn will also delivered a number of new buildings, but these are north and further east of Downtown, with the new supply being smaller in unit count and less desirable based on and locations. We would expect moderate impact in Williamsburg and less so in Downtown, Brooklyn, as both EQR communities in this location are delivering an excess of 4.8% revenue growth through February.
Again, as new supply comes online in areas, new lease pricing will be under pressure and we see that in our net effect today. However, occupancy remained strong across the portfolio at 96.1%. Renewal rate growth should average plus 4% for the portfolio that combines will produce full year revenue growth of approximately 3%.
Washington, D.C. will experience declines in deliveries to approximately 11,000 units in 2016, after observing over 28,000 units in the previous 2 years. With positive revenue growth in Q4 and full year, we are cautiously optimistic about near-term performance. Should absorption maintain its velocity, these fee should be against delivered more favorable revenue growth as new lease pricing pressures ease. With job growth in the professional service continuing to improve, an increase in D.C. business activity as a result of the election year. And more of the 2016 deliveries in the suburbs versus Arlington in D.C., we continued to be optimistic about the long-term performance of our portfolio.
In summary, we continue to see favorable fundamentals across all of our markets. At this point, in the apartment rental cycle, it is much too early to be influenced by the negative headlines that we all read each and everyday. We remain focused on what the data tells us and you respond appropriately. Today, our dashboard tell us that not much has changed in that apartment fundamentals at least for the first quarter remain strong, leading us to believe that 2016 will be yet another year of performance above long-term trend."

We're very pleased to recently close of our sale of 72 noncore assets holding 23,262 apartment units to Starwood, for $5.365 billion or $231,000 per unit. I'm particularly pleased to realize 11.1% unleveraged IRR on these investments, in",831,"Thank you, David. We're very pleased to recently close of our sale of 72 noncore assets holding 23,262 apartment units to Starwood, for $5.365 billion or $231,000 per unit. I'm particularly pleased to realize 11.1% unleveraged IRR on these investments, inclusive of indirect management costs over an extremely long hold period. This sale was resolved of an incredible a lot of folks here in EQR, who works practically around-the-clock to get this deal done, and I thank all of them for their dedication and commitment. And I also thank those who left the company with the sale of this portfolio, some of whom have been with us for more than 20 years, and we're most grateful to all these people for the service to our residents and the company.
answering this call this transaction was Starwood was first announced, we explained that this disposition accomplished several things for us: First, we realized a very good pricing on assets and markets not considered core for us, and on some assets in our core markets that didn't quite fit our long-term strategic vision. The second thing we accomplished is that we can now focus solely on our strategy of owning, building and operating assets in higher density urban locations, the close proximity to public transportation, job centers and other amenities that cities have to offer. As we've discussed with many of you since the original announcement, this sale, and the sale of $700 million of additional assets in 2016, would result in a special dividend of $9.11 per share. And that decision was made due to the challenge we saw trying to recycle $6 billion of capital in today's marketplace, where we continue to see strong institutional demand for core assets in Gateway processes and very competitive pricing as a result of that demand.
We continue to believe and are grateful for the support of so many of you who would agree with us, the returning much of these proceeds to our investors through a special dividend in a balance sheet neutral way is the best capital allocation decision you can make on behalf of our shareholders.
Since our original announcement of the Starwood transaction, demand for multi-family assets in our core markets was continued unabated, and so we've considered the sale of several additional assets that due to either operational challenges or submarket issues or prizing potential that we simply thought too good to pass up, might represent additional timely opportunities to monetize our interest in certain assets and modestly increase the size of this year's special dividend.
Last week, for instance, we sold 1 of 3 assets acquired for the macro family in 2010, when we paid a total of $475 million for the entire portfolio. This particular property, Tower, was sold for $390 million or $1.2 million per door, at the yield in low 3s for a 5-year unleveraged IRR, inclusive of indirect management costs of 14%. This sale was previously contemplated and was accounted for in our original special dividend guidance of $9 to $11 per share. In addition, we've also started work on the potential disposition of another $600 million of possible sales, that if consummated could increase that dividend by another $1-or-so per share, and hence, the new range of 10 to 12 per share noted in last night's press release.
I wanted to be publicly clear, because I'm sure many of you have questions about this. We backed up the truck once with the sale of the Starwood, we have no intention of doing so again. As I said, we're working on a limited number of additional sales this year that could bring our special dividend up to the $10 to $12 per share.
Our guidance also assumes that we will sell an additional $300 million by the end of the year, 100% of which would be redeployed from the new acquisitions. And that level of activities accounted on our guidance towards the back half of the year at a negative is spread of 75 basis points. This additional $300 million of activity would only occur if we can find suitable investments for which we're willing to trade out our current assets. For the guidance provided in press release is for $7.4 billion of these positions comprised of $6.1 billion we announced last October, nearly $400 million for Liver Tower, another $600 million expected to be sold during the year, adding an additional $1 per share special dividend, and $300 million of share that will occur if and only if we can find suitable reinvestment opportunities.
Our acquisition guidance of $600 million is roughly $300 million of 10 31 reinvestments to cover some very large tax gains of certain unaffiliated limited partners as a result of the Starwood transaction, and $300 million of additional possible acquisition in the back-half of the year, and matched up with dispositions in the normal course of managing our portfolio.
I'll now turn the call over to our CFO, Mark Parrell."
28209,322068815,925675,"Equity Residential, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2016",2016-02-03,"Earnings Calls","Equity Residential","Executives","Thank you, David. I want to take a few minutes this morning to talk about our guidance for 2016, that includes both the annually dividend and the specially dividends, our recent debt prepayment activity, and then I'll close with the discussion of sources",1175,"Thank you, David. I want to take a few minutes this morning to talk about our guidance for 2016, that includes both the annually dividend and the specially dividends, our recent debt prepayment activity, and then I'll close with the discussion of sources and uses in 2016.
Our range for normalized FFO for 2016 is $3 to $3.20 per share. This range is larger than usual due to some of the uncertainties over transaction timing. And I'm going walk you through some of the bigger highlights at this point. The biggest reconciling item between 2015 and 2016 normalized FFO is of course, the reduction we will experience in net operating income of about $345 million, that's about $0.90 per share from our transaction activity, including Starwood.
The second big item going the other way is the use of approximately $1.7 billion of those disposition proceeds to prepay debt, that creates an $80 million or $0.21 per share benefit or improvement in interest expense. I'll pause here and note, that we're expecting about $10 million decline in capitalized interest, in 2016 versus 2015, and I did include that in the $0.21 per share improvement number that I just give you.
So once you get passed the transaction and debt activity, our normalized FFO is driven by the usual suspects, and that includes an increase of $0.23 per share in same-store NOI, and an increase of $0.12 per share from lease-ups. And the final items are 'just a variety of other individually less material items, that reduced our normalized FFO estimate for 2016 by about $0.02 per share, and they include among other things lower income from unconsidered entities and as to the sales in 2015 as the last Archstone JV operating excess. So this brings our normalized FFO guidance midpoint for 2016 to $3.10 per share.
So now move on to the dividends, for the annual dividend, as you know, it is our intention to pay 65% of the midpoint of our normalized FFO guidance as our annual common share dividend. Given the midpoint I just discussed, of $3.10 per share, we would expect to pay $2.015 per share for the year or $0.50375 per share per quarter in 2016. Also we expect to pay 2 special dividends, which will total between $10 and $12 a share. The first special dividend is anticipated to be paid in the second quarter, and is expected to be about $8 per share. There is less variability in our minds about the size and timing of this first special dividend, given that the Starwood sale and some of these other sales have already occurred. But of course, our Board of Trustees retain discretion on all dividend matters.
The second special dividend has been modeled in our guidance at $3 per share, based on our existing disposition guidance number, as well as numerous assumptions we have to make about the exact timing and amount of the gain per asset, and our 2016 operating income and other tax receivables.  Similarly, the timing of the payment of the second special dividend is less certain in our minds, and we'll like the amount of the dividend ultimately depend on when this sales close, the number of sales that close and certain other tax variables.
Now onto the bond tender and other recent debt repayment activities, consistent with what we said on the earnings call back in October. Over the last 2 weeks, the company has prepared prior to maturity, a total of $1.7 billion in debt, through an unsecured bond tender, and early repayment of a large secured debt 
In mid-March, we also repay using the cash we now have on hand. The $270 million off March 2016, unsecured bonds, that were not tendered. Collectively, the company will incur approximately $112 million is prepayment penalties, and that would be recorded as additional interest expense in the first quarter, and it will impact EPS and FFO, but will not impact normalized funds from operations. These debt repayment activities were funded with the portion of the proceeds from the Starwood sale and our other recent sales, and are intended to maintain and they do in fact actually slightly enhance the company's already strong credit profile, we now expect net debt-to-EBITDA for 2016 to be about 5.8x, and fixed charge coverage to be about 3.6x, and this compares to our already strong 2015 net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 6.1x, and fixed charge coverage of 3.5x. And I'm computing all these fixed charge coverage ratios using the more stringent rating agency methodology, which does not reduce interest expense by capitalized interest.
Also our near-term maturities are now greatly reduced. And in fact, we currently have only approximately $330 million of debt maturing in 2016, consistent of $60 million in secured debt that matures a little later in 2016, plus the $270 million of unsecured notes due in March 2016 that were not tendered as I discussed previously.
Our 2017 maturities have now been cut in half, and now total about $600 million. The company's liquidity position is excellent. Currently, we have $3.5 billion in cash, and $2.5 billion revolving line of credit is undrawn. We also have no commercial paper outstanding. At the end of 2016, we expect to have about $50 million in cash, and the revolving line of credit and the commercial paper program between the two will have about $300 million balance. And that is certainly a lot of inflows and outflows in 1 year. So I'm take a minute and just give you a little background on that bigger pieces. For the full year 2016, we expect net inflows from buys and sales of about $6.8 billion. To-date, we have sold approximately $5.9 billion, which is inclusive of Starwood and we have not acquired any properties. We have assumed paying about $4.25 billion in special dividends, as I just said, and we expect to pay the first in the second quarter 2016, in the amount of about $3 billion. And the second later in 2016 in the amount of approximately $1.25 billion. We anticipate repaying approximately $2.1 billion in total debt during 2016. As mentioned earlier, we have already retired approximately $1.7 billion. We further expand to spend about $250 million during the year, that's mostly for the prepayment penalties I refer to you previously and about $40 million or $45 million of transaction cost on the dispositions. We expect to spend about $600 million in development activities during 2016, and the final piece of the puzzle is positive cash flow from operations were about $200 million, and that $200 million number is net of our annual dividend and our capital expenditures.
In order to balance our resources and uses, we have included in guidance a $200 million to $250 million borrowing later in 2016, which we have assumed will be a secured loan, and we expect to have the revolver drawn or CP outstanding equal about $300 million.
And I'll now turn the call back over to Angela, our operator, for the Q&A session."

I'm just going to refer you to Page 23, where we have our CapEx guidance. So what we've done is we've expected and this is on the 70,000 units set that will be our new same-store we think by the end of the year that we expect to spend about $2,200 dollars per unit. This year -- this year being 2015, we spent $1,800 effectively. And that was on the 93,000 same-store unit set. So what we've done is we try to think about this as a percentage of NOI, as a percentage of revenue. And with the company's new higher rent per unit and new higher NOI per unit, when you look at 2,200, that's about 7% of same-store revenue for the new 70,000 units, and about 10% of same-store NOI, and that's exactly -- really exactly identical to the $1,800 we spend as a percentage of lower same-store revenue per unit and lower same-store NOI per unit. So really proportionately it's about the same, on a per unit basis it just goes up just like our per unit rents are going up. I would say it's our in overtime, high-rise and midrise on a capital basis, will cost less as a percentage of NOI, than running a garden portfolio, but that will play out over a longer time period than just 2 years."

I think you'll see that supply skew towards in 2016, but as far as job growth in Seattle, we see that very strong in 2016, 2.3 almost 44,000 jobs expected in Seattle. In San Francisco, I would say we didn't see any softness in the fourth quarter, I think that's what you're asking I think the softness more appear right around the holidays and as we came into the new year I mean, when you look back for the past 2 years in San Francisco. Rents in January were up 15% over the previous year and then January of '14, rents were up 13% over the previous year. So you are just starting at a different point. And when you look at the makeup of pricing, both in San Francisco and the Peninsula, the urban core has been affected by what's being delivered down day-to-day. But the job growth outlooks down the Peninsula, I think are very favorable. I mean, every day we're reading about whether it's Oracle, whether it's Apple, whether it's the Citi, all these large companies, continue to lock up office space or land or have already started building other office headquarter. So I don't see any slowdown in the jobs in San Francisco. And I think the softness on the rate that we see today is very concentrated as a result of new supply."

The first question on the Archstone secured debt, except for the tax is we inherited, we inherited several hundred million of floating rate during expensive Archstone tax exempt debt. We have repaid all the secured debt that we inherited from that transaction, after repayment of the pool that we mentioned in the press release. On the second question, again, it's just an assumption, we haven't done a large secured debt pool in a while. It's also fairly small borrowing. The unsecured market really has a strong preference now for a larger borrowings and larger borrowers like us. So I wouldn't go-to-market on a non-index eligible $200 million unsecured deal. I go with something larger like $500 million. So given our relatively modest needs, my sense is we do a secure deal. We haven't done one in a couple of years a large pool. So it probably would be good to think that market out see what all the terms exactly are as well, but that's really more function just to size being relatively small."

So I tell you, we only get to $3, if we announce next quarter that we've sold a lot of what is in process now, very quickly. So that really is the way you get to the bottom of that range, it isn't because we contemplate the recession in our numbers. And adjusting this opportunity to go a little bit further and talk about the trend of FFO by quarter, because we're going to give you -- we've given you a guidance midpoint of $0.75 for the first quarter, and that it will go up, we think modestly every quarter and will be slightly over $0.80 by the time you get to the fourth quarter.

And finally, Mark Parrell will take you through how our operating outlook and transactional and other assumptions impact our 2016 earnings guidance, our regular and special dividends, our recent debt repayment activities, filing the Starwood sale and liquidity.
Before we get started, I wanted to make a couple of general comments because we all read and listen to the same things, the rest of you do, and we know that there is a lot of volatility around the globe and across the financial markets. And there are a lot of questions about how that is currently impacting or might soon impact the domestic economy, in general, and our business, in particular, because there've also been some reports of increasing apartment vacancy and declining rental rates. 
Like you, we don't have a crystal ball. All we can tell you is what we're seeing real time in our business. And what we're seeing is, some markets are a bit behind, while we had expected at this point, and others a bit ahead. But in total, portfolio-wide, we are where we expected to be 1 month into the year with 30 days forward visibility. And as in recent years, renewals tell a lot of the story. Renewal increases in November, December and January were all plus 6%, and we will also achieve plus 6% growth in renewal rents in February. Portfolio occupancy today is 96.1%, very much in line with our expectations and quite strong for this time of the year. All in all, we're pretty much right where we thought we would be when we gave our initial guidance for 2016 back in late October.
So with that said, I'll let David go into more detail about our markets, our current outlook for 2016 and why we think this year will be another good year for the apartment business and for Equity Residential."

During Q4, turnover continued to decline with a quarter-over-quarter reduction of 7% and gross move-outs. For the full year, turnover declined 40 basis points from 54.9% to 54.5%. And in net of intra-property tran",1941,"Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone. During Q4, turnover continued to decline with a quarter-over-quarter reduction of 7% and gross move-outs. For the full year, turnover declined 40 basis points from 54.9% to 54.5%. And in net of intra-property transfers, turnover decreased 50 basis points to 48.5% from 49%. 
Our continued focus on minimizing Q4 and Q1 lease expirations continues to produce more operational stability, as occupancy, once again, remained stronger through the historical Q4 seasonal slowdown. Move-outs to buy homes increased only slightly across many markets for the quarter and the full year. With rents continuing their rapid ascent across most markets, it should come as no surprise that affordability, our second largest category for move-outs, increased from 13% to 14.1% for full year. Yet demand for quality apartments in great locations has remained steady thus far.
Similar to 2015, we again started the year from a solid foundation of occupancy, exposure and pricing levels across most of our markets. Today, occupancy, as David mentioned, is 96.1%, and exposure is 20 basis points lower with net effective new lease rents up 3% year-over-year versus same week last year. 
While not the record-setting renewal increases we enjoyed in 2015, we achieved a 6.4% increase on our January offers, and February will deliver in the same range. These early indicators coupled with continued favorable job growth, fewer deliveries on our core markets, but more importantly, the submarkets that we operate in, gives us the confidence to stand by our preliminary revenue guidance range of 4.5% to 5.25%. However, we are mindful of the headwinds from the headlines and the potential odds and impact of the U.S. economy in a recessionary environment.
Our 2016 revenue guidance is, again, led by the West Coast, with San Francisco leading the way, followed by Los Angeles, which continues to show momentum in both new lease and renewal gains. Our 2016 buckets of revenue growth, again, includes San Francisco, Los Angeles, Seattle and the remainder of Southern California, all expected to exceed 5% revenue growth for the full year. Boston and New York Metro remained in the 3% to 5% bucket, as concentrated new supply in EQR submarkets continue to dampen pricing power for new leases. Washington, D.C., once again, remains in a bucket of their own, but we've projected revenue growth of 1% to 1.3% for full year 2016.
Our total portfolio assumptions based on 75,123 same-store units that drive the midpoint of guidance, our 2.3% embedded growth from 2015, 3.5% average new lease rent growth and 6% average gain on renewals. Occupancy and turnover for 2016 are modeled to be flat.
Expense results of 2% for the quarter were extremely favorable versus our forecast of 4.3%. Even with our optimistic adjustments that were made prior to our last earnings release, we were unable to predict the full impact of a commodity draught and record high temperatures, which allowed us to deliver full year expense growth of 2.5% versus the guidance of 3.1%. 
The 2 drivers of the 230 basis point pick up were approximately $4 million in Q4 were spread almost evenly between utilities and payroll, with the unseasonably warm weather materially influencing both. The rapid price decline across all relevant commodities combined with record warm temperatures through December allowed us to beat our original forecasted savings almost 3 folds for the quarter, resulting in an additional $2 million pick up across heating oil, natural gas and electric. Also, the warm temperatures combined with a 7% decline in Q4 move-outs allowed us to achieve our historical salary forecast, but the need for contract labor and over time was virtually nonexistent. This, in addition to favorable employee bonus and health insurance accruals, allowed us to achieve an additional $1.7 million in payroll savings for Q4, bringing our forecast of total of 4.3% down to the 2% for the quarter and 2.5% for the whole year.
Expense guidance for 2016 of 2.5% to 3.5% is, once again, driven by real estate tax growth of 5.25%, with 190 basis points of that 5.25% attributable to our New York portfolio 421 tax abatement burn off. Like 2015, we would expect minimal growth, if any, across the utility accounts. Payrolls command between 2.5% and 3%, and all other account lines will show flat-to-minimal growth as the impact have increased minimum wages and Affordable Care Act costs incurred by our outside vendors were already absorbed into our cost structure over the past 2 years.
So going around the horn and starting with Seattle, I'll give some brief working highlights, some revenue expectations and expected deliveries that combined influence our thought process for our full year 2016 revenue guidance.
Seattle will see an 8% decline in new deliveries from a little over 9,000 units in 2015 to approximately 7,200. Knowing that Amazon will continue its large capital investment and delivery of almost 4 million square feet of new office space in downtown and the continued migration of regional and corporate headquarters from the suburbs, Seattle should be able to absorb this new inventory with minimal disruption, just as it is done over the past 2 years and is evidenced by the 3,100 units that had been absorbed over the past 2 quarters.
San Francisco will once again [indiscernible] all EQR markets as constraints to new development are all around. However, like any market where there is concentration of new supply, near-term pricing pressure will always follow. As a result of the new deliveries in the urban core, pricing has appeared to revert to normal seasonal patterns with net effective new lease rents up only 4% today. As expected, properties closest to the urban core are experiencing the most pressure, while properties further down the peninsula continue to enjoy year-over-year rental rate growth in the mid-teens. With lease-up velocity exceeding normalized expectations, San Francisco Metro should experience rapid absorption and deliver another year of high-single-digit revenue growth as evidenced by our year-to-date billings that exceed 9.6%. 
While headlines are quick to recognize slowdown in VC tax spending, the large cap giants continue to buy, lease or build new office space in anticipation of future growth and elevated hiring. But as we all know, trees don't grow to the sky, but our dashboard tells us the fundamentals remain strong. Renewal offers issued through March remain in double digits, and if history plays out, we would expect new lease rents to seasonally adjust up from the mid-single digits we see today to higher levels as we move closer to peak leasing season.
With embedded revenue growth of 5.5%, renewal rates achieved averaging almost 10% and new lease rents averaging 7-plus percent. For the full year, we would expect our portfolio to deliver full year revenue growth in the high single digits.
Los Angeles fundamentals appear to be coming on strong. With the anticipation of a break-out year for the L.A. economy and the pro-business city government, the rebranding of downtown as a world-class city coupled with meaningful additions to infrastructure and transportation cause us to be very optimistic in L.A.'s ability to absorb the 7,600 new deliveries expected in 2016.
Given the concentrated nature of deliveries in the South Park and Hollywood submarkets, we see no major hurdles to strengthening fundamentals and revenue growth as net effective new lease rents are up 7.3%, with both occupancy and exposure significantly better positioned versus the same week last year.
Orange County and San Diego should continue to see above-average growth with 2016 deliveries of 3,600 and 2,400, respectively. These levels are on par or slightly less than 2015. With the concentration of assets delivered during 2015 being urban and in close proximity to a large percentage of our assets. We would expect to see better results in 2016 as pressure on new lease pricing subside.
Our Boston portfolio continues to face pricing pressure as 2015 back-loaded deliveries remain in lease up. With only 2,200 deliveries scheduled for 2016, which is a 62% decline, and a lower concentration in the Financial District and downtown. We would anticipate a window of improvement late this year and early into 2017 before an estimated 5,000 units are again delivered in 2017. To date, 19,000 units have been absorbed in the past 2 years without the disruption that one might expect. With GE announcing their headquarter relocation and the continued biotech-related job growth, Boston should deliver results very similar to what we achieved in 2015.
For New York Metro, we expect to deliver 3% revenue growth as new supply will impact certain submarkets. After delivering average annual revenue growth of 4.9% for the last 16 quarters, the performance of our Manhattan portfolio will be greatly influenced by almost 2,000 new units on the Upper West Side, which makes up almost 30% of total revenue for our New York Metro area. Most of these projects are luxury, with unit mixes that skewed towards 2 and 3-bedroom apartments. And of late have been more difficult to lease, and as a result ends up with a greater economic vacancy loss. While occupancies remain above 95%, we expect Upper West Side new lease rates to be flat or slightly positive until majority of these new deliveries are absorbed. We continue to see strong fundamentals and pricing in our other Manhattan submarkets, the Financial District, Gramercy and Chelsea. Collectively, these neighborhoods should deliver revenue growth in line with our historical averages that I noted earlier.
Another New York Metro hotspot is Jersey City or the Hudson Waterfront, where 1,000 new units were delivered in late 2015 and another 1,500 expected in 2016. All in consecrated a 1- to 2-mile radius. Thus far we've not felt the full impact, as year-to-date revenue growth is holding at 3%. Brooklyn also has delivered a number of new buildings, but these are north and further east of downtown, with the new supply being smaller in unit count and less desirable based on amenities and locations. We would expect moderate impact in Williamsburg and less so in Downtown Brooklyn, as both EQR communities in this location are delivering in excess of 4.8% revenue growth through February.
Again, as new supply comes online in consecrated areas, new lease pricing will be under pressure, and we see that in our net effective rates today. However, occupancy remained strong across the portfolio at 96.1%. Renewal rate growth should average plus 4% for the portfolio, that combined will produce full year revenue growth of approximately 3%.
Washington, D.C. will experience declines in deliveries to approximately 11,000 units in 2016 after absorbing over 28,000 units in the previous 2 years. With positive revenue growth in Q4 and full year, we are cautiously optimistic about near-term performance. Should absorption maintain its velocity, D.C. should begin to deliver more favorable revenue growth as new lease pricing pressures ease. With job growth in the professional services sector continuing to improve, an increase in D.C. business activity as a result of the election year and more of the 2016 deliveries in the suburbs versus Arlington in D.C., we continue to be optimistic about the long-term performance of our portfolio.
In summary, we continue to see favorable fundamentals across all of our markets. At this point, in the apartment rental cycle it is much too early to be influenced by the negative headlines that we all read each and every day. We remain focused on what the data tells us, and we'll respond appropriately. Today, our dashboard tell us that not much has changed and that apartment fundamentals, at least for the first quarter, remain strong, leading us to believe that 2016 will be yet another year of performance above long-term trend."

We're very pleased we recently closed our sale of 72 noncore assets, totaling 23,262 apartment units to Starwood, for $5.365 billion or $231,000 per unit. I'm particularly pleased to realize an 11.1% unleveraged IRR on these investments, inclusive of indirect management costs over an extremely long-hold period. This sale was result of an incredible effort by a lot of folks here in EQR, who works practically around-the-clock to get this deal done, and I thank all of them for their dedication and commitment. And I also thank those who left the company with the sale of this portfolio, some of whom had been with us for more than 20 years, and we're most grateful to all these people for their service to our residents and the company.
On our last earnings call when this transaction of Starwood was first announced, we explained that this disposition accomplished several things for us. First, we realized a very good pricing on assets and markets not considered core for us and on some assets in our core markets that didn't quite fit our long-term strategic vision. The second thing we accomplished is that we can now focus solely on our strategy of owning, building and operating assets in higher density urban locations with close proximity to public transportation, job centers and other amenities that cities have to offer. As we've discussed with many of you since the original announcement, this sale and the sale of $700 million of additional assets in 2016 would result in a special dividend of $9 to $11 per share. And that decision was made due to the challenge we saw of trying to recycle $6 billion of capital in today's marketplace, where we continue to see strong institutional demand for core assets in gateway coastal cities and very competitive pricing as a result of that demand.
We continue to believe and are grateful for the support of so many of you who had agreed with us, and returning much of these proceeds to our investors through a special dividend in a balance sheet-neutral way is the best capital allocation decision you can make on behalf of our shareholders.
Since our original announcement of the Starwood transaction, demand for multi-family assets in our core markets has continued unabated, and so we've considered the sale of several additional assets. But due to either operational challenges or submarket issues or pricing potential that we simply thought too good to pass up might represent additional timely opportunities to monetize our interest in certain assets and modestly increase the size of this year's special dividend.
Last week, for instance, we sold 1 of 3 assets acquired for the macro family in 2010, when we paid a total of $475 million for the entire portfolio. This particular property, River Tower, was sold for $390 million or $1.2 million per door at a yield in low 3s for a 5-year unleveraged IRR, inclusive of indirect management costs of 14%. This sale was previously contemplated and was accounted for in our original special dividend guidance of $9 to $11 per share. In addition, we've also started work on the potential disposition of another $600 million of possible sales, that, if consummated, could increase that dividend by another $1-or-so per share, and hence, the new range of $10 to $12 per share noted in last night's press release. I wanted to be publicly clear, because I'm sure many of you have questions about this. We backed up the truck once with the sale of Starwood, we have no intention of doing so again. As I said, we're working on a limited number of additional sales yet this year that could bring our special dividend up to the $10 to $12 per share.
Our guidance also assumes that we will sell an additional $300 million by the end of the year, 100% of which would be redeployed from the new acquisitions. And that level of activities accounted on our guidance towards the back half of the year at a negative yield spread of 75 basis points. This additional $300 million of activity will only occur if we can find suitable investments for which we're willing to trade out our current assets. So the guidance provided in the press release is for $7.4 billion of dispositions, comprised of: $6.1 billion we announced last October; nearly $400 million for River Tower; another $600 million expected to be sold during the year, adding an additional $1 per share to our special dividend; and $300 million of sales that will occur if, and only if, we can find suitable reinvestment opportunities.
Our acquisition guidance of $600 million is roughly $300 million of 1031 reinvestments to cover some very large tax gains of certain unaffiliated limited partners as a result of the Starwood transaction, and $300 million of additional possible acquisitions in the back half of the year and matched up with dispositions in the normal course of managing our portfolio.
I'll now turn the call over to our CFO, Mark Parrell."
28209,322068815,925941,"Equity Residential, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2016",2016-02-03,"Earnings Calls","Equity Residential","Executives","Thank you, David. I want to take a few minutes this morning to talk about our guidance for 2016, that includes both the annual dividend and the special dividends, our recent debt prepayment activity, and then I'll close with the discussion of sources and",1191,"Thank you, David. I want to take a few minutes this morning to talk about our guidance for 2016, that includes both the annual dividend and the special dividends, our recent debt prepayment activity, and then I'll close with the discussion of sources and uses in 2016.
Our range for normalized FFO for 2016 is $3 to $3.20 per share. This range is larger than usual due to some of the uncertainties over transaction timing. And I'm going to walk you through some of the bigger highlights at this point. The biggest reconciling item between 2015 and 2016 normalized FFO is, of course, the reduction we will experience in net operating income of about $345 million, that's about $0.90 per share from our transaction activity including Starwood.
The second big item going the other way is the use of approximately $1.7 billion of those disposition proceeds to prepay debt, that creates an $80 million or $0.21 per share benefit or improvement in interest expense. I'll pause here and note, that we're expecting about $10 million decline in capitalized interest in 2016 versus 2015, and I did include that in the $0.21 per share improvement number that I just gave you.
So once you get passed the transaction and debt activity, our normalized FFO is driven by the usual suspects, and that includes an increase of $0.23 per share in same-store NOI and an increase of $0.12 per share from lease-ups. And the final items are 'just a variety of other individually less material items, that reduced our normalized FFO estimate for 2016 by about $0.02 per share, and they include among other things lower income from unconsolidated entities and that's due to the sales in 2015 of the last due Archstone JV operating assets. So this brings our normalized FFO guidance midpoint for 2016 to $3.10 per share.
So now I'm going to move on to the dividends. For the annual dividend, as you know, it is our intention to pay 65% of the midpoint of our normalized FFO guidance as our annual common share dividend. Given the midpoint I just discussed, of $3.10 per share, we would expect to pay $2.015 per share for the year or $0.50375 per share per quarter in 2016. Also we expect to pay 2 special dividends, which will total between $10 and $12 a share. The first special dividend is anticipated to be paid in the second quarter and is expected to be about $8 per share. There is less variability in our minds about the size and timing of this first special dividend, given that the Starwood sale and some of these other sales have already occurred. But of course, our board of trustees retain discretion on all dividend matters. The second special dividend has been modeled in our guidance at $3 per share based on our existing disposition guidance number as well as numerous assumptions we had to make about the exact timing and amount of the gain per asset and our 2016 operating income and other tax receivables. Similarly, the timing of the payment of the second special dividend is less certain in our minds, and we'll like the amount of that dividend ultimately depend on when these sales close, the number of sales that close and certain other tax variables.
Now onto the bond tender and our other recent debt repayment activities. Consistent with what we said on the earnings call back in October -- over the last 2 weeks, the company has prepaid prior to maturity a total of $1.7 billion in debt through an unsecured bond tender and early repayment of a large secured debt pool. In mid-March, we also repay, using the cash we now have on hand, the $270 million of March 2016 unsecured bonds that were not tendered. Collectively, the company will incur approximately $112 million in prepayment penalties, and that will be recorded as additional interest expense in the first quarter, and it will impact EPS and FFO but will not impact normalized funds from operations. These debt repayment activities were funded with a portion of the proceeds from the Starwood sale and our other recent sales and are intended to maintain, and they do, in fact, actually slightly enhance the company's already strong credit profile. We now expect net debt to EBITDA for 2016 to be about 5.8x and fixed charge coverage to be about 3.6x, and this compares to our already strong 2015 net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 6.1x and fixed charge coverage of 3.5x. And I'm computing all these fixed charge coverage ratios using the more stringent rating agency methodology, which does not reduce interest expense by capitalized interest.
Also, our near-term maturities are now greatly reduced, and in fact, we currently have only approximately $330 million of debt maturing in 2016, consisting of $60 million in secured debt that matures a little later in 2016, plus the $270 million of unsecured notes due in March 2016 that were not tendered, as I discussed previously. Our 2017 maturities have now been cut in half and now total about $600 million. 
The company's liquidity position is excellent. Currently, we have $3.5 billion in cash, and our $2.5 billion revolving line of credit is undrawn. We also have no commercial paper outstanding. At the end of 2016, we expect to have about $50 million in cash, and the revolving line of credit and the commercial paper program, between the 2, will have about $300 million balance. 
And that is certainly a lot of inflows and outflows in 1 year. So I'm going to take a minute and just give you a little background on that and the bigger pieces. 
For the full year 2016, we expect net inflows from buys and sales of about $6.8 billion. To-date, we have sold approximately $5.9 billion, which is inclusive of Starwood, and we have not acquired any properties. We have assumed paying about $4.25 billion in special dividends. As I just said, we expect to pay the first in second quarter 2016 in the amount of about $3 billion and the second later in 2016 in the amount of approximately $1.25 billion. We anticipate repaying approximately $2.1 billion in total debt during 2016. As mentioned earlier, we have already retired approximately $1.7 billion. We further expect to spend about $250 million during the year, that's mostly for the prepayment penalties I referred to previously and about $40 million or $45 million of transaction cost on the dispositions. We expect to spend about $600 million in development activities during 2016, and the final piece of the puzzle is positive cash flow from operations of about $200 million, and that $200 million number is net of our annual dividend and our capital expenditures.
In order to balance our sources and uses, we have included in guidance a $200 million to $250 million borrowing later in 2016, which we have assumed will be a secured loan, and we expect to have the revolver drawn or to have CP outstanding equal to about $300 million.
And I'll now turn the call back over to Angela, our operator, for the Q&A session."

And deals that we could start if we feel the desire to do so of similar amount in 2016. Mark's guidance assumes about $350 million of starts. So as Mark noted in answering the last question, we've seen our  development exposure come down considerably. Land is very expensive, construction cost are up, yields are down. And as we look at the yields that are available in the marketplace, we just don't think they make sense for us. We're also not inclined to go further out into the suburbs in order to sort of change yield, because we are -- our strategies is to be focused on the urban core, we think that the total returns will perform better in the urban core than the suburb.
So there is not a function of us, so we think this amount as a percentage of our equity footings or our balance sheet of that percentage, we just look for opportunities. And when we find one that we think makes sense for us, we will not be shy pursuing them, but they are just getting more and more difficult to find. We did acquire some sites in San Francisco in the SoMa district last year, 3 properties which were assembled, and we'll work on those going forward, and we'll see those might be a potential 2017 start, but we've been quite clear, I think, for quite some time after an elevated level of starts in that $1 billion range as a result of the land sites that came to us in the Archstone transactions that, that number would likely come down and indeed, it has.

This year -- this year being 2015, we spent $1,800 effectively. And that was on the 93,000 same-store unit set. So what we've done is we try to think about this as a percentage of NOI, as a percentage of revenue. And with the company's new higher rent per unit and new higher NOI per unit, when you look at $2,200, that's about 7% of same-store revenue for the new 70,000 units, and about 10% of same-store NOI, and that's exactly -- really exactly identical to the $1,801 we spend as a percentage of lower same-store revenue per unit and lower same-store NOI per unit. So really proportionately, it's about the same. On a per unit basis, it goes up, just like our per unit rents are going up. I would say it's our in contention that over time, high-rise and mid-rise on a capital basis will cost less as a percentage of NOI than running a garden portfolio, but that contention will play out over a longer time period than just 2 years."

Rents in January were up 15% over the previous year. And then January of '14, rents were up 13% over the previous year. So you're just starting at a different point. And when you look at the makeup of pricing, both in San Francisco and the Peninsula, the urban core is being affected by what's being delivered down there today. But the job growth outlooks down the Peninsula, I think are very favorable.

We have repaid all the secured debt that we inherited from that transaction, after repayment of the pool that we mentioned in the press release. On the second question, again, it's just an assumption, we haven't done a large secured debt pool in a while. It's also fairly small borrowing. The unsecured market really has a strong preference now for a larger borrowings and larger borrowers like us. So I wouldn't go to market on a non-index eligible $200 million unsecured deal. I'd go with something larger like $500 million. So given our relatively modest needs, my sense is we do a secure deal. We haven't done one in a couple of years a large pool.

What we do here, Tayo, is we think about what the NOI range would give us from a sense on either side. And then we think about our acquisitions and dispositions, which are usually -- we know them within a certain fairly close tolerance. The lower end of that range is only accessible if dispositions were accelerated. We do not get there from our NOI numbers. And as David Santee has indicated, we have no reason to believe we'd be certainly anywhere below our NOI guidance range. So I tell you, we only get to $3, if we announce next quarter that we've sold a lot of what is in process now, very quickly. So that really is the way you get to the bottom of that range, it isn't because we contemplate the recession in our numbers. And I'll just take this opportunity to go a little bit further and talk about the trend of FFO by quarter, because we're going to give you -- we've given you a guidance midpoint of $0.75 for the first quarter, and that will go up, we think, modestly every quarter and will be slightly over $0.80 by the time you get to the fourth quarter. So as you look forward, it isn't the same sharp increase you're used to seeing from us, because there is some dilution. But I think at the end, you'll still see a number $0.80-or-so by the fourth quarter and probably a little bit higher."

Before we get started, though, I want to make a couple of general comments because we all read and listen to the same things the rest of you do, and we know that there's a lot of volatility around the globe and across the financial markets. And there are a lot of questions about how that is currently impacting or might soon impact the domestic economy in general and our business in particular. Because there've also been some reports of increasing apartment vacancy and declining rental rates. 
Like you, we don't have a crystal ball. All we can tell you is what we're seeing realtime in our business. And what we're seeing is some markets a bit behind what we had expected at this point and others a bit ahead. But in total, portfolio-wide, we are where we expected to be 1 month into the year with 30 days forward visibility. And as in recent years, renewals tell a lot of the story. Renewal increases in November, December and January were all plus 6%, and we will also achieve plus 6% growth in renewal rents in February. Portfolio occupancy today at 96.1%, very much in line with our expectations and quite strong for this time of year. All in all, we're pretty much right where we thought we would be when we gave our initial guidance for 2016 back in late October.
So with that said, I'll let David go into more detail about our markets, our current outlook for 2016 and why we think this year will be another good year for the apartment business and for Equity Residential."
28209,322068815,926070,"Equity Residential, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2016",2016-02-03,"Earnings Calls","Equity Residential","Executives","Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone. During Q4, turnover continued to decline with a quarter-over-quarter reduction of 7% in gross move-outs. For the full year, turnover declined 40 basis points from 54.9% to 54.5%. And then net of intra-property tra",1942,"Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone. During Q4, turnover continued to decline with a quarter-over-quarter reduction of 7% in gross move-outs. For the full year, turnover declined 40 basis points from 54.9% to 54.5%. And then net of intra-property transfers, turnover decreased 50 basis points to 48.5% from 49%. 
Our continued focus on minimizing Q4 and Q1 lease expirations continues to produce more operational stability as occupancy, once again, remained stronger through the historical Q4 seasonal slowdown. Move-outs to buy homes increased only slightly across many markets for the quarter and the full year. With rents continuing their rapid ascent across most markets, it should come as no surprise that affordability, our second-largest category for move-outs, increased from 13% to 14.1% for full year. Yet demand for quality apartments in great locations has remained steady thus far.
Similar to 2015, we again start the year from a solid foundation of occupancy, exposure and pricing levels across most of our markets. Today, occupancy, as David mentioned, is 96.1% and exposure is 20 basis points lower with net effective new lease rents up 3.3% [ph] year-over-year versus same week last year. 
While not the record-setting renewal increases we enjoyed in 2015, we achieved a 6.4% increase on our January offers, and February will deliver in the same range. These early indicators coupled with continued favorable job growth, fewer deliveries on our core markets but, more importantly, the submarkets that we operate in, gives us the confidence to stand by our preliminary revenue guidance range of 4.5% to 5.25%. However, we are mindful of the headwinds from the headlines and the potential odds and impact of the U.S. economy in a recessionary environment.
Our 2016 revenue guidance is, again, led by the West Coast with San Francisco leading the way followed by Los Angeles, which continues to show momentum in both new lease and renewal gains. Our 2016 buckets of revenue growth, again, include San Francisco, Los Angeles, Seattle and the remainder of Southern California, all expected to exceed 5% revenue growth for the full year. Boston and New York Metro remain in the 3% to 5% bucket as concentrated new supply in EQR submarkets continue to dampen pricing power for new leases. Washington, D.C., once again remains in a bucket of their own, but we've projected revenue growth of 1% to 1.3% for full year 2016.
Our total portfolio assumptions based on 75,123 same-store units that drive the midpoint of guidance, our 2.3% embedded growth from 2015, 3.5% average new lease rent growth and 6% average gain on renewals. Occupancy and turnover for 2016 are modeled to be flat.
Expense results of 2% for the quarter were extremely favorable versus our forecast of 4.3%. Even with our optimistic adjustments that were made prior to our last earnings release, we were unable to predict the full impact of a commodity drought and record high temperatures, which allowed us to deliver full year expense growth of 2.5% versus guidance of 3.1%. 
The 2 drivers of the 230 basis point pickup or approximately $4 million in Q4 were spread almost evenly between utilities and payroll with the unseasonably warm weather materially influencing both. The rapid price decline across all relevant commodities combined with record warm temperatures through December allowed us to beat our original forecasted savings almost threefold for the quarter, resulting in an additional $2 million pickup across heating oil, natural gas and electric. Also, the warm temperatures combined with a 7% decline in Q4 move-outs allowed us to achieve our historical salary forecast, but the need for contract labor and overtime was virtually nonexistent. This, in addition to favorable employee bonus and health insurance accruals, allowed us to achieve an additional $1.7 million in payroll savings for Q4, bringing our forecasted total of 4.3% down to the 2% for the quarter and 2.5% for the full year.
Expense guidance for 2016 of 2.5% to 3.5% is, once again, driven by real estate tax growth of 5.25% with 190 basis points of that 5.25% attributable to our New York portfolio 421 tax abatement burnoff. Like 2015, we would expect minimal growth, if any, across the utility accounts. Payrolls come in between 2.5% and 3%, and all other account lines will show flat to minimal growth as the impact of increased minimum wages and Affordable Care Act costs incurred by our outside vendors were already absorbed into our cost structure over the past 2 years.
So going around the horn and starting with Seattle, I'll give some brief market highlights, some revenue expectations and expected deliveries that, combined, influence our thought process for our full year 2016 revenue guidance.
Seattle will see an 8% decline in new deliveries from a little over 9,000 units in 2015 to approximately 7,200. Knowing that Amazon will continue its large capital investment and delivery of almost 4 million square feet of new office space in downtown and the continued migration of regional and corporate headquarters from the suburbs, Seattle should be able to absorb this new inventory with minimal disruption, just as it has done over the past 2 years and is evidenced by the 3,100 units that have been absorbed over the past 2 quarters.
San Francisco will once again lead all EQR markets as constraints to new development are all around. However, like any market where there is concentration of new supply, near-term pricing pressure will always follow. As a result of the new deliveries in the urban core, pricing has appeared to revert to normal seasonal patterns with net effective new lease rents up only 4% today. As expected, properties closest to the urban core are experiencing the most pressure, while properties further down the peninsula continue to enjoy year-over-year rental rate growth in the mid-teens. With lease-up velocity exceeding normalized expectations, San Francisco Metro should experience rapid absorption and deliver another year of high single digit revenue growth as evidenced by our year-to-date billings that exceed 9.6%. 
While headlines are quick to recognize the slowdown in VC [ph] tech spending, the large-cap giants continue to buy, lease or build new office space in anticipation of future growth and elevated hiring. But as we all know, trees don't grow to the sky, but our dashboard tells us the fundamentals remain strong. Renewal offers issued through March remain in double digits, and if history plays out, we would expect new lease rents to seasonally adjust up from the mid-single digits we see today to higher levels as we move closer to peak leasing season.
With embedded revenue growth of 5.5%, renewal rates achieved averaging almost 10% and new lease rents averaging 7-plus percent. For the full year, we would expect our portfolio to deliver full year revenue growth in the high single digits.
Los Angeles fundamentals appear to be coming on strong. With the anticipation of a breakout year for the L.A. economy and the pro-business city government, the rebranding of downtown as a world-class city coupled with meaningful additions to infrastructure and transportation cause us to be very optimistic in L.A.'s ability to absorb the 7,600 new deliveries expected in 2016.
Given the concentrated nature of deliveries in the South Park and Hollywood submarkets, we see no major hurdles to strengthening fundamentals and revenue growth as net effective new lease rents are up 7.3% with both occupancy and exposure significantly better positioned versus the same week last year.
Orange County and San Diego should continue to see above-average growth with 2016 deliveries of 3,600 and 2,400, respectively. These levels are on par or slightly less than 2015. With the concentration of assets delivered during 2015 being in Irvine and in close proximity to a large percentage of our assets, we would expect to see better results in 2016 as pressure on new lease pricing subsides.
Our Boston portfolio continues to face pricing pressure as 2015 backloaded deliveries remain in lease-up. With only 2,200 deliveries scheduled for 2016, which is a 62% decline, and a lower concentration in the Financial District and Downtown, we would anticipate a window of improvement late this year and early into 2017 before an estimated 5,000 units are again delivered in 2017. To-date, 19,000 units have been absorbed in the past 2 years without the disruption that one might expect. With GE announcing their headquarter relocation and the continued biotech-related job growth, Boston should deliver results very similar to what we achieved in 2015.
For New York Metro, we expect to deliver 3% revenue growth as new supply will impact certain submarkets. After delivering average annual revenue growth of 4.9% for the last 16 quarters, the performance of our Manhattan portfolio will be greatly influenced by almost 2,000 new units on the Upper West Side, which makes up almost 30% of total revenue for our New York Metro area. Most of these projects are luxury with unit mixes that skew towards 2- and 3-bedroom apartments and, of late, have been more difficult to lease, and as a result ends up with a greater economic vacancy loss. 
While occupancy changes [ph] remain above 95%, we expect Upper West Side new lease rates to be flat or slightly positive until majority of these new deliveries are absorbed. We continue to see strong fundamentals in pricing in our other Manhattan submarkets: The Financial District, Gramercy and Chelsea. Collectively, these neighborhoods should deliver revenue growth in line with our historical averages that I noted earlier.
Another New York Metro hotspot is Jersey City or the Hudson Waterfront, where over 1,000 new units were delivered in late 2015 and another 1,500 expected in 2016, all concentrated in a 1- to 2-mile radius. Thus far, we have not felt the full impact, as year-to-date revenue growth is holding at 3%. Brooklyn will also deliver a number of new buildings, but these are north and further east of downtown with new supply being smaller in unit count and less desirable based on amenities and locations. We would expect moderate impact in Williamsburg and less so in Downtown Brooklyn as both EQR communities in this location are delivering in excess of 4.8% revenue growth through February.
Again, as new supply comes online in concentrated areas, new lease pricing will be under pressure, and we see that in our net effective rents today. However, occupancy remained strong across the portfolio at 96.1%. Renewal rate growth should average plus 4% for the portfolio that combined will produce full year revenue growth of approximately 3%.
Washington, D.C., will experience declines in deliveries to approximately 11,000 units in 2016 after absorbing over 28,000 units in the previous 2 years. With positive revenue growth in Q4 and full year, we are cautiously optimistic about near-term performance. Should absorption maintain its velocity, D.C. should begin to deliver more favorable revenue growth as new lease pricing pressures ease. With job growth in the professional services sector continuing to improve, an increase in D.C. business activity as a result of the election year and more of the 2016 deliveries in the suburbs versus Arlington in D.C., we continue to be optimistic about the long-term performance of our portfolio.
In summary, we continue to see favorable fundamentals across all of our markets. At this point in the apartment rental cycle it is much too early to be influenced by the negative headlines that we all read each and every day. We remain focused on what the data tells us, and we'll respond appropriately. To-date, our dashboards tell us that not much has changed and that apartment fundamentals, at least for the first quarter, remain strong, leading us to believe that 2016 will be yet another year of performance above long-term trends."

The second thing we accomplished is that we can now focus solely on our strategy of owning, building and operating assets in higher-density urban locations with close proximity to public transportation, job centers and other amenities that cities have to offer. As we've discussed with many of you since the original announcement, this sale and the sale of $700 million of additional assets in 2016 would result in a special dividend of $9 to $11 per share. And that decision was made due to the challenge we saw of trying to recycle $6 billion of capital in today's marketplace where we continue to see strong institutional demand for core assets in gateway coastal cities and very competitive pricing as a result of that demand.
We continue to believe and are grateful for the support of so many of you who had -- agree with us, that returning much of these proceeds to our investors through a special dividend in a balance sheet neutral way is the best capital allocation decision you can make on behalf of our shareholders.
Since our original announcement of the Starwood transaction, demand for multifamily assets in our core markets has continued unabated, and so we've considered the sale of several additional assets. But due to either operational challenges or submarket issues or pricing potential that we simply thought too good to pass up might represent additional timely opportunities to monetize our interest in certain assets and modestly increase the size of this year's special dividend.
Last week, for instance, we sold 1 of 3 assets acquired for the macro family in 2010 when we paid a total of $475 million for the entire portfolio. This particular property, River Tower, was sold for $390 million or $1.2 million per door at a yield in the low 3s for a 5-year unleveraged IRR inclusive of indirect management costs of 14%. This sale was previously contemplated and was accounted for in our original special dividend guidance of $9 to $11 per share. In addition, we've also started work on the potential disposition of another $600 million of possible sales that, if consummated, could increase that dividend by another $1-or-so per share, and hence, the new range of $10 to $12 per share noted in last night's press release. I want to be perfectly clear because I'm sure many of you have questions about this. We backed up the truck once with the sale of Starwood. We have no intention of doing so again. As I said, we're working on a limited number of additional sales yet this year that could bring our special dividend up to the $10 to $12 per share.
Our guidance also assumes that we will sell an additional $300 million by the end of the year, 100% of which would be redeployed through the new acquisitions. And that level of activities accounted for in our guidance towards the back half of the year at a negative yield spread of 75 basis points. This additional $300 million of activity will only occur if we can find suitable investments for which we are willing to trade out of current assets. So the guidance provided in the press release is for $7.4 billion of dispositions comprised of the $6.1 billion we announced last October; nearly $400 million for River Tower; another $600 million expected to be sold during the year, adding an additional $1 per share to our special dividend; and $300 million of sales that will occur if and only if we can find suitable reinvestment opportunities.
Our acquisition guidance of $600 million is roughly $300 million of 1031 reinvestments to cover some very large tax gains of certain unaffiliated limited partners as a result of the Starwood transaction and $300 million of additional possible acquisitions in the back half of the year and matched up with dispositions in the normal course of managing our portfolio.
I'll now turn the call over to our CFO, Mark Parrell."
28209,322068815,926070,"Equity Residential, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2016",2016-02-03,"Earnings Calls","Equity Residential","Executives","Thank you, David. I want to take a few minutes this morning to talk about our guidance for 2016, and that includes both the annual dividend and the special dividends, our recent debt prepayment activity, and then I'll close with the discussion of sources",1197,"Thank you, David. I want to take a few minutes this morning to talk about our guidance for 2016, and that includes both the annual dividend and the special dividends, our recent debt prepayment activity, and then I'll close with the discussion of sources and uses in 2016.
Our range for normalized FFO for 2016 is $3 to $3.20 per share. This range is larger than usual due to some of the uncertainties over transaction timing. And I'm going to walk you through some of the bigger highlights at this point. The biggest reconciling item between 2015 and 2016 normalized FFO is, of course, the reduction we will experience in net operating income of about $345 million. That's about $0.90 per share from our transaction activity, including Starwood.
The second big item going the other way is the use of approximately $1.7 billion of those disposition proceeds to prepay debt. That creates an $80 million or $0.21 per share benefit or improvement in interest expense. I will pause here and note that we're expecting about a $10 million decline in capitalized interest in 2016 versus 2015, and I did include that in the $0.21 per share improvement number that I just gave you.
So once you get past the transaction and debt activity, our normalized FFO is driven by the usual suspects, and that includes an increase of $0.23 per share in same-store NOI and an increase of $0.12 per share from lease-ups. And the final items are just a variety of other individually less material items that reduced our normalized FFO estimate for 2016 by about $0.02 per share, and they include, among other things, lower income from unconsolidated entities, and that's due to the sales in 2015 of the last few Archstone JV operating assets. So this brings our normalized FFO guidance midpoint for 2016 to $3.10 per share.
So now I'm going to move on to the dividends. For the annual dividend, as you know, it is our intention to pay 65% of the midpoint of our normalized FFO guidance as our annual common share dividend. Given the midpoint I just discussed, of $3.10 per share, we would expect to pay $2.015 per share for the year or $0.50375 per share per quarter in 2016. Also, we expect to pay 2 special dividends, which will total between $10 and $12 a share. The first special dividend is anticipated to be paid in the second quarter and is expected to be about $8 per share. There's less variability in our minds about the size and timing of this first special dividend, given that the Starwood sale and some of these other sales have already occurred. But of course, our board of trustees retains discretion on all dividend matters. The second special dividend has been modeled in our guidance at $3 per share based on our existing disposition guidance number as well as numerous assumptions we had to make about the exact timing and amount of the gain per asset and our 2016 operating income and other tax variables. Similarly, the timing of the payment of the second special dividend is less certain in our minds and will, like the amount of that dividend, ultimately depend on when these sales close, the number of sales that close and certain other tax variables.
Now onto the bond tender and our other recent debt repayment activities. Consistent with what we said on the earnings call back in October, over the last 2 weeks, the company has prepaid prior to maturity a total of $1.7 billion in debt through an unsecured bond tender and early repayment of a large secured debt pool. In mid-March, we also repay, using the cash we now have on hand, the $270 million of March 2016 unsecured bonds that were not tendered. Collectively, the company will incur approximately $112 million in prepayment penalties, and that will be recorded as additional interest expense in the first quarter, and it will impact EPS and FFO but will not impact normalized funds from operations. These debt repayment activities were funded with a portion of the proceeds from the Starwood sale and our other recent sales and are intended to maintain, and they do in fact actually slightly enhance the company's already strong credit profile. We now expect net debt to EBITDA for 2016 to be about 5.8x and fixed charge coverage to be about 3.6x, and this compares to our already strong 2015 net debt to EBITDA ratio of 6.1x and fixed charge coverage of 3.5x. And I'm computing all these fixed charge coverage ratios using the more stringent rating agency methodology, which does not reduce interest expense by capitalized interest.
Also, our near-term maturities are now greatly reduced, and in fact, we currently have only approximately $330 million of debt maturing in 2016, consisting of $60 million in secured debt -- that matures a little later in 2016 -- plus the $270 million of unsecured notes due in March 2016 that were not tendered as I discussed previously. Our 2017 maturities have now been cut in half and now total about $600 million. 
The company's liquidity position is excellent. Currently, we have $3.5 billion in cash, and our $2.5 billion revolving line of credit is undrawn. We also have no commercial paper outstanding. At the end of 2016, we expect to have about $50 million in cash, and the revolving line of credit and the commercial paper program, between the 2, will have about a $300 million balance. 
And that is certainly a lot of inflows and outflows in 1 year. So I'm going to take a minute and just give you a little background on that and the bigger pieces. 
For the full year 2016, we expect net inflows from buys and sales of about $6.8 billion. To-date, we have sold approximately $5.9 billion, which is inclusive of Starwood, and we have not acquired any properties. We have assumed paying about $4.25 billion in special dividends. As I just said, we expect to pay the first in second quarter 2016 in the amount of about $3 billion and the second later in 2016 in the amount of approximately $1.25 billion. We anticipate repaying approximately $2.1 billion in total debt during 2016. As mentioned earlier, we have already retired approximately $1.7 billion. We further expect to spend about $250 million during the year. That's mostly for the prepayment penalties I referred to previously and about $40 million or $45 million of transaction costs on the dispositions. We expect to spend about $600 million in development activities during 2016, and the final piece of the puzzle is positive cash flow from operations of about $200 million, and that $200 million number is net of our annual dividend and our capital expenditures.
In order to balance our sources and uses, we have included in guidance a $200 million to $250 million borrowing later in 2016, which we have assumed will be a secured loan, and we expect to have the revolver drawn or to have CP outstanding equal to about $300 million.
And I'll now turn the call back over to Angela, our operator, for the Q&A session."

And deals that we could start if we feel the desire to do so of similar amount in 2016. Mark's guidance assumes about $350 million of starts. So as Mark noted in answering the last question, we've seen our  development exposure come down considerably. Land is very expensive. Construction costs are up. Yields are down. And as we look at the yields that are available in the marketplace, we just don't think that they make sense for us. We're also not inclined to go further out into the suburbs in order to sort of chase yield because we -- our strategy is to be focused on the urban core. We think that the total returns will perform better in the urban core than in the suburb. So it is not a function of us saying we want this amount as a percentage of our equity footings or our balance sheet or that percentage. We just look for opportunities, and when we find ones we think make sense for us, we will not be shy pursuing them, but they are just getting more and more difficult to find. We did acquire some sites in San Francisco in the SoMa district last year, 3 properties which were assembled, and we'll work on those going forward, and we'll see those might be a potential 2017 start, but we've been quite clear, I think, for quite some time that after an elevated level of starts in that $1 billion range as a result of the land sites that came to us in the Archstone transaction that, that number would likely come down, and indeed it has. We're happy where we are. If we can find opportunities that we think make sense for more, we'll be happy to do more.

This year -- this year being 2015, we spent $1,800 effectively. But that was on the 93,000 same-store unit set. So what we've done is we try to think about this as a percentage of NOI, as a percentage of revenue. And with the company's new higher rent per unit and new higher NOI per unit, when you look at $2,200, that's about 7% of same-store revenue for the new 70,000 units and about 10% of same-store NOI, and that's exactly -- really exactly identical to the $1,801 we spend as a percentage of lower same-store revenue per unit and lower same-store NOI per unit. So really proportionately, it's about the same. Though, on a per-unit basis, it goes up just like our per-unit rents are going up. I would say, it's our contention that, over time, high-rise and mid-rise on a capital basis will cost less as a percentage of NOI than running a garden portfolio, but that contention will play out over a longer time period than just 2 years."

I think perhaps there could be some short-term dislocation in the quality of product that is being delivered in New York. I mean, the only way you can build an apartment building in New York is through a 421-a subsidy and the rents -- the rents command at top end of the market, but there are plenty of people that make considerable amounts of money that can afford those types of buildings. So I think what you see is what we see in every other market when we have a concentration of delivery is there's near-term impact. And I don't see New York falling off a cliff. I mean, it's kind of a #1 place that people want to be in the world. And I think should it -- there would be any short-term dislocation, it will come back even stronger than it had been before as it has every other time that it's taken a dip. San Francisco, I just think that even though you're delivering new apartments in the urban core, the area is still underserved as far as affordable housing. And when you look at the job projections across San Jose, San Francisco and Oakland, you're looking at 122,000 jobs in 2016 and delivering only 6,000 apartments.

I think that the softness more appeared right around the holidays and as we came into the new year, I mean, when you look back over the past 2 years in San Francisco, rents in January were up 15% over the previous year. And then January of '14, rents were up 13% over the previous year. So you're just starting at a different point. And when you look at the makeup of pricing both in San Francisco and the Peninsula, the urban core is being affected by what's being delivered down there today. But the job growth outlooks down the Peninsula, I think, are very favorable. I mean, every day we're reading about whether it's Oracle, whether it's Apple, whether it's Airbnb in the city, all these large companies continue to lock up office space or land or have already started building other office headquarters.

We have repaid all the secured debt that we inherited from that transaction after repayment of the pool that we mentioned in the press release. On the second question, again, it's just an assumption. We haven't done a large secured debt pool in a while. It's also fairly small borrowing. The unsecured market really has a strong preference now for larger borrowings and larger borrowers like us. So I wouldn't go to market on a non-index eligible $200 million unsecured deal. I'd go with something larger like $500 million. So given our relatively modest needs, my sense is we do a secure deal.

What we do here, Tayo, is we think about what the NOI range would give us, how many cents on either side. And then we think about our acquisitions and dispositions, which are usually -- we know them within a certain fairly close tolerance. The lower end of that range is only accessible if dispositions were accelerated. We do not get there from our NOI numbers. And as David Santee has indicated, we have no reason to believe we'd be certainly anywhere below our NOI guidance range. So I tell you, we only get to $3 if we announce next quarter that we've sold a lot of what is in process now, very quickly. So that really is the way you get to the bottom of that range. It isn't because we contemplate a recession in our numbers. And I'll just take this opportunity to go a little bit further and talk about the trend of FFO by quarter because we're going to give you -- we've given you a guidance midpoint of $0.75 for the first quarter, and that will go up, we think, modestly every quarter and will be slightly over $0.80 by the time you get to the fourth quarter. So as you look forward, it isn't the same sharp increase you're used to seeing from us because there is some dilution. But I think at the end, you'll still see a number $0.80-or-so by the fourth quarter and probably a little bit higher."

At it's well known, the West Coast markets continued to lead the pack, while our East Coast markets deal with new supply, that while being reasonably well observed does continue to negatively impact our pricing power. As David Santee will discuss in more detail you just a moment, unlike 2015, this year we've experienced a more normal seasonal occupancy and pricing pattern that caused us to modestly reduce the midpoint of our expected same-store revenue range for the year. Nevertheless, our current expectations are for another very strong year of revenue growth. 1 again above long-term historical trends, which continues to demonstrate the strong demand for rental housing in high-density urban and close-in workable solutions the to a close of cities driven by very strong and positive demographic picture.
So with that said, I'll let David go to more detail across what we're seeing across our market today and our current outlook as we enter our primary leasing schemes."

Today, I'll provide color on our Q1 operating results focusing on the 4 key drivers of revenue growth and the impact of those results on our full year guidance, well by the experience in each of our markets during",2015,"Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone. Today, I'll provide color on our Q1 operating results focusing on the 4 key drivers of revenue growth and the impact of those results on our full year guidance, well by the experience in each of our markets during Q1 and the direction we expect each to take for the balance of the year. I'll close with a brief update on expenses for the quarter and full year.
Our 2016 revenue guidance assumptions were based on the expectation of maintaining the 96% occupancy we had in 2015, achieving the same level of rate growth that was achieved in 2015, comprised of renewals averaging 6% and minimum rates averaging 3%, with turnover being flat.
2016 is shaping up to be another 1 of the best years we have had with our expectation of continuing above-trend revenue growth and very manageable expense growth, leading to a very good NOI growth in our same-store portfolio.
For the quarter, occupancy was exceptionally strong at 95.9% but appeared to show I returned to the normal seasonal pattern. One of the reasons that 2015 was an exceptional year of performance was that we did not see the difficult seasonal occupancy dip at the end of 2014 and beginning of 2015. We have seen that seasonal pattern of return but at 95.9% occupied, we are still a solid 50 to 70 bps higher than years past. The result of more seasonal occupancy in the quarter we're seeing concession in our some markets and more significantly, in our New York City markets specifically Manhattan, where there is new supply pressure on the west side. On the flip side, we saw improving occupancy in Southern California and Washington, D.C. Based on what we saw on June 1, we are expecting to see some seasonal softening in Q4 and are lowering our full year occupancy projection from 96% to 95.9%, which again is still some of the strongest occupancy in our history.
Renewals continue to be very good and actually exceeded our expectations, averaging 6.2% for the quarter and 6.2% for April. May and June currently stand at 5.6%, but we would expect to close out these months at or above 6%.
As a result of the seasonality and the introduction of concessions, the impact to new lease rate -- were have left us in a position of trailing our full year rental rate growth projections up up 3%. While January met our expectations, net effected new lease rents quickly deteriorated to below 2% for a period of time and currently sit at 2.5% versus same week last year. Additionally, we saw a disproportionate number of premium rent apartments vacate during the quarter, which further impacted growth. With that said, we are lowering our expectations for full year new lease rate growth by 30 to 40 basis points and will still deliver 24 consecutive quarters of revenue growth exceeding 4% by years end. 
Lastly, turnover declined for the quarter from 10.9% to 10.8% and was in line with our expectations. All in all, or all in, while we believe that we will have a very robust leasing season and a strong fourth quarter in occupancy, we think it's likely to have the momentum to reach the 4.9% midpoint of our original revenue guidance.
Let's not forget, instead of having a spectacular year like 2015, we will have a great year that is still well above historical long-term trend. Today, we are 96.2% occupied. And again, renewal rates achieved in March and April were 6.1% and 6.2%, respectively, with May and June shaping up to be in the same range. Net effect of new lease rent growth remains in the mid-2a and exposure is a tick below same week last year.
As we enter peak season, we are once again well-positioned to optimize the 4 key drivers of revenue, occupancy, renewal rate, new lease rates and turnover.
Now moving on to the markets, I'd like to lead off with New York and then San Francisco as these 2 markets are grabbing the most attention.
In New York, the year started of the what I call the negativity bubble, with some about the New York economy that seems to impact both renters and landlords. A number of new lease ups were delivered into the market, particularly the Upper West Side and the result was escalated concessions. We made every attempt to stick with our net effective rent strategy to no avail. To be clear we had to join the concession party to close deals. Today, our your portfolio is 96.8% occupied, and renewal rates achieved for the quarter averaged 4.5% and are already in the mid-4s for April through June, which implies they will go higher. As quick as New York show signs of softening, it is now the turn more positive, with a sharp fall off in concessions but with new lease rates only slightly positive versus the flat to down we experienced in Q1.
Manhattan, Brooklyn, Midtown and New Jersey waterfront are also year-to-date revenue growth of 3% to 5%. However, the Upper West Side, which accounts for 30% of our New York market rental revenue remains under pressure as a result of new supply deluding the overall positive picture of New York.
In March, we said that we were moving our expectations for New York from a high 3% to a low 3% of total revenue growth d our position is unchanged. In San Francisco, year-to-date rental revenue ranges from a low of 9.5% to a high of 13.3% across all of our submarkets, with the exception of Soma. As a result of the new supply in the city and Mission Bay, has felt the impact of concessionary environments, making up over 10% of our San Francisco rental revenue that submarket is producing still very strong 6.2% revenue growth through April and is the largest contributor to our 30 basis point decline in occupancy for the quarter.
Occupancy for Q1 was 96.4%, but started to soften in March and is now 96% today, nearing last year's pattern with a 65 basis point drop in March to April. We expect to spring back to 96.5% or better in May as peak season is only weeks away.
Renewal rate achieved for the quarter for San Francisco averaged 8.9%, and we would expect renewals through June to average in the high to mid-8. Net effect newly spreads have averaged 4% year-to-date and it appears that perhaps, we have reached the point of moderation. Although we are still a month after our peak leasing season, when rents historically begin to move up. In summary, San Francisco is still solid and we will be our top-performing market in 2016.
We have no reports of any job loss due to declines in venture capital investment. Traffic thus far is on par with last year, and we expect the normal pricing pressures, where new supply directly competes with our asset.
Now on the Southern California, our next emerging boomtown. Both L.A. and San Diego are exceeding expectations thus far with Orange County meeting. With the concentration of new supply and downtown L.A. not directly impacting our portfolio, all of our key submarkets continue to exhibit signs of acceleration with West L.A, our largest submarket at 26% of the L.A. market rental revenue, delivering 7.1% revenue growth through April. All other submarkets are delivering 6 plus with the downtown market at 4.1%.
Renewal rates achieved through June have averaged slightly below 7% with net effective new lease rents averaging 6-plus percent year-to-date. With a slight decline in turnover for the quarter and 120 basis point pickup in occupancy quarter-over-quarter, L.A. appears to be well-positioned to be 1 of our best performing markets in 2016.
San Diego remain steady on all fronts as new supply have dispersed across the region versus Orange County, where new supply remains concentrated in the Irvine area. Orange County renewal rates achieved remain above 7% with net effective new lease rents accelerating in the past several weeks to about 8%. We would expect all of SoCal to continue its acceleration through the rest of the year with only mild pricing pressure in the downtown L.A. submarket.
Seattle also saw the normal seasonality return with lower occupancy and high exposures through much of the first quarter, but it's still meeting expectations with solid rental rates growth. Renewal rates have achieved for Q1 averaged 8.2% and should average 8% in Q2. Net effective new lease rents averaged around 5% for the quarter but recently improved to 7.3% at the peak season is underway.
While Amazon and Microsoft open positions significantly increase since the previous quarter with Amazon jumping from the normal 4800 open positions to 7200 positions as services division continues to grow leaps and bounds.
Most of our submarkets are delivering an excess of 7.2% revenue growth in April, the CBD which makes -- which has 2 assets is at 3.3% revenue growth and then Bellevue, consisting of 2 assets, is our bottom performing submarket. With limited new supply on the horizon and a limited capacity of construction personnel, we would expect Seattle to perform well through 2016.
Boston remains unchanged and still expect to hover around 3% revenue growth for the full year. With the outer suburban submarkets doing just fine, the urban core, which includes Cambridge, remains under pressure from new deliveries. Renewal rates achieved in Q1 averaged 5.9% and will be above 5% through June. However, net effective new lease pricing continues to flow in the 1% to 2% range. Absorption has been very favorable, and most leaseups are just about complete, creating windowless stability through the end of the year.
And last but not least, Washington, D.C. continues to climb out of trenches, is currently tracking ahead of our expectations. Much of the new supply in the last 2 years has competed head-to-head with much of our portfolio. Renewal rates achieved during Q1 averaged 4.1% versus 2.7% in the Q1 of 2015. For 2016, Arlington, City, Alexandria will feel the brunt of the new deliveries -- It is our bottom performing submarket at minus 80 basis points of revenue growth.
Silver Springs, Bethesda and the district are both jockeying for best revenue growth year-to-date with 1.6% and 1.4%, respectively. Revenue from these 2 submarkets make up almost 50% of total revenue for DC market. The outer burbs continue to have solid revenue growth of 2.1% in North Virginia and 3.4% in print stores County. Across the market, renewal rates achieved continued to accelerate from the 3.9% in March to an already rate of 4.9% in June. Net effective new lease rent rates, thus far, are developing a solid 4, up 2% and occupancy was 30 basis points favorable for the quarter.
With less impact from new deliveries, significant job growth in the professional services sectors, Washington is showing strong sustainable signs of improving revenue growth. While expenses for the quarter, they were better than expected and energy prices drove most of the outperformance. Electric, natural gas and heating oil were all down 6%, 13% and 39%, respectively. Additionally, the mild winter and no major storms allowed us to realize a 50% reduction in snow removal costs.
Real estate taxes, which now make up 40% of total expense and are now forecast to grow approximately 5.5%, with 1.9% growth attributable to our record 21A tax abatement burnoff in New York. With the magnitude of savings that we realized in Q1 and the expectation of continued favorable variances in energy, we are comfortable with the upper half of expense guidance off the table, moving from $2.5 million to $3.5 million down to $2.5 million to $3 million. So while we didn't power through the quarter as we did in 2015, we still see solid fundamentals across all of our markets.
New lease pricing will continue to feel the impact of new deliveries that go head-to-head with our assets in the near term, but solid renewal rates above average occupancy and continued lower turnover will produce exceptional results for EQR in 2016."

Last night's earnings release, we acquired 3 properties in the first quarter, 1 each in Brooklyn, Los Angeles and Seattle, for $204 million in -- of 4.9%. Now you may recall, we said we had some tax protection obligations for some unaffiliated third parties arising from standard sale that would be covered for approximately $300 million of acquisitions. And so this activity, along with acquisitions in the fourth quarter last year, are satisfied that responsibility.
In addition to the first quarter disposition activity we discussed on our last call, which included the Starwood transaction and the sale of River Tower in Manhattan, during the quarter we also closed on sales of 7 other noncore assets totaling 2,577 apartment units. Most of those deals was our 1,811 unit woodland property in east Palo Alto California, which we acquired out of foreclosure in late 2011 for $130 million, and we were very pleased to sell this asset for $412.5 million and realize an unleverage IRR of 37.2%.
We also sold 4 properties totaling 274 units in Massachusetts, 1 property in South Florida and 1 property in Denver.
A transactional guidance does not change for the year and as a reminder calls for $7.4 billion of dispositions. This was comprised of about $6.2 billion from Starwood, River Tower and Woodland Park; an additional $900 million of noncore sales the gains from which would be included in the special dividends paid this year, which Mark will discuss more fully in just a moment; and $300 million of activity if and only if we can find suitable acquisition opportunities from which we were willing to trade out of current assets. But I'll tell you working not much at the present time rates and by way of new acquisitions, so this activity, there's any will toward the back end of the year.
On the $900 million of noncore dispositions occurred this year, which we'll not be reinvested in new acquisitions or developments, about $150 million was closed in the first quarter, leaving $750 million yet too because this year. Because of the average size of these deals, this represents a significant number of transactions and the team is hard at work to get all this done by year-end, but it is possible that some of this activity will slip into 2017.
With regard to development business, while we did not in a projects in the quarter, we're currently working on $380 million of deals that could construction at this year with a weighted average yield on cost at today's rents in the mid-5s. While it's possible we can get all this underway this year, it's also possible some of this activity will slip in early 2017 as well. So now I'll turn the call over to our CFO, Mark Parrell."
28209,324437819,964255,"Equity Residential, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2016",2016-04-27,"Earnings Calls","Equity Residential","Executives","Thank you, David. I want to speak a few minutes this morning to talk about our guidance provisions this 2016. I will also discuss where we stand in terms of the remaining special dividend payment and review some of the changes we made to our press release",1013,"Thank you, David. I want to speak a few minutes this morning to talk about our guidance provisions this 2016. I will also discuss where we stand in terms of the remaining special dividend payment and review some of the changes we made to our press release and to our supplement. As David Neithercut discussed, portfolio 2016 will be another good year for Equity Residential. And as David Santee mentioned in his remarks, our New York performance is slightly below our expectations for the year, making the very high end of our original guidance range unattainable in 2016.
As a result, we have revised our guidance range for same-store revenue to 4.5% to 5% from 4.5% to 5.25%. On the same-store operating expense side, we have provided our guidance range to 2.5% to 3% from 2.5% to 3.5% growth for the full year. The mathematical results of all these changes, the same-store revenue and expense guidance, is to reduce our NOI range to 5% to 6% from our previous guidance range which was 5% to 6.5%.
The impact of this a normalized FFO is relatively minor, about $0.01 per share negative. So what normalized FFO guidance, we have raged of our normalized FFO for the year to $3.05 to $3.15 per share, which maintains our $3.10 per share midpoint. This is been driven by expectations for slightly lower same-store net operating income in for a higher G&A costs than expected.
These negative variances are getting offset by the additional NOI from owning our assets longer than we had expected. While we have maintained the dollar amount of our transaction guidance, we have moved back the timing for our remaining dispositions and acquisitions from occurring relatively evenly over quarters 2, 3 and 4 from being concentrated later in the year. While the disposition market remains strong, many of the assets we are selling are in relatively small niche markets in rural New England, which requires us to carefully meter our disposition pace in order not to overload the market.
We have adjusted the midpoint of our guidance for G&A up by $4 million. This is due to severance costs to right size our platform to our lower units out, following all of this reason disposition activity.
We expect quarterly normalized FFO to slowly trend up during the second half of 2016, driven by solid same-store and lease-up results. The rate of growth, however, will be moderated by the loss of NOI from earnings disposition activity.
Now I'm going to move over to our new disclosures. We've made a number of changes to our disclosure this quarter. We hope that these changes will be helpful to you in understanding the business and for comparability purposes. We also believe that these changes will help us market more effectively to investors that are new to the real estate space. I'm going to hit a few highlights. We added a glossary of key terms and definitions on Pages 25 to 28 of the release. We are also no longer including an allocation of property management expense in our calculation of our same-store operating expenses and in our NOI or in our calculation of unleveraged IRRs from our disposition.
The process of allocating property management costs among our variable property types like same-store, lease-ups, other non-same-store be managed was fairly complex and seem to us to be unnecessary, especially in light of the fact that our competitors certainly do not include property management expenses and NOI.
We have added guidance for our 2016 normalized property management expenses with all our the guidance items on Page 24 of the release. We think that evaluating aggregate overhead costs consisting of property management, whether included same-store not and general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue is the best gauge of corporate efficiency.
We've also changed our portfolio summary and same-store pages by pulling out our retail and garage operations from the calculations of average rental rate. We have added turnover by markets to our same-store operating metrics to provide more transparency at the market level. We have provided distinct definitions for what we have called acquisition cap rate and disposition yield on our transaction activity. Finally, we have made many other presentation changes, including adding a highlight section, adding a comparison to our portfolio before and after our significant 2016 disposition and disclosing the dollar amount of economic gain from our larger dispositions as well as our unlevered IRRs.
Moving on to the special dividend, as you know, in March, we paid a special dividend of $8 per share for approximately $3 billion and the proceeds of our asset dispositions this year. David Neithercut gave you an update on our progress on selling the remaining noncore assets in our 2016 disposition plan. The range for the second special dividend payment is going to remain $2 to $4 per share. We would expect to declare and pay this planned second payment from the late third quarter or fourth quarter.
In a related matter and as we discussed the last quarter, we used about $2 billion of the proceeds from our 2016 asset sales to retire debt that was primarily due to mature in 2016 and 2017. We expect our net debt to normalize EBITDA ratio at year-end 2016 to be about 5.6x. Currently, our net debt to normalized EBITDA disclosure on Page 16 reflects an even better ratio of about 4.6x. This is caused by the fact that this ratio compares our reduced debt balance on March 31, 2016, to our trailing 12-month normalize EBITDA, which include significant income from the same properties. This will trend up as the year progresses and we dropped all quarters out of the calculation and use cash to pay the second special dividend.

I said in our prepared -- in my prepared remarks that we would expect to average 6% for the full year. We've averaged 6.2% for the quarter. It looks like we'll hit 6.2% for the second quarter.

As is well known, the West Coast markets continue to lead the pack, while our East Coast markets deal with new supply, that while being reasonably well absorbed does continue to negatively impact our pricing power. As David Santee will discuss in more detail just a moment, unlike 2015, this year, we have experienced a more normal seasonal occupancy and pricing pattern that caused us to modestly reduce the midpoint of our expected same-store revenue range for the year. Nevertheless, our current expectations are for another very strong year of revenue growth, one, again above long-term historical trends, which continues to demonstrate the strong demand for rental housing in high-density urban and close-in walkable suburban locations on our gateway coastal cities, driven by a very strong and positive demographic picture.
So with that said, I'll let David go to more detail about what we're seeing across our markets today and our current outlook as we enter our primary leasing season."

Today, I'll provide color on our Q1 operating results, focusing on the 4 key drivers of revenue growth and the impact of those results on our full year guidance, followed by what we experienced in each of our mark",2040,"Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone. Today, I'll provide color on our Q1 operating results, focusing on the 4 key drivers of revenue growth and the impact of those results on our full year guidance, followed by what we experienced in each of our markets during Q1 and the direction we expect each to take for the balance of the year. I'll close with a brief update on expenses for the quarter and full year.
Our 2016 revenue guidance assumptions were based on the expectation of maintaining the 96% occupancy we had in 2015, achieving the same level of rate growth that was achieved in 2015, comprised of renewals averaging 6% and new lease rates averaging 3%, with turnover being flat.
2016 is shaping up to be another one of the best years we have had with our expectation of continuing above-trend revenue growth and very manageable expense growth, leading to very good NOI growth in our same-store portfolio.
For the quarter, occupancy was exceptionally strong at 95.9% but appeared to show a return to the normal seasonal pattern. One of the reasons that 2015 was an exceptional year of performance was that we did not see the typical seasonal occupancy dip at the end of 2014 and beginning of 2015. We have seen that seasonal pattern return but at 95.9% occupied, we are still a solid 50 to 70 bps higher than years past. The result of more seasonal occupancy in the quarter, we're seeing concessions enter some markets, and more significantly, in our New York City markets, specifically Manhattan, where there is new supply pressure on the west side. On the flip side, we saw improving occupancy in Southern California and Washington, D.C. Based on what we saw on June 1, we're expecting to see some seasonal softening in Q4 and are lowering our full year occupancy projection from 96% to 95.9%, which again is still some of the strongest occupancy in our history.
Renewals continue to be very good and actually exceeded our expectations, averaging 6.2% for the quarter and 6.2% for April. May and June currently stand at 5.6%, but we would expect to close out these months at or above 6%.
As a result of the seasonality and the introduction of concessions, the impact to new lease rate was -- have left us in a position of trailing our full year rental rate growth projections up 3%. While January met our expectations, net effective new lease rents quickly deteriorated to below 2% for a period of time and currently sit at 2.5% versus same week last year. Additionally, we saw a disproportionate number of premium rent apartments vacate during the quarter, which further impacted growth. With that said, we are lowering our expectations for full year new lease rate growth by 30 to 40 basis points and will still deliver 24 consecutive quarters of revenue growth exceeding 4% by year's end. 
Lastly, turnover declined for the quarter from 10.9% to 10.8% and was in line with our expectations. All in all, or all in, while we believe that we will have a very robust leasing season and a strong fourth quarter finish in occupancy, we think it's likely we will have the momentum to reach the 4.9% midpoint of our original revenue guidance.
But let's not forget, instead of having a spectacular year like 2015, we will have a great year that is still well above historical long-term trend. Today, we're 96.2% occupied. And again, renewal rates achieved in March and April were 6.1% and 6.2%, respectively, with May and June shaping up to be in the same range. Net effective new lease rent growth remains in the mid-2s and exposure is a tick below same week last year.
As we enter peak leasing season, we are once again well positioned to optimize the 4 key drivers of revenue, of -- revenue, occupancy, renewal rate, new lease rates and turnover.
Now moving on to the markets. I'd like to lead off with New York and then San Francisco as these 2 markets are grabbing the most attention.
In New York, the year started off with what I'll call the negativity bubble, with some unease about the New York economy that seemed to impact the psyche of both renters and landlords. A number of new lease-ups were delivered into the market, particularly in the Upper West Side, and the result was escalated concessions. We made every attempt to stick with our net effective rent strategy to no avail. It became clear we had to join the concession party to close deals. Today, our New York portfolio is 96.8% occupied, and renewal rates achieved for the quarter averaged 4.5% and are already in the mid-4s for April through June, which implies they will go higher. As quick as New York showed signs of softening, it has now turned more positive, with a sharp falloff in concessions but with new lease rates only slightly positive versus the flat to down we experienced in Q1.
Manhattan, Brooklyn, Midtown and the Jersey waterfront are all producing year-to-date revenue growth of 3% to 5%. However, the Upper West Side, which accounts for 30% of our New York market rental revenue, remains under pressure as a result of new supply diluting the overall positive picture of New York. In March, we said that we were moving our expectations for New York from a high 3% to a low 3% for total revenue growth and our position is unchanged.
In San Francisco, year-to-date rental revenue ranges from a low of 9.5% to a high of 13.3% across all of our submarkets, with the exception of SoMa. As a result of the new supply in the city and Mission Bay, SoMa has felt the impact of a concessionary environment, making up over 10% of our San Francisco rental revenue. That submarket is producing still very strong 6.2% revenue growth through April and is the largest contributor to our 30 basis point decline in occupancy for the quarter. Occupancy for Q1 was 96.4%, but started to soften in March and is now 96% today, nearing last year's pattern with a 65 basis point drop from March to April. We expect to spring back to 96.5% or better in May as peak leasing season is only weeks away.  Renewal rates achieved for the quarter for San Francisco averaged 8.9%, and we would expect renewals through June to average in the high to mid-8. Net effective new lease rents have averaged 4% year-to-date and it appears that perhaps we have reached the point of moderation, although we are still a month out from our peak leasing season when rents historically begin to move up. In summary, San Francisco is still solid and will be our top-performing market in 2016.
We have no reports of any job loss due to declines in venture capital investment. Traffic thus far is on par with last year, and we expect the normal pricing pressures where new supply directly competes with our asset.
Now on to Southern California, our next emerging boomtown. Both L.A. and San Diego are exceeding expectations thus far with Orange County meeting expectation. With the concentration of new supply in Downtown L.A. not directly impacting our portfolio, all of our key submarkets continue to exhibit signs of acceleration with West L.A., our largest submarket, at 26% of the L.A. market rental revenue, delivering 7.1% revenue growth through April. All other submarkets are delivering 6%-plus with the downtown market at 4.1%. Renewal rates achieved through June have averaged slightly below 7% with net effective new lease rents averaging 6-plus percent year-to-date. With a slight decline in turnover for the quarter and 120 basis point pickup in occupancy quarter-over-quarter, L.A. appears to be well positioned to be one of our best-performing markets in 2016.
San Diego remains steady on all fronts as new supply is dispersed across the region versus Orange County, where new supply remains concentrated in the Irvine area. Orange County renewal rates achieved remain above 7% with net effective new lease rents accelerating in the past several weeks to above 8%. We would expect all of SoCal to continue its acceleration through the rest of the year with only mild pricing pressure in the Downtown L.A. submarket.
Seattle also saw the normal seasonality return with lower occupancy and higher exposure through much of the first quarter, but it's still meeting expectations with solid rental rate growth. Renewal rates achieved for Q1 averaged 8.2% and should average 8% in Q2. Net effective new lease rents averaged around 5% for the quarter but recently improved to 7.3% as the peak season is underway.
Both Amazon and Microsoft open positions have significantly increased since the previous quarter with Amazon jumping from the normal 4,800 open positions to 7,200 positions as their cloud services division continues to grow leaps and bounds.
Most of our submarkets are delivering in excess of 7.2% revenue growth through April. The CBD, which makes -- which has 2 assets, is at 3.3% revenue growth. And then Bellevue, consisting of 2 assets, is our bottom-performing submarket. With limited new supply on the horizon and a limited capacity of construction personnel, we would expect Seattle to perform well through 2016.
Our cautious outlook on Boston remains unchanged and still expect to hover around 3% revenue growth for the full year. With the outer suburban submarkets doing just fine, the urban core, which includes Cambridge, remains under pressure from new deliveries. Renewal rates achieved in Q1 averaged 5.9% and will be above 5% through June. However, net effective new lease pricing continues to float in the 1% to 2% range. Absorption has been very favorable and most lease-ups are just about complete, creating a window of stability through the end of the year.
And last, but not least, Washington, D.C. continues to climb out of the trenches, is currently tracking ahead of our expectations. Much of the new supply in the last 2 years has competed head-to-head with much of our portfolio. Renewal rates achieved during Q1 averaged 4.1% versus 2.7% in Q1 of 2015. For 2016, Arlington, Pentagon City, Alexandria will feel the brunt of the new deliveries. It is our bottom-performing submarket at minus 80 basis points of revenue growth.
Silver Springs/Bethesda and the District are both jockeying for best revenue growth year-to-date with 1.6% and 1.4%, respectively. Revenue from these 2 submarkets make up almost 50% of total revenue for our D.C. market. The outer burbs continue to have solid revenue growth of 2.1% in Northern Virginia and 3.4% in Prince George's County. Across the market, renewal rates achieved continue to accelerate from the 3.9% in March to an already achieved rate of 4.9% in June. Net effective new lease rent rates thus far are developing a solid 4%, up 2%, and occupancy was 30 basis points favorable for the quarter.
With less impact from new deliveries, significant job growth in the professional services sectors, Washington is showing strong sustainable signs of improving revenue growth. With expenses for the quarter, they were better than expected as the malaise in energy prices drove most of the outperformance. Electric, natural gas and heating oil were all down 6%, 13% and 39%, respectively. Additionally, the mild winter and no major storms allowed us to realize a 50% reduction in snow removal costs.
Real estate taxes, which now make up 40% of total expense and are now forecast to grow approximately 5.5%, with 1.9 percentage points of this growth attributable to our record 421-a tax abatement burn-off in New York. With the magnitude of savings that we realized in Q1 and the expectation of continued favorable variances in energy, we are comfortable with taking the upper half of expense guidance off the table, moving from $2.5 million to $3.5 million down to $2.5 million to $3 million. So while we didn't power through the quarter as we did in 2015, we still see solid fundamentals across all of our markets.
New lease pricing will continue to feel the impact of new deliveries that go head-to-head with our assets in the near term, but solid renewal rates, above-average occupancy and continued lower turnover will produce exceptional results for EQR in 2016."

Noted in last night's earnings release, we acquired 3 properties in the first quarter, one each in Brooklyn, Los Angeles and Seattle, for $204 million and weighted average cap rate is 4.9%. Now you may recall, we said that we had some tax protection obligations for some unaffiliated third parties arising from the Starwood sale that would be covered with approximately $300 million of acquisitions. And so this activity, along with acquisitions in the fourth quarter last year, have satisfied that responsibility.
In addition to the first quarter disposition activity we discussed on our last call, which included the Starwood transaction and the sale of River Tower in Manhattan, during the quarter, we also closed on the sales of 7 other non-core assets totaling 2,577 apartment units. The largest of those deals was our 1,811-unit Woodland Park property in East Palo Alto, California, which we acquired out of foreclosure in late 2011 for $130 million, and we were very pleased to sell this asset for $412.5 million and realized an unleveraged IRR of 37.2%.
We also sold 4 properties totaling 274 units in Massachusetts, 1 property in South Florida and 1 property in Denver.
Our transactional guidance does not change for the year, and as a reminder, calls for $7.4 billion of dispositions. This was comprised of about $6.2 billion from Starwood, River Tower and Woodland Park; an additional $900 million of non-core sales, the gains from which would be included in the special dividends paid this year, which Mark will discuss more fully in just a moment; and $300 million of activity to occur if, and only if, we can find suitable acquisition opportunities for which we are willing to trade out of current assets. But I'll tell you we're not working on much at the present time by way of new acquisitions, so this activity, if there is any, will occur towards the back end of the year.
On the $900 million of non-core dispositions that occurred this year, which will not be reinvested in new acquisitions or developments, about $150 million was closed in the first quarter, leaving $750 million yet to be closed this year. Because of the average size of these deals, this represents a significant number of transactions and the team is hard at work to get all this done by year-end, but it is possible that some of this activity will slip into 2017.
With regard to the development business, while we did not start any projects in the quarter, we're currently working on $380 million of deals that could start construction yet this year with a weighted average yield on cost at today's rents in the mid-5s. While it's possible we can get all of this underway this year, it's also possible that some of this activity will slip into early 2017 as well.
So now I'll turn the call over to our CFO, Mark Parrell."
28209,324437819,964587,"Equity Residential, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2016",2016-04-27,"Earnings Calls","Equity Residential","Executives","Thank you, David. I want to take a few minutes this morning to talk about our guidance revisions this 2016. I will also discuss where we stand in terms of the remaining special dividend payment and review some of the changes we made to our press release a",1028,"Thank you, David. I want to take a few minutes this morning to talk about our guidance revisions this 2016. I will also discuss where we stand in terms of the remaining special dividend payment and review some of the changes we made to our press release and to our supplement. As David Neithercut discussed, portfolio-wide, 2016 will be another very good year for Equity Residential. And as David Santee mentioned in his remarks, our New York performance was slightly below our expectations for the year, making the very high end of our original guidance range unattainable in 2016.
As a result, we have revised our guidance range for same-store revenue to 4.5% to 5% from 4.5% to 5.25%. On the same-store operating expense side, we have revised our guidance range to 2.5% to 3% from 2.5% to 3.5% growth for the full year. The mathematical result of all these changes, the same-store revenue and expense guidance, is to reduce our NOI range to 5% to 6% from our previous guidance range, which was 5% to 6.5%.
The impact of this on normalized FFO was relatively minor, about $0.01 per share negative. Switching to our normalized FFO guidance, we have narrowed the range of our normalized FFO for the year to $3.05 to $3.15 per share, which maintains our $3.10 per share midpoint. This is being driven by our expectation for slightly lower same-store net operating income and for higher G&A costs than we expected.
These negative variances are being offset by the additional NOI from owning our disposition assets longer than we had expected. While we have maintained the dollar amounts of our transaction guidance, we have moved back the timing for our remaining dispositions and acquisition from occurring relatively evenly over quarters 2, 3 and 4 to being concentrated later in the year. While the disposition market remains strong, many of the assets we are selling are in relatively small niche markets in rural New England, which requires us to carefully meter our disposition pace in order not to overload the market.
We have adjusted the midpoint of our guidance for G&A up by $4 million. This is due to severance costs to rightsize our platform to our lower unit count, following all of this recent disposition activity.
We expect quarterly normalized FFO to slowly trend up during the second half of 2016, driven by solid same-store and lease-up results. The rate of growth, however, will be moderated by the loss of NOI from our disposition activity.
Now I'm going to move over to our new disclosures. We've made a number of changes to our disclosure this quarter. We hope that these changes will be helpful to you in understanding the business and for comparability purposes. We also believe that these changes will help us market more effectively to investors that are new to the real estate space. So I'm going to hit a few highlights. We added a glossary of key terms and definitions on Pages 25 through 28 of the release. We are also no longer including an allocation of property management expense in our calculation of our same-store operating expenses and in our NOI or in our calculation of unlevered IRRs from our disposition.
The process of allocating property management costs among our various property types like same store, lease-ups, other non-same store and fee managed was fairly complex and seemed to us to be unnecessary, especially in light of the fact that our competitors generally do not include property management expenses and NOI.
We have added guidance for our 2016 normalized property management expenses with all our other guidance items on Page 24 of the release. We think that evaluating aggregate overhead costs consisting of property management, whether included in same store or not, and general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue is the best gauge of corporate efficiency.
We have also changed our portfolio summary and same-store pages by pulling out our retail and garage operations from the calculations of average rental rate. We have added turnover by markets to our same-store operating metrics pages to provide more transparency at the market level. We have provided distinct definitions for what we have called acquisition cap rate and disposition yield on our transaction activity. Finally, we have made many other presentation changes, including adding a highlight section, adding a comparison of our portfolio before and after our significant 2016 dispositions and disclosing the dollar amount of economic gain from our larger dispositions as well as our unlevered IRRs.
Moving on to the special dividend. As you know, in March, we paid a special dividend of $8 per share for approximately $3 billion from the proceeds of our asset dispositions this year. David Neithercut gave you an update on our progress on selling the remaining non-core assets in our 2016 disposition plan. The range for the second special dividend payment is going to remain $2 to $4 per share. We would expect to declare and pay this planned second payment in the late third quarter or fourth quarter.
In a related matter and as we discussed with you last quarter, we used about $2 billion of the proceeds from our 2016 asset sales to retire debt that was primarily due to mature in 2016 and 2017. We expect our net debt to normalized EBITDA ratio at year-end 2016 to be about 5.6x. Currently, our net debt to normalized EBITDA disclosure on Page 16 reflects an even better ratio of about 4.6x. This is caused by the fact that this ratio compares our reduced debt balance at March 31, 2016, to our trailing 12-month normalized EBITDA, which includes significant income from the sold properties. This will trend up as the year progresses and we drop all quarters out of the calculation and use cash to pay the second special dividend.
At year-end, I expect we will have $50 million of cash on hand and have a balance outstanding on the revolving line of credit of about $130 million, leaving us with about $2.3 billion of undrawn capacity on our line.
I will now ask Kayla to begin the question-and-answer session. Kayla?"

I said in our prepared -- in my prepared remarks that we would expect to average 6% for the full year. We've averaged 6.2% for the quarter. It looks like we'll hit 6.2% for the second quarter. And as we get into peak leasing season, when full-on demand and -- comes, I don't see any softening there. The problem is really rate and the level of new supply that competes head-to-head with our properties. Again, as an example, Downtown Boston, 60% of our revenue comes from the urban core from probably 4 or 5 assets, where rent new lease rate growth has been 0.

So we're happy at the yields we get. We're quite confident that the locations and the product that we're building will be happily owned for an extended time period."

L.A., all of Southern California is trending ahead of our expectations. We also -- just another data point. Back in December, it was clear that in many of our markets that our employees were being challenged in finding places to live. And so we implemented a larger employee discount. I mean, some of our employees in San Francisco were driving 2 hours, 2.5 hours to do an emergency service call. So we increased -- on a market-by-market basis, we increased the employee discount. As an example, in San Francisco, that cost us 40 basis points of revenue growth in Q1. So we -- without that increased employee concession, we would have done a 9 9 [ph]. So there are some little volatility in these employee concessions line. And really, we have a lot of visibility into rate, which we have already kind of adjusted for. We've already issued renewals for June. And really once you issue renewals through August, you're pretty much baked for the whole year so that it comes down to having a strong occupancy finish in Q4."

Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. We're very pleased to have had another very solid quarter of operations, growing same-store revenue 4.6% in the quarter, holding property level operating expenses flat and delivering another very good quarter of 6.6% growth in net operating income.
As is well known, the West Coast markets continue to lead the pack, while our East Coast markets deal with new supply, that while being reasonably well absorbed does continue to negatively impact our pricing power. As David Santee will discuss in more detail just a moment, unlike 2015, this year, we have experienced a more normal seasonal occupancy and pricing pattern that caused us to modestly reduce the midpoint of our expected same-store revenue range for the year. Nevertheless, our current expectations are for another very strong year of revenue growth, one, again above long-term historical trends, which continues to demonstrate the strong demand for rental housing in high-density urban and close-in walkable suburban locations on our gateway coastal cities, driven by a very strong and positive demographic picture.
So with that said, I'll let David go to more detail about what we're seeing across our markets today and our current outlook as we enter our primary leasing season."

Today, I'll provide color on our Q1 operating results, focusing on the 4 key drivers of revenue growth and the impact of those results on our full year guidance, followed by what we experienced in each of our mark",2039,"Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone. Today, I'll provide color on our Q1 operating results, focusing on the 4 key drivers of revenue growth and the impact of those results on our full year guidance, followed by what we experienced in each of our markets during Q1 and the direction we expect each to take for the balance of the year. I'll close with a brief update on expenses for the quarter and full year.
Our 2016 revenue guidance assumptions were based on the expectation of maintaining the 96% occupancy we had in 2015, achieving the same level of rate growth that was achieved in 2015, comprised of renewals averaging 6% and new lease rates averaging 3%, with turnover being flat.
2016 is shaping up to be another one of the best years we have had with our expectation of continuing above-trend revenue growth and very manageable expense growth, leading to very good NOI growth in our same-store portfolio.
For the quarter, occupancy was exceptionally strong at 95.9% but appeared to show a return to the normal seasonal pattern. One of the reasons that 2015 was an exceptional year of performance was that we did not see the typical seasonal occupancy dip at the end of 2014 and beginning of 2015. We have seen that seasonal pattern return but at 95.9% occupied, we are still a solid 50 to 70 bps higher than years past. The result of more seasonal occupancy in the quarter, we're seeing concessions enter some markets, and more significantly, in our New York City markets, specifically Manhattan, where there is new supply pressure on the west side. On the flip side, we saw improving occupancy in Southern California and Washington, D.C. Based on what we saw on June 1, we're expecting to see some seasonal softening in Q4 and are lowering our full year occupancy projection from 96% to 95.9%, which again is still some of the strongest occupancy in our history.
Renewals continue to be very good and actually exceeded our expectations, averaging 6.2% for the quarter and 6.2% for April. May and June currently stand at 5.6%, but we would expect to close out these months at or above 6%.
As a result of the seasonality and the introduction of concessions, the impact to new lease rate was -- have left us in a position of trailing our full year rental rate growth projections up 3%. While January met our expectations, net effective new lease rents quickly deteriorated to below 2% for a period of time and currently sit at 2.5% versus same week last year. Additionally, we saw a disproportionate number of premium rent apartments vacate during the quarter, which further impacted growth. With that said, we are lowering our expectations for full year new lease rate growth by 30 to 40 basis points and will still deliver 24 consecutive quarters of revenue growth exceeding 4% by year's end. 
Lastly, turnover declined for the quarter from 10.9% to 10.8% and was in line with our expectations. All in all, or all in, while we believe that we will have a very robust leasing season and a strong fourth quarter finish in occupancy, we think it's unlikely we will have the momentum to reach the 4.9% midpoint of our original revenue guidance.
But let's not forget, instead of having a spectacular year like 2015, we will have a great year that is still well above historical long-term trend. Today, we're 96.2% occupied. And again, renewal rates achieved in March and April were 6.1% and 6.2%, respectively, with May and June shaping up to be in the same range. Net effective new lease rent growth remains in the mid-2s and exposure is a tick below same week last year.
As we enter peak leasing season, we are once again well positioned to optimize the 4 key drivers of revenue, of -- revenue, occupancy, renewal rate, new lease rates and turnover.
Now moving on to the markets. I'd like to lead off with New York and then San Francisco as these 2 markets are grabbing the most attention.
In New York, the year started off with what I'll call the negativity bubble, with some unease about the New York economy that seemed to impact the psyche of both renters and landlords. A number of new lease-ups were delivered into the market, particularly in the Upper West Side, and the result was escalated concessions. We made every attempt to stick with our net effective rent strategy to no avail. It became clear we had to join the concession party to close deals. Today, our New York portfolio is 96.8% occupied, and renewal rates achieved for the quarter averaged 4.5% and are already in the mid-4s for April through June, which implies they will go higher. As quick as New York showed signs of softening, it has now turned more positive, with a sharp falloff in concessions but with new lease rates only slightly positive versus the flat to down we experienced in Q1.
Manhattan, Brooklyn, Midtown and the Jersey waterfront are all producing year-to-date revenue growth of 3% to 5%. However, the Upper West Side, which accounts for 30% of our New York market rental revenue, remains under pressure as a result of new supply diluting the overall positive picture of New York. In March, we said that we were moving our expectations for New York from a high 3% to a low 3% for total revenue growth and our position is unchanged.
In San Francisco, year-to-date rental revenue ranges from a low of 9.5% to a high of 13.3% across all of our submarkets, with the exception of SoMa. As a result of the new supply in the city and Mission Bay, SoMa has felt the impact of a concessionary environment, making up over 10% of our San Francisco rental revenue. That submarket is producing still very strong 6.2% revenue growth through April and is the largest contributor to our 30 basis point decline in occupancy for the quarter. Occupancy for Q1 was 96.4%, but started to soften in March and is now 96% today, nearing last year's pattern with a 65 basis point drop from March to April. We expect to spring back to 96.5% or better in May as peak leasing season is only weeks away.  Renewal rates achieved for the quarter for San Francisco averaged 8.9%, and we would expect renewals through June to average in the high to mid-8. Net effective new lease rents have averaged 4% year-to-date and it appears that perhaps we have reached the point of moderation, although we are still a month out from our peak leasing season when rents historically begin to move up. In summary, San Francisco is still solid and will be our top-performing market in 2016.
We have no reports of any job loss due to declines in venture capital investment. Traffic thus far is on par with last year, and we expect the normal pricing pressures where new supply directly competes with our asset.
Now on to Southern California, our next emerging boomtown. Both L.A. and San Diego are exceeding expectations thus far with Orange County meeting expectation. With the concentration of new supply in Downtown L.A. not directly impacting our portfolio, all of our key submarkets continue to exhibit signs of acceleration with West L.A., our largest submarket, at 26% of the L.A. market rental revenue, delivering 7.1% revenue growth through April. All other submarkets are delivering 6%-plus with the downtown market at 4.1%. Renewal rates achieved through June have averaged slightly below 7% with net effective new lease rents averaging 6-plus percent year-to-date. With a slight decline in turnover for the quarter and 120 basis point pickup in occupancy quarter-over-quarter, L.A. appears to be well positioned to be one of our best-performing markets in 2016.
San Diego remains steady on all fronts as new supply is dispersed across the region versus Orange County, where new supply remains concentrated in the Irvine area. Orange County renewal rates achieved remain above 7% with net effective new lease rents accelerating in the past several weeks to above 8%. We would expect all of SoCal to continue its acceleration through the rest of the year with only mild pricing pressure in the Downtown L.A. submarket.
Seattle also saw the normal seasonality return with lower occupancy and higher exposure through much of the first quarter, but it's still meeting expectations with solid rental rate growth. Renewal rates achieved for Q1 averaged 8.2% and should average 8% in Q2. Net effective new lease rents averaged around 5% for the quarter but recently improved to 7.3% as the peak season is underway.
Both Amazon and Microsoft open positions have significantly increased since the previous quarter with Amazon jumping from the normal 4,800 open positions to 7,200 positions as their cloud services division continues to grow leaps and bounds.
Most of our submarkets are delivering in excess of 7.2% revenue growth through April. The CBD, which makes -- which has 2 assets, is at 3.3% revenue growth. And then Bellevue, consisting of 2 assets, is our bottom-performing submarket. With limited new supply on the horizon and a limited capacity of construction personnel, we would expect Seattle to perform well through 2016.
Our cautious outlook on Boston remains unchanged and still expect to hover around 3% revenue growth for the full year. With the outer suburban submarkets doing just fine, the urban core, which includes Cambridge, remains under pressure from new deliveries. Renewal rates achieved in Q1 averaged 5.9% and will be above 5% through June. However, net effective new lease pricing continues to float in the 1% to 2% range. Absorption has been very favorable and most lease-ups are just about complete, creating a window of stability through the end of the year.
And last, but not least, Washington, D.C. continues to climb out of the trenches, is currently tracking ahead of our expectations. Much of the new supply in the last 2 years has competed head-to-head with much of our portfolio. Renewal rates achieved during Q1 averaged 4.1% versus 2.7% in Q1 of 2015. For 2016, Arlington, Pentagon City, Alexandria will feel the brunt of the new deliveries. It is our bottom-performing submarket at minus 80 basis points of revenue growth.
Silver Springs/Bethesda and the District are both jockeying for best revenue growth year-to-date with 1.6% and 1.4%, respectively. Revenue from these 2 submarkets make up almost 50% of total revenue for our D.C. market. The outer burbs continue to have solid revenue growth of 2.1% in Northern Virginia and 3.4% in Prince George's County. Across the market, renewal rates achieved continue to accelerate from the 3.9% in March to an already achieved rate of 4.9% in June. Net effective new lease rent rates thus far are developing a solid 4%, up 2%, and occupancy was 30 basis points favorable for the quarter.
With less impact from new deliveries, significant job growth in the professional services sectors, Washington is showing strong sustainable signs of improving revenue growth. With expenses for the quarter, they were better than expected as the malaise in energy prices drove most of the outperformance. Electric, natural gas and heating oil were all down 6%, 13% and 39%, respectively. Additionally, the mild winter and no major storms allowed us to realize a 50% reduction in snow removal costs.
Real estate taxes, which now make up 40% of total expense and are now forecast to grow approximately 5.5%, with 1.9 percentage points of this growth attributable to our 421-a tax abatement burn-off in New York. With the magnitude of savings that we realized in Q1 and the expectation of continued favorable variances in energy, we are comfortable with taking the upper half of expense guidance off the table, moving from $2.5 million to $3.5 million down to $2.5 million to $3 million. So while we didn't power through the quarter as we did in 2015, we still see solid fundamentals across all of our markets.
New lease pricing will continue to feel the impact of new deliveries that go head-to-head with our assets in the near term, but solid renewal rates, above-average occupancy and continued lower turnover will produce exceptional results for EQR in 2016."

Noted in last night's earnings release, we acquired 3 properties in the first quarter, one each in Brooklyn, Los Angeles and Seattle, for $204 million and weighted average cap rate is 4.9%. Now you may recall, we said that we had some tax protection obligations for some unaffiliated third parties arising from the Starwood sale that would be covered with approximately $300 million of acquisitions. And so this activity, along with acquisitions in the fourth quarter last year, have satisfied that responsibility.
In addition to the first quarter disposition activity we discussed on our last call, which included the Starwood transaction and the sale of River Tower in Manhattan, during the quarter, we also closed on the sales of 7 other non-core assets totaling 2,577 apartment units. The largest of those deals was our 1,811-unit Woodland Park property in East Palo Alto, California, which we acquired out of foreclosure in late 2011 for $130 million, and we were very pleased to sell this asset for $412.5 million and realized an unleveraged IRR of 37.2%.
We also sold 4 properties totaling 274 units in Massachusetts, 1 property in South Florida and 1 property in Denver.
Our transactional guidance does not change for the year, and as a reminder, calls for $7.4 billion of dispositions. This was comprised of about $6.2 billion from Starwood, River Tower and Woodland Park; an additional $900 million of non-core sales, the gains from which would be included in the special dividends paid this year, which Mark will discuss more fully in just a moment; and $300 million of activity to occur if, and only if, we can find suitable acquisition opportunities for which we are willing to trade out of current assets. But I'll tell you we're not working on much at the present time by way of new acquisitions, so this activity, if there is any, will occur towards the back end of the year.
On the $900 million of non-core dispositions that occurred this year, which will not be reinvested in new acquisitions or developments, about $150 million was closed in the first quarter, leaving $750 million yet to be closed this year. Because of the average size of these deals, this represents a significant number of transactions and the team is hard at work to get all this done by year-end, but it is possible that some of this activity will slip into 2017.
With regard to the development business, while we did not start any projects in the quarter, we're currently working on $380 million of deals that could start construction yet this year with a weighted average yield on cost at today's rents in the mid-5s. While it's possible we can get all of this underway this year, it's also possible that some of this activity will slip into early 2017 as well.
So now I'll turn the call over to our CFO, Mark Parrell."

I want to take a few minutes this morning to talk about our guidance revisions this 2016. I will also discuss where we stand in terms of the remaining special dividend payment and review some of the changes we made to our press release and to our supplement. As David Neithercut discussed, portfolio-wide, 2016 will be another very good year for Equity Residential. And as David Santee mentioned in his remarks, our New York performance was slightly below our expectations for the year, making the very high end of our original guidance range unattainable in 2016.
As a result, we have revised our guidance range for same-store revenue to 4.5% to 5% from 4.5% to 5.25%. On the same-store operating expense side, we have revised our guidance range to 2.5% to 3% from 2.5% to 3.5% growth for the full year. The mathematical result of all these changes, the same-store revenue and expense guidance, is to reduce our NOI range to 5% to 6% from our previous guidance range, which was 5% to 6.5%.
The impact of this on normalized FFO was relatively minor, about $0.01 per share negative. Switching to our normalized FFO guidance, we have narrowed the range of our normalized FFO for the year to $3.05 to $3.15 per share, which maintains our $3.10 per share midpoint. This is being driven by our expectation for slightly lower same-store net operating income and for higher G&A costs than we expected.
These negative variances are being offset by the additional NOI from owning our disposition assets longer than we had expected. While we have maintained the dollar amounts of our transaction guidance, we have moved back the timing for our remaining dispositions and acquisition from occurring relatively evenly over quarters 2, 3 and 4 to being concentrated later in the year. While the disposition market remains strong, many of the assets we are selling are in relatively small niche markets in rural New England, which requires us to carefully meter our disposition pace in order not to overload the market.
We have adjusted the midpoint of our guidance for G&A up by $4 million. This is due to severance costs to rightsize our platform to our lower unit count, following all of this recent disposition activity.
We expect quarterly normalized FFO to slowly trend up during the second half of 2016, driven by solid same-store and lease-up results. The rate of growth, however, will be moderated by the loss of NOI from our disposition activity.
Now I'm going to move over to our new disclosures. We've made a number of changes to our disclosure this quarter. We hope that these changes will be helpful to you in understanding the business and for comparability purposes. We also believe that these changes will help us market more effectively to investors that are new to the real estate space. So I'm going to hit a few highlights. We added a glossary of key terms and definitions on Pages 25 through 28 of the release. We are also no longer including an allocation of property management expense in our calculation of our same-store operating expenses and in our NOI or in our calculation of unlevered IRRs from our disposition.
The process of allocating property management costs among our various property types like same store, lease-ups, other non-same store and fee managed was fairly complex and seemed to us to be unnecessary, especially in light of the fact that our competitors generally do not include property management expenses and NOI.
We have added guidance for our 2016 normalized property management expenses with all our other guidance items on Page 24 of the release. We think that evaluating aggregate overhead costs consisting of property management, whether included in same store or not, and general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue is the best gauge of corporate efficiency.
We have also changed our portfolio summary and same-store pages by pulling out our retail and garage operations from the calculations of average rental rate. We have added turnover by markets to our same-store operating metrics pages to provide more transparency at the market level. We have provided distinct definitions for what we have called acquisition cap rate and disposition yield on our transaction activity. Finally, we have made many other presentation changes, including adding a highlight section, adding a comparison of our portfolio before and after our significant 2016 dispositions and disclosing the dollar amount of economic gain from our larger dispositions as well as our unlevered IRRs.
Moving on to the special dividend. As you know, in March, we paid a special dividend of $8 per share for approximately $3 billion from the proceeds of our asset dispositions this year. David Neithercut gave you an update on our progress on selling the remaining non-core assets in our 2016 disposition plan. The range for the second special dividend payment is going to remain $2 to $4 per share. We would expect to declare and pay this planned second payment in the late third quarter or fourth quarter.
In a related matter and as we discussed with you last quarter, we used about $2 billion of the proceeds from our 2016 asset sales to retire debt that was primarily due to mature in 2016 and 2017. We expect our net debt to normalized EBITDA ratio at year-end 2016 to be about 5.6x. Currently, our net debt to normalized EBITDA disclosure on Page 16 reflects an even better ratio of about 4.6x. This is caused by the fact that this ratio compares our reduced debt balance at March 31, 2016, to our trailing 12-month normalized EBITDA, which includes significant income from the sold properties. This will trend up as the year progresses and we drop all quarters out of the calculation and use cash to pay the second special dividend.
At year-end, I expect we will have $50 million of cash on hand and have a balance outstanding on the revolving line of credit of about $130 million, leaving us with about $2.3 billion of undrawn capacity on our line.
I will now ask Kayla to begin the question-and-answer session. Kayla?"

And I would say that, in hindsight, 2015 was an anomaly year in the 30 years that I personally have been doing this. Occupancies did not decline in Q4. They did not decline in Q1.

I mean, in fact, if you look at market-by-market, almost -- a lot of the market showed 20 to 40 basis point declines. Boston had 180 basis point decline, but -- I'm sorry, increase that kind of overshadowed that. So I mean, it's clear that once people get situated into their neighborhood and enjoy their lifestyle, they're not going to move unless it just becomes totally unaffordable. So we would expect turnover to continue to decline as it has for probably the past 4 or 5 years. Renewal rates, we expect more of the same. I said in our prepared -- in my prepared remarks that we would expect to average 6% for the full year. We've averaged 6.2% for the quarter. It looks like we'll hit 6.2% for the second quarter. And as we get into peak leasing season, when full-on demand and -- comes, I don't see any softening there. The problem is really rate and the level of new supply that competes head-to-head with our properties. Again, as an example, Downtown Boston, 60% of our revenue comes from the urban core from probably 4 or 5 assets, where rent new lease rate growth has been 0. So when you're getting 4%, 4.5% on a renewal and then someone moves out, you're kind of giving back that 4.5%. So the real pressure will be new lease rate."

We really look at these as we start, based upon where their yield based upon current rents. Not sitting there trying to continue to trend rents low double digit, high single digits. So as we look at lease-up absorption of what we've done, absorption has been very strong and then what we've achieved has been very much in a wheelhouse. So we continue to feel very good.

L.A., all of Southern California is trending ahead of our expectations. We also -- just another data point. Back in December, it was clear that in many of our markets that our employees were being challenged in finding places to live. And so we implemented a larger employee discount. I mean, some of our employees in San Francisco were driving 2 hours, 2.5 hours to do an emergency service call. So we increased -- on a market-by-market basis, we increased the employee discount. As an example, in San Francisco, that cost us 40 basis points of revenue growth in Q1. So we -- without that increased employee concession, we would have done a 9 9 [ph]. So there are some little volatility in these employee concessions line. And really, we have a lot of visibility into rate, which we have already kind of adjusted for.

You're just not getting any new lease pricing power. With a lot of those units delivered and fully leased up, there is nothing coming online until the first of '17. So we will see, as we enter peak leasing season, if pricing power returns to that market. But I guess, I would say every market is different. I mean, Seattle, we have delivered considerable new product that goes head to head with some of our communities. But the demand has been so great from the growth in Amazon jobs downtown that it had 0 impact on the new -- on our existing same-store assets. So I think it's more of a market-by-market discussion."

So it just became clear that as concessions, whether it was the gift cards, whether it was 2 months free, whether it was free vacuum cleaners, what have you, people will come in, and prospects expect, ""What are you going to give me?"" And basically, our response is, ""This is our rate."" They had no point of reference whether that rate compare to what someone else was offering them, whether it was the gift card or more free months rent. So we started to see pressure on occupancy. We are more focused perhaps on providing incentives at the broker level versus at the prospect level. But that's what we saw, and it's started to impact our occupancy.

Thanks for joining us. Clearly, 2016 did not turn out to be near what we had originally expected due to deteriorating market conditions in San Francisco and New York City, which combined, made up 50% of our initial growth forecast for the year. 
As David Santee will address in greater detail in just a moment, at the time of our first quarter earnings call, nearly all indicators suggest that, while the top end of our original expectation was off the table, another year of solid 12.4% in same-store revenue was most likely, as strong demand continued to absorb new supply with little impact to existing inventory. 
The month of May, however, brought sudden and material changes to the fundamental picture, particularly in San Francisco, in the 50 basis point reduction to the company's expected revenue growth for the year. Now at 60 days, fundamentals should continue to weaken in this market, causing us to yet again reduce our expectations for full-year revenue growth, which for the first time in many years, is now expected to have a 3 handle and as a result, after 5 years of extraordinary strong fundamentals, revenue growth this year will now be more in line with historical trends. 
Like many of the participants on today's call, we too would prefer other growth with a 4 or even a 5 handle, but markets do reset from time to time, either due to new supply or changes in the demand side of the equation. Unfortunately, the present at the time we're experiencing both factors in 2 were most important markets. And the weakness we're experiencing in San Francisco and New York City were driving reduction in our revenue growth expectations for the year. 
So with that said, I'll let David Santee go into more detailed about what's occurred over the last 60 to 90 days, how it's impacted us during the primary leasing season and our expect results for the year."

This morning, I'll address our revised same-store revenue guidance and give you some color on overall operations.

This morning, I'll address our revised same-store revenue guidance and give you some color on overall operations. As Boston, D.C., Seattle and Southern California are all generally performing in line with our expectations, I'll focus my commentary on San Francisco and New York.  We'll welcome any questions you have on our other markets in the Q&A. Today, Mark will address our same-store expenses in his remarks. 
As David said in his comments, we would not meet revenue expectations we announced in June and that is due in large part to the continued volatility that we're seeing in San Francisco, and to a lesser extent, New York. As these markets work towards new supply. Together, these 2 markets accounted for approximately 50% of our expected revenue growth in 2016 and the deterioration in both markets is rightly more volatility than we have experienced in our portfolio over the last half a dozen years. Now that markets are less stable as a result of elevated supply and pressure on the highly compensated job sector, optimizing occupancy comes at a cost to rate growth. 
And when we gave the revised guidance in June, San Francisco new lease rents have gone from being up 5% in Q1, down to flat in a matter of weeks. We assume that as a result of some of the irrational pricing you saw on new lease-ups, that we would see rate deteriorate further into negative territory, but that we could still achieve similar occupancy as we move through peak leasing season. 
We felt comfortable about occupancy because the last week of May, occupancy was 20 basis points higher than the same week last year and exposure was 20 basis points lower. We thought, certainly, if Seattle could absorb elevated supply with minimal disruption, San Fran could do the same. 
Our forecast for San Francisco new lease rents to go negative proved to be through very quickly, as new lease rents are now negative 3% versus same week last year. Unfortunately, over the next 4 weeks, our occupancy assumptions for San Francisco missed the mark and, today, we set up 95.8% occupied, 110 basis points lower than the same week last year. The deterioration of both metrics and the knowledge that new supply continues to be delivered to the rest of this year and heavily in the first half of next has led us to lower our full-year growth expectation for San Francisco to be around 6.5%, down from our expected 7.25% in June and the original 9.5% growth we expected when we gave the original guidance in Q4 of last year. 
San Francisco accounted for about 1/3 of our same-store revenue growth in 2016, and so this decline, along with New York City, accounts for the 100 basis points off of the entire portfolio. In San Francisco, we have seen a sizable amount of new supply, over 8,000 units, being delivered in 2016 and it is all in the high end of the market. This supply has hit the market at the same time the job growth in the tech sector has hit the pulse button. We still see good demand for units as evidenced by how well our newly completed development are leasing up, but we are feeling the impact of our target demographic having more choices than before. 
In the second quarter, our lease-over-lease delta was up 2.1% and July was up 95 basis points, while renewals were up 8.6%. Occupancy was 96.2% and turnover, excluding same-property transfers, increased 30 basis points from same quarter last year. Through Q2, turnover excluding transfers is down 30 basis points from 25% to 24.7%. 
Looking forward, new lease rents are expected to remain in the minus 3% range for July and August. Our renewals achieved for July are 8% and current lease 6.9% for August. Again, occupancy is 95.8%, but is only expected seasonal upswing as students return to school. 
Now switching to New York. When we gave guidance in June, it was clear that New York was going to deteriorate further and we are comfortable that we have forecasted the appropriate mix of rate in occupancy for the balance of the year. New York job growth expectations were at the time stable. While the economy there appears to be on solid footing and the overall job growth is at expected levels, the bulk of jobs added to date are mid-level compensation types job dominated by hospitality and leisure followed by healthcare. Professional services, our demographic, typically the higher-paying jobs held by our target demographic was a close third. 
The New York market continues to work to observe approximately nearly 9,000 units this year and with the great majority of that supply at the high-end, absorption has not been as robust as we would expect. As a result, it's possible that 2016 deliveries will carry over into 2017 lease-ups. We're already expecting a more elevated pipeline of new products scheduled for delivery in both '17 and '18. The concern in New York is that these elevated levels of supply, mainly private and fee managers, to elevate upfront move-in concessions beginning in the fourth quarter of 2016. 
Now on our shop, as we immediately take a cash charge in our same-store revenue of the full concession in the month of move-in, our revenue stream would be more impacted this year than if we amortize those concessions over the term of the lease. For example, year-to-date, we would have reported a 4.5% if we have straight line concessions versus the 4.4% that we reported. As a result, sequential quarter-over-quarter and full-year revenue growth will be more impacted this year. Much of the new supply delivered in 2016 has been focused on the West side, Jersey City and Brooklyn, all very competitive to our same-store portfolio in the market. 
2017 will see deliveries across a number of some markets, especially Long Island City and Brooklyn, but the Westside will see continued deliveries as well. Our current expectation for full-year same-store revenue growth for New York is now around 1.5%, which is down from the 2.25% growth expectation we had at the beginning of June and the 3.75% growth expectation we had at the start of the year. 
New York accounted for about 15% of our expected 2016 same-store revenue growth. In the second quarter, our lease-over-lease delta was minus 80 basis points. In July, it's minus 95 basis points. Renewal rates achieved were 4.4% for the quarter with July at 3.3%. Renewals achieved thus for August and September are 3.4% and 2.8%, respectively. 
Turnover, excluding same store -- same property transfers, increased 100 basis points quarter-over-quarter to 10.1% and 100 basis points year-to-date to 17.4%. Today, occupancy is 962%, with new lease rates slightly negative. 
Now before I close, I want to assure you that no one is more disappointed about having to lower our guidance again more than the entire team here at EQR as well as myself. I can also see that each staff, along the way, will work diligently to give you our best estimate at the time based on our collective experience. As David said, at the end of April, occupancy, exposures, turnover, renewal rents, new lease rents, all indicated another good year in San Francisco. 
Unfortunately, as we continue to increase rents in May, the market decided to get conservative and we had to react accordingly. We are obviously experiencing extremely volatile markets and this volatility is very difficult to predict. Perhaps, in hindsight, we're initially overoptimistic on San Francisco, given the levels of new supply, brought online this year but based on our dashboards at the end of April and later in early June, we would never have predicted the fall off in new lease rent and occupancy that we've experienced to date.

Second, the original disposition guidance included a $200 million portfolio of asset [indiscernible] for the present time, because we see continued upside in both operations and valuations there because sale at this time would be premature. And lastly, as noted in last night's release, we did not acquire any assets in the second quarter and have reduced our acquisition expectations for the year by $150 million. Since any incremental acquisitions will be funded by sales proceeds, we've reduced dispositions by a similar amount. 
During the second quarter, we did sell 3 noncore assets for $112.5 million and a 5.7% disposition yield and a 9.3% unleveraged IRR. In addition to selling these assets in Arizona, Massachusetts and Connecticut, last quarter, we also sold our entire interest in military housing at Joint Base Lewis and the court Washington and realizing a gain of $52.4 million. And we've been involved with since 2002, during which time, we renovated over 2,200 homes and built more than 800 new homes for the men and women called by the joint base home, while serving our country. We're very proud of our work at in the last 14 years and it was really our honor and privilege to be involved there. 
With regard to our development business, we commenced construction in 1 small development project in the second quarter in the Washington, D.C. where we're building 222 units for $88 million or $396,000 a unit. And unexpected yield on cost of today's rent in the mid-5s. The deal was in the market and will be delivered in late 2018 and is expected to stabilize in late 2019. 
We're also currently working on 2 small projects totaling $90 million if we start construction this year with a weighted average cost at today's rents in the mid to high 5s. Bring the second quarter, we also completed construction in our lease-up of 3 new development deals, all in the San Francisco market, 2 Downtown and 1 in North San Jose. These efforts are leasing extremely well and are experiencing monthly absorption rates in excess of original expectations. 
From a pricing standpoint, like our same-store portfolio, we're now achieving the rents we have hoped at the beginning of the year, while the rents we are achieving our well in excess of those under it at the time of the site were acquired and constructions commenced. And as a result, these assets will provide stabilized yields from the high 5s to high 7s, which are well in excess of our original expectations. 
I'll turn the call over to Mark Parrell."

Today, I'll be giving some color behind our same-store expense guidance and the change to our normalized FFO guidance. I will then discuss how the change to our normalized FFO guidance impacted the remaining special dividend payment and our debt issue is guidance. In all these is, I'm comparing the guidance numbers we gave you in late April 2016 as part of our first quarter earnings call to the revised guidance that we provided last night.  As you might recall, the June 1st press release only revised our same-store revenue and NOI ranges. 
So moving on to the same-store expense side, we have left our annual same-store expense range at an increase of 2.5% to 3% and this is not withstanding the fact that same-store expenses year-to-date have only grown by 0.9%. This implies that we expect second half same-store expenses to grow at a considerably higher rate of about 4.6%. As usual, our big 3 expense categories are real estate taxes, utilities and payroll will drive these numbers. We now expect property taxes to increase at a rate of about 6% versus our previous expectation in our year-to-date number of 5.5%. This increase is due to a recent adversely legal decision regarding the calculation of property taxes for several of our properties in Jersey City. We also previously forecast payroll growth of 2.5% to 3% and we still believe they forecast to be accurate. Year-to-date peril is only increased 0.3%, so we see most of the expected increase in payroll as backend loaded. 
For the year, we expect utilities expense to decline by approximately 3%. Year-to-date, utilities expense is down 8.1%. Most of the expected growth in the second half on the utility side is due to our expectation of somewhat higher commodity prices later in this year as compared to the historically low commodity prices we had in the third and fourth quarters of 2015. 
So moving on to normalized FFO. The reduction in the same-store NOI from the midpoint back in April of 5.5% to a midpoint now of 4% causes a normalized FFO reduction of about $23 million or about $0.06 per share. Going the other way an increase in our normalized FFO estimate, we now expect an additional $4 million in NOI or about $0.01 per share to the positive due to the reduction in this positions combined with these as of sales being pushed back further into the year. David Nethercutt previously discussed the reasons for this reduction in our disposition activity. 
Our reduction in acquisition guidance from $600 million to $350 million and disposition guidance from $7.4 billion to $6.9 billion has only had a very modest impact on the amount of taxable gain that we only incurred in 2016 and meet the special dividend. And this is because the specific assets that we removed from our disposition guidance, just specifically and relatively tax gain and because we have already paid the $8 per share March 2016 special dividend, the preponderance of the tax gain that we will incur in 2016. We therefore left our guidance for the annual special dividend in the range of $2 to $4 per share with the thought that the ultimate amount that we will pay is likely to be at or slightly lower than that midpoint. Our guidance assumes that this payment will be made in the fourth quarter of 2016. All dividend payments are subject still to the approval of our Board of Trustees. 
Moving on to the debt side. Because our net to disposition activity is about $250 million lower than we expected back in April, our projected line balance at December 31, 2016, is anticipated to now be about $430 million versus the $130 million we previously estimated.

And I don't want get into specifics of the numbers, but I want to focus on your processes and procedures in terms of forecasting and the results. And do you have heard many we've seen all the reasons of data, we've seen the pricing that you have and now you've reduced guidance 3x. So we're trying to figure out sort of what are the issues in terms of is your asset forecasting system not driving the right rates and so the input's not right or the output is not right. Is it an operations issue or is it an FP&A issue that's causing this, because the way you have 1 strike, 2 strikes, but doing it 3x, 1 could imagine that there are other issues at play here than just the markets in terms of how the data's coming in relative to your expectations and ultimately, what you put out to the Street. And on the supply side, I don't think the 500 unit building sort of pops of overnight, with the input that you would know, so maybe either, I don't now but sort of get some color around some of the processes and procedures that are going on."

There's probably 6 of us that run our models from different perspectives. But at the end of the day, we all wind up in the same place. I think a lot of the volatility has been very quick and at very inopportune times. One of the things that makes it very difficult to forecast is when we look at the precipitous drop and new lease rents in San Francisco. And look, we've had Boston, D.C., all of these other markets have delivered outside supply that have relatively strong occupancy. And as I said in my prepared remarks, we will prepare for rents to go down. When you look at the new lease-ups, if new lease-ups are giving 1 month free, basically, you can go into our brand-new building at 2015 rent. If a new lease-up is giving 2 months free, you can move into a brand-new building at 2014 rents. I think to some extent, we're a victim of our own success on the renewal side. When you look at San Francisco, 35% of our expirations are almost 5% above current Street rents. And with volatility ranging from plus 2% to as much as down 10% at certain properties in San Francisco, it really comes down to who moves out and at what property do they move out of. I mean, as rents down 10%, a person could be 6% above current market rents at 16% decline on $4,000 a month rent times a couple of hundred -- couple $300 each month for a couple of points winds down your revenue stream pretty quickly. So I hope that gives you a little more granular explanation of why it is very difficult to predict at the rate of decline that we can expect, especially in the peak season where you have 15% of your leases expiring in June, July and August each month. So extreme volatility with the highest number of transactions in the year with job growth really coming to a halt at the high end of the market is just making it very difficult to forecast forward. New York is kind of in the same boat, 45% of our expirations."

I think that some of the -- I mean, basically, I think we were all really optimistic about San Francisco and really just kind of mirrored -- at certain point in time, judgment has come into play. But what's different also about California is that California is a 30-day market. All of our other markets are 60-day markets. So you have a longer runway to see who's giving notice. You have longer runway to react to pricing and what have you. And so this was -- the San Francisco and the 30-day market with these dramatic changes within 30 days is just very hard to forecast and very hard to react as quickly to adjust. Let me just add one thing there, Michael, just general serve. The philosophy we have with respect to this. Our intent every time is to give the -- our investors our best guess as to how we see our business performing going forward. That 90% of that best guess or 80% of that best guess or 75% of that business, rather, our best guess based upon the tools that we have at our disposal, the boots we have on the ground and the judgment of the people who've been doing this for an awful long time. And it's not intended to give you the range of all possible outcomes, but those outcomes that we think are most probable based upon the tools that we have and the judgment that we use. And as David said, as these markets have turned to become quite volatile, it's become far more difficult to do that, but each step of the way, we try and give your best guess. And as David said, we're as disappointed with anyone about where we are relative to where we ended up. But this, we believe, we have an obligation to be as transparent with the Street as we can and to give them our absolute best guess and not build in and also to efficient but to tell it like we see it. And we think we've done that every step of the way and it's just difficult to do so with things running and moving. Quickly in markets that we're deliver 50% of our growth for the year."

I say the assets in these markets continue to trade at the very low cap rates, Dave with 3 handles. In some instances even through a 3 handle. There continues to be, perhaps not as much demand but certainly sufficient demand for these hard assets in these gateway cities that we've not seen any change in value at least at the present time. Now there are maybe because there might be fewer and potential if your buyers will maybe some bid ask spreads and wide certain instances, but the transaction we're seeing getting done in the market in which we operate continue to support the valuations that we've been talking about. Just with respect to strategy, I think we've got NOIs wide open that by operating in fewer markets we're likely to have more volatility. But again, we think these are the markets that are going to create jobs and these are the markets where people are going to want to live, work and play, and to perform best over the long term. As David noted, we've had 10% compounded growth rate in San Francisco over the past 5 years. If it was flat revenue growth over the next 5 or 10 years, it duw still be 4.5, which is very, very strong revenue growth. So we remain very committed to the markets. And. We think that again, this are the place where the economy going forward and will thrive. And that we'll see better overall risk-adjusted total returns in these markets. You've seen construction cost continue to go up in these markets and replacement costs going up. But I guess, I'd also say that in these markets, while there is elevated or more supplies than you've seen in the past and as a percentage of existing inventory, these are troubling amounts of new supply and in historical context, aren't unprecedented levels of new supplies. So it's more than we've seen, it's disrupting us somewhat, but as evidenced just my earliest, particularly San Francisco, which have gone extraordinarily well.

So it was very easy to forecast just based on momentum. Certainly, when you get to August, the rate portion that drives revenue growth in the current year is baked. I mean, there's just not enough transactions remaining in the year to meaningful impact the full year revenue. But what can meaningfully change your revenue September, October, November, December is certainly occupancy. And more importantly, concessions. Because as I've mentioned in my prepared remarks, if we give a full month's concession, that's an 8% discount that we take a full charge on in that month. So if concessions, upfront concessions, really ramped up which we are not a fan of, where we try to be a net effective rent shop, then that will seriously impact your revenue stream in that month and for the next couple of months."

So when we talked back in February about our guidance, we put out a wider. You might recall normalized FFO range usually at $0.20 range. We told you have more variability in our numbers because we had all this position activity and we do know what it would attribute in our business and the later it occurred, the higher FFO would be and the earlier of where we de-risk the special dividend that we really did have all that uncertainty, we also didn't know when we we're paying special note that we pay, we are moving pieces. So when we put our range together and we spoke to you in February and we spoke to you in April, we saw in our range a way in which we could get modestly above the midpoint of our range and into the upper half of our old range if we sold our assets relatively slowly. And so we gave ourselves a little flexibility. As our operating conditions deteriorated, as we became more certain about what debt we're paying off, where we're going to pay the specials and after you that in be sold that's what caused the whole thing to gravitate down.

So we're seeing great results in Orange County as a result of the supply -- the new deliveries being in totally different submarkets and far away from our existing portfolio. But I'd say beyond that, Alex, our expectation is for deliveries to come down. The build 2 yields we see in the markets today are extremely low and we certainly understand that the lending community's becoming much more conservative with respect to advance rates and if they're willing to sponsor, you'll hear more and more -- transaction team are seeing more and more inquiries about capital needs for developers who might have land tied up to complete the capital stock.

The good news is that a lot of those units are now in the suburbs. And I think on our last call, we said that we have this 12 to 18-month window where 2017 deliveries kind of moved back into the urban core, the seaport, what have yous. So I mean, that's why you're seeing better revenue growth in Boston. Even though we delivered 5,000 units in '15 in the urban core, we were still able to hold occupancy at 96%, new lease rents were flat. And we were still able to get renewal increases. And that's kind of what we've experienced over the years is that even though these markets that we're in today, we can still deliver product, hold the occupancy but feel the rate pressure. And then when the new deliveries move away from you, you start to get pricing power back. And I think that's -- I we're we just kind of in the middle or the beginning stages of getting to that point in San Francisco and New York. But again, it's kind of the mix of jobs and where the deliveries. So you mentioned Seattle. I mean, Seattle is delivering, I think they delivered 6,000, 5,000 units last year. Significant deliveries in '14. The occupancy has continued to hold. We've continued to be able to push rents. We expected in Seattle that we would see pricing pressure in downtown, Central Business District, Capitol Hill but now we're seeing revenue actually accelerate in those markets as we begin to absorb.

Thanks for joining us. Clearly, 2016 did not turn out to be the year that we had originally expected due to deteriorating market conditions in San Francisco and New York City, which combined, made up 50% of our initial growth forecast for the year. 
As David Santee will address in greater detail in just a moment, at the time of our first quarter earnings call, nearly all indicators suggest that while the top end of our original expectation was off the table, another year of solid upper 4% in same-store revenue was most likely as strong demand continued to absorb new supply with little impact to existing inventory. 
The month of May, however, brought sudden and material changes to the fundamental picture, particularly in San Francisco, in a 50 basis point reduction to the company's expected revenue growth for the year. In the last 60 days, fundamentals have continued to weaken in these markets, causing us to yet again reduce our expectations for full-year revenue growth, which for the first time in many years, is now expected to have a 3 handle. And as a result, after 5 years of extraordinary strong fundamentals, revenue growth this year will now be more in line with historical trends. 
Like many of the participants on today's call, we too would prefer other growth as a 4 or even a 5 handle, but markets do reset from time to time, either due to new supply or changes in the demand side of the equation. Unfortunately, at the present time we're experiencing both factors in 2 of our most important markets. And the weakness we're experiencing in San Francisco and New York City is driving the reduction in our revenue growth expectations for the year. 
So with that said, I'll let David Santee go into more detail about what's occurred over the last 60 to 90 days, how it's impacted us during the primary leasing season and our expected results for the year."
28209,332083609,1014068,"Equity Residential, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2016",2016-07-27,"Earnings Calls","Equity Residential","Executives","Okay. Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone. This morning, I'll address our revised same-store revenue guidance and give you some color on overall operations.

This morning, I'll address our revised same-store revenue guidance and give you some color on overall operations. As Boston, D.C., Seattle and Southern California are all generally performing in line with our expectations, I'll focus my commentary on San Francisco and New York. We'll welcome any questions you have on our other markets in the Q&A. Today, Mark will address our same-store expenses in his remarks. 
As David said in his comments, we would not meet revenue expectations that we announced in June and that is due in large part to the continued volatility that we are seeing in San Francisco, and to a lesser extent, New York, as these markets work to absorb new supply. Together, these 2 markets accounted for approximately 50% of our expected revenue growth in 2016 and the deterioration in both markets is driving more volatility than we have experienced in our portfolio over the last half dozen years. Now that markets are less stable as a result of elevated supply and pressure on the highly compensated job sector, optimizing occupancy comes at a cost to rate growth. 
Now when we gave the revised guidance in June, San Francisco new lease rents had gone from being up 5% in Q1, down to flat in a matter of weeks. We assume that as a result of some of the irrational pricing we saw on new lease-ups that we would see rates deteriorate further into negative territory, but that we could still achieve similar occupancy as we move through peak leasing season. 
We felt comfortable about occupancy because in the last week of May, occupancy was 20 basis points higher than the same week last year and exposure was 20 basis points lower. We thought, certainly, if Seattle could absorb elevated supply with minimal disruption, San Fran could do the same. 
Our forecast for San Francisco new lease rents to go negative proved to be true very quickly as new lease rents are now negative 3% versus same week last year. Unfortunately, over the next 4 weeks, our occupancy assumptions for San Francisco missed the mark. And today, we sit at 95.8% occupied, 110 basis points lower than the same week last year. The deterioration of both metrics and the knowledge that new supply continues to be delivered through the rest of this year and heavily in the first half of next has led us to lower our full year growth expectation for San Francisco to be around 6.5%, down from our expected 7.75% in June and the original 9.5% growth we expected when we gave the original guidance in Q4 of last year. 
San Francisco accounted for about 1/3 of our same-store revenue growth in 2016. And so this decline, along with New York City, accounts for the 100 basis points off of the entire portfolio. In San Francisco, we had seen a sizable amount of new supply, over 8,000 units, being delivered in 2016 and it is all at the high end of the market. This supply has hit the market at the same time the job growth in the tech sector has hit the pause button. We still see good demand for units as evidenced by how well our newly completed developments are leasing up, but we are feeling the impact of our target demographic having more choices than before. 
In the second quarter, our lease-over-lease delta was up 2.1% and July was up 95 basis points, while renewals were up 8.6%. Occupancy was 96.2% and turnover, excluding same-property transfers, increased 30 basis points from same quarter last year. Through Q2, turnover excluding transfers is down 30 basis points with 25% to 24.7%. 
Looking forward, new lease rents are expected to remain in the minus 3% range for July and August. Our renewals achieved for July are 8% and currently 6.9% for August. Again, occupancy is 95.8%, but is only expected seasonal upswing as students return to school. 
Now switching to New York. When we gave guidance in June, it was clear that New York was going to deteriorate further, and we are comfortable that we have forecasted the appropriate mix of rate and occupancy for the balance of the year. New York job growth expectations were at the time stable. While the economy there appears to be on solid footing and the overall job growth is at expected levels, the bulk of jobs added today are mid-level compensation types jobs dominated by hospitality and leisure, followed by health care. Professional services, our demographic, typically the higher-paying jobs held by our target demographic was a close third. 
The New York market continues to work to absorb approximately nearly 9,000 units this year. And with the great majority of that supply at the high-end, absorption has not been as robust as we would expect. As a result, it's possible that 2016 deliveries will carry over into 2017 lease-ups. We're already expecting a more elevated pipeline of new products scheduled for delivery in both '17 and '18. The concern in New York is that these elevated levels of supply, mainly private and fee managers, to elevate upfront move-in concessions beginning in the fourth quarter of 2016. 
Now on our shop, as we immediately take a cash charge in our same-store revenue of the full concession in the month of move-in, our revenue stream would be more impacted this year than if we amortize those concessions over the term of the lease. For example, year-to-date, we would have reported a 4.5% if we had straight line concessions versus the 4.4% that we reported. As a result, sequential quarter-over-quarter and full-year revenue growth will be more impacted this year. Much of the new supply delivered in 2016 has been focused on the West Side, Jersey City and Brooklyn, all very competitive to our same-store portfolio in the market. 
2017 will see deliveries across a number of some markets, especially Long Island City and Brooklyn, but the West Side will see continued deliveries as well. Our current expectation for full-year, same-store revenue growth for New York is now around 1.5%, which is down from the 2.25% growth expectation we had at the beginning of June and the 3.75% growth expectation we had at the start of the year. 
New York accounted for about 15% of our expected 2016 same-store revenue growth. In the second quarter, our lease-over-lease delta was minus 80 basis points, and July is minus 95 basis points. Renewal rates achieved were 4.3% for the quarter with July at 3.3%. Renewals achieved thus far for August and September are 3.4% and 2.8%, respectively. 
Turnover, excluding same store -- same property transfers, increased 100 basis points quarter-over-quarter to 10.1% and 100 basis points year-to-date to 17.4%. Today, occupancy is 96.2%, with new lease rates slightly negative. 
Now before I close, I want to assure you that no one is more disappointed about having to lower our guidance again more than the entire team here at EQR as well as myself. I can also say that each staff along the way, we work diligently to give you our best estimate at the time based on our collective experience. As David said, at the end of April, occupancy, exposure, turnover, renewal rents, new lease rents, all indicated another good year in San Francisco. 
Unfortunately, as we continue to increase rents in May, the market decided to get conservative and we had to react accordingly. We are obviously experiencing extremely volatile markets, and this volatility is very difficult to predict. Perhaps, in hindsight, we were initially overoptimistic on San Francisco, given the levels of new supply brought online this year, but based on our dashboards at the end of April and later in early June, we would never have predicted the fall-off in new lease rent and occupancy that we experienced today.

This $500 million reduction is a",520,"Okay. Thank you, David. As noted in last night's earnings release, we've also made some changes to our expected transaction activity for the year. Dispositions have now been reduced to $6.9 billion, down from $7.4 billion. This $500 million reduction is a result of 3 factors. First, about $150 million of the Non-Boston New England assets that are in various stages of the disposition process will not likely close this year, but will carry over into the first quarter of 2017. 
Second, the original disposition guidance included a $200 million portfolio of assets we decided to hold for the present time because we see continued upside in both operations and valuations there. We think a sale at this time would be premature. And lastly, as noted in last night's release, we did not acquire any assets in the second quarter and have reduced our acquisition expectations for the year by $150 million. Since any incremental acquisitions will be funded by sales proceeds, we have reduced dispositions by a similar amount. 
During the second quarter, we did sell 3 noncore assets for $112.5 million and a 5.7% disposition yield and a 9.3% unleveraged IRR. In addition to selling these assets in Arizona, Massachusetts and Connecticut, last quarter, we also sold our entire interest in the military housing at Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Tacoma, Washington, and realizing a gain of $52.4 million. 
Now we've been involved with Lewis-McChord since 2002, during which time we renovated over 2,200 homes and built more than 800 new homes for the men and women who called the Joint Base home while serving our country. We're very proud of our work at Lewis-McChord in the last 14 years, and it was really our honor and privilege to be involved there. 
With regard to our development business, we commenced construction in 1 small development project in the second quarter in Washington, D.C., where we're building 222 units for $88 million or $396,000 a unit and at an unexpected yield on cost at today's rents in the mid-5s. The deal was in the NoMa market and will be delivered in late 2018 and is expected to stabilize in late 2019. 
We're also currently working on 2 small projects totaling $90 million that could start construction yet this year with a weighted average cost at today's rents in the mid to high 5s. 
During the second quarter, we also completed construction in our lease-up of 3 new development deals, all in the San Francisco market, 2 Downtown and 1 in North San Jose. These assets are leasing extremely well and are experiencing monthly absorption rates in excess of original expectations. 
From a pricing standpoint, like our same-store portfolio, we're not achieving the rents we had hoped at the beginning of the year. While the rents we are achieving are well in excess of those underwritten at the time these sites were acquired and constructions commenced. And as a result, these assets will provide stabilized yields from the high 5s to high 7s, which are well in excess of our original expectations. 
I'll turn the call now over to Mark Parrell."

Today, I'll be giving some color behind our same-store expense guidance and the change to our normalized FFO guidance. I will then discuss how the change to our normalized FFO guidance impacted the remaining special dividend payment and our debt issuance guidance. In all these cases, I'm comparing the guidance numbers we gave you in late April 2016 as part of our first quarter earnings call to the revised guidance that we provided last night. As you might recall, the June 1st press release only revised our same-store revenue and NOI ranges. 
So moving on to the same-store expense side, we have left our annual same-store expense range at an increase of 2.5% to 3%, and this is not withstanding the fact that same-store expenses year-to-date have only grown by 0.9%. This implies that we expect second half same-store expenses to grow at a considerably higher rate of about 4.6%. As usual, our big 3 expense categories are real estate taxes, utilities and payroll will drive these numbers. We now expect property taxes to increase at a rate of about 6% versus our previous expectation in our year-to-date number of 5.5%. This increase is due to a recent adverse legal decision regarding the calculation of property taxes for several of our properties in New-- in  Jersey City. We also previously forecast payroll growth of 2.5% to 3% and we still believe that forecast to be accurate. Year-to-date, payroll has only increased 0.3%, so we see most of the expected increase in payroll as back-end loaded. 
For the year, we expect utilities expense to decline by approximately 3%. Year-to-date, utilities expense is down 8.1%. Most of the expected growth in the second half on the utility side is due to our expectation of somewhat higher commodity prices later in this year as compared to the historically low commodity prices we had in the third and fourth quarters of 2015. 
So moving on to normalized FFO. The reduction in the same-store NOI from a midpoint back in April of 5.5% to a midpoint now of 4% causes a normalized FFO reduction of about $23 million or about $0.06 per share. Going the other way an increase in our normalized FFO estimate, we now expect an additional $4 million in NOI or about $0.01 per share to the positive due to the reduction in dispositions combined with these asset sales being pushed back further into the year. David Neithercut previously discussed the reasons for this reduction in our disposition activity. 
Our reduction in acquisition guidance from $600 million to $350 million and disposition guidance from $7.4 billion to $6.9 billion has only had a very modest impact on the amount of taxable gain that we will incur in 2016 and meet the special dividend. And this is because the specific assets that we removed from our disposition guidance, just specifically at relatively little tax gain and because we have already paid with the $8 per share March 2016 special dividend, the preponderance of the tax gain that we will incur in 2016. We, therefore, left our guidance for the annual special dividend in the range of $2 to $4 per share with the thought that the ultimate amount that we will pay is likely to be at or slightly lower than that midpoint. Our guidance assumes that this payment will be made in the fourth quarter of 2016. All dividend payments are subject still to the approval of our Board of Trustees. 
Moving on to the debt side. Because our net disposition activity is about $250 million lower than we expected back in April, our projected line balance at December 31, 2016, is anticipated to now be about $430 million versus the $130 million we previously estimated. For now, we have left our debt issuance guidance at about $225 million. But if our disposition process goes as expected, we may do a larger offering, and that's now included in our guidance, in either the secured or unsecured markets later in 2016. 
And I'll now turn the call back over to the operator for the question-and-answer period."

And look, we've had Boston, D.C., all of these other markets have delivered outsized supply, but have relatively strong occupancy. And as I said in my prepared remarks, we were prepared for rents to go down. When you look at the new lease-ups, if new lease-ups are giving 1 month free, basically, you can move into a brand-new building at 2015 rents. If a new lease-up is giving 2 months free, you can move into a brand-new building at 2014 rents. I think to some extent, we're a victim of our own success on the renewal side. When you look at San Francisco, 35% of our expirations are almost 5% above current Street rents. And with volatility ranging from plus 2% to as much as down 10% at certain properties in San Francisco, it really comes down to who moves out and at what property do they move out of. I mean, at -- with rents down 10%, a person could be 6% above current market rents, at 16% decline on a $4,000 a month rent times a couple of hundred -- couple $300 each month for a couple of points winds down your revenue stream pretty quickly. So I hope that gives you a little more granular explanation of why it is very difficult to predict the -- at the rate of decline that we can expect, especially in the peak season, where you have 15% of your leases expiring in June, July and August, each month. So extreme volatility with the highest number of transactions in the year with job growth really coming to a halt at the high end of the market is just making it very difficult to forecast forward. New York is kind of in the same boat, 45% of our expirations."

I'd say the assets in these markets continue to trade at very low cap rates, Dave, with 3 handles. In some instances even through a 3 handle. There continues to be, perhaps not as much demand but certainly sufficient demand for these hard assets in these gateway cities that we've not seen any change in value at least at the present time. Now there may be because there might be fewer tourists and potentially fewer buyers, maybe some bid ask, spreads widen in certain instances, but the transactions that we're seeing getting done in the market in which we operate continue to support the valuations that we've been talking about. Just with respect to strategy, I think we've gone in with our eyes wide open that by operating in fewer markets, we're likely to have more volatility. But again, we think these are the markets that are going to create jobs and these are the markets where people are going to want to live, work and play, and they'll perform best over the long term. As David noted, we've had 10% compounded growth rate in San Francisco over the past 5 years. If it was flat job-- flat  revenue growth over the next 5, over 10 years, it would still be 4.5%, which is very, very strong revenue growth. So we remain very committed to the markets we're in. We think that, again, these are the place where the economy going forward will thrive and that we will see better overall risk-adjusted total returns in these markets. You've seen construction cost continue to go up in these markets. The replacement costs are going up. But I guess, I'd also say that in these markets, while there is elevated or more supply than we've seen in the past as a percentage of existing inventory, these aren't troubling amounts of new supply and in historical context, aren't unprecedented levels of new supplies. So it's more than we've seen. It's disrupting us somewhat, but as evidenced just by our lease-ups, particularly in San Francisco, which have gone extraordinarily well, demand is there and we couldn't be happier with the product that we're delivering and we'll outperform our original expectations and we think we're in right place for a long-term perspective."

I mean, all of the markets went down in the Great Recession and then all of the markets kind of came up together. During those years, you really had virtually no new supply to speak of. So it was very easy to forecast just based on momentum. Certainly, when you get to August, the rate portion that drives revenue growth in the current year is baked. I mean, there's just not enough transactions remaining in the year to meaningfully impact the full year revenue. But what can meaningfully change your revenue September or October, the November, December is certainly occupancy. And more importantly, concessions. Because as I've mentioned in my prepared remarks, if we give a full month's concession, that's an 8% discount that we take a full charge on in that month. So if concessions, upfront concessions, really ramped up, which we are not a fan of, where we try to be a net effective rent shop, then that will seriously impact your revenue stream in that month and for the next couple of months."

So when we talked back in February about our guidance, we put out a wider. You might recall, normalized FFO range usually at a $0.20 range. We told you we had more variability in our numbers because we had all this disposition activity and we didn't know when it would occur. And obviously, the later it occurred, the higher FFO would be; and the earlier, the more we derisk the special dividend that we really didn't have all that uncertainty. We also didn't know when we were paying the special, what debt we'd pay off. So there's just a lot of moving pieces. So when we put our range together and we spoke to you in February and we spoke to you in April, we saw in our range a way in which we could get modestly above the midpoint of our range and into the upper half of our old range if we sold our assets relatively slowly. And so we gave ourselves a little flexibility. As our operating conditions deteriorated, as we became more certain about what debt we were paying off, when we were going to pay the specials and what assets were going to be sold, that's what caused the whole thing to gravitate down. So the math is absolutely right. $0.06 down on same store, $0.01 up on transactions. But I'm starting from a higher point than the 3 10 you are."

But when you're giving us guidance, are you extrapolating the current trends like you had been in the guidance early in the year and unfortunately felt that volatility? Or are you being more conservative now because the supply, although it hasn't become manic or created volatility at the downside, you now have learned from that and you're saying, okay, we're going to be more cautious even though that those markets are extrapolating -- we could extrapolate positively?"

The good news is, is that a lot of those units are now in the suburbs. And I think on our last call, we said that we have this 12- to 18-month window where 2017 deliveries kind of moved back into the urban core, the seaport, what have you. So I mean, that's why we're seeing better revenue growth in Boston. Even though we delivered 5,000 units in '15 in the urban core, we were still able to hold occupancy at 96%, new lease rents were flat and we were still able to get renewal increases. And that's kind of the -- what we've experienced over the years is that even though these -- the markets that we're in today, you can still deliver product, hold the occupancy but feel the rate pressure. And then when the new deliveries move away from you, you start to get pricing power back. And I think that's -- I think we're just kind of in the middle or the beginning stages of getting to that point in San Francisco and New York. But again, it's kind of the mix of jobs and where the deliveries are. So you mentioned Seattle. I mean, Seattle is delivering -- I think they delivered 6,000, 5,000 units last year, significant deliveries in '14. The occupancy has continued to hold. We've continued to be able to push rents. We expected in Seattle that we would see pricing pressure in Belltown, Central Business District, Capitol Hill. But now we're seeing revenue actually accelerate in those markets as we begin to absorb. So it's just a combination of jobs, level of absorption and the relative location of the new supply."

Thanks for joining us. Clearly, 2016 did not turn out to be the year that we had originally expected due to deteriorating market conditions in San Francisco and New York City, which combined, made up 50% of our initial growth forecast for the year. 
As David Santee will address in greater detail in just a moment, at the time of our first quarter earnings call, nearly all indicators suggest that while the top end of our original expectation was off the table, another year of solid upper 4% growth in same-store revenue was most likely as strong demand continued to absorb new supply with little impact to existing inventory. 
The month of May, however, brought sudden and material changes to the fundamental picture, particularly in San Francisco, in a 50-basis-point reduction to the company's expected revenue growth for the year. In the last 60 days, fundamentals have continued to weaken in these markets, causing us to yet again reduce our expectations for full-year revenue growth, which for the first time in many years, is now expected to have a 3 handle. And as a result, after 5 years of extraordinary strong fundamentals, revenue growth this year will now be more in line with historical trends. 
Like many of the participants on today's call, we too would prefer other growth of a 4 or even a 5 handle, but markets do reset from time to time, either due to new supply or changes in the demand side of the equation. Unfortunately, at the present time we're experiencing both factors in 2 of our most important markets. And the weakness we're experiencing in San Francisco and New York City is driving the reduction in our revenue growth expectations for the year. 
So with that said, I'll let David Santee go into more detail about what's occurred over the last 60 to 90 days, how it's impacted us during the primary leasing season and our expected results for the year."
28209,332083609,1014350,"Equity Residential, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2016",2016-07-27,"Earnings Calls","Equity Residential","Executives","Okay. Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone. This morning, I'll address our revised same-store revenue guidance and give you some color on overall operations.

This morning, I'll address our revised same-store revenue guidance and give you some color on overall operations. As Boston, D.C., Seattle and Southern California are all generally performing in line with our expectations, I'll focus my commentary on San Francisco and New York. We'll welcome any questions you have on our other markets in the Q&A. Today, Mark will address our same-store expenses in his remarks. 
As David said in his comments, we would not meet revenue expectations that we announced in June and that is due in large part to the continued volatility that we are seeing in San Francisco, and to a lesser extent, New York, as these markets work to absorb new supply. Together, these 2 markets accounted for approximately 50% of our expected revenue growth in 2016 and the deterioration in both markets is driving more volatility than we have experienced in our portfolio over the last half dozen years. Now that markets are less stable as a result of elevated supply and pressure on the highly compensated job sector, optimizing occupancy comes at a cost to rate growth. 
Now when we gave a revised guidance in June, San Francisco new lease rents had gone from being up 5% in Q1, down to flat in a matter of weeks. We assume that as a result of some of the irrational pricing we saw on new lease-ups that we would see rates deteriorate further into negative territory, but that we could still achieve similar occupancy as we move through peak leasing season. 
We felt comfortable about occupancy because in the last week of May, occupancy was 20 basis points higher than the same week last year and exposure was 20 basis points lower. We thought, certainly, if Seattle could absorb elevated supply with minimal disruption, San Fran could do the same. 
Our forecast for San Francisco new lease rents to go negative proved to be true very quickly as new lease rents are now negative 3% versus same week last year. Unfortunately, over the next 4 weeks, our occupancy assumptions for San Francisco missed the mark. And today, we sit at 95.8% occupied, 110 basis points lower than the same week last year. The deterioration of both metrics and the knowledge that new supply continues to be delivered through the rest of this year and heavily in the first half of next has led us to lower our full year growth expectation for San Francisco to be around 6.5%, down from our expected 7.75% in June and the original 9.5% growth we expected when we gave the original guidance in Q4 of last year. 
San Francisco accounted for about 1/3 of our same-store revenue growth in 2016. And so this decline, along with New York City, accounts for the 100 basis points off of the entire portfolio. In San Francisco, we had seen a sizable amount of new supply, over 8,000 units, being delivered in 2016 and it is all at the high end of the market. This supply has hit the market at the same time the job growth in the tech sector has hit the pause button. We still see good demand for units as evidenced by how well our newly completed developments are leasing up, but we are feeling the impact of our target demographic having more choices than before. 
In the second quarter, our lease-over-lease delta was up 2.1% and July was up 95 basis points, while renewals were up 8.6%. Occupancy was 96.2% and turnover, excluding same-property transfers, increased 30 basis points from same quarter last year. Through Q2, turnover excluding transfers is down 30 basis points with 25% to 24.7%. 
Looking forward, new lease rents are expected to remain in the minus 3% range for July and August. Our renewals achieved for July are 8% and currently 6.9% for August. Again, occupancy is 95.8%, but is on the expected seasonal upswing as students return to school. 
Now switching to New York. When we gave guidance in June, it was clear that New York was going to deteriorate further, and we are comfortable that we have forecasted the appropriate mix of rate and occupancy for the balance of the year. New York job growth expectations were at the time stable. While the economy there appears to be on solid footing and the overall job growth is at expected levels, the bulk of jobs added to date are mid-level compensation types jobs dominated by hospitality and leisure, followed by health care. Professional services, our demographic, typically the higher-paying jobs held by our target demographic, was a close third. 
The New York market continues to work to absorb approximately nearly 9,000 units this year. And with the great majority of that supply at the high-end, absorption has not been as robust as we would expect. As a result, it's possible that 2016 deliveries will carry over into 2017 lease-ups. We're already expecting a more elevated pipeline of new products scheduled for delivery in both '17 and '18. The concern in New York is that these elevated levels of supply, mainly private and fee managers, to elevate upfront move-in concessions beginning in the fourth quarter of 2016. 
Now on our shop, as we immediately take a cash charge in our same-store revenue of the full concession in the month of move-in, our revenue stream would be more impacted this year than if we amortize those concessions over the term of the lease. For an example, year-to-date, we would have reported a 4.5% if we had straight line concessions versus the 4.4% that we reported. As a result, sequential quarter-over-quarter and full-year revenue growth will be more impacted this year. Much of the new supply delivered in 2016 has been focused on the West Side, Jersey City and Brooklyn, all very competitive to our same-store portfolio in the market. 
2017 will see deliveries across a number of submarkets, especially Long Island City and Brooklyn, but the West Side will see continued deliveries as well. Our current expectation for full-year, same-store revenue growth for New York is now around 1.5%, which is down from the 2.25% growth expectation we had at the beginning of June and the 3.75% growth expectation we had to start the year. 
New York accounted for about 15% of our expected 2016 same-store revenue growth. In the second quarter, our lease-over-lease delta was minus 80 basis points, and July is minus 95 basis points. Renewal rates achieved were 4.3% for the quarter with July at 3.3%. Renewals achieved thus far for August and September are 3.4% and 2.8%, respectively. 
Turnover, excluding same store -- same property transfers, increased 100 basis points quarter-over-quarter to 10.1% and 100 basis points year-to-date to 17.4%. Today, occupancy is 96.2%, with new lease rates slightly negative. 
Now before I close, I want to assure you that no one is more disappointed about having to lower our guidance again more than the entire team here at EQR as well as myself. I can also say that each stop along the way, we work diligently to give you our best estimate at the time based on our collective experience. As David said, at the end of April, occupancy, exposure, turnover, renewal rents, new lease rents all indicated another good year in San Francisco. 
Unfortunately, as we continue to increase rents in May, the market decided to get conservative and we had to react accordingly. We are obviously experiencing extremely volatile markets, and this volatility is very difficult to predict. Perhaps, in hindsight, we were initially overoptimistic on San Francisco, given the levels of new supply brought online this year, but based on our dashboards at the end of April and later in early June, we would never have predicted the fall-off in new lease rent and occupancy that we experienced today.

This $500 million reduction is a",519,"Okay. Thank you, David. As noted in last night's earnings release, we've also made some changes to our expected transaction activity for the year. Dispositions have now been reduced to $6.9 billion, down from $7.4 billion. This $500 million reduction is a result of 3 factors. First, about $150 million of the Non-Boston New England assets that are in various stages of the disposition process will not likely close this year, but will carry over into the first quarter of 2017. 
Second, the original disposition guidance included a $200 million portfolio of assets we decided to hold for the present time because we see continued upside in both operations and valuations there and think a sale at this time would be premature. And lastly, as noted in last night's release, we did not acquire any assets in the second quarter and have reduced our acquisition expectations for the year by $150 million. Since any incremental acquisitions will be funded by sales proceeds, we have reduced dispositions by a similar amount. 
During the second quarter, we did sell 3 noncore assets for $112.5 million and a 5.7% disposition yield and a 9.3% unleveraged IRR. In addition to selling these assets in Arizona, Massachusetts and Connecticut, last quarter, we also sold our entire interest in military housing at Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Tacoma, Washington, and realizing a gain of $52.4 million. 
Now we've been involved with Lewis-McChord since 2002, during which time we renovated over 2,200 homes and built more than 800 new homes for the men and women who called the Joint Base home while serving our country. We're very proud of our work at Lewis-McChord in the last 14 years, and it was really our honor and privilege to be involved there. 
With regard to our development business, we commenced construction in 1 small development project in the second quarter in Washington, D.C., where we're building 222 units for $88 million or $396,000 a unit and at an unexpected yield on cost at today's rents in the mid-5s. The deal was in the NoMa market and will be delivered in late 2018 and is expected to stabilize in late 2019. 
We're also currently working on 2 small projects totaling $90 million that could start construction yet this year with a weighted average cost at today's rents in the mid- to high 5s. 
During the second quarter, we also completed construction in our lease-up of 3 new development deals, all in the San Francisco market, 2 Downtown and 1 in North San Jose. These assets are leasing extremely well and are experiencing monthly absorption rates in excess of original expectations. 
From a pricing standpoint, like our same-store portfolio, we're not achieving the rents we had hoped at the beginning of the year while the rents we are achieving are well in excess of those underwritten at the time these sites were acquired and constructions commenced. And as a result, these assets will provide stabilized yields from the high 5s to high 7s, which are well in excess of our original expectations. 
I'll turn the call now over to Mark Parrell."

Today, I'll be giving some color behind our same-store expense guidance and the change to our normalized FFO guidance. I will then discuss how the change to our normalized FFO guidance impacted the remaining special dividend payment and",687,"Thank you, David. Today, I'll be giving some color behind our same-store expense guidance and the change to our normalized FFO guidance. I will then discuss how the change to our normalized FFO guidance impacted the remaining special dividend payment and our debt issuance guidance. In all these cases, I'm comparing the guidance numbers we gave you in late April 2016 as part of our first quarter earnings call to the revised guidance that we provided last night. As you might recall, the June 1st press release only revised our same-store revenue and NOI ranges. 
So moving on to the same-store expense side, we have left our annual same-store expense range at an increase of 2.5% to 3%, and this is not withstanding the fact that same-store expenses year-to-date have only grown by 0.9%. This implies that we expect second half same-store expenses to grow at a considerably higher rate of about 4.6%. As usual, our big 3 expense categories of real estate taxes, utilities and payroll will drive these numbers. We now expect property taxes to increase at a rate of about 6% versus our previous expectation in our year-to-date number of 5.5%. This increase is due to a recent adverse legal decision regarding the calculation of property taxes for several of our properties in New -- in Jersey City. We also previously forecast payroll growth of 2.5% to 3% and we still believe that forecast to be accurate. Year-to-date, payroll has only increased 0.3%, so we see most of the expected increase in payroll as back-end loaded. 
For the year, we expect utilities expense to decline by approximately 3%. Year-to-date, utilities expense is down 8.1%. Most of the expected growth in the second half on the utility side is due to our expectation of somewhat higher commodity prices later in this year as compared to the historically low commodity prices we had in the third and fourth quarters of 2015. 
So moving on to normalized FFO. The reduction in the same-store NOI from a midpoint back in April of 5.5% to a midpoint now of 4% causes a normalized FFO reduction of about $23 million or about $0.06 per share. Going the other way an increase in our normalized FFO estimate, we now expect an additional $4 million in NOI or about $0.01 per share to the positive due to the reduction in dispositions combined with these asset sales being pushed back further into the year. David Neithercut previously discussed the reasons for this reduction in our disposition activity. 
Our reduction in acquisition guidance from $600 million to $350 million and disposition guidance from $7.4 billion to $6.9 billion has only had a very modest impact on the amount of taxable gain that we will incur in 2016 and meet the special dividend. And this is because the specific assets that we removed from our disposition guidance, just specifically at relatively little tax gain and because we have already paid with the $8 per share March 2016 special dividend, the preponderance of the tax gain that we will incur in 2016. We, therefore, left our guidance for the annual special dividend in the range of $2 to $4 per share with the thought that the ultimate amount that we will pay is likely to be at or slightly lower than that midpoint. Our guidance assumes that this payment will be made in the fourth quarter of 2016. All dividend payments are subject still to the approval of our Board of Trustees. 
Moving on to the debt side. Because our net disposition activity is about $250 million lower than we expected back in April, our projected line balance at December 31, 2016, is anticipated to now be about $430 million versus the $130 million we previously estimated. For now, we have left our debt issuance guidance at about $225 million. But if our disposition process goes as expected, we may do a larger offering, and that's now included in our guidance, in either the secured or unsecured markets later in 2016. 
And I'll now turn the call back over to the operator for the question-and-answer period."

And look, many of us have been to your offices, we've seen all the reams of data, we've seen all the pricing systems that you have and you've now reduced guidance 3 times. So we're trying to figure out sort of what are the issues in terms of is your asset forecasting system not driving the right rates. And so, what, the input's not right or the output is not right? Is it an operations issue or is it an FP&A issue that's causing this? Because you can have 1 strike, 2 strikes, but doing it 3 times, one could imagine that there are other issues at play here than just the markets in terms of how the data's coming in relative to your expectations and ultimately what you put out to The Street. And like on the supply side, I don't think the 500-unit building sort of pops up overnight. That would be an input that you would know. So maybe either Neithercut, I don't know if you want to take that, but sort of give some color around some of the processes and procedures that are going on."

But at the end of the day, we all kind of wind up in the same place. I think a lot of the volatility has been very quick and at very inopportune times. One of the things that makes it very difficult to forecast is when we look at the precipitous drop in new lease rents in San Francisco. And look, we've had Boston, D.C., all of these other markets have delivered outsized supply, but have relatively strong occupancy. And as I said in my prepared remarks, we were prepared for rents to go down. When you look at the new lease-ups, if new lease-ups are giving 1 month free, basically, you can move into a brand-new building at 2015 rents. If a new lease-up is giving 2 months free, you can move into a brand-new building at 2014 rents. I think to some extent, we're a victim of our own success on the renewal side. When you look at San Francisco, 35% of our expirations are almost 5% above current Street rents. And with volatility ranging from plus 2% to as much as down 10% at certain properties in San Francisco, it really comes down to who moves out and at what property do they move out of. I mean, at -- with rents down 10%, a person could be 6% above current market rents, a 16% decline on a $4,000 a month rent times a couple hundred -- couple $300 each month for a couple months winds down your revenue stream pretty quickly. So I hope that gives you a little more granular explanation of why it is very difficult to predict the -- at the rate of decline that we can expect, especially in the peak season, where you have 15% of your leases expiring in June, July and August, each month. So extreme volatility with the highest number of transactions in the year with job growth really coming to a halt at the high end of the market is just making it very difficult to forecast forward. New York is kind of in the same boat, 45% of our expirations."

I think that some of the -- I mean, basically, I think we were overly optimistic about San Francisco and really just kind of mirrored -- at some point in time, judgment has to come into play. But what's different also about California is that California is a 30-day market. All of our other markets are 60-day markets. So you have a longer runway to see who's giving notice. You have longer runway to react to pricing and what have you. And so this was -- the San Francisco and the 30-day market with these dramatic changes within 30 days is just very hard to forecast and very hard to react as quickly to adjust."

I'd say the assets in these markets continue to trade at very low cap rates, Dave, with 3 handles. In some instances, even through a 3 handle. There continues to be perhaps not as much demand but certainly sufficient demand for these hard assets in these gateway cities that we've not seen any change in value at least at the present time. Now there may be because there might be fewer tours and potentially fewer buyers, maybe some bid ask, spreads widen in certain instances, but the transactions that we're seeing getting done in the markets in which we operate continue to support the valuations that we've been talking about. Just with respect to strategy, I think we've gone in with our eyes wide open that by operating in fewer markets, we're likely to have more volatility. But again, we think these are the markets that are going to create jobs and these are the markets where people are going to want to live, work and play, and they'll perform best over the long term. As David noted, we've had 10% compounded growth rate in San Francisco over the past 5 years. If it was flat job -- flat revenue growth over the next 5, over 10 years, it would still be 4.5%, which is very, very strong revenue growth. So we remain very committed to the markets we're in. We think that, again, these are the place where the economy going forward will thrive and that will see better overall risk-adjusted total returns in these markets. You've seen construction cost continue to go up in these markets. The replacement costs are going up. But I guess, I'd also say that in these markets, while there is elevated or more supply than we've seen in the past as a percentage of existing inventory, these aren't troubling amounts of new supply and in historical context, aren't unprecedented levels of new supplies. So it's more than we've seen. It's disrupting us somewhat, but as evidenced just by our lease-ups, particularly in San Francisco, which have gone extraordinarily well, demand is there and we couldn't be happier with the product that we're delivering and we'll outperform our original expectations and we think we're in right place for a long-term perspective."

So it was very easy to forecast just based on momentum. Certainly, when you get to August, the rate portion that drives revenue growth in the current year is baked. I mean, there's just not enough transactions remaining in the year to meaningfully impact the full year revenue. But what can meaningfully change your revenue September or October, November, December is certainly occupancy. And more importantly, concessions. Because as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, if we give a full month's concession, that's an 8% discount that we take a full charge on in that month. So if concessions, upfront concessions, really ramp up, which we are not a fan of, where we try to be a net effective rent shop, then that will seriously impact your revenue stream in that month and for the next couple of months."

The issue there is that we sort of started from a point that's higher than our midpoint. So when we talked back in February about our guidance, we put out a wider, you might recall, normalized FFO range than usual. We had a $0.20 range. We told you we had more variability in our numbers because we had all this disposition activity and we didn't know when it would occur. And obviously, the later it occurred, the higher FFO would be; and the earlier, the more we derisk the special dividend but we really didn't have all that much certainty. We also didn't know when we were paying the special, what debt we'd pay off. So there's just a lot of moving pieces. So when we put our range together and we spoke to you in February and we spoke to you in April, we saw in our range a way in which we could get modestly above the midpoint of our range and into the upper half of our old range if we sold our assets relatively slowly. And so we gave ourselves a little flexibility. As our operating conditions deteriorated, as we became more certain about what debt we were paying off, when we were going to pay the specials and what assets were going to be sold, that's what caused the whole thing to gravitate down. So the math is absolutely right. $0.06 down on same store, $0.01 up on transactions. But I'm starting from a higher point than the 3 10 you are."

But when you're giving us guidance, are you extrapolating the current trends like you had been in the guidance early in the year and unfortunately felt that volatility?

The good news is, is that a lot of those units are now in the suburbs. And I think on our last call, we said that we have this 12- to 18-month window where 2017 deliveries kind of moved back into the urban core, the seaport, what have you. So I mean, that's why we're seeing better revenue growth in Boston. Even though we delivered 5,000 units in '15 in the urban core, we were still able to hold occupancy at 96%, new lease rents were flat and we were still able to get renewal increases. And that's kind of the -- what we've experienced over the years is that even though these -- the markets that we're in today, you can still deliver product, hold the occupancy but feel the rate pressure. And then when the new deliveries move away from you, you start to get pricing power back. And I think that's -- I think we're just kind of in the middle or the beginning stages of getting to that point in San Francisco and New York. But again, it's kind of the mix of jobs and where the deliveries are. So you mentioned Seattle. I mean, Seattle is delivering -- I think they delivered 6,000, 5,000 units last year, significant deliveries in '14. The occupancy has continued to hold. We've continued to be able to push rents. We expected in Seattle that we would see pricing pressure in Belltown, Central Business District, Capitol Hill. But now we're seeing revenue actually accelerate in those markets as we begin to absorb. So it's just a combination of jobs, level of absorption and the relative location of the new supply."

Thanks for joining us. Clearly, 2016 did not turn out to be the year that we had originally expected due to deteriorating market conditions in San Francisco and New York City, which combined, made up 50% of our initial growth forecast for the year. 
As David Santee will address in greater detail in just a moment, at the time of our first quarter earnings call, nearly all indicators suggest that while the top end of our original expectation was off the table, another year of solid upper 4% growth in same-store revenue was most likely as strong demand continued to absorb new supply with little impact to existing inventory. 
The month of May, however, brought sudden and material changes to the fundamental picture, particularly in San Francisco, in a 50 basis point reduction to the company's expected revenue growth for the year. In the last 60 days, fundamentals have continued to weaken in these markets, causing us to yet again reduce our expectations for full-year revenue growth, which for the first time in many years, is now expected to have a 3 handle. And as a result, after 5 years of extraordinary strong fundamentals, revenue growth this year will now be more in line with historical trends. 
Like many of the participants on today's call, we too would prefer other growth of a 4 or even a 5 handle, but markets do reset from time to time, either due to new supply or changes in the demand side of the equation. Unfortunately, at the present time we're experiencing both factors in 2 of our most important markets. And the weakness we're experiencing in San Francisco and New York City is driving the reduction in our revenue growth expectations for the year. 
So with that said, I'll let David Santee go into more detail about what's occurred over the last 60 to 90 days, how it's impacted us during the primary leasing season and our expected results for the year."
28209,332083609,1014654,"Equity Residential, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2016",2016-07-27,"Earnings Calls","Equity Residential","Executives","Okay. Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone. This morning, I'll address our revised same-store revenue guidance and give you some color on overall operations.

This morning, I'll address our revised same-store revenue guidance and give you some color on overall operations. As Boston, D.C., Seattle and Southern California are all generally performing in line with our expectations, I'll focus my commentary on San Francisco and New York. We'll welcome any questions you have on our other markets in the Q&A. Today, Mark will address our same-store expenses in his remarks. 
As David said in his comments, we would not meet revenue expectations that we announced in June and that is due in large part to the continued volatility that we are seeing in San Francisco, and to a lesser extent, New York, as these markets work to absorb new supply. Together, these 2 markets accounted for approximately 50% of our expected revenue growth in 2016 and the deterioration in both markets is driving more volatility than we have experienced in our portfolio over the last half dozen years. Now that markets are less stable as a result of elevated supply and pressure on the highly compensated job sector, optimizing occupancy comes at a cost to rate growth. 
Now when we gave a revised guidance in June, San Francisco new lease rents had gone from being up 5% in Q1, down to flat in a matter of weeks. We assume that as a result of some of the irrational pricing we saw on new lease-ups that we would see rates deteriorate further into negative territory, but that we could still achieve similar occupancy as we move through peak leasing season. 
We felt comfortable about occupancy because in the last week of May, occupancy was 20 basis points higher than the same week last year and exposure was 20 basis points lower. We thought, certainly, if Seattle could absorb elevated supply with minimal disruption, San Fran could do the same. 
Our forecast for San Francisco new lease rents to go negative proved to be true very quickly as new lease rents are now negative 3% versus same week last year. Unfortunately, over the next 4 weeks, our occupancy assumptions for San Francisco missed the mark. And today, we sit at 95.8% occupied, 110 basis points lower than the same week last year. The deterioration of both metrics and the knowledge that new supply continues to be delivered through the rest of this year and heavily in the first half of next has led us to lower our full year growth expectation for San Francisco to be around 6.5%, down from our expected 7.75% in June and the original 9.5% growth we expected when we gave the original guidance in Q4 of last year. 
San Francisco accounted for about 1/3 of our same-store revenue growth in 2016. And so this decline, along with New York City, accounts for the 100 basis points off of the entire portfolio. In San Francisco, we had seen a sizable amount of new supply, over 8,000 units, being delivered in 2016 and it is all at the high end of the market. This supply has hit the market at the same time the job growth in the tech sector has hit the pause button. We still see good demand for units as evidenced by how well our newly completed developments are leasing up, but we are feeling the impact of our target demographic having more choices than before. 
In the second quarter, our lease-over-lease delta was up 2.1% and July was up 95 basis points, while renewals were up 8.6%. Occupancy was 96.2% and turnover, excluding same-property transfers, increased 30 basis points from same quarter last year. Through Q2, turnover excluding transfers is down 30 basis points with 25% to 24.7%. 
Looking forward, new lease rents are expected to remain in the minus 3% range for July and August. Our renewals achieved for July are 8% and currently 6.9% for August. Again, occupancy is 95.8%, but is on the expected seasonal upswing as students return to school. 
Now switching to New York. When we gave guidance in June, it was clear that New York was going to deteriorate further, and we are comfortable that we have forecasted the appropriate mix of rate and occupancy for the balance of the year. New York job growth expectations were at the time stable. While the economy there appears to be on solid footing and the overall job growth is at expected levels, the bulk of jobs added to date are mid-level compensation types jobs dominated by hospitality and leisure, followed by health care. Professional services, our demographic, typically the higher-paying jobs held by our target demographic, was a close third. 
The New York market continues to work to absorb approximately nearly 9,000 units this year. And with the great majority of that supply at the high-end, absorption has not been as robust as we would expect. As a result, it's possible that 2016 deliveries will carry over into 2017 lease-ups. We're already expecting a more elevated pipeline of new products scheduled for delivery in both '17 and '18. The concern in New York is that these elevated levels of supply, mainly private and fee managers, to elevate upfront move-in concessions beginning in the fourth quarter of 2016. 
Now on our shop, as we immediately take a cash charge in our same-store revenue of the full concession in the month of move-in, our revenue stream would be more impacted this year than if we amortize those concessions over the term of the lease. For an example, year-to-date, we would have reported a 4.5% if we had straight line concessions versus the 4.4% that we reported. As a result, sequential quarter-over-quarter and full-year revenue growth will be more impacted this year. Much of the new supply delivered in 2016 has been focused on the West Side, Jersey City and Brooklyn, all very competitive to our same-store portfolio in the market. 
2017 will see deliveries across a number of submarkets, especially Long Island City and Brooklyn, but the West Side will see continued deliveries as well. Our current expectation for full-year, same-store revenue growth for New York is now around 1.5%, which is down from the 2.25% growth expectation we had at the beginning of June and the 3.75% growth expectation we had to start the year. 
New York accounted for about 15% of our expected 2016 same-store revenue growth. In the second quarter, our lease-over-lease delta was minus 80 basis points, and July is minus 95 basis points. Renewal rates achieved were 4.3% for the quarter with July at 3.3%. Renewals achieved thus far for August and September are 3.4% and 2.8%, respectively. 
Turnover, excluding same store -- same property transfers, increased 100 basis points quarter-over-quarter to 10.1% and 100 basis points year-to-date to 17.4%. Today, occupancy is 96.2%, with new lease rates slightly negative. 
Now before I close, I want to assure you that no one is more disappointed about having to lower our guidance again more than the entire team here at EQR as well as myself. I can also say that each stop along the way, we work diligently to give you our best estimate at the time based on our collective experience. As David said, at the end of April, occupancy, exposure, turnover, renewal rents, new lease rents all indicated another good year in San Francisco. 
Unfortunately, as we continue to increase rents in May, the market decided to get conservative and we had to react accordingly. We are obviously experiencing extremely volatile markets, and this volatility is very difficult to predict. Perhaps, in hindsight, we were initially overoptimistic on San Francisco, given the levels of new supply brought online this year, but based on our dashboards at the end of April and later in early June, we would never have predicted the fall-off in new lease rent and occupancy that we experienced today.

This $500 million reduction is a",519,"Okay. Thank you, David. As noted in last night's earnings release, we've also made some changes to our expected transaction activity for the year. Dispositions have now been reduced to $6.9 billion, down from $7.4 billion. This $500 million reduction is a result of 3 factors. First, about $150 million of the Non-Boston New England assets that are in various stages of the disposition process will not likely close this year, but will carry over into the first quarter of 2017. 
Second, the original disposition guidance included a $200 million portfolio of assets we decided to hold for the present time because we see continued upside in both operations and valuations there and think a sale at this time would be premature. And lastly, as noted in last night's release, we did not acquire any assets in the second quarter and have reduced our acquisition expectations for the year by $150 million. Since any incremental acquisitions will be funded by sales proceeds, we have reduced dispositions by a similar amount. 
During the second quarter, we did sell 3 noncore assets for $112.5 million and a 5.7% disposition yield and a 9.3% unleveraged IRR. In addition to selling these assets in Arizona, Massachusetts and Connecticut, last quarter, we also sold our entire interest in military housing at Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Tacoma, Washington, and realizing a gain of $52.4 million. 
Now we've been involved with Lewis-McChord since 2002, during which time we renovated over 2,200 homes and built more than 800 new homes for the men and women who called the Joint Base home while serving our country. We're very proud of our work at Lewis-McChord in the last 14 years, and it was really our honor and privilege to be involved there. 
With regard to our development business, we commenced construction in 1 small development project in the second quarter in Washington, D.C., where we're building 222 units for $88 million or $396,000 a unit and at an unexpected yield on cost at today's rents in the mid-5s. The deal was in the NoMa market and will be delivered in late 2018 and is expected to stabilize in late 2019. 
We're also currently working on 2 small projects totaling $90 million that could start construction yet this year with a weighted average cost at today's rents in the mid- to high 5s. 
During the second quarter, we also completed construction in our lease-up of 3 new development deals, all in the San Francisco market, 2 Downtown and 1 in North San Jose. These assets are leasing extremely well and are experiencing monthly absorption rates in excess of original expectations. 
From a pricing standpoint, like our same-store portfolio, we're not achieving the rents we had hoped at the beginning of the year while the rents we are achieving are well in excess of those underwritten at the time these sites were acquired and constructions commenced. And as a result, these assets will provide stabilized yields from the high 5s to high 7s, which are well in excess of our original expectations. 
I'll turn the call now over to Mark Parrell."

Today, I'll be giving some color behind our same-store expense guidance and the change to our normalized FFO guidance. I will then discuss how the change to our normalized FFO guidance impacted the remaining special dividend payment and",686,"Thank you, David. Today, I'll be giving some color behind our same-store expense guidance and the change to our normalized FFO guidance. I will then discuss how the change to our normalized FFO guidance impacted the remaining special dividend payment and our debt issuance guidance. In all these cases, I'm comparing the guidance numbers we gave you in late April 2016 as part of our first quarter earnings call to the revised guidance that we provided last night. As you might recall, the June 1st press release only revised our same-store revenue and NOI ranges. 
So moving on to the same-store expense side, we have left our annual same-store expense range at an increase of 2.5% to 3%, and this is notwithstanding the fact that same-store expenses year-to-date have only grown by 0.9%. This implies that we expect second half same-store expenses to grow at a considerably higher rate of about 4.6%. As usual, our big 3 expense categories of real estate taxes, utilities and payroll will drive these numbers. We now expect property taxes to increase at a rate of about 6% versus our previous expectation in our year-to-date number of 5.5%. This increase is due to a recent adverse legal decision regarding the calculation of property taxes for several of our properties in New -- in Jersey City. We also previously forecast payroll growth of 2.5% to 3% and we still believe that forecast to be accurate. Year-to-date, payroll has only increased 0.3%, so we see most of the expected increase in payroll as back-end loaded. 
For the year, we expect utilities expense to decline by approximately 3%. Year-to-date, utilities expense is down 8.1%. Most of the expected growth in the second half on the utility side is due to our expectation of somewhat higher commodity prices later in this year as compared to the historically low commodity prices we had in the third and fourth quarters of 2015. 
So moving on to normalized FFO. The reduction in the same-store NOI from a midpoint back in April of 5.5% to a midpoint now of 4% causes a normalized FFO reduction of about $23 million or about $0.06 per share. Going the other way an increase in our normalized FFO estimate, we now expect an additional $4 million in NOI or about $0.01 per share to the positive due to the reduction in dispositions combined with these asset sales being pushed back further into the year. David Neithercut previously discussed the reasons for this reduction in our disposition activity. 
Our reduction in acquisition guidance from $600 million to $350 million and disposition guidance from $7.4 billion to $6.9 billion has only had a very modest impact on the amount of taxable gain that we will incur in 2016 and meet the special dividend. And this is because the specific assets that we removed from our disposition guidance, just specifically at relatively little tax gain and because we have already paid with the $8 per share March 2016 special dividend, the preponderance of the tax gain that we will incur in 2016. We, therefore, left our guidance for the annual special dividend in the range of $2 to $4 per share with the thought that the ultimate amount that we will pay is likely to be at or slightly lower than that midpoint. Our guidance assumes that this payment will be made in the fourth quarter of 2016. All dividend payments are subject still to the approval of our Board of Trustees. 
Moving on to the debt side. Because our net disposition activity is about $250 million lower than we expected back in April, our projected line balance at December 31, 2016, is anticipated to now be about $430 million versus the $130 million we previously estimated. For now, we have left our debt issuance guidance at about $225 million. But if our disposition process goes as expected, we may do a larger offering, and that's now included in our guidance, in either the secured or unsecured markets later in 2016. 
And I'll now turn the call back over to the operator for the question-and-answer period."

So we're trying to figure out sort of what are the issues in terms of is your asset forecasting system not driving the right rates. And so, what, the input's not right or the output is not right? Is it an operations issue or is it an FP&A issue that's causing this? Because you can have 1 strike, 2 strikes, but doing it 3 times, one could imagine that there are other issues at play here than just the markets in terms of how the data's coming in relative to your expectations and ultimately what you put out to The Street.

But at the end of the day, we all kind of wind up in the same place. I think a lot of the volatility has been very quick and at very inopportune times. One of the things that makes it very difficult to forecast is when we look at the precipitous drop in new lease rents in San Francisco. And look, we've had Boston, D.C., all of these other markets have delivered outsized supply, but have relatively strong occupancy. And as I said in my prepared remarks, we were prepared for rents to go down. When you look at the new lease-ups, if new lease-ups are giving 1 month free, basically, you can move into a brand-new building at 2015 rents. If a new lease-up is giving 2 months free, you can move into a brand-new building at 2014 rents. I think to some extent, we're a victim of our own success on the renewal side. When you look at San Francisco, 35% of our expirations are almost 5% above current Street rents. And with volatility ranging from plus 2% to as much as down 10% at certain properties in San Francisco, it really comes down to who moves out and at what property do they move out of. I mean, at -- with rents down 10%, a person could be 6% above current market rents, a 16% decline on a $4,000 a month rent times a couple hundred -- couple $300 each month for a couple months winds down your revenue stream pretty quickly. So I hope that gives you a little more granular explanation of why it is very difficult to predict the -- at the rate of decline that we can expect, especially in the peak season, where you have 15% of your leases expiring in June, July and August, each month. So extreme volatility with the highest number of transactions in the year with job growth really coming to a halt at the high end of the market is just making it very difficult to forecast forward. New York is kind of in the same boat, 45% of our expirations."

I think that some of the -- I mean, basically, I think we were overly optimistic about San Francisco and really just kind of mirrored -- at some point in time, judgment has to come into play. But what's different also about California is that California is a 30-day market. All of our other markets are 60-day markets. So you have a longer runway to see who's giving notice.

I'd say the assets in these markets continue to trade at very low cap rates, Dave, with 3 handles. In some instances, even through a 3 handle. There continues to be perhaps not as much demand but certainly sufficient demand for these hard assets in these gateway cities that we've not seen any change in value at least at the present time. Now there may be because there might be fewer tours and potentially fewer buyers, maybe some bid ask, spreads widen in certain instances, but the transactions that we're seeing getting done in the markets in which we operate continue to support the valuations that we've been talking about. Just with respect to strategy, I think we've gone in with our eyes wide open that by operating in fewer markets, we're likely to have more volatility. But again, we think these are the markets that are going to create jobs and these are the markets where people are going to want to live, work and play, and they'll perform best over the long term. As David noted, we've had 10% compounded growth rate in San Francisco over the past 5 years. If it was flat job -- flat revenue growth over the next 5, over 10 years, it would still be 4.5%, which is very, very strong revenue growth. So we remain very committed to the markets we're in. We think that, again, these are the place where the economy going forward will thrive and that will see better overall risk-adjusted total returns in these markets. You've seen construction cost continue to go up in these markets. The replacement costs are going up. But I guess, I'd also say that in these markets, while there is elevated or more supply than we've seen in the past as a percentage of existing inventory, these aren't troubling amounts of new supply and in historical context, aren't unprecedented levels of new supplies. So it's more than we've seen. It's disrupting us somewhat, but as evidenced just by our lease-ups, particularly in San Francisco, which have gone extraordinarily well, demand is there and we couldn't be happier with the product that we're delivering and we'll outperform our original expectations and we think we're in right place for a long-term perspective."

I mean, there's just not enough transactions remaining in the year to meaningfully impact the full year revenue. But what can meaningfully change your revenue September or October, November, December is certainly occupancy. And more importantly, concessions. Because as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, if we give a full month's concession, that's an 8% discount that we take a full charge on in that month.

The issue there is that we sort of started from a point that's higher than our midpoint. So when we talked back in February about our guidance, we put out a wider, you might recall, normalized FFO range than usual. We had a $0.20 range. We told you we had more variability in our numbers because we had all this disposition activity and we didn't know when it would occur. And obviously, the later it occurred, the higher FFO would be; and the earlier, the more we derisk the special dividend but we really didn't have all that much certainty. We also didn't know when we were paying the special, what debt we'd pay off. So there's just a lot of moving pieces. So when we put our range together and we spoke to you in February and we spoke to you in April, we saw in our range a way in which we could get modestly above the midpoint of our range and into the upper half of our old range if we sold our assets relatively slowly. And so we gave ourselves a little flexibility. As our operating conditions deteriorated, as we became more certain about what debt we were paying off, when we were going to pay the specials and what assets were going to be sold, that's what caused the whole thing to gravitate down. So the math is absolutely right. $0.06 down on same store, $0.01 up on transactions. But I'm starting from a higher point than the 3 10 you are."

But when you're giving us guidance, are you extrapolating the current trends like you had been in the guidance early in the year and unfortunately felt that volatility?

The good news is, is that a lot of those units are now in the suburbs. And I think on our last call, we said that we have this 12- to 18-month window where 2017 deliveries kind of moved back into the urban core, the seaport, what have you. So I mean, that's why we're seeing better revenue growth in Boston. Even though we delivered 5,000 units in '15 in the urban core, we were still able to hold occupancy at 96%, new lease rents were flat and we were still able to get renewal increases. And that's kind of the -- what we've experienced over the years is that even though these -- the markets that we're in today, you can still deliver product, hold the occupancy but feel the rate pressure. And then when the new deliveries move away from you, you start to get pricing power back. And I think that's -- I think we're just kind of in the middle or the beginning stages of getting to that point in San Francisco and New York. But again, it's kind of the mix of jobs and where the deliveries are. So you mentioned Seattle. I mean, Seattle is delivering -- I think they delivered 6,000, 5,000 units last year, significant deliveries in '14. The occupancy has continued to hold. We've continued to be able to push rents. We expected in Seattle that we would see pricing pressure in Belltown, Central Business District, Capitol Hill. But now we're seeing revenue actually accelerate in those markets as we begin to absorb. So it's just a combination of jobs, level of absorption and the relative location of the new supply."

Thank you for joining us for this morning's call. As we discussed over the last several quarters, 2016 will not turn out to be the year we had originally expected due to elevated levels of new supply in both San Fran",324,"Thanks, Marty. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for this morning's call. As we discussed over the last several quarters, 2016 will not turn out to be the year we had originally expected due to elevated levels of new supply in both San Francisco and New York City, which combined, made up a large share of our initial growth forecast for the year. And as a result, after 5 years of extraordinary strong fundamentals, revenue growth this year will now be more in line with long-term historical trends. 
Good news, however, is that exceptionally strong demand continues unabated across our markets. With current occupancies remaining at or near 96% and lower exposure on the horizon. Turnover across all markets when excluding same property movement is actually decreased for the first 9 months of the year compared to the same period last year. Move-outs from the single-family homes remained a nonfactor in our high cost of housing markets and our recently completed development properties are absorbing unit significantly faster in the rates above or close to our original expectations. Furthermore, while our markets have experienced a slowdown in the growth of high income jobs, the absolute number of new high income jobs remain relatively strong and our preliminary indication that the trend may be reversing. Perhaps more importantly, for the first time since recovery began, there are abundant signs of wage growth occurring in all industries across the country, which obviously is a very good sign for the apartment business. 
So as we look forward to what we see as peak delivery next year, our teams across the country will work very hard in carrying for our existing residents, welcoming prospects and turning them into new residents and we remain extraordinarily excited about the outlook for our business, portfolio and the company. 
So with that said, we will let David Santee go into more detail about what we're seeing across our markets today."
28209,378013080,1061661,"Equity Residential, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2016",2016-10-26,"Earnings Calls","Equity Residential","Executives","Okay. Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone. Today, I'll update you on our Q3 results, discuss the current state of each market in which we operate as well as providing additional color on 2017 deliveries. As David said, demand for quality apartments",2129,"Okay. Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone. Today, I'll update you on our Q3 results, discuss the current state of each market in which we operate as well as providing additional color on 2017 deliveries. 
As David said, demand for quality apartments remain very robust, with occupancies in our markets averaging 96 or better and resident turnover continuing to decline. The year-to-date turnover net of same-property transfers decreased 30 basis points versus the 10 basis point increase in the gross turnover that we reported, demonstrating the strong customer satisfaction that our employees strive to deliver each and every day and the great locations our portfolio continues to enjoy. 
Renewal rates achieved for the quarter continued to be well above historical averages at 5.3%, while new leads over lease pricing was plus 90 basis points. Combined results were in line with our revised expectations at 3.1%. 
Moving on to the markets. In Seattle, new lease over lease growth averaged 4.9% for the quarter, while renewals achieved were 8.1%. Seattle continues to distinguish itself as the epicenter of cloud computing services as Amazon remains the catalyst for the rapid downtown expansion of both jobs and new apartment deliveries. Through August, Seattle, Bellevue and Redmond realized job growth of 3.5% that allows the 7,200 new apartment deliveries this year to be easily absorbed with virtually 0 pricing pressure. 
Now with 7,000 deliveries expected in '17 [indiscernible] above the national average, we see Seattle as our best revenue growth market next year. Again, using Amazon job openings as a proxy for demand, lastly, there were 8,000 openings in Seattle, almost double from same time last year, 3,300 of which are for high-paying software developer positions. This concentration of intellectual capital is also forcing the large well-established tech companies to expand their presence in Seattle to better compete for talent. 
Microsoft, the region's second-largest employer recently committed to a significant investment in a new artificial intelligence group and most recently announced record operating results. With cloud computing in early beginnings, in the areas of largest employer having a 7-year backlog in the airplane production, Seattle's poised for continued growth as well as the lowest of all the markets in which we operate, likely delivering strong revenue results that is slightly lower next year. 
In San Francisco, while operations were quite volatile during the summer peak leasing season, where recently the market is been more stable across the key drivers to get growth. Occupancies improved to 96% versus the low 95% that we saw only a few months ago. The percent of residents renewing are at peak levels and contrary to some reports of rents being down double digits, our San Francisco portfolio's average asking rents are down only 1.4% versus same week last year. 
Growth in higher-paying tech jobs is not as robust as 2015, but the growth is nonetheless positive. And while these capital investment has slowed, the actual amount of DC funds available for investment have increased. All the fundamentals are still in place for the markets in 2017 deliveries. However, elevated supply and the slower pace of BC investment that drives the tech sector will continue to have a negative impact on pricing power in submarkets that see the most deliveries. 
Achieved renewal rates for the quarter in San Francisco were 6.2% and the new lease over lease rate averaged minus 30 basis points. The modest increase in turnover is more than accounted for by same-property transfers. Netting these out, year-to-date turnover has actually declined 70 basis points on top of the improvement we saw last year. 
2017 will see the market deliver 8,400 new apartments, with deliveries that are less concentrated than in 2016. In the downtown area, some will see 50% fewer units delivered with the balance across Mission Bay and the Dogpatch areas. The [indiscernible] will also be more dispersed with only 1,600 units spread across all directions in San Mateo and Redwood City. San Jose and Santa Clara will see the majority of deliveries in South Bay and will be less geographically competitive with our same-store portfolio. 
Based on current delivery estimates, the 2017 supply appears to be more front loaded in the year which means most of the supply will begin leasing up in periods of peak demand. San Francisco remains Ground Zero for innovation and textile works [indiscernible] to expand their footprint. As Artificial Intelligence and the Internet of Things continues to grow legs, we would expect San Francisco to continue to lead the world in tech and overcome any short-term challenges with supply. 
Time and time again, San Francisco has proven to come back faster and stronger and peaks in the past, but we would expect San Fran to deliver revenue growth in 2017 that is much lower in 2016. 
Going out to L.A. Job growth continues to be very strong, but is dominated more by lower paying hospitality and leisure sector. However, as San Fran really focus on its Renaissance efforts and Silicon Beach continues to develop and build out the higher-paying professional services sector is expected to lead job growth through 2020. As nontraditional entertainment content continues to grow, Southern California is poised to capture this additional investment as well. 
Demand for apartments continues to be strong, with occupancy across our L.A. portfolio at 96.3%. Renewal rates achieved for the quarter were 6.8% and new lease over lease growth was 2.5% or lower turnover for the quarter. But based on current estimates, L.A. will see peak deliveries of 10,000 units through 2017, with over 80% of these units spread across 3 submarkets. Downtown Hollywood will represent 50% of the 80%, Glendale, Pasadena 20% of the 80% and then Koreatown [indiscernible] at 14% of the 80%. 
To date, deliveries in the urban poor and West L.A. have had modest impact on revenue growth, which today is in the 3% to 5% range. As L.A. continues to add supply in the urban poor, Downtown continues to be a more attractive lifestyle that has been nonexistent for many years. Where virtually no units being delivered this year or next, the East and West San Fernando Valley, Ventura County and Inland Empire continue to show signs of accelerated revenue growth upwards of 6% to 7% for the current month billings. 
For 2017, we would expect Greater L.A. County to deliver modest lower revenue growth pressured by the level of new supply in the urban poor. 
Orange County at 96% occupancy today achieved renewals for the quarter of 7.6%, and that was the strongest across our portfolio and new lease-over-lease growth of 4.4%. After taking a breather from elevated deliveries in 2015 and, for the most part, 2016, Orange County is expected to deliver 5,700 units in 2017 with about 50% concentration in Irvine submarket and the balance of spread from Anaheim up to Huntington Beach. With almost 65% of our portfolio in South Orange County, we would expect slightly lower revenue growth as a result of the concentration of deliveries in Irvine where we have 35% of our residents. 
San Diego, with extremely strong job growth in the first half of the year, has seen strong demand for apartments with very little supply. San Diego is the state which itself is a life science medical device, tech manufacturing center and continues to have high paying jobs in the sectors, albeit at a slower rate. Second, only the Orange County achieved the renewal rate growth for the quarter averaged 7.4% with new lease-over-lease growth of 4.4%. Again, on lower turnover. 
San Diego has delivered 2,300 units in 2017, which appeared to be dispersed equally between Downtown and the I-50 corridor [ph] on lower expected job growth. The I-15 submarket has already shown modest deceleration and we would expect revenue results in '17 to be somewhat lower next year. 
Okay, jumping over to Boston. As we previously said, 2016 will be a window of opportunity in the urban poor and especially Cambridge where deliveries were few. To date, that is laid out where we have seen modest acceleration in revenue growth with more pressure on rents in the suburbs than downtown. New lease-over-lease growth of 1.6% for Q3 was the strongest quarter since Q3 of '15. Achieved renewal rate growth was 4.9%, and again, on lower turnover. As Boston continues to position itself as a major tech, biotech hub, and an endorsement with [indiscernible] headquarter relocation, the future Boston and professional services job growth is very bright as professional services sector move from 35% of jobs created to 45% of new jobs created this year. 
In the near term, Boston is expected to deliver approximately 6,200 units in 2017, split evenly between Downtown Cambridge and then North and West Suburbs. Given the concentrations of the new supply to our portfolio, we see continued deceleration across the market and expect revenue growth to be lower than 2016. 
New York, for the quarter, achieved an average renewal rates of 3% and minus 2% on new lease-over-lease growth. Again, on slightly lower turnover. With a trend toward affordability over neighborhood loyalty, prospective renters are proving to be more flexible where they choose to live. To date, 55% of the 2016 deliveries have been absorbed. Confessions have yet to become widespread and appear to be more targeted to specific unit types as stable communities. The Upper West Side and West Side down the Chelsea are currently the weakest neighborhoods in our portfolio and are delivering slightly negative revenue growth for the current month. 
The New York MSA will see 14,000 units in '17, and to clarify, these are units that are identified very conservatively to be within the competitive boundaries defined by our portfolio. They will not match the higher MSA numbers provided by third-party data shops. It should not be no surprise that Brooklyn will deliver the lion share of new units where we have less than 8% of total New York metro revenue, followed by Long Island City where we have no presence. Midtown West will deliver a good portion as Hudson Yard comes online and then the Hudson Waterfront, specifically Jersey City. These 4 submarkets will account for a little more than 70% of all deliveries, with a balance spread across various Manhattan neighborhoods. 
While there have been lingering pressures on the financial services sector, high-paying tech jobs and venture capital continue to migrate to the area. Some believe that Brexit could bring back additional financial services jobs and that would be a good thing. While supply pressures are driven largely by the expiration of the 421-a program, the lack of any existing replacement legislation will create a scenario in the near future of significantly reduced supply. With expectations of more affordability in any future legislation and increasing consumption cost, it's hard to imagine deliveries that come close to historical norms. 
Given all these factors and the deceleration we see today, we see New York as our worst-performing market with a high probability of revenue growth turning negative during the year. 
Last but not least, the D.C. The metro area continue to improve, coming off of with its best job boost in2000, 8 out of our 10 submarkets were currently delivering accelerated revenue growth where our current month growth exceeds year-to-date growth anywhere from 100 to 300 basis points. For the quarter, renewal rates achieved were 4.6%, the strongest in the last 7 quarters and new lease-over-lease growth was plus 20 basis points. Again, the strongest in 7 quarters with flat occupancy and turnover. 
With expectations of future job growth being very favorable and over half of the 10,000 units being delivered concentrated in the Southeast and Southwest submarkets, we would expect continued favorable absorption and accelerating revenue growth in the submarkets in which we operate. Like L.A. living in downtown D.C. 2 years ago, was not a consideration for most. As more of come online, more restaurants and activities are creating an urban environment that did not exist previously, bringing in suburban renters to find downtown a more attractive and active lifestyle, given the traffic congestion and commuting cost that currently exist in the region. We expect the acceleration of revenue growth that we see today to continue into next year. 
In closing, 2017 revenue growth will certainly be lower than 2016. Job growth and job sectors will dictate the ability of each market to absorb these levels of elevated supply. The degree of management sophistication and discipline will determine how we price it and the overall impact to revenue growth. With occupancy still in the 96% range, demand remains strong, but elevated supplies that are not supported by the necessary job growth will face varying degrees of pricing pressure in the near term. 
And so with that said, I will turn it over to Mark Parrell. Mark?"

Therefore, as we mentioned on the second quarter call, we've always expected our second half expenses to grow at a considerably higher rate, somewhere in the mid-4% range in order to meet our July guidance range of 2.5% to 3%. 
In a moment, I'll give some detail on payroll expense and on leasing and advertising expense, which were the 2 main drivers of our change in expense guidance. But first, I want to mention one of the bigger drivers of our overall same-store expense growth this year and as for recent adverse legal decision regarding the calculation of property taxes for several of our properties in Jersey City that I noted in our second quarter call. The same-store impact to this decision was an increase in 2016 annual real estate tax expense of $1.6 million. We were aware of this in maintaining our same-store expense range of 2.5% to 3% back in July, but still thought that we could stay within that range. 
So overall, for 2016, we expect property tax expense to grow by 6%. So getting back to the change in the same-store expense guidance. On the payroll side, cost in the third quarter were about $1 million more than we had originally planned because we run our properties in the third quarter at higher employment levels to keep our properties competitive in some of these challenging markets. We also made aggressive efforts to retain our field personnel in the face of the great demand for them in our markets as new supply is delivered in needs to be staffed out. 
In the leasing and advertising line, we incurred promotional expenses at the high end of our expectations, mostly in New York and San Francisco in response to a higher supply in this markets. This heightened spending of about $1 million included about $670,000 in gift cards given to new residents and payment of broker commissions on a few high-rent units. We did anticipate some gift card usage in the third quarter, but the order of magnitude was higher than we expected back in July. We also spent a bit more on Internet listing services in the quarter. Please do remember that we had higher occupancy in 2015 and we're able to review such spending in the comparable quarter. We expect additional promotional spending to continue in the fourth quarter though at a lesser pace. 
So this is accounting note. Those rules, the accounting rules, requires that we account for gift card spending as an expense. However, if we had accounted for the cards as a reduction in revenue, the impact of the company's results would have been a reduction in quarterly same-store revenue of 12 basis points, which would have reduced our reported 3.4% quarterly same-store revenue growth number to 3.3%. The impact on our full-year same-store revenue as a result of the gift cards we gave in the third quarter, the ones I just discussed and that we expected given the fourth quarter, will be even less, about 5 basis points, if they were to be treated as a contrary to revenue. 
So now I'm going to switch over and talk about moving concessions on our same-store portfolio and those we do treat as a reductions in revenue. So again, on the same-store portfolio, in the third quarter, we gave approximately $190,000 versus concessions versus the $235,000 in moving concessions we gave in the third quarter of 2015. In terms of the sensitivity of our revised guidance range or expense range, leasing and advertising in payroll are the 2 likely pressure points that can move our annual expenses to the higher end of our new range of 2.8% to 3.2%. On the leasing and advertising side, we expect less gift card spending for the rest of the year because at the lower turnover we expect in the fourth quarter and our strong current occupancy. We are incorrect in these assumptions, our expense growth could be pressured. 
Another possible pressure point is that payroll cost continue to escalate due to wage pressure or service levels required by heightened competition in our markets. On the revenue side, we have left our midpoint of 3.75% unchanged and David Santee has already provided you a bit of color on that. 
We just fine-tuned a few other guidance number, so I'll just talk about that for a minute. We continue to see normalized FFO is remaining within our prior range, so we narrow that range as we customarily do at this time of the year. Our current annual normalized FFO midpoint of $3.08 per share is yearly identical to the $3.10 per share midpoint of the range we originally gave you back in February as reductions in same-store NOI were offset by changes in transaction timing and amounts. 
Now just a note on our debt deal on October 12. We closed on a $500 million 10-year unsecured note offering with a coupon of 2.85% and an all-in effective rate of approximately 3.1%, which includes underwriters fees and the termination of a small interest rate hedge we had. There was great demand for this step and we the lowest tenure in our history and one of the lowest ever by a REIT and we thank our unsecured bond investors for their support of the company. Proceeds from this issuance will be used for working capital and general corporate purposes. Our projected combined line of credit and commercial paper amounts outstanding for those 2 combined at December 31, 2016, is now anticipated to be $130 million versus the $430 million we previously estimated back in July. That's due to proceeds on the $500 million debt deal, reducing line usage and is offset by a net $100 million reduction in disposition proceeds that we now expect in 2016. 
So I'll now turn the call over to Cynthia for the question-and-answer period."

We've got a significant amount of gain into a most of our assets and there's not a lot of capacity after doing things on a debt-neutral basis and distributing dealings with the gain to actually buy much back with the proceeds and then with respect to borrowing to buy stock back, these are relatively few bites of the apple and we want to make sure that if and when we do, there will be appropriate time and we'll continue to monitor this as we do on a regular and consistent basis with the board and if it makes sense to do something down the road, we'll certainly would be willing to do that.

Historically, the state or the city would find the building owner if any transient rentals were discovered and transient rentals mean anything less than 30 days. On the other hand, they do allow sharing as long as the owner is in occupancy. So I'm not really sure how that gets and I would say to what extent it affects Airbnb, I'm not sure. But we do have a pilot, 1 property. We continue to learn, we continue to understand how to build out this platform to really, for the purpose of transparency and control. This is not -- this would not be a huge moneymaker for any particular owner or any particular property.

Thank you for joining us for this morning's call. As we discussed over the last several quarters, 2016 will not turn out to be the year we had originally expected due to elevated levels of new supply in both San Fran",321,"Thanks, Marty. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for this morning's call. As we discussed over the last several quarters, 2016 will not turn out to be the year we had originally expected due to elevated levels of new supply in both San Francisco and New York City, which combined, made up a large share of our initial growth forecast for the year. And as a result, after 5 years of extraordinarily strong fundamentals, revenue growth this year will now be more in line with long-term historical trends. 
Good news, however, is that exceptionally strong demand continues unabated across our markets, with current occupancies remaining at or near 96% and lower exposure on the horizon. Turnover across all markets, when excluding same-property movement, has actually decreased for the first 9 months of the year compared to the same period last year. Move-outs by single-family homes remain a nonfactor in our high cost of housing markets. And our recently completed development properties are absorbing units significantly faster and at rates above or close to our original expectations. Furthermore, while our markets have experienced a slowdown in the growth of high-income jobs, the absolute number of new high-income jobs remains relatively strong, and there are preliminary indications that the trend may be reversing. Perhaps more importantly, for the first time since recovery began, there are abundant signs of wage growth occurring in all industries across the country, which obviously is a very good sign for the apartment business. 
So as we look forward to what we see as peak deliveries next year, our teams across the country will work very hard in caring for our existing residents, welcoming prospects and turning them into new residents. And we remain extraordinarily excited about the outlook for our business, portfolio and the company. 
So with that said, we will let David Santee go into more detail about what we're seeing across our markets today."
28209,378013080,1062001,"Equity Residential, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2016",2016-10-26,"Earnings Calls","Equity Residential","Executives","Okay. Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone. Today, I'll update you on our Q3 results, discuss the current state of each market in which we operate as well as providing additional color on 2017 deliveries.

Today, I'll update you on our Q3 results, discuss the current state of each market in which we operate as well as providing additional color on 2017 deliveries. 
And as David said, demand for quality apartments remained very robust, with occupancies in our markets averaging 96% or better, and resident turnover continuing to decline. Year-to-date turnover net of same-property transfers decreased 30 basis points versus the 10 basis point increase in the gross turnover that we reported, demonstrating the strong customer satisfaction that our employees strive to deliver each and every day, and the great locations our portfolio continues to enjoy. 
Renewal rates achieved for the quarter continued to be well above historical averages at 5.3%, while new lease-over-lease pricing was plus 90 basis points. Combined results were in line with our revised expectations at 3.1%. 
Moving on to the markets. In Seattle, new lease-over-lease growth averaged 4.9% for the quarter, while renewals achieved were 8.1%. Seattle continues to distinguish itself as the epicenter of cloud computing services as Amazon remains the catalyst for the rapid downtown expansion of both jobs and new apartment deliveries. Through August, Seattle, Bellevue and Redmond realized job growth of 3.15% [ph] that allowed for 7,200 new apartment deliveries this year to be easily absorbed with virtually 0 pricing pressure. Now with 7,000 new deliveries expected in '17 and job growth well above the national average, we see Seattle as our best revenue growth market next year. 
Again, using job -- Amazon job openings as a proxy for demand, lastly, there were 8,000 openings in Seattle, almost double from the same time last year, 3,300 of which are for high-paying software developer positions. This concentration of intellectual capital is also forcing the large well-established tech companies to expand their presence in Seattle to better compete for talent. 
Microsoft, the region's second-largest employer recently committed to a significant investment in a new artificial intelligence group and most recently announced record operating results. With cloud computing in early innings, and Boeing, the area's largest employer having a 7-year backlog in airplane production, Seattle is poised for continued growth as rents are the lowest of all the markets in which we operate, likely delivering strong revenue results that are slightly lower next year. 
Down to San Francisco, while operations were quite volatile during the summer peak leasing season, more recently the market has been more stable across the key drivers of revenue growth. Occupancy has improved to 96% versus the low 95% that we saw only a few months ago. The percent of residents renewing are at peak levels. And contrary to some reports of rents being down double digits, our San Francisco portfolio average asking rents are down only 1.4% versus same week last year. 
Growth in higher-paying tech jobs is not as robust as 2015, but the growth is, nonetheless, positive. And while D.C. capital investment has slowed, the actual amount of D.C. funds available for investment have increased. All the fundamentals are still in place for the market to absorb 2017 deliveries. However, elevated supply and a slower pace of D.C. investment that drives the tech sector will continue to have a negative impact on pricing power in submarkets that see the most deliveries. 
Achieved renewal rates for the quarter in San Francisco were 6.2% and the new lease-over-lease rate averaged minus 30 basis points. The modest increase in turnover is more than accounted for by same-property transfers. Netting these out, year-to-date turnover has actually declined 70 basis points on top of the improvement we saw last year. 
2017 will see the market deliver 8,400 new apartments, with deliveries that are less concentrated than in 2016. In the downtown area, summer will see 50% fewer units delivered, with the balance spread across Mission Bay and the Dogpatch areas. The mid-Peninsula will also be more dispersed, with only 1,600 units spread across all directions in San Mateo and Redwood City. San Jose and Santa Clara will see the majority of deliveries in South Bay and will be less geographically competitive with our same-store portfolio. 
Based on current delivery estimates, the 2017 supply appears to be more front loaded in the year, which means most of the supply will begin leasing up in periods of peak demand. San Francisco remains ground zero for innovation, and tech stalwarts continue to expand their footprint. As artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things continues to grow legs, we would expect San Francisco to continue to lead the world in tech and overcome any short-term challenges with supply. Time and time again, San Francisco has proven to come back faster and stronger than peaks of the past, but we would expect San Fran to deliver revenue growth in 2017 that is much lower than 2016. 
Dropping down to L.A., job growth continues to be very strong, but is dominated more by lower-paying hospitality and leisure sector. However, as downtown L.A. focuses on its Renaissance efforts, and Silicon Beach continues to develop and build out, the higher-paying professional services sector is expected to lead job growth through 2020. As nontraditional entertainment content continues to grow, Southern California is poised to capture this additional investment as well. 
Demand for apartments continues to be strong, with occupancy across our L.A. portfolio at 96.3%. Renewal rates achieved for the quarter were 6.8% and new lease-over-lease growth was 2.5% or lower turnover for the quarter. But based on current estimates, L.A. will see peak deliveries of 10,000 units through 2017, with over 80% of these units spread across 3 submarkets. Downtown Hollywood will represent 50% of the 80%; Glendale, Pasadena 20% of the 80%; and then Koreatown, Mid-Wilshire at 14% of the 80%. 
To date, deliveries in the urban core and West L.A. have had modest impact on revenue growth, which today is in the 3% to 5% range. As L.A. continues to add supply in the urban core, downtown continues to be a more attractive lifestyle that has been nonexistent for many years. With virtually no units being delivered this year or next, the East and West San Fernando Valley, Ventura County and Inland Empire continue to show signs of accelerated revenue growth upwards of 6% to 7% for the current month billings. For 2017, we would expect greater L.A. County to deliver modestly lower revenue growth pressured by the level of new supply in the urban core. 
Orange County at 96% occupancy today achieved renewals for the quarter of 7.6%, and that was the strongest across our portfolio, and new lease-over-lease growth of 4.4%. After taking a breather from elevated deliveries in 2015 and, for the most part, 2016, Orange County is expected to deliver 5,700 units in 2017, with about 50% concentration in Irvine, Newport Beach submarket and a balance spread from Anaheim up through Huntington Beach. With almost 65% of our portfolio in South Orange County, we would expect slightly lower revenue growth as a result of the concentration of deliveries in Irvine, where we have 35% of our revenues. 
San Diego, with extremely strong job growth in the first half of the year, had seen strong demand for apartments with very little supply. San Diego is distinguishing itself as the life science medical device, tech manufacturing center and continues to add high-paying jobs in this sector, albeit at a slower rate. Second, only the Orange County achieved renewal rate growth for the quarter averaged 7.4%, with new lease-over-lease growth of 4.4%, again, on lower turnover. 
San Diego will deliver 2,300 units in 2017, which appear to be dispersed equally between downtown and the I-15 corridor on lower expected job growth. The I-15 submarket is already showing modest deceleration, and we would expect revenue results in '17 to be somewhat lower next year. 
Okay, jumping over to Boston. As we previously said, 2016 would be a window of opportunity in the urban core and, especially Cambridge, where deliveries were few. To date, that has played out where we had seen modest acceleration in revenue growth with more pressure on rents in the suburbs than downtown. New lease-over-lease growth of 1.6% for Q3 was the strongest quarter since Q3 of '15. Achieved renewal rate growth was 4.9%, and again, on lower turnover. 
As Boston continues to position itself as a major tech, biotech hub, and an endorsement with the G.E. headquarter relocation, the future of Boston and professional services job growth is very bright as professional services sector move from 35% of jobs created to 45% of new jobs created this year. 
In the near term, Boston is expected to deliver approximately 6,200 units in 2017, split evenly between Downtown Cambridge and then north and west suburbs. Given the concentrations of the new supply to our portfolio, we see continued deceleration across the market and expect revenue growth to be lower than 2016. 
New York, for the quarter, achieved average renewal rates of 3% and minus 2% on new lease-over-lease growth, again, on slightly lower turnover. With the trend toward affordability over neighborhood loyalty, prospective renters are proving to be more flexible where they choose to live. To date, 55% of the 2016 deliveries have been absorbed. Concessions have yet to become widespread and appear to be more targeted to specific unit types at stable communities. The Upper West Side and West Side down to Chelsea are currently the weakest neighborhoods in our portfolio and are delivering slightly negative revenue growth for the current month. 
The New York MSA will see 14,000 units in '17. And to clarify, these are units that are identified, say, very conservatively to be within the competitive boundaries defined by our portfolio. They will not match the higher MSA numbers provided by third-party data shops. It should not be no surprise that Brooklyn will deliver the lion share of new units, where we have less than 8% of total New York metro revenue, followed by Long Island City, where we have no presence; Midtown West will deliver a good portion as Hudson Yard comes online; and then the Hudson Waterfront, specifically Jersey City. These 4 submarkets will account for a little more than 70% of all deliveries, with the balance spread across various Manhattan neighborhoods. 
While there have been lingering pressures on the financial services sector, high-paying tech jobs and venture capital continue to migrate to the area. Some believe that Brexit could bring back additional financial services jobs, and that would be a good thing. While supply pressures are driven largely by the expiration of the 421-a program, the lack of any existing replacement legislation will create a scenario in the near future of significantly reduced supply. With expectations of more affordability in any future legislation and increasing construction cost, it's hard to imagine deliveries that come close to historical norms. 
Given all these factors and the deceleration we see today, we see New York as our worst-performing market with a high probability of revenue growth turning negative during the year. 
Last but not least, D.C. The metro area continues to improve, coming off of its best job growth since 2000, 8 out of our 10 submarkets are currently delivering accelerated revenue growth, where our current month growth exceeds year-to-date growth anywhere from 100 to 300 basis points. For the quarter, renewal rates achieved were 4.6%, the strongest in the last 7 quarters. And new lease-over-lease growth was plus 20 basis points, again, the strongest in 7 quarters with flat occupancy and turnover. 
With expectations of future job growth being very favorable and over half of the 10,000 units being delivered concentrated in the Southeast and Southwest submarkets, we would expect continued favorable absorption and accelerating revenue growth in the submarkets in which we operate. Like L.A., living in Downtown D.C. 10 years ago was not a consideration for most. As more apartments come online, more restaurants and activities are creating an urban environment that did not exist previously, bringing in suburban renters, who find downtown a more attractive and active lifestyle, given the traffic congestion and commuting cost that currently exist in the region, we expect the acceleration of revenue growth that we see today to continue into next year. 
  
In closing, 2017 revenue growth will certainly be lower than 2016. Job growth and job sectors will dictate the ability of each market to absorb these levels of elevated supply. The degree of management sophistication and discipline will determine how we price it and overall impact to revenue growth. With occupancy still in the 96% range, demand remains strong, but elevated supplies that are not supported by the necessary job growth will face varying degrees of pricing pressure in the near term. 
And so with that said, I will turn it over to Mark Parrell. Mark?"

On the same-store expense side, we moved our annua",1100,"Thank you, David. Today, I'll be giving some color behind our same-store expense growth in the quarter and our normalized FFO guidance. And I'm going to move on to talk a bit about our recent debt deal. 
On the same-store expense side, we moved our annual same-store expense range to 2.8% to 3.2%, which moves the center of our range back to the midpoint of our original February guidance range into the high end of our July guidance range of 2.5% to 3%. This is a relatively modest change for us, 25 basis points of annual expense growth is about $1.5 million. Our same-store expenses through June 30 grew at a rate of only 0.9%. Therefore, as we mentioned on the second quarter call, we always expected our second half expenses to grow at a considerably higher rate, somewhere in the mid-4% range in order to meet our July guidance range of 2.5% to 3%. 
In a moment I will give some detail on payroll expense and on leasing and advertising expense, which were the 2 main drivers of our change in expense guidance. But first, I want to mention one of the bigger drivers of our overall same-store expense growth this year. And that's the recent adverse legal decision regarding the calculation of property taxes for several of our properties in Jersey City that I noted on our second quarter call. The same-store impact of this decision was an increase in 2016 annual real estate tax expense of $1.6 million. We were aware of this in maintaining our same-store expense range of 2.5% to 3% back in July, but still thought that we could stay within that range. 
So overall, for 2016, we expect property tax expense to grow by 6%. So getting back to the change in the same-store expense guidance. On the payroll side, cost in the third quarter were about $1 million more than we had originally planned, because we ran our properties in the third quarter at higher employment levels to keep our properties competitive in some of these challenging markets. We also made aggressive efforts to retain our field personnel in the face of the great demand for them in our markets as new supply gets delivered and needs to be staffed out. 
In the leasing and advertising line, we incurred promotional expenses at the high end of our expectations, mostly in New York and San Francisco, in response to higher supply in this markets. This heightened spending of about $1 million included about $670,000 in gift cards, given new residents, and payment of broker commissions on a few high-rent units. We did anticipate some gift card usage in the third quarter, but the order of magnitude was higher than we expected back in July. We also spent a bit more on Internet listing services in the quarter. Please do remember that we had higher occupancy in 2015 and we were able to reduce such spending in the comparable quarter. We expect additional promotional spending to continue in the fourth quarter, though, at a lesser pace. 
So this is accounting note. Those rules, the accounting rules, require that we account for gift card spending as an expense. However, if we had accounted for the cards as a reduction in revenue, the impact to the company's results would have been a reduction in quarterly same-store revenue of 12 basis points, which would have reduced our reported 3.4% quarterly same-store revenue growth number to 3.3%. The impact on our full year same-store revenue as a result of the gift cards we gave in the third quarter, the ones I just discussed and that we expect to give in the fourth quarter, will be even less, about 5 basis points, if they were to be treated as a contrary to revenue. 
So now I'm going to switch over and talk about moving concessions on our same-store portfolio and those we do treat as reductions in revenue. So again, on the same-store portfolio, in the third quarter, we gave approximately $190,000 versus -- in these concessions versus the $235,000 in moving concessions we gave in the third quarter of 2015. But in terms of the sensitivity of our revised guidance range -- or expense range, leasing and advertising in payroll are the 2 likely pressure points that can move our annual expenses to the higher end of our new range up 2.8% to 3.2%. On the leasing and advertising side, we expect less gift card spending through the rest of the year because of the lower turnover we expect in the fourth quarter and our strong current occupancy. We are incorrect in these assumptions, our expense growth could be pressured. 
Another possible pressure point is that payroll cost continue to escalate due to wage pressure or service levels required by heightened competition in our markets. On the revenue side, we have left our midpoint of 3.75% unchanged, and David Santee has already provided you a bit of color on that. 
We just fine-tuned a few other guidance number, so I'll just talk about that for a minute. We continue to see normalized FFO is remaining within our prior range, so we narrowed that range, as we customarily do at this time of the year. Our current annual normalized FFO midpoint of $3.08 per share is nearly identical to the $3.10 per share midpoint of the range we originally gave you back in February as reductions in same-store NOI were offset by changes in transaction timing and amounts. 
Now just a note on our debt deal. On October 12, we closed on a $500 million 10-year unsecured note offering with a coupon of 2.85% and an all-in effective rate of approximately 3.1%, which includes underwriters' fees and the termination of a small interest rate hedge we had. There was great demand for this debt and we printed the lowest 10-year in our history and one of the lowest ever by a REIT, and we thank our unsecured bond investors for their support of the company. Proceeds from this issuance will be used for working capital and general corporate purposes. Our projected combined line of credit and commercial paper amounts outstanding for those 2 combined at December 31, 2016, is now anticipated to be $130 million versus the $430 million we previously estimated back in July. That's due to proceeds from the $500 million debt deal, reducing line usage, and that's offset by a net $100 million reduction in disposition proceeds that we now expect in 2016. 
 
So I'll now turn the call over to Cynthia for the question-and-answer period."

We're certainly seeing fewer players in the marketplace looking for assets, but I will tell you not a week goes by when Alan George is not showing me some deals we traded at some very strong price across these markets. So we're watching it closely. Certainly revenue is not growing at the same rate and the bottom line is not growing at the same rate that they had. But bottom line is, by and large, they'll continue to improve or continue to grow. There continues to be a need or demand for yield.

Every situation will be different, but I can tell you as, I guess, I have on this most recent call and the call even before that, that we talk about that at the board level and the board just believes that, that activity requires probably a bigger discount than what many on The Street might suggest there with the answers they get with their arithmetic. We've got a significant amount of gain built into most of our assets and that there's just not a lot of capacity after doing things on a debt-neutral basis and distributing dealings with the gain to actually buy much stock back with the proceeds. And then with respect to borrowing to buy stock back, that's -- these are relatively few bites at the apple. And we want to make sure that if and when we do, there would be appropriate time and we'll continue to monitor this as we do on a regular and consistent basis with the board and we'll -- if this makes sense to do something down the road, we certainly would be willing to do that.

Thank you for joining us for this morning's call. As we've discussed over the last several quarters, 2016 will not turn out to be the year we had originally expected due to elevated levels of new supply in both San F",322,"Thanks, Marty. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for this morning's call. As we've discussed over the last several quarters, 2016 will not turn out to be the year we had originally expected due to elevated levels of new supply in both San Francisco and New York City, which combined, made up a large share of our initial growth forecast for the year. And as a result, after 5 years of extraordinarily strong fundamentals, revenue growth this year will now be more in line with long-term historical trends. 
Good news, however, is that exceptionally strong demand continues unabated across our markets, with current occupancies remaining at or near 96% and low exposure on the horizon. Turnover across all markets, when excluding same-property movement, has actually decreased for the first 9 months of the year compared to the same period last year. Move-outs by single-family homes remain a nonfactor in our high cost of housing markets. And our recently completed development properties are absorbing units significantly faster and at rates above or close to our original expectations. Furthermore, while our markets have experienced a slowdown in the growth of high-income jobs, the absolute number of new high-income jobs remains relatively strong, and there are preliminary indications that the trend may be reversing. Perhaps more importantly, for the first time since the recovery began, there are abundant signs of wage growth occurring in all industries across the country, which obviously is a very good sign for the apartment business. 
So as we look forward to what we see as peak deliveries next year, our teams across the country will work very hard in caring for our existing residents, welcoming prospects and turning them into new residents. And we remain extraordinarily excited about the outlook for our business, portfolio and the company. 
So with that said, we will let David Santee go into more detail about what we're seeing across our markets today."
28209,378013080,1062285,"Equity Residential, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2016",2016-10-26,"Earnings Calls","Equity Residential","Executives","Okay. Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone. Today, I'll update you on our Q3 results, discuss the current state of each market in which we operate as well as providing additional color on 2017 deliveries. And as David said, demand for quality apartm",2131,"Okay. Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone. Today, I'll update you on our Q3 results, discuss the current state of each market in which we operate as well as providing additional color on 2017 deliveries. 
And as David said, demand for quality apartments remains very robust, with occupancies in our markets averaging 96% or better, and resident turnover continuing to decline. Year-to-date turnover net of same-property transfers decreased 30 basis points versus the 10 basis point increase in the gross turnover that we reported, demonstrating the strong customer satisfaction that our employees strive to deliver each and every day, and the great locations our portfolio continues to enjoy. 
Renewal rates achieved for the quarter continue to be well above historical averages at 5.3%, while new lease-over-lease pricing was plus 90 basis points. Combined results were in line with our revised expectations at 3.1%. 
Moving on to the markets. In Seattle, new lease-over-lease growth averaged 4.9% for the quarter, while renewals achieved were 8.1%. Seattle continues to distinguish itself as the epicenter of cloud computing services as Amazon remains the catalyst for the rapid downtown expansion of both jobs and new apartment deliveries. Through August, Seattle, Bellevue and Redmond realized job growth of 3.15% [ph] that allowed the 7,200 new apartment deliveries this year to be easily absorbed with virtually 0 pricing pressure. Now with 7,000 new deliveries expected in '17 and job growth well above the national average, we see Seattle as our best revenue growth market next year. 
Again, using job -- Amazon job openings as a proxy for demand, last week there were 8,000 openings in Seattle, almost double from the same time last year, 3,300 of which are for high-paying software developer positions. This concentration of intellectual capital is also forcing the large well-established tech companies to expand their presence in Seattle to better compete for talent. 
Microsoft, the region's second-largest employer recently committed to a significant investment in a new artificial intelligence group and most recently announced record operating results. With cloud computing in early innings, and Boeing, the area's largest employer having a 7-year backlog in airplane production, Seattle is poised for continued growth as rents are the lowest of all the markets in which we operate, likely delivering strong revenue results that are slightly lower next year. 
Down to San Francisco, while operations were quite volatile during the summer peak leasing season, more recently the market has been more stable across the key drivers of revenue growth. Occupancy has improved to 96% versus the low 95s that we saw only a few months ago. The percent of residents renewing are at peak levels. And contrary to some reports of rents being down double digits, our San Francisco portfolio average asking rents are down only 1.4% versus same week last year. 
Growth in higher-paying tech jobs is not as robust as 2015, but the growth is, nonetheless, positive. And while VC capital investment has slowed, the actual amount of VC funds available for investment have increased. All the fundamentals are still in place for the market to absorb 2017 deliveries. However, elevated supply and a slower pace of VC investment that drives the tech sector will continue to have a negative impact on pricing power in submarkets that see the most deliveries. 
Achieved renewal rates for the quarter in San Francisco were 6.2% and the new lease-over-lease rate averaged minus 30 basis points. The modest increase in turnover is more than accounted for by same-property transfers. Netting these out, year-to-date turnover has actually declined 70 basis points on top of the improvement we saw last year. 
2017 will see the market deliver 8,400 new apartments, with deliveries that are less concentrated than in 2016. In the downtown area, SoMa will see 50% fewer units delivered, with the balance spread across Mission Bay and the Dogpatch areas. The mid-Peninsula will also be more dispersed, with only 1,600 units spread across all directions in San Mateo and Redwood City. San Jose and Santa Clara will see the majority of deliveries in the South Bay and will be less geographically competitive with our same-store portfolio. 
Based on current delivery estimates, the 2017 supply appears to be more front loaded in the year, which means most of the supply will begin leasing up in periods of peak demand. San Francisco remains ground zero for innovation, and tech stalwarts continue to expand their footprint. As artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things continues to grow legs, we would expect San Francisco to continue to lead the world in tech and overcome any short-term challenges with supply. Time and time again, San Francisco has proven to come back faster and stronger than peaks in the past, but we would expect San Fran to deliver revenue growth in 2017 that is much lower than 2016. 
Dropping down to L.A., job growth continues to be very strong, but is dominated more by lower-paying hospitality and leisure sector. However, as downtown L.A. focuses on its Renaissance efforts, and Silicon Beach continues to develop and build out, the higher-paying professional services sector is expected to lead job growth through 2020. As nontraditional entertainment content continues to grow, Southern California is poised to capture this additional investment as well. 
Demand for apartments continues to be strong, with occupancy across our L.A. portfolio at 96.3%. Renewal rates achieved for the quarter were 6.8% and new lease-over-lease growth was 2.5% or lower turnover for the quarter. But based on current estimates, L.A. will see peak deliveries of 10,000 units through 2017, with over 80% of these units spread across 3 submarkets. Downtown Hollywood will represent 50% of the 80%; Glendale, Pasadena 20% of the 80%; and then Koreatown, Mid-Wilshire at 14% of the 80%. 
To date, deliveries in the urban core and West L.A. have had modest impact on revenue growth, which today is in the 3% to 5% range. As L.A. continues to add supply in the urban core, downtown continues to be a more attractive lifestyle that has been nonexistent for many years. With virtually no units being delivered this year or next, the East and West San Fernando Valley, Ventura County and Inland Empire continue to show signs of accelerated revenue growth upwards of 6% to 7% for the current month billings. For 2017, we would expect greater L.A. County to deliver modestly lower revenue growth pressured by the level of new supply in the urban core. 
Orange County at 96% occupancy today achieved renewals for the quarter of 7.6%, and that was the strongest across our portfolio, and new lease-over-lease growth of 4.4%. After taking a breather from elevated deliveries in 2015 and, for the most part, 2016, Orange County is expected to deliver 5,700 units in 2017, with about 50% concentration in [indiscernible], Irvine, Newport Beach submarket and a balance spread from Anaheim up through Huntington Beach. With almost 65% of our portfolio in South Orange County, we would expect slightly lower revenue growth as a result of the concentration of deliveries in Irvine, where we have 35% of our revenues. 
San Diego, with extremely strong job growth in the first half of the year, has seen strong demand for apartments with very little supply. San Diego is distinguishing itself as a life science medical device, tech manufacturing center and continues to add high-paying jobs in this sector, albeit at a slower rate. Second only to Orange County achieved renewal rate growth for the quarter averaged 7.4%, with new lease-over-lease growth of 4.4%, again, on lower turnover. 
San Diego will deliver 2,300 units in 2017, which appear to be dispersed equally between downtown and the I-15 corridor on lower expected job growth. The I-15 submarket is already showing modest deceleration, and we would expect revenue results in '17 to be somewhat lower next year. 
Okay, jumping over to Boston. As we previously said, 2016 would be a window of opportunity in the urban core and, especially Cambridge, where deliveries were few. To date, that has played out where we had seen modest acceleration in revenue growth with more pressure on rents in the suburbs than downtown. New lease-over-lease growth of 1.6% for Q3 was the strongest quarter since Q3 of '15. Achieved renewal rate growth was 4.9%, and again, on lower turnover. 
As Boston continues to position itself as a major tech, biotech hub, and an endorsement with the G.E. headquarter relocation, the future of Boston and professional services job growth is very bright as professional services sector move from 35% of jobs created to 45% of new jobs created this year. 
In the near term, Boston is expected to deliver approximately 6,200 units in 2017, split evenly between Downtown Cambridge and then north and west suburbs. Given the concentrations of the new supply to our portfolio, we see continued deceleration across the market and expect revenue growth to be lower than 2016. 
New York, for the quarter, achieved average renewal rates up 3% and minus 2% on new lease-over-lease growth, again, on slightly lower turnover. With the trend toward affordability over neighborhood loyalty, prospective renters are proving to be more flexible where they choose to live. To date, 55% of the 2016 deliveries have been absorbed. Concessions have yet to become widespread and appear to be more targeted to specific unit types at stable communities. The Upper West Side and West Side down to Chelsea are currently the weakest neighborhoods in our portfolio and are delivering slightly negative revenue growth for the current month. 
The New York MSA will see 14,000 units in '17. And to clarify, these are units that are identified, and I'll say, very conservatively, to be within the competitive boundaries defined by our portfolio. They will not match the higher MSA numbers provided by third-party data shops. It should be no surprise that Brooklyn will deliver the lion share of new units, where we have less than 8% of total New York metro revenue, followed by Long Island City, where we have no presence; Midtown West will deliver a good portion as Hudson Yard comes online; and then the Hudson Waterfront, specifically Jersey City. These 4 submarkets will account for a little more than 70% of all deliveries, with the balance spread across various Manhattan neighborhoods. 
While there have been lingering pressures on the financial services sector, high-paying tech jobs and venture capital continue to migrate to the area. Some believe that Brexit could bring back additional financial services jobs, and that would be a good thing. While supply pressures are driven largely by the expiration of the 421-a program, the lack of any existing replacement legislation will create a scenario in the near future of significantly reduced supply. With expectations of more affordability in any future legislation and increasing construction cost, it's hard to imagine deliveries that come close to historical norms. 
Given all these factors and the deceleration we see today, we see New York as our worst-performing market with a high probability of revenue growth turning negative during the year. 
Last but not least, D.C. The metro area continues to improve, coming off of its best job growth since 2000, 8 out of our 10 submarkets are currently delivering accelerated revenue growth, where our current month growth exceeds year-to-date growth anywhere from 100 to 300 basis points. For the quarter, renewal rates achieved were 4.6%, the strongest in the last 7 quarters. And new lease-over-lease growth was plus 20 basis points, again, the strongest in 7 quarters with flat occupancy and turnover. 
With expectations of future job growth being very favorable and over half of the 10,000 units being delivered concentrated in the Southeast and Southwest submarkets, we would expect continued favorable absorption and accelerating revenue growth in the submarkets in which we operate. Like L.A., living in Downtown D.C. 10 years ago was not a consideration for most. As more apartments come online, more restaurants and activities are creating an urban environment that did not exist previously, bringing in suburban renters, who find downtown a more attractive and active lifestyle, given the traffic congestion and commuting cost that currently exists in the region. We expect the acceleration of revenue growth that we see today to continue into next year. 
  
In closing, 2017 revenue growth will certainly be lower than 2016. Job growth and job sectors will dictate the ability of each market to absorb these levels of elevated supply. The degree of management sophistication and discipline will determine how we price it and overall impact to revenue growth. With occupancy still in the 96% range, demand remains strong, but elevated supplies that are not supported by the necessary job growth will face varying degrees of pricing pressure in the near term. 
And so with that said, I will turn it over to Mark Parrell. Mark?"

On the same-store expense side, we moved our annu",1102,"Thank you, David. Today, I'll be giving some color behind our same-store expense growth in the quarter and our normalized FFO guidance. Then I'm going to move on to talk a bit about our recent debt deal. 
On the same-store expense side, we moved our annual same-store expense range to 2.8% to 3.2%, which moves the center of our range back to the midpoint of our original February guidance range, and to the high end of our July guidance range of 2.5% to 3%. This is a relatively modest change for us, 25 basis points of annual expense growth is about $1.5 million. Our same-store expenses through June 30 grew at a rate of only 0.9%. Therefore, as we mentioned on the second quarter call, we always expected our second half expenses to grow at a considerably higher rate, somewhere in the mid-4% range in order to meet our July guidance range of 2.5% to 3%. 
In a moment I will give some detail on payroll expense and on leasing and advertising expense, which were the 2 main drivers of our change in expense guidance. But first, I want to mention one of the bigger drivers of our overall same-store expense growth this year. And that's the recent adverse legal decision regarding the calculation of property taxes for several of our properties in Jersey City that I noted on our second quarter call. The same-store impact of this decision was an increase in 2016 annual real estate tax expense of $1.6 million. We were aware of this in maintaining our same-store expense range of 2.5% to 3% back in July, but still thought that we could stay within that range. 
So overall, for 2016, we expect property tax expense to grow by 6%. So getting back to the change in the same-store expense guidance. On the payroll side, cost in the third quarter were about $1 million more than we had originally planned, because we ran our properties in the third quarter at higher employment levels to keep our properties competitive in some of these challenging markets. We also made aggressive efforts to retain our field personnel in the face of the great demand for them in our markets as new supply gets delivered and needs to be staffed up. 
In the leasing and advertising line, we incurred promotional expenses at the high end of our expectations, mostly in New York and San Francisco, in response to higher supply in these markets. This heightened spending of about $1 million included about $670,000 in gift cards, given new residents, and payment of broker commissions on a few high-rent units. We did anticipate some gift card usage in the third quarter, but the order of magnitude was higher than we expected back in July. We also spent a bit more on Internet listing services in the quarter. Please do remember that we had higher occupancy in 2015 and we were able to reduce such spending in the comparable quarter. We expect additional promotional spending to continue in the fourth quarter, though, at a lesser pace. 
So just an accounting note, those rules, the accounting rules, require that we account for gift card spending as an expense. However, if we had accounted for the cards as a reduction in revenue, the impact to the company's results would have been a reduction in quarterly same-store revenue of 12 basis points, which would have reduced our reported 3.4% quarterly same-store revenue growth number to 3.3%. The impact on our full year same-store revenue as a result of the gift cards we gave in the third quarter, the ones I just discussed and that we expect to give in the fourth quarter, will be even less, about 5 basis points, if they were to be treated as a contra to revenue. 
So now I'm going to switch over and talk about move-in concessions on our same-store portfolio and those we do treat as reductions in revenue. So again, on the same-store portfolio, in the third quarter, we gave approximately $190,000 versus -- in these concessions versus the $235,000 in move-in concessions we gave in the third quarter of 2015. But in terms of the sensitivity of our revised guidance range -- or expense range, leasing and advertising and payroll are the 2 likeliest pressure points that can move our annual expenses to the higher end of our new range of 2.8% to 3.2%. On the leasing and advertising side, we expect less gift card spending through the rest of the year because of the lower turnover we expect in the fourth quarter and our strong current occupancy. We are incorrect in these assumptions, our expense growth could be pressured. 
Another possible pressure point is if payroll costs continue to escalate due to wage pressure or service levels required by heightened competition in our markets. On the revenue side, we have left our midpoint of 3.75% unchanged, and David Santee has already provided you a bit of color on that. 
We just fine-tuned a few other guidance number, so I'll just talk about that for a minute. We continue to see normalized FFO as remaining within our prior range, so we narrowed that range, as we customarily do at this time of the year. Our current annual normalized FFO midpoint of $3.08 per share is nearly identical to the $3.10 per share midpoint of the range we originally gave you back in February as reductions in same-store NOI were offset by changes in transaction timing and amounts. 
Now just a note on our debt deal. On October 12, we closed on a $500 million 10-year unsecured note offering with a coupon of 2.85% and an all-in effective rate of approximately 3.1%, which includes underwriters' fees and the termination of a small interest rate hedge we had. There was great demand for this debt and we printed the lowest 10-year in our history and one of the lowest ever by a REIT, and we thank our unsecured bond investors for their support of the company. Proceeds from this issuance will be used for working capital and general corporate purposes. Our projected combined line of credit and commercial paper amounts outstanding, so those 2 combined, at December 31, 2016, is now anticipated to be $130 million versus the $430 million we previously estimated back in July. That's due to proceeds from the $500 million debt deal, our reducing line usage, and that's offset by a net $100 million reduction in disposition proceeds that we now expect in 2016. 
 
So I'll now turn the call over to Cynthia for the question-and-answer period."

We're certainly seeing fewer players in the marketplace looking for assets, but I will tell you not a week goes by when Alan George is not showing me some deals we traded at some very strong price across these markets. So we're watching it closely. Certainly revenue is not growing at the same rate and the bottom line is not growing at the same rate that they had. But bottom line is, by and large, they'll continue to improve or continue to grow. There continues to be a need or demand for yield.

We've got a significant amount of gain built into most of our assets and that there's just not a lot of capacity after doing things on a debt-neutral basis and distributing dealing with the gain to actually buy much stock back with the proceeds.

So I thought I picked up on some comments surrounding potential stabilization there. Is that accurate just in terms of how new and renewals are trending today? Or is that just a function of lower turnover at this point in the leasing season or a shift in timing of supply, or some other factor?"

I would say certainly not -- the market is not moving back up. It's kind of moving sideways right now, but we started off with going from rents that were up 5%, 6% that within a couple of months went down to negative 2%. We saw occupancies that were well above 96% fall off by over 100 basis points in the peak leasing season, which is not a time that you would expect lower demand. So the market was just zigging and zagging for the most of the summer. And so today our exposure is right back where it was. Our occupancy is, for the most part, right on top of last year. We don't see any crazy pricing mechanisms in the market. I mean, the new lease-ups will continue to offer the 1, 1.5 months free rent, and we expect that. But for the most part, I would really just say the market appears to be more disciplined today instead of stable. It's just more disciplined today than it has been over the last 4 months."

I mean, you had a very large concentration of assets in the SoMa area, which really trickled across -- as well as South San Francisco. And I go back to kind of the original underwriting where the market rent growth in San Francisco far outpaced underwriting on new assets. I mean, even looking at our own assets, the market went well above what we underwrote on our new delivery. So owners had a lot of wiggle room to price discover. I mean, there hasn't really been any high-rise, brand-new vertical glass, great views of the bay, assets delivered in San Francisco for years. So there was some element of price discovery and I feel like some could have probably achieved higher rents when you look at the pace of lease-ups. So I think you'll see -- obviously, you'll see less of that type of product in 2017, probably more podium, traditional developments that you see down in San Jose, and what have you, and pricing should -- we expect and hope that it would be more reasonable than what we saw last year or this year."

Thank you for joining us for this morning's call. As we've discussed over the last several quarters, 2016 will not turn out to be the year we had originally expected due to elevated levels of new supply in both San F",322,"Thanks, Marty. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for this morning's call. As we've discussed over the last several quarters, 2016 will not turn out to be the year we had originally expected due to elevated levels of new supply in both San Francisco and New York City, which combined, made up a large share of our initial growth forecast for the year. And as a result, after 5 years of extraordinarily strong fundamentals, revenue growth this year will now be more in line with long-term historical trends. 
Good news, however, is that exceptionally strong demand continues unabated across our markets, with current occupancies remaining at or near 96% and low exposure on the horizon. Turnover across all markets, when excluding same-property movement, has actually decreased for the first 9 months of the year compared to the same period last year. Move-outs by single-family homes remain a nonfactor in our high cost of housing markets. And our recently completed development properties are absorbing units significantly faster and at rates above or close to our original expectations. Furthermore, while our markets have experienced a slowdown in the growth of high-income jobs, the absolute number of new high-income jobs remains relatively strong, and there are preliminary indications that the trend may be reversing. Perhaps more importantly, for the first time since the recovery began, there are abundant signs of wage growth occurring in all industries across the country, which obviously is a very good sign for the apartment business. 
So as we look forward to what we see as peak deliveries next year, our teams across the country will work very hard in caring for our existing residents, welcoming prospects and turning them into new residents. And we remain extraordinarily excited about the outlook for our business, portfolio and the company. 
So with that said, we will let David Santee go into more detail about what we're seeing across our markets today."
28209,378013080,1062892,"Equity Residential, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2016",2016-10-26,"Earnings Calls","Equity Residential","Executives","Okay. Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone. Today, I'll update you on our Q3 results, discuss the current state of each market in which we operate as well as providing additional color on 2017 deliveries. And as David said, demand for quality apartm",2131,"Okay. Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone. Today, I'll update you on our Q3 results, discuss the current state of each market in which we operate as well as providing additional color on 2017 deliveries. 
And as David said, demand for quality apartments remains very robust, with occupancies in our markets averaging 96% or better, and resident turnover continuing to decline. Year-to-date turnover net of same-property transfers decreased 30 basis points versus the 10 basis point increase in the gross turnover that we reported, demonstrating the strong customer satisfaction that our employees strive to deliver each and every day, and the great locations our portfolio continues to enjoy. 
Renewal rates achieved for the quarter continue to be well above historical averages at 5.3%, while new lease-over-lease pricing was plus 90 basis points. Combined results were in line with our revised expectations at 3.1%. 
Moving on to the markets. In Seattle, new lease-over-lease growth averaged 4.9% for the quarter, while renewals achieved were 8.1%. Seattle continues to distinguish itself as the epicenter of cloud computing services as Amazon remains the catalyst for the rapid downtown expansion of both jobs and new apartment deliveries. Through August, Seattle, Bellevue and Redmond realized job growth of 3.15% [ph] that allowed the 7,200 new apartment deliveries this year to be easily absorbed with virtually 0 pricing pressure. Now with 7,000 new deliveries expected in '17 and job growth well above the national average, we see Seattle as our best revenue growth market next year. 
Again, using job -- Amazon job openings as a proxy for demand, last week there were 8,000 openings in Seattle, almost double from the same time last year, 3,300 of which are for high-paying software developer positions. This concentration of intellectual capital is also forcing the large well-established tech companies to expand their presence in Seattle to better compete for talent. 
Microsoft, the region's second-largest employer recently committed to a significant investment in a new artificial intelligence group and most recently announced record operating results. With cloud computing in early innings, and Boeing, the area's largest employer having a 7-year backlog in airplane production, Seattle is poised for continued growth as rents are the lowest of all the markets in which we operate, likely delivering strong revenue results that are slightly lower next year. 
Down to San Francisco, while operations were quite volatile during the summer peak leasing season, more recently the market has been more stable across the key drivers of revenue growth. Occupancy has improved to 96% versus the low 95s that we saw only a few months ago. The percent of residents renewing are at peak levels. And contrary to some reports of rents being down double digits, our San Francisco portfolio average asking rents are down only 1.4% versus same week last year. 
Growth in higher-paying tech jobs is not as robust as 2015, but the growth is, nonetheless, positive. And while VC capital investment has slowed, the actual amount of VC funds available for investment have increased. All the fundamentals are still in place for the market to absorb 2017 deliveries. However, elevated supply and a slower pace of VC investment that drives the tech sector will continue to have a negative impact on pricing power in submarkets that see the most deliveries. 
Achieved renewal rates for the quarter in San Francisco were 6.2% and the new lease-over-lease rate averaged minus 30 basis points. The modest increase in turnover is more than accounted for by same-property transfers. Netting these out, year-to-date turnover has actually declined 70 basis points on top of the improvement we saw last year. 
2017 will see the market deliver 8,400 new apartments, with deliveries that are less concentrated than in 2016. In the downtown area, SoMa will see 50% fewer units delivered, with the balance spread across Mission Bay and the Dogpatch areas. The mid-Peninsula will also be more dispersed, with only 1,600 units spread across all directions in San Mateo and Redwood City. San Jose and Santa Clara will see the majority of deliveries in the South Bay and will be less geographically competitive with our same-store portfolio. 
Based on current delivery estimates, the 2017 supply appears to be more front loaded in the year, which means most of the supply will begin leasing up in periods of peak demand. San Francisco remains ground zero for innovation, and tech stalwarts continue to expand their footprint. As artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things continues to grow legs, we would expect San Francisco to continue to lead the world in tech and overcome any short-term challenges with supply. Time and time again, San Francisco has proven to come back faster and stronger than peaks in the past, but we would expect San Fran to deliver revenue growth in 2017 that is much lower than 2016. 
Dropping down to L.A., job growth continues to be very strong, but is dominated more by lower-paying hospitality and leisure sector. However, as downtown L.A. focuses on its Renaissance efforts, and Silicon Beach continues to develop and build out, the higher-paying professional services sector is expected to lead job growth through 2020. As nontraditional entertainment content continues to grow, Southern California is poised to capture this additional investment as well. 
Demand for apartments continues to be strong, with occupancy across our L.A. portfolio at 96.3%. Renewal rates achieved for the quarter were 6.8% and new lease-over-lease growth was 2.5% or lower turnover for the quarter. But based on current estimates, L.A. will see peak deliveries of 10,000 units through 2017, with over 80% of these units spread across 3 submarkets. Downtown Hollywood will represent 50% of the 80%; Glendale, Pasadena 20% of the 80%; and then Koreatown, Mid-Wilshire at 14% of the 80%. 
To date, deliveries in the urban core and West L.A. have had modest impact on revenue growth, which today is in the 3% to 5% range. As L.A. continues to add supply in the urban core, downtown continues to be a more attractive lifestyle that has been nonexistent for many years. With virtually no units being delivered this year or next, the East and West San Fernando Valley, Ventura County and Inland Empire continue to show signs of accelerated revenue growth upwards of 6% to 7% for the current month billings. For 2017, we would expect greater L.A. County to deliver modestly lower revenue growth pressured by the level of new supply in the urban core. 
Orange County at 96% occupancy today achieved renewals for the quarter of 7.6%, and that was the strongest across our portfolio, and new lease-over-lease growth of 4.4%. After taking a breather from elevated deliveries in 2015 and, for the most part, 2016, Orange County is expected to deliver 5,700 units in 2017, with about 50% concentration in [indiscernible], Irvine, Newport Beach submarket and a balance spread from Anaheim up through Huntington Beach. With almost 65% of our portfolio in South Orange County, we would expect slightly lower revenue growth as a result of the concentration of deliveries in Irvine, where we have 35% of our revenues. 
San Diego, with extremely strong job growth in the first half of the year, has seen strong demand for apartments with very little supply. San Diego is distinguishing itself as a life science medical device, tech manufacturing center and continues to add high-paying jobs in this sector, albeit at a slower rate. Second only to Orange County achieved renewal rate growth for the quarter averaged 7.4%, with new lease-over-lease growth of 4.4%, again, on lower turnover. 
San Diego will deliver 2,300 units in 2017, which appear to be dispersed equally between downtown and the I-15 corridor on lower expected job growth. The I-15 submarket is already showing modest deceleration, and we would expect revenue results in '17 to be somewhat lower next year. 
Okay, jumping over to Boston. As we previously said, 2016 would be a window of opportunity in the urban core and, especially Cambridge, where deliveries were few. To date, that has played out where we had seen modest acceleration in revenue growth with more pressure on rents in the suburbs than downtown. New lease-over-lease growth of 1.6% for Q3 was the strongest quarter since Q3 of '15. Achieved renewal rate growth was 4.9%, and again, on lower turnover. 
As Boston continues to position itself as a major tech, biotech hub, and an endorsement with the G.E. headquarter relocation, the future of Boston and professional services job growth is very bright as professional services sector move from 35% of jobs created to 45% of new jobs created this year. 
In the near term, Boston is expected to deliver approximately 6,200 units in 2017, split evenly between Downtown Cambridge and then north and west suburbs. Given the concentrations of the new supply to our portfolio, we see continued deceleration across the market and expect revenue growth to be lower than 2016. 
New York, for the quarter, achieved average renewal rates up 3% and minus 2% on new lease-over-lease growth, again, on slightly lower turnover. With the trend toward affordability over neighborhood loyalty, prospective renters are proving to be more flexible where they choose to live. To date, 55% of the 2016 deliveries have been absorbed. Concessions have yet to become widespread and appear to be more targeted to specific unit types at stable communities. The Upper West Side and West Side down to Chelsea are currently the weakest neighborhoods in our portfolio and are delivering slightly negative revenue growth for the current month. 
The New York MSA will see 14,000 units in '17. And to clarify, these are units that are identified, and I'll say, very conservatively, to be within the competitive boundaries defined by our portfolio. They will not match the higher MSA numbers provided by third-party data shops. It should be no surprise that Brooklyn will deliver the lion share of new units, where we have less than 8% of total New York metro revenue, followed by Long Island City, where we have no presence; Midtown West will deliver a good portion as Hudson Yard comes online; and then the Hudson Waterfront, specifically Jersey City. These 4 submarkets will account for a little more than 70% of all deliveries, with the balance spread across various Manhattan neighborhoods. 
While there have been lingering pressures on the financial services sector, high-paying tech jobs and venture capital continue to migrate to the area. Some believe that Brexit could bring back additional financial services jobs, and that would be a good thing. While supply pressures are driven largely by the expiration of the 421-a program, the lack of any existing replacement legislation will create a scenario in the near future of significantly reduced supply. With expectations of more affordability in any future legislation and increasing construction cost, it's hard to imagine deliveries that come close to historical norms. 
Given all these factors and the deceleration we see today, we see New York as our worst-performing market with a high probability of revenue growth turning negative during the year. 
Last but not least, D.C. The metro area continues to improve, coming off of its best job growth since 2000, 8 out of our 10 submarkets are currently delivering accelerated revenue growth, where our current month growth exceeds year-to-date growth anywhere from 100 to 300 basis points. For the quarter, renewal rates achieved were 4.6%, the strongest in the last 7 quarters. And new lease-over-lease growth was plus 20 basis points, again, the strongest in 7 quarters with flat occupancy and turnover. 
With expectations of future job growth being very favorable and over half of the 10,000 units being delivered concentrated in the Southeast and Southwest submarkets, we would expect continued favorable absorption and accelerating revenue growth in the submarkets in which we operate. Like L.A., living in Downtown D.C. 10 years ago was not a consideration for most. As more apartments come online, more restaurants and activities are creating an urban environment that did not exist previously, bringing in suburban renters, who find downtown a more attractive and active lifestyle, given the traffic congestion and commuting cost that currently exists in the region. We expect the acceleration of revenue growth that we see today to continue into next year. 
  
In closing, 2017 revenue growth will certainly be lower than 2016. Job growth and job sectors will dictate the ability of each market to absorb these levels of elevated supply. The degree of management sophistication and discipline will determine how we price it and overall impact to revenue growth. With occupancy still in the 96% range, demand remains strong, but elevated supplies that are not supported by the necessary job growth will face varying degrees of pricing pressure in the near term. 
And so with that said, I will turn it over to Mark Parrell. Mark?"

Then I'm going to move on to talk a bit about our recent debt deal. 
On the same-store expense side, we moved our annual same-store expense range to 2.8% to 3.2%, which moves the center of our range back to the midpoint of our original February guidance range, and to the high end of our July guidance range of 2.5% to 3%. This is a relatively modest change for us, 25 basis points of annual expense growth is about $1.5 million. Our same-store expenses through June 30 grew at a rate of only 0.9%. Therefore, as we mentioned on the second quarter call, we always expected our second half expenses to grow at a considerably higher rate, somewhere in the mid-4% range in order to meet our July guidance range of 2.5% to 3%. 
In a moment I will give some detail on payroll expense and on leasing and advertising expense, which were the 2 main drivers of our change in expense guidance. But first, I want to mention one of the bigger drivers of our overall same-store expense growth this year. And that's the recent adverse legal decision regarding the calculation of property taxes for several of our properties in Jersey City that I noted on our second quarter call. The same-store impact of this decision was an increase in 2016 annual real estate tax expense of $1.6 million. We were aware of this in maintaining our same-store expense range of 2.5% to 3% back in July, but still thought that we could stay within that range. 
So overall, for 2016, we expect property tax expense to grow by 6%. So getting back to the change in the same-store expense guidance. On the payroll side, cost in the third quarter were about $1 million more than we had originally planned, because we ran our properties in the third quarter at higher employment levels to keep our properties competitive in some of these challenging markets. We also made aggressive efforts to retain our field personnel in the face of the great demand for them in our markets as new supply gets delivered and needs to be staffed up. 
In the leasing and advertising line, we incurred promotional expenses at the high end of our expectations, mostly in New York and San Francisco, in response to higher supply in these markets. This heightened spending of about $1 million included about $670,000 in gift cards, given new residents, and payment of broker commissions on a few high-rent units. We did anticipate some gift card usage in the third quarter, but the order of magnitude was higher than we expected back in July. We also spent a bit more on Internet listing services in the quarter. Please do remember that we had higher occupancy in 2015 and we were able to reduce such spending in the comparable quarter. We expect additional promotional spending to continue in the fourth quarter, though, at a lesser pace. 
So just an accounting note, those rules, the accounting rules, require that we account for gift card spending as an expense. However, if we had accounted for the cards as a reduction in revenue, the impact to the company's results would have been a reduction in quarterly same-store revenue of 12 basis points, which would have reduced our reported 3.4% quarterly same-store revenue growth number to 3.3%. The impact on our full year same-store revenue as a result of the gift cards we gave in the third quarter, the ones I just discussed and that we expect to give in the fourth quarter, will be even less, about 5 basis points, if they were to be treated as a contra to revenue. 
So now I'm going to switch over and talk about move-in concessions on our same-store portfolio and those we do treat as reductions in revenue. So again, on the same-store portfolio, in the third quarter, we gave approximately $190,000 versus -- in these concessions versus the $235,000 in move-in concessions we gave in the third quarter of 2015. But in terms of the sensitivity of our revised guidance range -- or expense range, leasing and advertising and payroll are the 2 likeliest pressure points that can move our annual expenses to the higher end of our new range of 2.8% to 3.2%. On the leasing and advertising side, we expect less gift card spending through the rest of the year because of the lower turnover we expect in the fourth quarter and our strong current occupancy. We are incorrect in these assumptions, our expense growth could be pressured. 
Another possible pressure point is if payroll costs continue to escalate due to wage pressure or service levels required by heightened competition in our markets. On the revenue side, we have left our midpoint of 3.75% unchanged, and David Santee has already provided you a bit of color on that. 
We just fine-tuned a few other guidance number, so I'll just talk about that for a minute. We continue to see normalized FFO as remaining within our prior range, so we narrowed that range, as we customarily do at this time of the year. Our current annual normalized FFO midpoint of $3.08 per share is nearly identical to the $3.10 per share midpoint of the range we originally gave you back in February as reductions in same-store NOI were offset by changes in transaction timing and amounts. 
Now just a note on our debt deal. On October 12, we closed on a $500 million 10-year unsecured note offering with a coupon of 2.85% and an all-in effective rate of approximately 3.1%, which includes underwriters' fees and the termination of a small interest rate hedge we had. There was great demand for this debt and we printed the lowest 10-year in our history and one of the lowest ever by a REIT, and we thank our unsecured bond investors for their support of the company. Proceeds from this issuance will be used for working capital and general corporate purposes. Our projected combined line of credit and commercial paper amounts outstanding, so those 2 combined, at December 31, 2016, is now anticipated to be $130 million versus the $430 million we previously estimated back in July. That's due to proceeds from the $500 million debt deal, our reducing line usage, and that's offset by a net $100 million reduction in disposition proceeds that we now expect in 2016. 
 
So I'll now turn the call over to Cynthia for the question-and-answer period."

We're certainly seeing fewer players in the marketplace looking for assets, but I will tell you not a week goes by when Alan George is not showing me some deals we traded at some very strong price across these markets. So we're watching it closely. Certainly revenue is not growing at the same rate and the bottom line is not growing at the same rate that they had. But bottom line is, by and large, they'll continue to improve or continue to grow. There continues to be a need or demand for yield.

Every situation will be different, but I can tell you as, I guess, I have on this most recent call and the call even before that, that we talk about that at the board level and the board just believes that, that activity requires probably a bigger discount than what many on The Street might suggest that their -- with the answers they get with their arithmetic. We've got a significant amount of gain built into most of our assets and that there's just not a lot of capacity after doing things on a debt-neutral basis and distributing dealing with the gain to actually buy much stock back with the proceeds. 
And then with respect to borrowing to buy stock back, that's -- these are --  you get relatively few bites at the apple and we want to make sure that if and when we do, they're the appropriate time and we'll continue to monitor this as we do on a regular and consistent basis with the board and we'll -- if it makes sense to do something down the road we're certainly -- would be willing to do that.

We saw occupancies that were well above 96% fall off by over 100 basis points in the peak leasing season, which is not a time that you would expect lower demand. So the market was just zigging and zagging for the most of the summer. And so today our exposure is right back where it was. Our occupancy is, for the most part, right on top of last year. We don't see any crazy pricing mechanisms in the market. I mean, the new lease-ups will continue to offer the 1, 1.5 months free rent, and we expect that.
