Thanks, again, for joining us on this busy morning. By now you've heard many metaphors describing the commodity price environment from choppy waters to rough terrain.

By now you've heard many metaphors describing the commodity price environment from choppy waters to rough terrain. The backdrop we find ourselves in is volatile and dynamic, but the Concho team has experienced succeeding when prices are low. 
We're building the company that can thrive at any point in the cycle. We consolidate high quality properties in the Permian Basin and have an exceptional track record of profitably growing production, reserves and resorts. And while the past year has been challenging, we view the macro environment as an opportunity to extend our lead in the Permian and make our business stronger by focusing on how we can control and strategically consolidating acreage on our core areas. 
We believe this approach enables Concho to deliver on our near-term objectives, while providing our shareholders with a solid investment for long-term value creation. 
From both an operational and a financial perspective, Concho delivered exceptional results for 2015, demonstrating the quality of our team and assets. As oil price continue to its volatile and protracted decline, we reduced capital spending from an initial budget of $3 billion to $2 billion, and we expected annual production growth to be less than 20%. 
We ended up delivering more with less. Daily production volumes for 2015 increased 28%, with crude oil growing by 31%, while exploration and development capital totaled only $1.8 billion for the year. 
The results of our 2015 program highlight our improved capital efficiency, driven by lower service cost, shorter cycle times, long laterals and completion intensity. 
I'm proud of how well our operational teams performed given all the moving parts. Their focus drove better well performance across all our assets and resulted in per unit cost that were in line or below the low end of our guidance range. 
Proved reserves held steady despite the 50% decline in SEC prices used to calculate crude reserves. And we replaced 290% of production at a drillbit finding cost of $11.66 per barrel. We've been focused on the Permian for a long time. It's a resource rich basin and our teams generate more economic drilling opportunities on our assets each year. 
Over the past 2 years, our drilling program has unlocked more resource as we convert vertical drilling locations to horizontal locations, derisk multizone potential and successfully test denser well spacing. 
In total, the captured resource for the company increased by 35% during 2015 to 25 billion Boes, including proved reserves. And we've identified approximately 18,000 horizontal drilling locations. 
Approximately 30% of these locations are in 20% or greater rate of return at a flat $40 oil price. This is a function of moving down the cost curve, refining our drilling and completion techniques and improving well performance. 
Given our focus on in the best assets and development efforts, each of our core areas contributed to expanding our resource potential. In the Northern Delaware Basin, results from our drilling program, optimizing completion techniques and downspacing increased our inventory. 
They also made significant progress in the Southern Delaware Basin and in the Midland Basin. In both areas, field infrastructure improved our economics. And in the Southern Delaware, we derisking the play combined with acreage trades and acquisitions, expanded our long lateral drilling inventory, increased our confidence in the growth potential of this asset.
Our enthusiasm for the New Mexico Shelf has not Horizontal results through past expectations. These low-cost, shallow opportunities have some of the best economics in our portfolio. And while we have success defining and expanding our resource space, we're drilling at a slower space. 
We reduced our activity level over the course of 2015, such that our cash flow exceeded drilling and completion capital by approximately $225 million in the second half of the year. The capital activity aligned with the lower commodity price environment,  a premier asset base, a robust hedge position and a strong balance sheet, we're approaching 2016 with confidence that we can continue to take advantage of the current environment. 
And a strategy we've executed in the second half of '15 is what you're going to see from us in 2016 as low commodity prices continue to demand capital discipline and patience. 
We believe oil prices will ultimately move higher, but for now, we remain committed to a plan of balancing our entire capital spend, excluding potential acquisitions within estimated cash flow. 
This is a strategy that's been successful for Concho. They will maintain our financial strength and preserve our high-quality inventory through this down cycle. 
We've lowered our 2016 capital plan from a base budget of $1.4 billion to a range of $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion. The current capital plan for 2016 represents a 35% reduction compared to 2015. Our production outlook for 2016 is driven by timing and transitioning to forefeel development. The last 2 years we've grown production at a compound rate of 25% annually. 
In the second half of '15, we significantly reduced operating activity and will again reduce activity in 2016. 
Importantly, over the past 2 years, our drilling program successfully defined multizone potential broadly across our operating areas, resulting in substantial resource discovery. 
As we look to further increase the efficiency of our ongoing development program, a substantial portion of our 2016 program will utilize pad bad drilling and long lateral development. 
The combined effect of the exceptional growth over the past 2 years, followed by a slowdown in activity and transition to pad drilling have a more pronounced impact on -- in 2016, but we'll continue to demonstrate our ability to deliver capital efficient growth over the long term. 
Based on the current market outlook for commodity prices and continuing to spend within cash flow, we expect to deliver double-digit production growth in 2017. 
Let me say that again. Based on the current market outlook for commodity prices and continuing to spend within cash flow, we expect to deliver double-digit production growth in 2017. 
Importantly, our plan is flexible, and we're keeping both hands on the steering wheel as we navigate the volatility. 
We have a strong track record of delivering growth and by staying committed to a strong balance sheet and preserving our inventory rather than growing volumes and depleting our resource in a weak prize environment. 
We will be uniquely positioned to grow when conditions improve high-quality assets in the Permian is a key component of our strategy. 
Given the capital chase and acreage in the Permian, property values remained high, but our acquisition efforts in 2015 were disciplined, targeted and privately negotiated. 
We acquired interest in bolt-on acreage to our core areas. These acquisitions expanded our long lateral drilling inventory and enhanced the overall value of our portfolio. 
Our operational expertise in the Permian is a technical advantage when evaluating the acquisitions. We coupled this expertise with discipline. We're looking to consolidate the right assets at the right price at the right time. 
Our team evaluated a lot of opportunities and demonstrated their ability to move on the best deals with the most positive strategic impact. 
We have a deep inventory of drilling projects. At today's drilling pace and current environment, we have more than 2 decades of inventory that generate competitive rates of return and growth. 
The depth and quality of our inventory sets a high bar for future acquisitions. The opportunities we evaluate have to compete with the best projects in our portfolio. 
Our recently announced transactions achieved this objective. The acreage trade and asset acquisition  coupled with the asset sale in Loving County out drilling program, increased our exposure to the best part of the Southern Delaware Basin, while also strengthening our balance sheet. 
Having a strong balance sheet is a key component of our strategy, which continues to serve as well. Recently, our debt ratings were reaffirmed at both S&P and Moody's. I'm also proud to report that Concho is added to the S&P 500 last Friday. 
Concho's addition to the S&P 500 is a testament to the hard work and dedication of our team. Together, we've grown Concho into a leading ENP company, operating in one of the most prolific oil basins in the world. Despite the uncertain backdrop, our strategy and our team enabled Concho to thrive. 
We've demonstrated our ability to rapidly grow production. We have a great asset base and a great machine. Commodity price environment is uncertain, but we believe we can continue to build value through the cycle by keeping a strong balance sheet, prudently investing in the business and staying discipline in order to take advantage of unique opportunities. 
I appreciate your continued confidence in Concho. Now let me turn the call back over to the moderator, I'll look forward to your questions."

The backdrop we find ourselves in is volatile and dynamic, but the Concho",1459,"Good morning. Thanks, again, for joining us on this busy morning. By now you've heard many metaphors describing the commodity price environment from choppy waters to rough terrain. The backdrop we find ourselves in is volatile and dynamic, but the Concho team has experience succeeding when prices are low.
We're building a company that can thrive at any point in the cycle. We consolidate high-quality properties in the Permian Basin and have an exceptional track record of profitably growing production, reserves and resource. And while the past year has been challenging, we view the macro environment as an opportunity to extend our lead in the Permian and make our business stronger by focusing on what we can control and strategically consolidating acreage in our core areas. We believe this approach enables Concho to deliver on our near-term objectives, while providing our shareholders with a solid investment for long-term value creation.
From both an operational and a financial perspective, Concho delivered exceptional results for 2015, demonstrating the quality of our team and assets. As the oil price continued its volatile and protracted decline, we reduced capital spending from an initial budget of $3 billion to $2 billion, and we expected annual production growth to be less than 20%. We ended up delivering more with less. Daily production volumes for 2015 increased 28%, with crude oil growing by 31%, while exploration and development capital totaled only $1.8 billion for the year.
The results of our 2015 program highlight our improved capital efficiency, driven by lower service cost, shorter cycle times, long laterals and completion intensity.
I'm proud of how well our operational teams performed given all the moving parts. Their focus drove better well performance across all our assets and resulted in per unit cost that were in line or below the low end of our guidance range.
Proved reserves held steady despite the 50% decline in SEC prices used to calculate proved reserves. And we replaced 290% of production at a drill bit finding cost of $11.66 per barrel. We've been focused on the Permian for a long time. It's a resource-rich basin and our teams generate more economic drilling opportunities on our assets each year.
Over the past 2 years, our drilling program has unlocked more resource as we convert vertical drilling locations to horizontal locations, derisk multizone potential and successfully test denser well spacing.
In total, the captured resource for the company increased by 35% during 2015 to 5 billion Boes, including proved reserves. And we've identified approximately 18,000 horizontal drilling locations. Approximately 30% of these locations earn a 20% or greater rate of return at a flat $40 oil price. This is a function of moving down the cost curve, refining our drilling and completion techniques and improving well performance.
Given our focus on acquiring the best assets and development efforts, each of our core areas contributed to expanding our resource potential. In the Northern Delaware Basin, results from our drilling program, optimizing completion techniques and downspacing increased our inventory.
We also made significant progress in the Southern Delaware Basin and in the Midland Basin. In both areas, field infrastructure improved our economics. And in the Southern Delaware, derisking the play, combined with acreage trades and acquisitions, expanded our long lateral drilling inventory and increased our confidence in the growth potential of this asset.
Our enthusiasm for the New Mexico Shelf hasn't waned. Horizontal results surpassed expectations. These low cost, shallow opportunities have some of the best economics in our portfolio. And while we've had success at defining and expanding our resource base, we're drilling at a slower pace.
We reduced our activity level over the course of 2015, such that our cash flow exceeded drilling and uncompleted capital by approximately $225 million in the second half of the year. With capital activity aligned with the lower commodity price environment, a premier asset base, a robust hedge position and a strong balance sheet, we're approaching 2016 with confidence that we can continue to take advantage of the current environment.
And a strategy we've executed in the second half of '15 is what you're going to see from us in 2016 as low commodity prices continue to demand capital discipline and patience.
We believe oil prices will ultimately move higher, but for now, we remain committed to a plan of balancing our entire capital spend, excluding potential acquisitions, within estimated cash flow. This is a strategy that's been successful for Concho. It will maintain our financial strength and preserve our high-quality inventory through this down cycle.
We've lowered our 2016 capital plan from a base budget of $1.4 billion to a range of $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion. The current capital plan for 2016 represents a 35% reduction compared to 2015. Our production outlook for 2016 is driven by timing and transitioning to full field development.
The last 2 years, we've grown production at a compound rate of 25% annually. In the second half of '15, we significantly reduced operating activity and will again reduce activity in 2016. Importantly, over the past 2 years, our drilling program successfully defined multizone potential broadly across our operating areas, resulting in substantial resource discovery.
As we look to further increase the efficiency of our ongoing development program, a substantial portion of our 2016 program will utilize pad drilling and long lateral development.
The combined effect of exceptional growth over the past 2 years, followed by a slowdown in activity and transition to pad drilling will have a more pronounced impact on 2000 -- in 2016, but we'll continue to demonstrate our ability to deliver capital-efficient growth over the long term.
Based on the current market outlook for commodity prices and continuing to spend within cash flow, we expect to deliver double-digit production growth in 2017.
Let me say that again. Based on the current market outlook for commodity prices and continuing to spend within cash flow, we expect to deliver double-digit production growth in 2017.
Importantly, our plan is flexible, and we're keeping both hands on the steering wheel as we navigate the volatility.
We have a strong track record of delivering growth and by staying committed to a strong balance sheet and preserving our inventory rather than growing volumes and depleting our resource in a weak price environment, we will be uniquely positioned to grow when conditions improve.
Acquiring high-quality assets in the Permian is a key component of our strategy. Given the capital chasing acreage in the Permian, property values remain high, but our acquisition efforts in 2015 were disciplined, targeted and privately negotiated. We acquired interest in bolt-on acreage to our core areas. These acquisitions expanded our long lateral drilling inventory and enhanced the overall value of our portfolio.
Our operational expertise in the Permian is a technical advantage when evaluating acquisitions. We couple this expertise with discipline. We're looking to consolidate the right assets at the right price at the right time.
Our team evaluated a lot of opportunities and demonstrated their ability to move on the best deals with the most positive strategic impact.
We have a deep inventory of drilling projects. At today's drilling pace and current environment, we have more than 2 decades of inventory that generate competitive rates of return and growth.
The depth and quality of our inventory sets a high bar for future acquisitions. The opportunities we evaluate have to compete with the best projects in our portfolio.
Our recently announced transactions achieved this objective. The acreage trade and asset acquisition, coupled with the asset sale in Loving County, high graded our drilling program, increased our exposure to the best part of the Southern Delaware Basin, while also strengthening our balance sheet.
Having a strong balance sheet is a key component of our strategy, which continues to serve us well. Recently, our debt ratings were reaffirmed at both S&P and Moody's.
I'm also proud to report that Concho was added to the S&P 500 last Friday. Concho's addition to the S&P 500 is a testament to the hard work and dedication of our team. Together, we've grown Concho into a leading E&P company, operating in one of the most prolific oil basins in the world. Despite the uncertain backdrop, our strategy and our team enable Concho to thrive. We've demonstrated our ability to rapidly grow production. We have a great asset base and a great machine.
The commodity price environment is uncertain, but we believe we can continue to build value through the cycle by keeping a strong balance sheet, prudently investing in the business and staying disciplined in order to take advantage of unique opportunities.
I appreciate your continued confidence in Concho. Now let me turn the call back over to the moderator, and I look forward to your questions."

And then as far as the rest of the timing of the year, one thing I want to make sure everybody understands is the impact of the slowdown in the second half of '15 and how that impact then affects the overall production for 2016 and then going into '17. Because we really are gaining capital efficiencies and have gained them through the last half of '15 and is really driving a capital-efficient process right now. We're not projecting any additional capital efficiencies going through '16 into '17, but based on the way conditions are today, you're going to see kind of a flattening of production throughout 2016, but then the base economics take over again and we start growing again in 2017 and beyond."

The backdrop we find ourselves in is volatile and dynamic, but the Concho",1457,"Good morning. Thanks, again, for joining us on this busy morning. By now you've heard many metaphors describing the commodity price environment from choppy waters to rough terrain. The backdrop we find ourselves in is volatile and dynamic, but the Concho team has experience succeeding when prices are low.
We're building a company that can thrive at any point in the cycle. We consolidate high-quality properties in the Permian Basin and have an exceptional track record of profitably growing production, reserves and resource. And while the past year has been challenging, we view the macro environment as an opportunity to extend our lead in the Permian and make our business stronger by focusing on what we can control and strategically consolidating acreage in our core areas. We believe this approach enables Concho to deliver on our near-term objectives, while providing our shareholders with a solid investment for long-term value creation.
From both an operational and a financial perspective, Concho delivered exceptional results for 2015, demonstrating the quality of our team and assets. As the oil price continued its volatile and protracted decline, we reduced capital spending from an initial budget of $3 billion to $2 billion, and we expected annual production growth to be less than 20%. We ended up delivering more with less. Daily production volumes for 2015 increased 28%, with crude oil growing by 31%, while exploration and development capital totaled only $1.8 billion for the year.
The results of our 2015 program highlight our improved capital efficiency, driven by lower service cost, shorter cycle times, long laterals and completion intensity.
I'm proud of how well our operational teams performed given all the moving parts. Their focus drove better well performance across all our assets and resulted in per-unit cost that were in line or below the low end of our guidance range.
Proved reserves held steady despite the 50% decline in SEC prices used to calculate proved reserves. And we replaced 290% of production at a drill bit finding cost of $11.66 per barrel. We've been focused on the Permian for a long time. It's a resource-rich basin, and our teams generate more economic drilling opportunities on our assets each year.
Over the past 2 years, our drilling program has unlocked more resource as we convert vertical drilling locations to horizontal locations, derisk multizone potential and successfully test denser well spacing.
In total, the captured resource for the company increased by 35% during 2015 to 5 billion Boes, including proved reserves. And we've identified approximately 18,000 horizontal drilling locations. Approximately 30% of these locations earn a 20% or greater rate of return at a flat $40 oil price. This is a function of moving down the cost curve, refining our drilling and completion techniques and improving well performance.
Given our focus on acquiring the best assets and development efforts, each of our core areas contributed to expanding our resource potential. In the Northern Delaware Basin, results from our drilling program, optimizing completion techniques and downspacing increased our inventory.
We also made significant progress in the Southern Delaware Basin and in the Midland Basin. In both areas, field infrastructure improved our economics. And in the Southern Delaware, derisking the play, combined with acreage trades and acquisitions, expanded our long lateral drilling inventory and increased our confidence in the growth potential of this asset.
Our enthusiasm for the New Mexico Shelf hasn't waned. Horizontal results surpassed expectations. These low-cost, shallow opportunities have some of the best economics in our portfolio. And while we've had success at defining and expanding our resource base, we're drilling at a slower pace.
We reduced our activity level over the course of 2015 such that our cash flow exceeded drilling and completion capital by approximately $225 million in the second half of the year. With capital activity aligned with the lower commodity price environment, a premier asset base, a robust hedge position and a strong balance sheet, we're approaching 2016 with confidence that we can continue to take advantage of the current environment.
And the strategy we've executed in the second half of '15 is what you're going to see from us in 2016, as low commodity prices continue to demand capital discipline and patience.
We believe oil prices will ultimately move higher, but for now, we remain committed to a plan of balancing our entire capital spend, excluding potential acquisitions, within estimated cash flow. This is a strategy that's been successful for Concho. It will maintain our financial strength and preserve our high-quality inventory through this down cycle.
We've lowered our 2016 capital plan from a base budget of $1.4 billion to a range of $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion. The current capital plan for 2016 represents a 35% reduction compared to 2015. Our production outlook for 2016 is driven by timing and transitioning to full field development.
The last 2 years we've grown production at a compound rate of 25% annually. In the second half of '15, we significantly reduced operating activity and will again reduce activity in 2016. Importantly, over the past 2 years, our drilling program successfully defined multizone potential broadly across our operating areas, resulting in substantial resource discovery.
As we look to further increase the efficiency of our ongoing development program, a substantial portion of our 2016 program will utilize pad drilling and long lateral development.
The combined effect of exceptional growth over the past 2 years followed by a slowdown in activity and transition to pad drilling will have a more pronounced impact on 2000 -- in 2016, but we'll continue to demonstrate our ability to deliver capital-efficient growth over the long term.
Based on the current market outlook for commodity prices and continuing to spend within cash flow, we expect to deliver double-digit production growth in 2017.
Let me say that again. Based on the current market outlook for commodity prices and continuing to spend within cash flow, we expect to deliver double-digit production growth in 2017.
Importantly, our plan is flexible, and we're keeping both hands on the steering wheel as we navigate the volatility.
We have a strong track record of delivering growth, and by staying committed to a strong balance sheet and preserving our inventory rather than growing volumes and depleting our resource in a weak price environment, we will be uniquely positioned to grow when conditions improve.
Acquiring high-quality assets in the Permian is a key component of our strategy. Given the capital chasing acreage in the Permian, property values remain high; but our acquisition efforts in 2015 were disciplined, targeted and privately negotiated. We acquired interest and bolt-on acreage to our core areas. These acquisitions expanded our long lateral drilling inventory and enhanced the overall value of our portfolio.
Our operational expertise in the Permian is a technical advantage when evaluating acquisitions. We couple this expertise with discipline. We're looking to consolidate the right assets at the right price at the right time.
Our team evaluated a lot of opportunities and demonstrated their ability to move on the best deals with the most positive strategic impact.
We have a deep inventory of drilling projects. At today's drilling pace and current environment, we have more than 2 decades of inventory that generate competitive rates of return and growth.
The depth and quality of our inventory sets a high bar for future acquisitions. The opportunities we evaluate have to compete with the best projects in our portfolio.
Our recently announced transactions achieved this objective. The acreage trade and asset acquisition, coupled with the asset sale in Loving County, high graded our drilling program, increased our exposure to the best part of the Southern Delaware Basin, while also strengthening our balance sheet.
Having a strong balance sheet is a key component of our strategy, which continues to serve us well. Recently, our debt ratings were reaffirmed at both S&P and Moody's.
I'm also proud to report that Concho was added to the S&P 500 last Friday. Concho's addition to the S&P 500 is a testament to the hard work and dedication of our team. Together, we've grown Concho into a leading E&P company, operating in one of the most prolific oil basins in the world. Despite the uncertain backdrop, our strategy and our team enable Concho to thrive. We've demonstrated our ability to rapidly grow production. We have a great asset base and a great machine.
The commodity price environment is uncertain, but we believe we can continue to build value through the cycle by keeping a strong balance sheet, prudently investing in the business and staying disciplined in order to take advantage of unique opportunities.
I appreciate your continued confidence in Concho. Now let me turn the call back over to the moderator, and I look forward to your questions."

Thanks for joining us on this busy morning. Before I begin the first quarter results, I want to talk about the current business environment for our industry.We're operating in one of the toughest commodity price cycles we've experienced in",1294,"Good morning. Thanks for joining us on this busy morning. Before I begin the first quarter results, I want to talk about the current business environment for our industry.
We're operating in one of the toughest commodity price cycles we've experienced in the past 30 years. We responded with deep cost to capital budgets. The U.S. rig count is in all-time low since we began keeping records. Meanwhile, the industry's leverage is at historic highs. Lower 48 oil productions is set decline by nearly 1 million barrels per day in 2016, according to EIA's current estimate.
Thinking about what's happened in our industry over the past 2 years. Underinvestment and overstretched balance sheets, mixed with a growing global population, a decline in U.S. oil production and a service sector that's been cut to the bone. The long-term implications to the balance of supply and demand mean more volatility, not less. Amid the volatility, we're focused on aggressively managing the things we can control. Concho delivered another strong quarter and the contrast between the current environment and our results for the first quarter demonstrate our flexibility to respond to lower oil prices, protect our balance sheet, just in operating momentum.
Results this quarter also reflect our high-quality drilling inventory in the Permian Basin, which sits at the low end of the cost curves and continues to be one of the best basis for driving capital efficient growth and creating value for our shareholders. Our robust hedge position provides stability around our cash flows and combined with our strong portfolio, we're well-positioned to keep moving forward, investing in our assets and driving gains and productivity efficiency. And while commodity prices have moved higher recently, we remain committed to a disciplined returns base capital program while spending within cash flow.
Now let me summarize some of the key achievements in the first quarter. Quarterly production increased 6%[ph] year-over-year and exceeded our guidance range. Operating performance this quarter hide is the strength of our portfolio. Each core area is performing well. For full year 2016, we now expect production will be flat compared to 2015 and our capital plans unchanged.
We continue to make progress on our cost structure. Combined unit cost, LOE and G&A were down 9% year-over-year. And importantly, we've reduced our full year outlook for LOE. Cost controls are a priority and set in the right direction. In addition, the Alpha Crude Connector system in New Mexico is improving our oil price realization in the northern Delaware Basin. As a result, guidance range for the pre-hedged oil differentials has improved.
For the third consecutive quarter, we understand operating cash flow, which excludes A&D. Spending within our means fortifies our balance sheet, and it's with this discipline that we find ourselves in a path to emerge stronger when the cycle started.
Also during the first quarter we closed 2 transactions. The previously announced transactions include an acquisition of 12,000 net 2008 acres adjacent to our core North Harpoon prospect in the Southern Delaware for combined combination of equity, cash and drilling carry and the sale of 14,000 net acres in [indiscernible] County for cash proceeds. The net impact of these transactions added cash to the balance sheet, high graded our inventory and improved our returns base capital allocation program by freeing up capital to develop higher return properties.
Our strong balance sheet's a key advantage during periods of volatility. At quarter end, we had $0.5 billion of cash on our balance sheet and a net debt-to-EBITDAX ratio of 1.7x. We have substantial liquidity of $3 billion and our credit facility is undrawn. The total commitment level is $2.5 billion, which was recently reaffirmed by our lender group.
Turning now to our capital plan for 2016. Our plan to spend within cash flow remains unchanged and the capital guidance is still a range of $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion. And I don't have the say that our production's going to be down anymore because now we expect 2016 production to be just as robust as 2015. Our average expected rig count for the year is approximately 14. As we mentioned before during 2016, we plan to direct more capital to the Midland Basin, where consisting pretty strong-willed results and good returns across several zones support our development plans.
Drilling more wells enhances our operational scale, expands our opportunity to test new ideas and accelerate development efficiencies. Our commitment to capital discipline is evident. The first quarter of 2016 represents the third consecutive quarter where cash flow exceeded our drilling expenditures. Since our rig count peak in late 2014, development capital has been reduced 70%. Meanwhile production has grown 12% over that same time period and cash operating expenses are lower.
Lower commodity prices great opportunities for Concho. We're actively managing our portfolio by consolidating core acreage and selling lower rate of return assets. The acquisition of 12,000 net acres in the Southern Delaware Basin brings us new drilling locations that moved to the front of the inventory line. We closed this transaction in late March and shifted 2 rigs on to on these properties in April. Acquisitions for assets like these are very competitive. The seller picked Concho as a partner based on our execution strength, and we liked this asset because they increase our exposure to the best part of the southern Delaware Basin and add long lateral drilling locations.
We continue to see good consolidation opportunities to around our core areas. While we possess the financial and operational firepower to move quickly, we will remain disciplined with our acquisition strategy. The acquisitions we evaluate must compete with the best projects in our portfolio and strengthen our financial position. And we're willing to sell assets to high grade our portfolio and to fund transactions.
And importantly, our leverage ratio remains unchanged since late 2014 with $0.5 billion of cash on the balance sheet. This is a direct result of our fundamental strategy to focus on our asset quality, program returns, balance sheet and our team.
The most impactful later that we can affect the value of Concho is by becoming even more efficient. And we're focused on improving the productivity of each capital dollar invested. 2016 is an inflection point for capital efficiency. During the year, our average lateral length will increase by approximately 35% year-over-year and more than 50% of our operated drill wells will be on multi-well pad sites. We continue to optimize well results and returns by fine-tuning completion design for each core area and zone we're drilling. This inflection and capital efficiency also creates an inflection in production, which is demonstrated by our ability to hold production that from an all-time high in 2015 and it allows us to confidently project double-digit production growth in 2017 within cash flow.
This outlook remains unchanged. The strength of our machine is demonstrated by our longer-term view that at current strip pricing, we're capable of delivering differentiated annual production growth while continuing to spend within our cash flow, run a steady rig program and maintain a leverage ratio at/or below 2x.
We're working hard to deliver on our near-term objectives and position the company for your future. Our technical expertise and team facilitate the spread of innovation across our assets. We're uniquely positioned with 4 core areas to compete for capital within the Permian, which is the most robust and cost-efficient basin in North America. We are focused on making smart capital allocation decisions and keeping a strong financial position. The outlook for oil prices remains uncertain, but we've never been in a better position to deliver strong, profitable growth. This is our opportunity to extend our lead.

Thanks for joining us on this busy morning. Before I begin the first quarter results, I want to talk about the current business environment for our industry.We're operating in one of the toughest commodity price cycles we've experienced in",1300,"Good morning. Thanks for joining us on this busy morning. Before I begin the first quarter results, I want to talk about the current business environment for our industry.
We're operating in one of the toughest commodity price cycles we've experienced in the past 30 years. We responded with deep cuts to capital budgets. The U.S. rig count is in all-time low since we began keeping records. Meanwhile, the industry's leverage is at historic highs. Lower 48 oil production is set to decline by nearly 1 million barrels per day in 2016, according to EIA's current estimate.
Thinking about what's happened in our industry over the past 2 years, underinvestment and overstretched balance sheets, mixed with a growing global population, a decline in U.S. oil production and a service sector that's been cut to the bone. The long-term implications to the balance of supply and demand mean more volatility, not less. Amid the volatility, we're focused on aggressively managing the things we can control. Concho delivered another strong quarter and the contrast between the current environment and our results for the first quarter demonstrate our flexibility to respond to lower oil prices, protect our balance sheet, and sustain operating momentum.
Results this quarter also reflect our high-quality drilling inventory in the Permian Basin, which sits at the low end of the cost curve and continues to be one of the best basins for driving capital efficient growth and creating value for our shareholders. Our robust hedge position provides stability around our cash flows and combined with our strong portfolio, we're well-positioned to keep moving forward, investing in our assets and driving gains and productivity and efficiency. And while commodity prices have moved higher recently, we remain committed to a disciplined returns base capital program while spending within cash flow.
Now let me summarize some of the key achievements in the first quarter. Quarterly production increased 6% year-over-year and exceeded our guidance range. Our operating performance this quarter highlights the strength of our portfolio. Each core area is performing well. For full year 2016, we now expect production will be flat compared to 2015 and our capital plans unchanged.
We continue to make progress on our cost structure, combined unit cost, LOE and G&A were down 9% year-over-year. And importantly, we've reduced our full year outlook for LOE. Cost controls are a priority and they're set in the right direction. In addition, the Alpha Crude Connector system in New Mexico is improving our oil price realizations in the northern Delaware Basin. As a result, the guidance range for the pre-hedged oil differentials has improved.
For the third consecutive quarter, we understand operating cash flow, which excludes A&D. Spending within our means fortifies our balance sheet, and it's with this discipline that we find ourselves on a path to emerge stronger than when the cycle started.
Also during the first quarter we closed 2 transactions. The previously announced transactions include an acquisition of 12,000 net acres adjacent to our core North Harpoon prospect in the southern Delaware for a combined combination of equity, cash and drilling carry and the sale of 14,000 net acres in Loving County for cash proceeds. The net impact of these transactions added cash to the balance sheet, high graded our inventory and improved our returns base capital allocation program by freeing up capital to develop higher return properties.
Our strong balance sheet is a key advantage during periods of volatility. At quarter end, we had $0.5 billion of cash on our balance sheet and a net debt-to-EBITDAX ratio of 1.7x. We have substantial liquidity of $3 billion and our credit facility is undrawn. The total commitment level is $2.5 billion, which was recently reaffirmed by our lender group.
Turning now to our capital plan for 2016. Our plan to spend within cash flow remains unchanged and the capital guidance is still a range of $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion. And I don't have to say that our production is going to be down anymore because now we expect 2016 production to be just as robust as 2015. Our average expected rig count for the year is approximately 14. As we mentioned before during 2016, we plan to direct more capital to the Midland Basin, were consistently strong well results and good returns across several zones support our development plans.
Drilling more wells enhances our operational scale, expands our opportunity to test new ideas and accelerates development efficiencies. Our commitment to capital discipline is evident. The first quarter of 2016 represents the third consecutive quarter where cash flow exceeded our drilling expenditures. Since our rig count peaked in late 2014, development capital has been reduced 70%. Meanwhile production has grown 12% over that same time period and cash operating expenses are lower.
Lower commodity prices is great opportunities for Concho. We're actively managing our portfolio by consolidating core acreage and selling lower rate of return assets. The acquisition of 12,000 net acres in the southern Delaware Basin brings us new drilling locations that moved to the front of the inventory line. We closed this transaction in late March and shifted 2 rigs on to these properties in April. Acquisitions for assets like these are very competitive. The seller picked Concho as a partner based on our execution strength, and we like these asset because they increase our exposure to the best part of the southern Delaware Basin and add long lateral drilling locations.
We continue to see good consolidation opportunities around our core areas. While we possess the financial and operational firepower to move quickly, we will remain disciplined with our acquisition strategy. The acquisitions we evaluate must compete with the best projects in our portfolio and strengthen our financial position. And we're willing to sell assets to high grade our portfolio and to fund transactions.
And importantly, our leverage ratio remains unchanged since late 2014 with $0.5 billion of cash on the balance sheet. This is a direct result of our fundamental strategy to focus on our asset quality, program returns, balance sheet and our team.
The most impactful way that we can affect the value of Concho is by becoming even more efficient. And we're focused on improving the productivity of each capital dollar invested. 2016 is an inflection point for capital efficiency. During the year, our average lateral length will increase by approximately 35% year-over-year and more than 50% of our operated drill wells will be on multi-well pad sites. We continue to optimize well results and returns by fine-tuning completion design for each core area and zone we're drilling. This inflection and capital efficiency also creates an inflection in production, which is demonstrated by our ability to hold production flat from an all-time high in 2015 and it allows us to confidently project double-digit production growth in 2017 within cash flow.
This outlook remains unchanged. The strength of our machine is demonstrated by our longer-term view that at current strip pricing, we're capable of delivering differentiated annual production growth while continuing to spend within our cash flow, run a steady rig program and maintain a leverage ratio at/or below 2x.
We're working hard to deliver on our near-term objectives and position the company for the future. Our technical expertise and team facilitate the spread of innovation across our assets. We're uniquely positioned with 4 core areas to compete for capital within the Permian, which is the most robust and cost-efficient basin in North America. We are focused on making smart capital allocation decisions and keeping a strong financial position. The outlook for oil prices remains uncertain, but we've never been in a better position to deliver strong, profitable growth. This is our opportunity to extend our lead.

It's just been -- it kind of -- with all of our Delaware activity and everything we're doing in New Mexico, of that really good Midland Basin stuff just kind of got lost in the bigger picture. But I think we've got some of the best Midland Basin acreage that there is. Our well results compare with anything that anybody else is turning out in the Midland Basin. And we now have completed the hidden play so that you can run a multi-rig pad drilling development kind of program. So we're ready to devote more capital there. When we come out of this cycle and things start growing rapidly again, I think it would be good for Concho to have multiple growth drivers. The last time we came through this growth cycle, the growth of the company was really driven by the northern Delaware Basin. I think next time, we'll have multiple growth drivers. I think there will be a better more diversified company."

Thanks for joining us on this busy morning. Before we get into first quarter results, I want to talk about the current business environment for our industry.We're operating in one of the toughest commodity price cycles we've experienced in",1297,"Good morning. Thanks for joining us on this busy morning. Before we get into first quarter results, I want to talk about the current business environment for our industry.
We're operating in one of the toughest commodity price cycles we've experienced in the past 30 years. We've responded with deep cuts to capital budgets. The U.S. rig count is in all-time low since we began keeping records. Meanwhile, the industry's leverage is at historic highs. Lower 48 oil production is set to decline by nearly 1 million barrels per day in 2016, according to EIA's current estimate.
Think about what's happened in our industry over the past 2 years, underinvestment and overstretched balance sheets, mixed with a growing global population, a decline in U.S. oil production and a service sector that's been cut to the bone. The long-term implications to the balance of supply and demand mean more volatility, not less. Amid the volatility, we're focused on aggressively managing the things we can control. Concho delivered another strong quarter and the contrast between the current environment and our results for the first quarter demonstrate our flexibility to respond to low oil prices, protect our balance sheet, and sustain operating momentum.
Results this quarter also reflect our high-quality drilling inventory in the Permian Basin, which sits at the low end of the cost curve and continues to be one of the best basins for driving capital efficient growth and creating value for our shareholders. Our robust hedge position provides stability around our cash flows and combined with our strong portfolio, we're well-positioned to keep moving forward, investing in our assets and driving gains and productivity and efficiency. And while commodity prices have moved higher recently, we remain committed to a disciplined returns base capital program while spending within cash flow.
Now let me summarize some of the key achievements in the first quarter. Quarterly production increased 6% year-over-year and exceeded our guidance range. Our operating performance this quarter highlights the strength of our portfolio. Each core area is performing well. For full year 2016, we now expect production will be flat compared to 2015 and our capital plans unchanged.
We continue to make progress on our cost structure, combined unit cost, LOE and G&A were down 9% year-over-year. And importantly, we reduced our full year outlook for LOE. Cost control's a priority and it's headed in the right direction. In addition, the Alpha Crude Connector system in New Mexico is improving our oil price realizations in the northern Delaware Basin. As a result, the guidance range for the pre-hedge oil differentials has improved.
For the third consecutive quarter, we under spent operating cash flow, which excludes A&D. Spending within our means fortifies the balance sheet, and it's with this discipline that we find ourselves on a path to emerge stronger than when the cycle started.
Also during the first quarter we closed 2 transactions. The previously announced transactions include an acquisition of 12,000 net acres adjacent to our core North Harpoon prospect in the southern Delaware for a combination of equity, cash and drilling carry and the sale of 14,000 net acres in Loving County for cash proceeds. The net impact of these transactions added cash to the balance sheet, high graded our inventory and improved our returns base capital allocation program by freeing up capital to develop higher return properties.
Our strong balance sheet is a key advantage during periods of volatility. At quarter end, we had $0.5 billion of cash on our balance sheet and a net debt-to-EBITDAX ratio of 1.7x. We have substantial liquidity of $3 billion and our credit facility is undrawn. The total commitment level is $2.5 billion, which was recently reaffirmed by our lender group.
Turning now to our capital plan for 2016. Our plan to spend within cash flow remains unchanged and the capital guidance is still a range of $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion. And I don't have to say that our production is going to be down anymore because now we expect 2016 production to be just as robust as 2015. Our average expected rig count for the year is approximately 14. As we mentioned before, during 2016 we plan to direct more capital to the Midland Basin, were consistently strong well results and good returns across several zones support our development plans.
Drilling more wells enhances our operational scale, expands our opportunity to test new ideas and accelerates development efficiencies. Our commitment to capital discipline is evident. The first quarter of 2016 represents the third consecutive quarter where cash flow exceeded our drilling expenditures. Since our rig count peaked in late 2014, development capital has been reduced 70%. Meanwhile production's grown 12% over that same time period and cash operating expenses are lower.
Lower commodity prices create opportunities for Concho. We're actively managing our portfolio by consolidating core acreage and selling lower rate of return assets. The acquisition of 12,000 net acres in the southern Delaware Basin brings us new drilling locations that moved to the front of the inventory line. We closed this transaction in late March and shifted 2 rigs on to these properties in April. Acquisitions for assets like these are very competitive. The seller picked Concho as a partner based on our execution strength, and we like these asset because they increase our exposure to the best part of the southern Delaware Basin and add long lateral drilling locations.
We continue to see good consolidation opportunities around our core areas. While we possess the financial and operational firepower to move quickly, we will remain disciplined with our acquisition strategy. The acquisitions we evaluate must compete with the best projects in our portfolio and strengthen our financial position. And we're willing to sell assets to high grade our portfolio and to fund transactions.
And importantly, our leverage ratio remains unchanged since late 2014 with $0.5 billion of cash on the balance sheet. This is a direct result of our fundamental strategy to focus on our asset quality, program returns, balance sheet and our team.
The most impactful way that we can affect the value of Concho is by becoming even more efficient. And we're focused on improving the productivity of each capital dollar invested. 2016 is an inflection point for capital efficiency. During the year, our average lateral length will increase by approximately 35% year-over-year and more than 50% of our operated drill wells will be on multi-well pad sites. We continue to optimize well results and returns by fine-tuning completion design for each core area and zone we're drilling. This inflection and capital efficiency also creates an inflection in production, which is demonstrated by our ability to hold production flat from an all-time high in 2015 and it allows us to confidently project double-digit production growth in 2017 within cash flow.
This outlook remains unchanged. The strength of our machine is demonstrated by our longer-term view that at current strip pricing, we're capable of delivering differentiated annual production growth while continuing to spend within our cash flow, run a steady rig program and maintain a leverage ratio at/or below 2x.
We're working hard to deliver on our near-term objectives and position the company for the future. Our technical expertise and team facilitate the spread of innovation across our assets. We're uniquely positioned with 4 core areas to compete for capital within the Permian, which is the most robust and cost-efficient basin in North America. We are focused on making smart capital allocation decisions and keeping a strong financial position. The outlook for oil prices remains uncertain, but we've never been in a better position to deliver strong, profitable growth. This is our opportunity to extend our lead.

So I do think that in general, it will take the industry some time to respond to increased activity, but we need some increased activity just to get back to normal. So I think we have a lot of spare capacity right now and we're likely to have spare capacity for some time to come."

Thanks for joining us on this busy morning. Before we get into first quarter results, I want to talk about the current business environment for our industry.We're operating in one of the toughest commodity price cycles we've experienced in",1297,"Good morning. Thanks for joining us on this busy morning. Before we get into first quarter results, I want to talk about the current business environment for our industry.
We're operating in one of the toughest commodity price cycles we've experienced in the past 30 years. We've responded with deep cuts to capital budgets. The U.S. rig count is in all-time low since we began keeping records. Meanwhile, the industry's leverage is at historic highs. Lower 48 oil production is set to decline by nearly 1 million barrels per day in 2016, according to EIA's current estimate.
Think about what's happened in our industry over the past 2 years, underinvestment and overstretched balance sheets, mixed with a growing global population, a decline in U.S. oil production and a service sector that's been cut to the bone. The long-term implications to the balance of supply and demand mean more volatility, not less. Amid the volatility, we're focused on aggressively managing the things we can control. Concho delivered another strong quarter and the contrast between the current environment and our results for the first quarter demonstrate our flexibility to respond to low oil prices, protect our balance sheet, and sustain operating momentum.
Results this quarter also reflect our high-quality drilling inventory in the Permian Basin, which sits at the low end of the cost curve and continues to be one of the best basins for driving capital efficient growth and creating value for our shareholders. Our robust hedge position provides stability around our cash flows and combined with our strong portfolio, we're well-positioned to keep moving forward, investing in our assets and driving gains and productivity and efficiency. And while commodity prices have moved higher recently, we remain committed to a disciplined returns base capital program while spending within cash flow.
Now let me summarize some of the key achievements in the first quarter. Quarterly production increased 6% year-over-year and exceeded our guidance range. Our operating performance this quarter highlights the strength of our portfolio. Each core area is performing well. For full year 2016, we now expect production will be flat compared to 2015 and our capital plans unchanged.
We continue to make progress on our cost structure, combined unit cost, LOE and G&A were down 9% year-over-year. And importantly, we reduced our full year outlook for LOE. Cost control's a priority and it's headed in the right direction. In addition, the Alpha Crude Connector system in New Mexico is improving our oil price realizations in the northern Delaware Basin. As a result, the guidance range for the pre-hedge oil differentials has improved.
For the third consecutive quarter, we under spent operating cash flow, which excludes A&D. Spending within our means fortifies the balance sheet, and it's with this discipline that we find ourselves on a path to emerge stronger than when the cycle started.
Also during the first quarter we closed 2 transactions. The previously announced transactions include an acquisition of 12,000 net acres adjacent to our core North Harpoon prospect in the southern Delaware for a combination of equity, cash and drilling carry and the sale of 14,000 net acres in Loving County for cash proceeds. The net impact of these transactions added cash to the balance sheet, high graded our inventory and improved our returns base capital allocation program by freeing up capital to develop higher return properties.
Our strong balance sheet is a key advantage during periods of volatility. At quarter end, we had $0.5 billion of cash on our balance sheet and a net debt-to-EBITDAX ratio of 1.7x. We have substantial liquidity of $3 billion and our credit facility is undrawn. The total commitment level is $2.5 billion, which was recently reaffirmed by our lender group.
Turning now to our capital plan for 2016. Our plan to spend within cash flow remains unchanged and the capital guidance is still a range of $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion. And I don't have to say that our production is going to be down anymore because now we expect 2016 production to be just as robust as 2015. Our average expected rig count for the year is approximately 14. As we mentioned before, during 2016 we plan to direct more capital to the Midland Basin, were consistently strong well results and good returns across several zones support our development plans.
Drilling more wells enhances our operational scale, expands our opportunity to test new ideas and accelerates development efficiencies. Our commitment to capital discipline is evident. The first quarter of 2016 represents the third consecutive quarter where cash flow exceeded our drilling expenditures. Since our rig count peaked in late 2014, development capital has been reduced 70%. Meanwhile production's grown 12% over that same time period and cash operating expenses are lower.
Lower commodity prices create opportunities for Concho. We're actively managing our portfolio by consolidating core acreage and selling lower rate of return assets. The acquisition of 12,000 net acres in the southern Delaware Basin brings us new drilling locations that moved to the front of the inventory line. We closed this transaction in late March and shifted 2 rigs on to these properties in April. Acquisitions for assets like these are very competitive. The seller picked Concho as a partner based on our execution strength, and we like these asset because they increase our exposure to the best part of the southern Delaware Basin and add long lateral drilling locations.
We continue to see good consolidation opportunities around our core areas. While we possess the financial and operational firepower to move quickly, we will remain disciplined with our acquisition strategy. The acquisitions we evaluate must compete with the best projects in our portfolio and strengthen our financial position. And we're willing to sell assets to high grade our portfolio and to fund transactions.
And importantly, our leverage ratio remains unchanged since late 2014 with $0.5 billion of cash on the balance sheet. This is a direct result of our fundamental strategy to focus on our asset quality, program returns, balance sheet and our team.
The most impactful way that we can affect the value of Concho is by becoming even more efficient. And we're focused on improving the productivity of each capital dollar invested. 2016 is an inflection point for capital efficiency. During the year, our average lateral length will increase by approximately 35% year-over-year and more than 50% of our operated drill wells will be on multi-well pad sites. We continue to optimize well results and returns by fine-tuning completion design for each core area and zone we're drilling. This inflection and capital efficiency also creates an inflection in production, which is demonstrated by our ability to hold production flat from an all-time high in 2015 and it allows us to confidently project double-digit production growth in 2017 within cash flow.
This outlook remains unchanged. The strength of our machine is demonstrated by our longer-term view that at current strip pricing, we're capable of delivering differentiated annual production growth while continuing to spend within our cash flow, run a steady rig program and maintain a leverage ratio at/or below 2x.
We're working hard to deliver on our near-term objectives and position the company for the future. Our technical expertise and team facilitate the spread of innovation across our assets. We're uniquely positioned with 4 core areas to compete for capital within the Permian, which is the most robust and cost-efficient basin in North America. We are focused on making smart capital allocation decisions and keeping a strong financial position. The outlook for oil prices remains uncertain, but we've never been in a better position to deliver strong, profitable growth. This is our opportunity to extend our lead.
Thanks for listening and let me turn it back now to the moderator and take your questions."

While the macro environment is dynamic, we're extending our",1296,"Good morning. Thanks for joining us on this busy morning. 
The second quarter of 2016 was a good one. Once again, it illustrates the power of our assets, the excellent commitment of our people. While the macro environment is dynamic, we're extending our track record of working all angles within our business to deliver strong operational and financial performance and position the company for the future. Our performance this quarter highlights our ongoing drive to improve capital efficiency, with a relentless focus on asset performance, cost savings and capital discipline. Let me start by summarizing the key achievements for the quarter. 
Second quarter production increased 4% over the previous quarter and exceeded the high end of our guidance. For 2016, we now expect our annual production to show growth while maintaining our capital budget guidance and underspending cash flow. Our outlook for double-digit production growth in 2017 also remains unchanged and in some ways, improves. Double-digit growth in '17 up a higher production base and a capital program defined by our cash flow at the current strip will be a unique achievement, reflecting the operational momentum and improving capital productivity across our assets. 
For the first half of 2016, lease operating expenses averaged approximately $6.50 per barrel, a 12% reduction compared to LOE in the second half of '15. The decrease in LOE reflects specific actions we're taking to generate sustainable operational efficiencies. 
We're making substantial progress in several areas. For example, there's an asset-wide focus on transporting water disposal volumes by pipe rather than truck, which is more efficiently and reduces transportation costs. In addition, our efforts to optimize production fuel development have reduced pumping cost. Hydrating our inventory also contributes to lower LOE as we acquired assets, complementary to our core positions and infrastructure while we're selling lower return properties. 
As a result of ongoing improvements in operations, we've reduced our cost guidance for LOE to $6.75 per barrel at the midpoint. We also reduced our guidance for both cash and noncash G&A per barrel. Aggressively managing our cost structure, combined with strong asset performance, accelerates capital productivity gains, which increasingly enables us to do more with less. 
In addition to delivering strong production volumes and reducing operating costs, we under spent cash flow for the fourth consecutive quarter, which further strengthened our balance sheet. Our commitment to capital discipline and a strong balance sheet provides us with opportunities to generate differentiated value for our shareholders. The most impactful way we can affect the value of Concho is by becoming even more efficient, and we are focused on improving the productivity of each capital dollar invested. Each of our core areas is contributing to improved capital productivity. 
In the Northern Delaware Basin, where we've drilled more than 600 horizontal wells, our drilling team still finds way to set new records. For example, in the second quarter, average drilling days improved to 19, smashing the prior record by 3 days. We're also advancing the oil-rich Avalon Shale in Lea County where continued improvement is a direct result of refining lateral placement and completion techniques. 
This quarter, we highlighted early results from the density test on the Monet wells and this appears on Slide 9 of the earnings presentation. These 4 wells targeted the upper Avalon zone on 80 acre spacing to the specific focus on optimizing the fluid systems and sand volumes. We're excited about the outstanding performance of these wells as we move into development mode. 
The Red Hills area in Lea County's an area where we targeted both on acquisitions for long lateral development. During the second half of the year, we planned to drill several long lateral wells, targeting the Avalon, and we'll look to replicate our success in the Wolfcamp where we believe significant upside exists. 
In the southern Delaware Basin, we closed the acquisition of 12,000 net acres in our core North Harpoon area at the end of the first quarter. We've added 2 drilling rigs to this acreage at the start of the second quarter, illustrating that anything we bring into the portfolio must be ready to move to the front of the drilling program. 
In the Southern Delaware, we continued to deliver industry-leading well results and the Upper Wolfcamp while continuing to test multi-zone potential. We recently achieved strong results from a third Bone Spring well with plans to drill additional third Bone Spring wells before the end of the year. 
We're also quickly advancing our play in the Midland Basin. The Midland Basin represents our largest opportunity to capture efficiencies as we focus on 2-mile laterals and multi-well pad development. Our efforts to optimize development and maximize the value of this project are ongoing. The 9 wells we drilled this quarter were drilled to a shorter lateral length, which is primarily a function of timing. We drilled these wells in 2015 and our to shift to 2-mile laterals begin at the start of this year. 
We also tested smaller frac jobs on these wells, which provided us valuable information about cost versus well performance that we can use to improve future well economics. 
For the balance of the year, our completion techniques will focus on large profit concentrations. We're currently completing an 8-well density test with 4 wells targeting the Lower Spraberry and 4 wells targeting the Wolfcamp B. These completions will utilize profit concentrations of approximately 2,000 pounds per foot. 
The New Mexico Shelf continues to outperform. During the quarter, well results for the shelf set another record, the second in its many quarters. With just 2 rigs running here, we've managed to advance that's horizontal development of the play and maintained stable production from year-end '15 volumes. 
Our strategy and diversity within the Permian are unique and give us our greatest competitive advantage. We have the ability to allocate capital across our assets and leverage our scale and technical expertise to enhance returns and recoveries. And our relentless focus on improving capital efficiency will have an ever increasing impact on Concho. It will we enable us to drive profitable debt adjusted gross per share in the near and long-term. 
The acquisition market surrounding our core areas is also setting new records and it's nice to have assets in the hottest ZIP Codes in the industry. We currently have the largest and highest quality inventory in our history. Our consolidation activity must compete with our top-tier drilling inventory and strengthen our financial position. While it's a target-rich environment, we will continue to take a disciplined approach in pursuing the right acquisitions to build for the future. 
Cinema is positive among our industry peers and optimism is a driving force in our industry. At Concho, there's a lot to be excited about. But the outlook for commodity prices isn't much different since the last quarterly update. As a result, we maintained our commitment to spend within cash flow. The momentum we're generating reinforces our 2017 outlook for double-digit production growth, while balancing capital and cash flow within the current price outlook. 
The mission of Concho has always been to build something unique, to build a leading energy company that excels in any environment that creates shareholder value by investing capital in the best assets with the highest returns that consistently seeks to improve performance and drive profitable growth per share. Our vision for delivering on this mission today is simple, we believe that we can be the best by executing a disciplined capital program, delivering operational excellence and hydrating our investment opportunities. Our track record of performance confined with focus and disciplined execution of our strategy will enable us to generate value for our shareholders for many years to come.

While the macro environment is dynamic, we're extending our tr",1294,"Good morning. Thanks for joining us on this busy morning. The second quarter of 2016 was a good one. Once again, it illustrates the power of our assets, the excellent commitment of our people. While the macro environment is dynamic, we're extending our track record of working all angles within our business to deliver strong operational and financial performance and position the company for the future. Our performance this quarter highlights our ongoing drive to improve capital efficiency, with a relentless focus on asset performance, cost savings and capital discipline. 
Let me start by summarizing the key achievements for the quarter. Second quarter production increased 4% over the previous quarter and exceeded the high end of our guidance. For 2016, we now expect our annual production to show growth, while maintaining our capital budget guidance and underspending cash flow. Our outlook for double-digit production growth in 2017 also remains unchanged and in some ways, improves. Double-digit growth in '17 up a higher production base and a capital program defined by our cash flow at the current strip will be a unique achievement, reflecting the operational momentum and improving capital productivity across our assets. 
For the first half of 2016, lease operating expenses averaged approximately $6.50 per barrel, a 12% reduction compared to LOE in the second half of '15. The decrease in LOE reflects specific actions we're taking to generate sustainable operational efficiencies. 
We're making substantial progress in several areas. For example, there's an asset-wide focus on transporting water disposal volumes by pipe rather than truck, which is more efficient and reduces transportation cost. In addition, our efforts to optimize production and fuel development that reduce pumping cost. High-grading our inventory also contributes to lower LOE as we acquire assets complementary to our core positions and infrastructure, while we're selling lower returning properties. 
As a result of ongoing improvements in operations, we've reduced our cost guidance for LOE to $6.75 per barrel at the midpoint. We also reduced our guidance for both cash and noncash G&A per barrel. Aggressively managing our cost structure, combined with strong asset performance, accelerates capital productivity gains, which increasingly enables us to do more with less. 
In addition to delivering strong production volumes and reducing operating cost, we underspent cash flow for the fourth consecutive quarter, which further strengthened our balance sheet. Our commitment to capital discipline and a strong balance sheet provides us with opportunities to generate differentiated value for our shareholders. The most impactful way we can affect the value of Concho is by becoming even more efficient, and we're focused on improving the productivity of each capital dollar invested. Each of our core areas is contributing to improved capital productivity.
In the Northern Delaware Basin, where we've drilled more than 600 horizontal wells, our drilling team still finds ways to set new records. For example, in the second quarter, average drilling days improved to 19, smashing the prior record by 3 days. We're also advancing the oil-rich Avalon Shale in Lea County, where continued improvement is a direct result of refining lateral placement and completion techniques. 
This quarter, we highlighted early results from the density test on the Monet wells and this appears on Slide 9 of the earnings presentation. These 4 wells targeted the upper Avalon zone on 80 acre spacing, with a specific focus on optimizing the fluid systems and sand volumes. We're excited about the outstanding performance of these wells as we move into development mode. 
The Red Hills area in Lea County is an area where we've targeted bolt on acquisitions for long lateral development. During the second half of the year, we planned to drill several long lateral wells, targeting the Avalon, and we'll look to replicate our success in the Wolfcamp where we believe significant upside exists. 
In the southern Delaware Basin, we closed the acquisition of 12,000 net acres in our core North Harpoon area at the end of the first quarter. We've added 2 drilling rigs to this acreage at the start of the second quarter, illustrating that anything we bring into the portfolio must be ready to move to the front of the drilling program. 
In the Southern Delaware, we continued to deliver industry-leading well results and the Upper Wolfcamp, while continuing to test multi-zone potential. We recently achieved strong results from a third Bone Spring well with plans to drill additional third Bone Spring wells before the end of the year. 
We're also quickly advancing our play in the Midland Basin. The Midland Basin represents our largest opportunity to capture efficiencies as we focus on 2-mile laterals and multi-well pad development. Our efforts to optimize development and maximize the value of this project are ongoing. The 9 wells we drilled this quarter were drilled to a shorter lateral length, which is primarily a function of timing. We drilled these wells in 2015 and our to shift to 2-mile laterals begin at the start of this year. We also tested smaller frac jobs on these wells, which provided us valuable information about cost versus well performance that we can use to improve future well economics. 
For the balance of the year, our completion techniques will focus on large profit concentrations. We're currently completing an 8-well density test with 4 wells targeting the Lower Spraberry and 4 wells targeting the Wolfcamp B. These completions will utilize profit concentrations of approximately 2,000 pounds per foot. 
The New Mexico Shelf continues to outperform. During the quarter, well results for the shelf set another record, the second in as many quarters. With just 2 rigs running here, we've managed to advance horizontal development of the play and maintain stable production from year-end '15 volumes. 
Our strategy and diversity within the Permian are unique and give us our greatest competitive advantage. We have the ability to allocate capital across our assets and leverage our scale and technical expertise to enhance returns and recoveries. And our relentless focus on improving capital efficiency will have an ever increasing impact on Concho. It will we enable us to drive profitable debt-adjusted growth per share in the near and long-term. 
The acquisition market surrounding our core areas is also setting new records and it's nice to have assets in the hottest ZIP Codes in the industry. We currently have the largest and highest quality inventory in our history. Our consolidation activity must compete with our top-tier drilling inventory and strengthen our financial position. While it's a target-rich environment, we will continue to take a disciplined approach in pursuing the right acquisitions to build for the future. 
Cinema is positive among our industry peers and optimism is a driving force in our industry. At Concho, there's a lot to be excited about. But the outlook for commodity prices isn't much different since the last quarterly update. As a result, we maintained our commitment to spend within cash flow. The momentum we're generating reinforces our 2017 outlook for double-digit production growth, while balancing capital and cash flow within the current price outlook. 
The mission of Concho has always been to build something unique, to build a leading energy company that excels in any environment, that creates shareholder value by investing capital in the best assets with the highest returns, that consistently seeks to improve performance and drive profitable growth per share. 
Our vision for delivering on this mission today is simple, we believe that we can be the best by executing a disciplined capital program, delivering operational excellence and high-grading our investment opportunities. Our track record of performance combined with focus and disciplined execution of our strategy will enable us to generate value for our shareholders for many years to come.

And the Midland Basin has -- there's lots of companies with lots of data and we're just probably further along, industries understanding of what works and what doesn't work and where the Wolfcamp works best, where the Spraberry works best.

Once again, it illustrates the power of our assets, the excellent commitment of our people. While the macro environment is dynamic, we're extending our track record of working all angles within our business to deliver strong operational and financial performance and position the company for the future. Our performance this quarter highlights our ongoing drive to improve capital efficiency, with a relentless focus on asset performance, cost savings and capital discipline. 
Let me start by summarizing the key achievements for the quarter. Second quarter production increased 4% over the previous quarter and exceeded the high end of our guidance. For 2016, we now expect our annual production to show growth, while maintaining our capital budget guidance and underspending cash flow. Our outlook for double-digit production growth in 2017 also remains unchanged and in some ways, improves. Double-digit growth in '17 off a higher production base and a capital program defined by our cash flow at the current strip will be a unique achievement, reflecting the operational momentum and improving capital productivity across our assets. 
For the first half of 2016, lease operating expenses averaged approximately $6.50 per barrel, a 12% reduction compared to LOE in the second half of '15. The decrease in LOE reflects specific actions we're taking to generate sustainable operational efficiencies. 
We're making substantial progress in several areas. For example, there's an asset-wide focus on transporting water disposal volumes by pipe rather than truck, which is more efficient and reduces transportation cost. In addition, our efforts to optimize production and field development that reduce pumping cost. High-grading our inventory also contributes to lower LOE as we acquire assets complementary to our core positions and infrastructure, while we're selling lower returning properties. 
As a result of ongoing improvements in operations, we've reduced our cost guidance for LOE to $6.75 per barrel at the midpoint. We also reduced our guidance for both cash and noncash G&A per barrel. Aggressively managing our cost structure, combined with strong asset performance, accelerates capital productivity gains, which increasingly enables us to do more with less. 
In addition to delivering strong production volumes and reducing operating cost, we underspent cash flow for the fourth consecutive quarter, which further strengthened our balance sheet. Our commitment to capital discipline and a strong balance sheet provides us with opportunities to generate differentiated value for our shareholders. The most impactful way we can affect the value of Concho is by becoming even more efficient, and we're focused on improving the productivity of each capital dollar invested. Each of our core areas is contributing to improved capital productivity.
In the Northern Delaware Basin, where we've drilled more than 600 horizontal wells, our drilling team still finds ways to set new records. For example, in the second quarter, average drilling days improved to 19, smashing the prior record by 3 days. We're also advancing the oil-rich Avalon Shale in Lea County, where continued improvement is a direct result of refining lateral placement and completion techniques. 
This quarter, we highlighted early results from the density test on the Monet wells and this appears on Slide 9 of the earnings presentation. These 4 wells targeted the upper Avalon zone on 80 acre spacing, with a specific focus on optimizing the fluid system and sand volumes. We're excited about the outstanding performance of these wells as we move into development mode. 
The Red Hills area in Lea County is an area where we've targeted bolt on acquisitions for long lateral development. During the second half of the year, we plan to drill several long lateral wells, targeting the Avalon, and we'll look to replicate our success in the Wolfcamp where we believe significant upside exists. 
In the southern Delaware Basin, we closed the acquisition of 12,000 net acres in our core North Harpoon area at the end of the first quarter. We've added 2 drilling rigs to this acreage at the start of the second quarter, illustrating that anything we bring into the portfolio must be ready to move to the front of the drilling program. 
In the Southern Delaware, we continued to deliver industry-leading well results in the Upper Wolfcamp, while continuing to test multi-zone potential. We recently achieved strong results from a third Bone Spring well with plans to drill additional third Bone Spring wells before the end of the year. 
We're also quickly advancing our play in the Midland Basin. The Midland Basin represents our largest opportunity to capture efficiencies as we focus on 2-mile laterals and multi-well pad development. Our efforts to optimize development and maximize the value of this project are ongoing. The 9 wells we added this quarter were drilled to a shorter lateral length, which is primarily a function of timing. We drilled these wells in 2015 and our to shift to 2-mile laterals began at the start of this year. We also tested smaller frac jobs on these wells, which provided us valuable information about cost versus well performance that we can use to improve future well economics. 
For the balance of the year, our completion techniques will focus on large profit concentrations. We're currently completing an 8-well density test with 4 wells targeting the Lower Spraberry and 4 wells targeting the Wolfcamp B. These completions will utilize profit concentrations of approximately 2,000 pounds per foot. 
The New Mexico Shelf continues to outperform. During the quarter, well results for the shelf set another record, the second in as many quarters. With just 2 rigs running here, we've managed to advance horizontal development of the play and maintain stable production from year-end '15 volumes. 
Our strategy and diversity within the Permian are unique and give us our greatest competitive advantage. We have the ability to allocate capital across our assets and leverage our scale and technical expertise to enhance returns and recoveries. And our relentless focus on improving capital efficiency will have an ever increasing impact on Concho. It will we enable us to drive profitable debt-adjusted growth per share in the near and long-term. 
The acquisition market surrounding our core areas is also setting new records and it's nice to have assets in the hottest ZIP Codes in the industry. We currently have the largest and highest quality inventory in our history. Our consolidation activity must compete with our top-tier drilling inventory and strengthen our financial position. While it's a target-rich environment, we will continue to take a disciplined approach in pursuing the right acquisitions to build for the future. 
Sentiment is positive among our industry peers and optimism is a driving force in our industry. At Concho, there's a lot to be excited about. But the outlook for commodity prices isn't much different since the last quarterly update. As a result, we maintain our commitment to spend within cash flow. The momentum we're generating reinforces our 2017 outlook for double-digit production growth, while balancing capital and cash flow within the current price outlook. 
The mission of Concho has always been to build something unique, to build a leading energy company that excels in any environment, that creates shareholder value by investing capital in the best assets with the highest returns, that consistently seeks to improve performance and drive profitable growth per share. 
Our vision for delivering on this mission today is simple, we believe that we can be the best by executing a disciplined capital program, delivering operational excellence and high-grading our investment opportunities. Our track record of performance combined with focus and disciplined execution of our strategy will enable us to generate value for our shareholders for many years to come.

While the macro environment is dynamic, we're extending our tr",1294,"Good morning. Thanks for joining us on this busy morning. The second quarter of 2016 was a good one. Once again, it illustrates the power of our assets, the excellent commitment of our people. While the macro environment is dynamic, we're extending our track record of working all angles within our business to deliver strong operational and financial performance and position the company for the future. Our performance this quarter highlights our ongoing drive to improve capital efficiency, with a relentless focus on asset performance, cost savings and capital discipline. 
Let me start by summarizing the key achievements for the quarter. Second quarter production increased 4% over the previous quarter and exceeded the high end of our guidance. For 2016, we now expect our annual production to show growth, while maintaining our capital budget guidance and underspending cash flow. Our outlook for double-digit production growth in 2017 also remains unchanged and in some ways, improves. Double-digit growth in '17 off a higher production base and a capital program defined by our cash flow at the current strip will be a unique achievement, reflecting the operational momentum and improving capital productivity across our assets. 
For the first half of 2016, lease operating expenses averaged approximately $6.50 per barrel, a 12% reduction compared to LOE in the second half of '15. The decrease in LOE reflects specific actions we're taking to generate sustainable operational efficiencies. 
We're making substantial progress in several areas. For example, there's an asset-wide focus on transporting water disposal volumes by pipe rather than truck, which is more efficient and reduces transportation cost. In addition, our efforts to optimize production and field development that reduce pumping cost. High-grading our inventory also contributes to lower LOE as we acquire assets complementary to our core positions and infrastructure, while we're selling lower returning properties. 
As a result of ongoing improvements in operations, we've reduced our cost guidance for LOE to $6.75 per barrel at the midpoint. We also reduced our guidance for both cash and noncash G&A per barrel. Aggressively managing our cost structure, combined with strong asset performance, accelerates capital productivity gains, which increasingly enables us to do more with less. 
In addition to delivering strong production volumes and reducing operating cost, we underspent cash flow for the fourth consecutive quarter, which further strengthened our balance sheet. Our commitment to capital discipline and a strong balance sheet provides us with opportunities to generate differentiated value for our shareholders. The most impactful way we can affect the value of Concho is by becoming even more efficient, and we're focused on improving the productivity of each capital dollar invested. Each of our core areas is contributing to improved capital productivity.
In the Northern Delaware Basin, where we've drilled more than 600 horizontal wells, our drilling team still finds ways to set new records. For example, in the second quarter, average drilling days improved to 19, smashing the prior record by 3 days. We're also advancing the oil-rich Avalon Shale in Lea County, where continued improvement is a direct result of refining lateral placement and completion techniques. 
This quarter, we highlighted early results from the density test on the Monet wells and this appears on Slide 9 of the earnings presentation. These 4 wells targeted the upper Avalon zone on 80 acre spacing, with a specific focus on optimizing the fluid system and sand volumes. We're excited about the outstanding performance of these wells as we move into development mode. 
The Red Hills area in Lea County is an area where we've targeted bolt on acquisitions for long lateral development. During the second half of the year, we plan to drill several long lateral wells, targeting the Avalon, and we'll look to replicate our success in the Wolfcamp where we believe significant upside exists. 
In the southern Delaware Basin, we closed the acquisition of 12,000 net acres in our core North Harpoon area at the end of the first quarter. We've added 2 drilling rigs to this acreage at the start of the second quarter, illustrating that anything we bring into the portfolio must be ready to move to the front of the drilling program. 
In the Southern Delaware, we continued to deliver industry-leading well results in the Upper Wolfcamp, while continuing to test multi-zone potential. We recently achieved strong results from a third Bone Spring well with plans to drill additional third Bone Spring wells before the end of the year. 
We're also quickly advancing our play in the Midland Basin. The Midland Basin represents our largest opportunity to capture efficiencies as we focus on 2-mile laterals and multi-well pad development. Our efforts to optimize development and maximize the value of this project are ongoing. The 9 wells we added this quarter were drilled to a shorter lateral length, which is primarily a function of timing. We drilled these wells in 2015 and our to shift to 2-mile laterals began at the start of this year. We also tested smaller frac jobs on these wells, which provided us valuable information about cost versus well performance that we can use to improve future well economics. 
For the balance of the year, our completion techniques will focus on large profit concentrations. We're currently completing an 8-well density test with 4 wells targeting the Lower Spraberry and 4 wells targeting the Wolfcamp B. These completions will utilize profit concentrations of approximately 2,000 pounds per foot. 
The New Mexico Shelf continues to outperform. During the quarter, well results for the shelf set another record, the second in as many quarters. With just 2 rigs running here, we've managed to advance horizontal development of the play and maintain stable production from year-end '15 volumes. 
Our strategy and diversity within the Permian are unique and give us our greatest competitive advantage. We have the ability to allocate capital across our assets and leverage our scale and technical expertise to enhance returns and recoveries. And our relentless focus on improving capital efficiency will have an ever increasing impact on Concho. It will we enable us to drive profitable debt-adjusted growth per share in the near and long-term. 
The acquisition market surrounding our core areas is also setting new records and it's nice to have assets in the hottest ZIP Codes in the industry. We currently have the largest and highest quality inventory in our history. Our consolidation activity must compete with our top-tier drilling inventory and strengthen our financial position. While it's a target-rich environment, we will continue to take a disciplined approach in pursuing the right acquisitions to build for the future. 
Sentiment is positive among our industry peers and optimism is a driving force in our industry. At Concho, there's a lot to be excited about. But the outlook for commodity prices isn't much different since the last quarterly update. As a result, we maintain our commitment to spend within cash flow. The momentum we're generating reinforces our 2017 outlook for double-digit production growth, while balancing capital and cash flow within the current price outlook. 
The mission of Concho has always been to build something unique, to build a leading energy company that excels in any environment, that creates shareholder value by investing capital in the best assets with the highest returns, that consistently seeks to improve performance and drive profitable growth per share.

The Southern Delaware Basin is very early as far as getting enough information in wells to delineate all the productive zones. And so I think there's still a tremendous amount of work to be done there. And so we like the Delaware Basin and the top-tier areas of the Delaware Basin continue to grow. And the Midland Basin has -- there's lots of companies with lots of data and it's probably further along, industry's understanding of what works and what doesn't work and where the Wolfcamp works best, where the Spraberry works best. So in general I think for both the Midland Basin and the Delaware Basin, it's still early innings. And everybody's -- the number of wells that the companies are drilling have gone down.

Over the past year, we've emphasized the 4 philosophies of our strategy: Our people, assets, turns and balance sheet. Our commitment to this strategy has driven exceptional performance, as reflected by our operational financial results for the third quarter. The quarter also demonstrated that we don't just talk about capital discipline, we actually [ph] employ it. Cash flow exceeded capital spending for the fifth consecutive quarter, and excluding acquisitions, we're on track to underspend our cash flow by over $100 million for full year '16.
Production for the third quarter was very strong and exceeded the high end of our guidance. We're building a great deal of momentum as we head toward the end of the year, and are increasing our 2016 growth outlook to 5% from the previous range of 1% to 3%. Importantly, we expect to land our capital budget within our range at $1.3 billion, again, all of which will be funded comfortably within cash flow.
Looking ahead to 2017 and beyond, we expect to deliver peer leading growth. We're targeting 20% annualized growth through 2019 within cash flow at the current commodity price outlook. Our asset base, financial discipline and operational excellence fuel our confidence on what we believe is a truly differentiated long-term outlook. Jack will outline our plans for 2017 and the 3-year outlook in more detail, but first, I want to give you some of the highlights across our assets.
As we improve our drilling and completion technology, our capital efficiency continues to get better. Each of our operating areas illustrates this. The entire portfolio is performing extremely well and contributing to accelerated growth. In both the Northern and Southern Delaware Basin, our team delivered record 30-day production rates, and we achieved record average laterally across all assets. The resource potential in the Northern Delaware Basin is abundant, and with more than 350,000 gross acres, we have significant leverage to the stacked resource. Since 2015, we've completed more than 225 horizontal wells, targeting 9 different zones. Our activity over the past 2 years represents only 1/3 of the horizontal wells we've drilled in the Northern Delaware since 2011.
Our top priority today is optimizing well spacing, lateral placement, lateral length and completion design. This focus is improving recoveries and returns. The Avalon Shale is an excellent example. The 4 well-development pad in the Red Hills area, highlighted on Slide 10 of the earnings deck, continues to outpace expectations and supports tighter well spacing, as well as our completion technique. Also, on Slide 10, we highlight the Wolfcamp zone in Red Hills. I'll describe the Wolfcamp as the next big play for Concho, and we recently completed 2 wells targeting the Upper Wolfcamp sands. These 2 wells came online at an average 30-day peak rate of 2,000 barrels of oil per day. The results from the Avalon and Wolfcamp illustrates both the quality of our acreage position and the technical expertise of our team.
In the Southern Delaware basin, we continued to delineate the Third Bone Spring Sand play, bringing 2 strong wells online during the quarter. For 2017, we plan to optimize the development of the third Bone Spring and the Wolfcamp A. At the time of our last call, we were completing an 8-well stacked test in the Midland Basin. The Windham this, which is referred to on Slide 13, includes 4 wells targeting the Lower Spraberry and 4 wells targeting the Wolfcamp B. These wells were drilled with long laterals, spaced at approximately 660 feet between wells in the same zone, and represents some of the best results we've achieved in the play. In the first 30 days, these wells produced a cumulative 260,000 barrels of oil equivalent, of which 85% was oil. And for the past 10 days, they've produced at an average daily rate of more than 11,000 BOEs per day, also made up of 85% oil.
Additionally, our drilling team is constantly working to drill wells faster and longer by using the latest technology. They recently set the record by drilling a 2-mile Lower Spraberry well from spud to TD in less than 12 days.
And over on the Mexico shale, we're targeting longer laterals while maintaining productivity per 1,000 feet of lateral and cost around $2.5 million per well. Investing in high quality assets in the Permian is key to our strategy. During the third quarter, we announced acquisition of 40,000 core net acres in the Midland Basin. The acquisition closed in October, and we are running one rig on these assets today with plans to add a second rig in '17. This transaction is a great example of the high bar we set for acquisitions. It's value accretive, enhances our drilling inventory, and we believe our drilling machine can make it even better.
We also find considerable value in owning large blocky positions. This allows us to capture the growth and economic advantages scale. While we continue to see a great deal of consolidation opportunities in the basin, we remain committed to active portfolio management. This includes a disciplined strategy of pursuing the right acquisitions to build for the future and selling projects that have a hard time competing for capital within our portfolio.
It's hard to imagine that it's been nearly 2 years since Black Thursday OPEC meeting that sent oil prices lower. Our industry's adapted well to lower our prices, but Concho's track record has been excellent. Year-to-date, we've increased our production growth target from down 5 at the start of the year to up 5. We've reduced our capital budget to $1.3 billion from the initial $1.4 billion. We've demonstrated capital discipline by spending within cash flow. We significantly reduced our annual cash cost by more than $100 million. We've reduced long-term debt by more than $1 billion. We've consolidated more than $2 billion of core assets. We've enhanced the quality of our inventory and we've delivered leading debt-adjusted production growth per share. It's amazing that this success overlaps with the longest-running oil price down cycle in more than 30 years. I'm excited about our momentum and even more pleased about the long-term outlook for our company.
Thanks for your attention this morning and now let me turn it over to Jack."
26906,403757258,1081051,"Concho Resources, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 09, 2016",2016-11-09,"Earnings Calls","Concho Resources Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Tim.

All around it was an exceptional quarter that supports our focused strategy and teh dedication of our team to operational excellence. Good capital allocation, cost control and a strong simple financial position are the 3 pillars of Concho's financial strategy. First, we believe that in order to build a leading energy company that excels in any environment that starts directing capital to the best asset and constantly working to improve performance.
On the first quarter earnings call, we outlined the inflection point in capital efficiency that's occurring in 2016. Our transition to long laterals and multi-well pads, combined with improving well productivity through new completion design, is enhancing the quality of our inventory. This really drilling opportunities are powerful engine for multi year growth within cash flow.
Cost control is the second component of Concho's financial strategy. We continue to work our cash cost lower. We lowered guidance for lease operating expense to $6 per BOE from the prior range of $6.50 to $7. Additionally, during the third quarter, we redeemed $600 million of 7% senior notes, further strengthening the balance sheet and reducing cash interest burden, which leads me to the third component of our financial strategy. A strong simple balance sheet continues to serve Concho well and provides significant flexibility. One goal we had for Concho is to come out the cycle in a stronger financial position than when we started and we've done that. We have significantly reduced our absolute debt and are within our leverage comfortable level based on debt-to-EBITDA.
As we approach the budget season, we can find ourselves planning for the long-term in an uncertain price environment. Depending on commodity prices and resulting cash flow, we expect to invest between $1.4 billion and $1.6 billion in 2017 and grow oil volumes by more than 20% year-over-year. Total company production is expected to be 17% to 20% over 2016's increasingly strong base.
We're 18 rigs today and plan to run 18 rigs on average next year. So the rigs are ready to deliver on our growth target. We will continue to capture efficiencies as we increase long lateral and multi-well pad development. The average lateral length of the program is expected to increase 20% as compared to '16. Additionally, we expect more than 70% of the program to utilize multi-well pads, up from approximately 50% in '16, and 15% 2 years ago. We've drilled over 1,000 horizontal wells in the Permian, providing us with a significant amount of data and discover. But this business still has an incredible amount of running room in terms of delineating zones, well spacing and overall drilling and completion optimization. We like to think of it is as a big science experiment. So in addition to advancing efficiencies across the plays in 2017, the drilling program will also help answer important questions about optimal development of this world-class resource.
We're excited about outlook for next year, but ultimately Concho's a growth company capable of raising the industry bar for delivering differentiated performance over the long term. And even in this commodity price environment, our long-term growth outlook is robust. Over the next 3 years, at current strip price, we expect to generate 20% annualized production growth within cash flow. With our leverage ratio further improving as it trends to 1x over this 3-year period. The plan is simple: There are no assumptions for a higher price outlook or greater efficiencies than where we stand today. Our combined efforts in 2016 to expand profitability and improved capital productivity enhance the impact of each dollar we redeploy in the drilling program. This is how we're to deliver differentiated growth within cash flow relative to the field.
Our consistent execution provides a strong foundation for creating value for shareholders over the long term, operational excellence, structural cost improvement, and a fortress balance sheet will continue to set Concho apart. And as we look to the balance of the year and beyond, we are more focused than ever on enhancing capital productivity and translating that into a sustainable capital efficient growth per share for our shareholders.
With that, we'll now open up the call for your questions."

And as we work on our property base of our leases, we've gotten bigger and got blockier positions now that allow us to drill longer. But I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we're really focused on lateral length, well placement of the zone and the completion style. And those are our priorities on the science experiment of solving for all the different zones. I think we're well up the learning curve and I think we're zeroing in on optimization on those areas."

Over the past year, we've emphasized the 4 philosophies of our strategy: Our people, assets, turns and balance sheet. Our commitment to this strategy has driven exceptional performance, as reflected by our operational financial results for the third quarter. The quarter also demonstrated that we don't just talk about capital discipline. We actually employ it. Cash flow exceeded capital spending for the fifth consecutive quarter, and excluding acquisitions, we're on track to underspend our cash flow by over $100 million for full year '16.
Production for the third quarter was very strong and exceeded the high end of our guidance. We're building a great deal of momentum as we head toward the end of the year, and are increasing our 2016 growth outlook to 5% from the previous range of 1% to 3%. Importantly, we expect to land our capital budget within our range at $1.3 billion, again, all of which will be funded comfortably within cash flow.
Looking ahead to 2017 and beyond, we expect to deliver peer leading growth. We're targeting 20% annualized growth through 2019 within cash flow at the current commodity price outlook. Our asset base, financial discipline and operational excellence fuel our confidence on what we believe is a truly differentiated long-term outlook. Jack will outline our plans for 2017 and the 3-year outlook in more detail, but first, I want to give you some of the highlights across our assets.
As we improve our drilling and completion technology, our capital efficiency continues to get better. Each of our operating areas illustrates this. The entire portfolio is performing extremely well and contributing to accelerated growth. In both the Northern and Southern Delaware Basin, our team delivered record 30-day production rates, and we achieved record average laterally across all assets. The resource potential in the Northern Delaware Basin is abundant, and with more than 350,000 gross acres, we have significant leverage to the stacked resource. Since 2015, we've completed more than 225 horizontal wells, targeting 9 different zones. Our activity over the past 2 years represents only 1/3 of the horizontal wells we've drilled in the Northern Delaware since 2011.
Our top priority today is optimizing well spacing, lateral placement, lateral length and completion design. This focus is improving recoveries and returns. The Avalon Shale is an excellent example. The 4 well-development pad in the Red Hills area, highlighted on Slide 10 of the earnings deck, continues to outpace expectations and supports tighter well spacing, as well as our completion technique. Also, on Slide 10, we highlight the Wolfcamp zone in Red Hills. I'll describe the Wolfcamp as the next big play for Concho, and we recently completed 2 wells, targeting the Upper Wolfcamp Sands. These 2 wells came online at an average 30-day peak rate of 2,000 barrels of oil per day. The results from the Avalon and Wolfcamp illustrates both the quality of our acreage position and the technical expertise of our team.
In the Southern Delaware basin, we continued to delineate the Third Bone Spring Sand play, bringing 2 strong wells online during the quarter. For 2017, we plan to optimize the development of the third Bone Spring and the Wolfcamp A. At the time of our last call, we were completing an 8-well stack test in the Midland Basin. The Windham test, which is referred to on Slide 13, includes 4 wells targeting the Lower Spraberry and 4 wells targeting the Wolfcamp B. These wells were drilled with long laterals, spaced at approximately 660 feet between wells in the same zone, and represents some of the best results that we've achieved in the play. In the first 30 days, these wells produced a cumulative 260,000 barrels of oil equivalent, of which 85% was oil. And for the past 10 days, they've produced at an average daily rate of more than 11,000 BOEs per day, also made up of 85% oil. Additionally, our drilling team is constantly working to drill wells faster and longer by using the latest technology. They recently set a record by drilling a 2-mile Lower Spraberry well from spud to TD in less than 12 days.
And over onto the Mexico shale, we're targeting longer laterals, while maintaining productivity per 1,000 feet of lateral, and cost around $2.5 million per well. Investing in high quality assets in the Permian is key to our strategy. During the third quarter, we announced the acquisition of 40,000 core net acres in the Midland Basin. The acquisition closed in October, and we're running one rig on these assets today with plans to add a second rig early in '17. This transaction is a great example of the high bar we've set for acquisitions. It's value accretive, enhances our drilling inventory, and we believe our drilling machine can make it even better.
We also find considerable value in owning large blocky positions. This allows us to capture the growth and economic advantage of scale. While we continue to see a great deal of consolidation opportunities in the basin, we remain committed to active portfolio management. This includes a disciplined strategy of pursuing the right acquisitions to build for the future and selling projects that have a hard time competing for capital within our portfolio.
It's hard to imagine that it's been nearly 2 years since Black Thursday OPEC meeting that sent oil prices lower. Our industry's adapted well to lower our prices, but Concho's track record has been excellent. Year-to-date, we've increased our production growth target from down 5 at the start of the year to up 5. We've reduced our capital budget to $1.3 billion from the initial $1.4 billion. We've demonstrated capital discipline by spending within cash flow. We significantly reduced our annual cash cost by more than $100 million. We've reduced long-term debt by more than $1 billion. We've consolidated more than $2 billion of core assets. We've enhanced the quality of our inventory and we've delivered leading debt-adjusted production growth per share. It's amazing that this success overlaps with the longest-running oil price down cycle in more than 30 years. I'm excited about our momentum and even more pleased about the long-term outlook for our company.
Thanks for your attention this morning and now let me turn it over to Jack."

All around it was an exceptional quarter that supports our focused strategy and the dedication of our team to operational excellence.

All around it was an exceptional quarter that supports our focused strategy and the dedication of our team to operational excellence. Good capital allocation, cost control and a strong simple financial position are the 3 pillars of Concho's financial strategy. First, we believe that in order to build a leading energy company that excels in any environment that starts directing capital to the best assets and constantly working to improve performance.
On the first quarter earnings call, we outlined the inflection point in capital efficiency that's occurring in 2016. Our transition to long laterals and multi-well pads, combined with improving well productivity through new completion design, is enhancing the quality of our inventory. This really drilling opportunities are powerful engine for multi year growth within cash flow.
Cost control is the second component of Concho's financial strategy. We continue to work our cash cost lower. We lowered guidance for lease operating expense to $6 per BOE from the prior range of $6.50 to $7. Additionally, during the third quarter, we redeemed $600 million of 7% senior notes, further strengthening the balance sheet and reducing cash interest burden, which leads me to the third component of our financial strategy. A strong simple balance sheet continues to serve Concho well and provides significant flexibility. One goal we had for Concho is to come out the cycle in a stronger financial position than when we started and we've done that. We have significantly reduced our absolute debt, and are within our leverage comfort level based on debt-to-EBITDA.
As we approach budget season, we can find ourselves planning for the long-term in an uncertain price environment. Depending on commodity prices and resulting cash flow, we expect to invest between $1.4 billion and $1.6 billion in 2017, and grow oil volumes by more than 20% year-over-year. Total company production is expected to be 17% to 20% over 2016's increasingly strong base.
We're at 18 rigs today, and plan to run 18 rigs on average next year. So the rigs are ready to deliver on our growth target. We will continue to capture efficiencies as we increase long lateral and multi-well pad development. The average lateral length of the program is expected to increase 20%, as compared to '16. Additionally, we expect more than 70% of the program to utilize multi well pads, up from approximately 50% in '16, and 15% 2 years ago. We've drilled over 1,000 horizontal wells in the Permian, providing us with a significant amount of data and discovery. But there's still an incredible amount of running room in terms of delineating zones, well spacing and overall drilling and completion optimization. We like to think of it as a big science experiment. So in addition to advancing efficiencies across the plays in 2017, the drilling program will also help answer important questions about optimal development of this world-class resource.
We're excited about the outlook for next year, but ultimately, Concho is a growth company, capable of raising the industry bar for delivering differentiated performance over the long term. And even in this commodity price environment, our long-term growth outlook is robust. Over the next 3 years, at current strip price, we expect to generate 20% annualized production growth within cash flow, with our leverage ratio further improving as it trends to 1x over this 3-year period. The plan is simple. There are no assumptions for a higher price outlook or greater efficiencies than where we stand today. Our combined efforts in 2016 to expand profitability and improve capital productivity enhance the impact of each dollar we redeploy in the drilling program. This is how we were to deliver differentiated growth within cash flow relative to the field.
Our consistent execution provides a strong foundation for creating value for shareholders over the long term. Operational excellence, structural cost improvement, and a fortressed balance sheet will continue to set Concho apart. And as we look to the balance of the year and beyond, we are more focused than ever on enhancing capital productivity and translating that into a sustainable capital efficient growth per share for our shareholders.
With that, we'll now open up the call for your questions."

So most of our property management is going to be focused on creating bigger blocks of acreage, either through trades or selling stuff and redeploying through acquiring other bolt-on properties. And so when you look at something and, say, well, acreage looks expensive, well, if you're buying and selling at the same value, but improving your blockiness, that seem on -- what you're paying, as long as you're continuing to get ever-increasing quality of acreage. I think that's okay, and we've demonstrated our ability to buy stuff at a good price. So I think we'll continue that as well."

Over the past year, we've emphasized the 4 philosophies of our strategy: Our people, assets, returns and balance sheet. Our commitment to this strategy has driven exceptional performance, as reflected by our operational financial results for the third quarter. The quarter also demonstrated that we don't just talk about capital discipline. We actually employ it. Cash flow exceeded capital spending for the fifth consecutive quarter, and excluding acquisitions, we're on track to underspend our cash flow by over $100 million for full year '16.
Production for the third quarter was very strong and exceeded the high end of our guidance. We're building a great deal of momentum as we head toward the end of the year, and are increasing our 2016 growth outlook to 5% from the previous range of 1% to 3%. Importantly, we expect to land our capital budget within our range at $1.3 billion, again, all of which will be funded comfortably within cash flow.
Looking ahead to 2017 and beyond, we expect to deliver peer leading growth. We're targeting 20% annualized growth through 2019 within cash flow at the current commodity price outlook. Our asset base, financial discipline and operational excellence fuel our confidence of what we believe is a truly differentiated long-term outlook. Jack will outline our plans for 2017 and the 3-year outlook in more detail, but first, I want to give you some of the highlights across our assets.
As we improve our drilling and completion technology, our capital efficiency continues to get better. Each of our operating areas illustrates this. The entire portfolio is performing extremely well and contributing to accelerated growth. In both the Northern and Southern Delaware Basin, our team delivered record 30-day production rates, and we achieved record average lateral length across all assets. The resource potential in the Northern Delaware Basin is abundant, and with more than 350,000 gross acres, we have significant leverage to the stacked resource. Since 2015, we've completed more than 225 horizontal wells, targeting 9 different zones. Our activity over the past 2 years represents only 1/3 of the horizontal wells we've drilled in the Northern Delaware since 2011.
Our top priority today is optimizing well spacing, lateral placement, lateral length and completion design. This focus is improving recoveries and returns. The Avalon Shale is an excellent example. The 4 well-development pad in the Red Hills area, highlighted on Slide 10 of the earnings deck, continues to outpace expectations and supports tighter well spacing, as well as our completion technique. Also, on Slide 10, we highlight the Wolfcamp zone in Red Hills. I've described the Wolfcamp as the next big play for Concho, and we recently completed 2 wells, targeting the Upper Wolfcamp Sands. These 2 wells came online at an average 30-day peak rate of 2,000 barrels of oil per day. The results from the Avalon and Wolfcamp illustrate both the quality of our acreage position and the technical expertise of our team.
In the Southern Delaware basin, we continued to delineate the Third Bone Spring Sand play, bringing 2 strong wells online during the quarter. For 2017, we plan to optimize the development of the third Bone Spring and the Wolfcamp A. At the time of our last call, we were completing an 8-well stack test in the Midland Basin. The Windham test, which is referred to on Slide 13, includes 4 wells targeting the Lower Spraberry and 4 wells targeting the Wolfcamp B. These wells were drilled with long laterals, spaced at approximately 660 feet between wells in the same zone, and represents some of the best results that we've achieved in the play. In the first 30 days, these wells produced a cumulative 260,000 barrels of oil equivalent, of which 85% was oil. And for the past 10 days, they've produced at an average daily rate of more than 11,000 BOEs per day, also made up of 85% oil. Additionally, our drilling team is constantly working to drill wells faster and longer by using the latest technology. They recently set a record by drilling a 2-mile Lower Spraberry well from spud to TD in less than 12 days.
And over on the New Mexico Shelf, we're targeting longer laterals while maintaining productivity per 1,000 feet of lateral, and cost around $2.5 million per well. Investing in high quality assets in the Permian is key to our strategy. During the third quarter, we announced the acquisition of 40,000 core net acres in the Midland Basin. The acquisition closed in October, and we're running one rig on these assets today with plans to add a second rig early in '17. This transaction is a great example of the high bar we've set for acquisitions. It's value accretive, enhances our drilling inventory, and we believe our drilling machine can make it even better.
We also find considerable value in owning large blocky positions. This allows us to capture the growth and economic advantage of scale. While we continue to see a great deal of consolidation opportunities in the basin, we remain committed to active portfolio management. This includes a disciplined strategy of pursuing the right acquisitions to build for the future and selling projects that have a hard time competing for capital within our portfolio.
It's hard to imagine that it's been nearly 2 years since Black Thursday OPEC meeting that sent oil prices lower. Our industry's adapted well to lower our prices, but Concho's track record has been excellent. Year-to-date, we've increased our production growth target from down 5 at the start of the year to up 5. We've reduced our capital budget to $1.3 billion from the initial $1.4 billion. We've demonstrated capital discipline by spending within cash flow. We’ve significantly reduced our annual cash cost by more than $100 million. We've reduced long-term debt by more than $1 billion. We've consolidated more than $2 billion of core assets. We've enhanced the quality of our inventory and we've delivered leading debt-adjusted production growth per share. It's amazing that this success overlaps with the longest-running oil price down cycle in more than 30 years. I'm excited about our momentum and even more pleased about the long-term outlook for our company.
Thanks for your attention this morning, and now let me turn it over to Jack."
26906,403757258,1081539,"Concho Resources, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 09, 2016",2016-11-09,"Earnings Calls","Concho Resources Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Tim. All around it was an exceptional quarter that supports our focused strategy and the dedication of our team to operational excellence. Good capital allocation, cost control and a strong simple financial position are the 3 pillars of Concho's f",698,"Thanks, Tim. All around it was an exceptional quarter that supports our focused strategy and the dedication of our team to operational excellence. Good capital allocation, cost control and a strong simple financial position are the 3 pillars of Concho's financial strategy. First, we believe that in order to build a leading energy company that excels in any environment it starts with directing capital to the best assets and constantly working to improve performance.
On the first quarter earnings call, we outlined the inflection point in capital efficiency that's occurring in 2016. Our transition to long laterals and multi-well pads, combined with improving well productivity through new completion design, is enhancing the quality of our inventory. These drilling opportunities are a powerful engine for multiyear growth within cash flow.
Cost control is the second component of Concho's financial strategy. We continue to work our cash cost lower. We lowered guidance for lease operating expense to $6 per BOE from the prior range of $6.50 to $7. Additionally, during the third quarter, we redeemed $600 million of 7% senior notes, further strengthening the balance sheet and reducing cash interest burden, which leads me to the third component of our financial strategy. A strong simple balance sheet continues to serve Concho well and provides significant flexibility. One goal we had for Concho was to come out the cycle in a stronger financial position than when we started, and we've done that. We have significantly reduced our absolute debt, and are within our leverage comfort level based on debt-to-EBITDA.
As we approach budget season, we again find ourselves planning for the long term in an uncertain price environment. Depending on commodity prices and resulting cash flow, we expect to invest between $1.4 billion and $1.6 billion in 2017, and grow oil volumes by more than 20% year-over-year. Total company production is expected to be 17% to 20% over 2016's increasingly strong base.
We're at 18 rigs today, and plan to run 18 rigs on average next year. So the rigs are ready to deliver on our growth target. We will continue to capture efficiencies as we increase long lateral and multi-well pad development. The average lateral length of the program is expected to increase 20% as compared to '16. Additionally, we expect more than 70% of the program to utilize multi well pads, up from approximately 50% in '16, and 15% 2 years ago. We've drilled over 1,000 horizontal wells in the Permian, providing us with a significant amount of data and discovery. But there's still an incredible amount of running room in terms of delineating zones, well spacing and overall drilling and completion optimization. We like to think of it as a big science experiment. So in addition to advancing efficiencies across the plays in 2017, the drilling program will also help answer important questions about optimal development of this world-class resource.
We're excited about the outlook for next year, but ultimately, Concho is a growth company, capable of raising the industry bar for delivering differentiated performance over the long term. And even in this commodity price environment, our long-term growth outlook is robust. Over the next 3 years, at current strip price, we expect to generate 20% annualized production growth within cash flow, with our leverage ratio further improving as it trends to 1x over this 3-year period. The plan is simple. There are no assumptions for a higher price outlook or greater efficiencies than where we stand today. Our combined efforts in 2016 to expand profitability and improve capital productivity enhance the impact of each dollar we redeploy in the drilling program. This is how we were able to deliver differentiated growth within cash flow relative to the field.
Our consistent execution provides a strong foundation for creating value for shareholders over the long term. Operational excellence, structural cost improvement, and a fortressed balance sheet will continue to set Concho apart. And as we look to the balance of the year and beyond, we are more focused than ever on enhancing capital productivity and translating that into a sustainable capital efficient growth per share for our shareholders.
With that, we'll now open up the call for your questions."

Over the past year, we've emphasized the 4 philosophies of our strategy: Our people, assets, returns and balance sheet. Our commitment to this strategy has driven exceptional performance, as reflected by our operational financial results for the third quarter. The quarter also demonstrated that we don't just talk about capital discipline. We actually employ it. Cash flow exceeded capital spending for the fifth consecutive quarter, and excluding acquisitions, we're on track to underspend our cash flow by over $100 million for full year '16.
Production for the third quarter was very strong and exceeded the high end of our guidance. We're building a great deal of momentum as we head toward the end of the year, and are increasing our 2016 growth outlook to 5% from the previous range of 1% to 3%. Importantly, we expect to land our capital budget within our range at $1.3 billion, again, all of which will be funded comfortably within cash flow.
Looking ahead to 2017 and beyond, we expect to deliver peer leading growth. We're targeting 20% annualized growth through 2019 within cash flow at the current commodity price outlook. Our asset base, financial discipline and operational excellence fuel our confidence of what we believe is a truly differentiated long-term outlook. Jack will outline our plans for 2017 and the 3-year outlook in more detail, but first, I want to give you some of the highlights across our assets.
As we improve our drilling and completion technology, our capital efficiency continues to get better. Each of our operating areas illustrates this. The entire portfolio is performing extremely well and contributing to accelerated growth. In both the Northern and Southern Delaware Basin, our team delivered record 30-day production rates, and we achieved record average lateral length across all assets. The resource potential in the Northern Delaware Basin is abundant, and with more than 350,000 gross acres, we have significant leverage to the stacked resource. Since 2015, we've completed more than 225 horizontal wells, targeting 9 different zones. Our activity over the past 2 years represents only 1/3 of the horizontal wells we've drilled in the Northern Delaware since 2011.
Our top priority today is optimizing well spacing, lateral placement, lateral length and completion design. This focus is improving recoveries and returns. The Avalon Shale is an excellent example. The 4 well-development pad in the Red Hills area, highlighted on Slide 10 of the earnings deck, continues to outpace expectations and supports tighter well spacing, as well as our completion technique. Also, on Slide 10, we highlight the Wolfcamp zone in Red Hills. I've described the Wolfcamp as the next big play for Concho, and we recently completed 2 wells, targeting the Upper Wolfcamp Sands. These 2 wells came online at an average 30-day peak rate of 2,000 barrels of oil per day. The results from the Avalon and Wolfcamp illustrate both the quality of our acreage position and the technical expertise of our team.
In the Southern Delaware basin, we continued to delineate the Third Bone Spring Sand play, bringing 2 strong wells online during the quarter. For 2017, we plan to optimize the development of the third Bone Spring and the Wolfcamp A. At the time of our last call, we were completing an 8-well stack test in the Midland Basin. The Windham test, which is referred to on Slide 13, includes 4 wells targeting the Lower Spraberry and 4 wells targeting the Wolfcamp B. These wells were drilled with long laterals, spaced at approximately 660 feet between wells in the same zone, and represents some of the best results that we've achieved in the play. In the first 30 days, these wells produced a cumulative 260,000 barrels of oil equivalent, of which 85% was oil. And for the past 10 days, they've produced at an average daily rate of more than 11,000 BOEs per day, also made up of 85% oil. Additionally, our drilling team is constantly working to drill wells faster and longer by using the latest technology. They recently set a record by drilling a 2-mile Lower Spraberry well from spud to TD in less than 12 days.
And over on the New Mexico Shelf, we're targeting longer laterals while maintaining productivity per 1,000 feet of lateral, and cost around $2.5 million per well. Investing in high quality assets in the Permian is key to our strategy. During the third quarter, we announced the acquisition of 40,000 core net acres in the Midland Basin. The acquisition closed in October, and we're running one rig on these assets today with plans to add a second rig early in '17. This transaction is a great example of the high bar we've set for acquisitions. It's value accretive, enhances our drilling inventory, and we believe our drilling machine can make it even better.
We also find considerable value in owning large blocky positions. This allows us to capture the growth and economic advantage of scale. While we continue to see a great deal of consolidation opportunities in the basin, we remain committed to active portfolio management. This includes a disciplined strategy of pursuing the right acquisitions to build for the future and selling projects that have a hard time competing for capital within our portfolio.
It's hard to imagine that it's been nearly 2 years since Black Thursday OPEC meeting that sent oil prices lower. Our industry's adapted well to lower our prices, but Concho's track record has been excellent. Year-to-date, we've increased our production growth target from down 5 at the start of the year to up 5. We've reduced our capital budget to $1.3 billion from the initial $1.4 billion. We've demonstrated capital discipline by spending within cash flow. We’ve significantly reduced our annual cash cost by more than $100 million. We've reduced long-term debt by more than $1 billion. We've consolidated more than $2 billion of core assets. We've enhanced the quality of our inventory and we've delivered leading debt-adjusted production growth per share. It's amazing that this success overlaps with the longest-running oil price down cycle in more than 30 years. I'm excited about our momentum and even more pleased about the long-term outlook for our company.
Thanks for your attention this morning, and now let me turn it over to Jack."
26906,403757258,1082252,"Concho Resources, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 09, 2016",2016-11-09,"Earnings Calls","Concho Resources Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Tim. All around it was an exceptional quarter that supports our focused strategy and the dedication of our team to operational excellence. Good capital allocation, cost control and a strong simple financial position are the 3 pillars of Concho's f",698,"Thanks, Tim. All around it was an exceptional quarter that supports our focused strategy and the dedication of our team to operational excellence. Good capital allocation, cost control and a strong simple financial position are the 3 pillars of Concho's financial strategy. First, we believe that in order to build a leading energy company that excels in any environment it starts with directing capital to the best assets and constantly working to improve performance.
On the first quarter earnings call, we outlined the inflection point in capital efficiency that's occurring in 2016. Our transition to long laterals and multi-well pads, combined with improving well productivity through new completion design, is enhancing the quality of our inventory. These drilling opportunities are a powerful engine for multiyear growth within cash flow.
Cost control is the second component of Concho's financial strategy. We continue to work our cash cost lower. We lowered guidance for lease operating expense to $6 per BOE from the prior range of $6.50 to $7. Additionally, during the third quarter, we redeemed $600 million of 7% senior notes, further strengthening the balance sheet and reducing cash interest burden, which leads me to the third component of our financial strategy. A strong simple balance sheet continues to serve Concho well and provides significant flexibility. One goal we had for Concho was to come out the cycle in a stronger financial position than when we started, and we've done that. We have significantly reduced our absolute debt, and are within our leverage comfort level based on debt-to-EBITDA.
As we approach budget season, we again find ourselves planning for the long term in an uncertain price environment. Depending on commodity prices and resulting cash flow, we expect to invest between $1.4 billion and $1.6 billion in 2017, and grow oil volumes by more than 20% year-over-year. Total company production is expected to be 17% to 20% over 2016's increasingly strong base.
We're at 18 rigs today, and plan to run 18 rigs on average next year. So the rigs are ready to deliver on our growth target. We will continue to capture efficiencies as we increase long lateral and multi-well pad development. The average lateral length of the program is expected to increase 20% as compared to '16. Additionally, we expect more than 70% of the program to utilize multi well pads, up from approximately 50% in '16, and 15% 2 years ago. We've drilled over 1,000 horizontal wells in the Permian, providing us with a significant amount of data and discovery. But there's still an incredible amount of running room in terms of delineating zones, well spacing and overall drilling and completion optimization. We like to think of it as a big science experiment. So in addition to advancing efficiencies across the plays in 2017, the drilling program will also help answer important questions about optimal development of this world-class resource.
We're excited about the outlook for next year, but ultimately, Concho is a growth company, capable of raising the industry bar for delivering differentiated performance over the long term. And even in this commodity price environment, our long-term growth outlook is robust. Over the next 3 years, at current strip price, we expect to generate 20% annualized production growth within cash flow, with our leverage ratio further improving as it trends to 1x over this 3-year period. The plan is simple. There are no assumptions for a higher price outlook or greater efficiencies than where we stand today. Our combined efforts in 2016 to expand profitability and improve capital productivity enhance the impact of each dollar we redeploy in the drilling program. This is how we were able to deliver differentiated growth within cash flow relative to the field.
Our consistent execution provides a strong foundation for creating value for shareholders over the long term. Operational excellence, structural cost improvement, and a fortressed balance sheet will continue to set Concho apart.
