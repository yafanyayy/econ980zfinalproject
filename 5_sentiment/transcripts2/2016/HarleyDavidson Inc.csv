Today, I'll provide additional insight around our fourth quarter and full year financial results found in the press release and supporting slides. The summary of our fourth quarter financial results start on Slide",2611,"Thanks, Amy, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll provide additional insight around our fourth quarter and full year financial results found in the press release and supporting slides. The summary of our fourth quarter financial results start on Slide 4. 
During the quarter, revenue was $1.18 billion, net income was $42.2 million and diluted earnings per share were $0.22. Operating income from the Motorcycle segment was down $29.5 million from last year's fourth quarter. Segment revenue was down versus prior year driven by unfavorable mix and currency exchange, partially offset by higher shipments. Additionally, SG&A was higher driven by the organization charges, which enabled the shift in our operating investment profile to drive more demand. Operating income headwinds were partially offset by strong gross margin percent. 
At HDFS, operating income was down 2.5% year-over-year. The quarter also reflected higher corporate interest expense resulting from our 2015 recapitalization. Despite the challenging conditions we face throughout 2015, we continue to focus on delivering strong margins and strong returns over the long term. 
Now, let's take a look at our retail sales on Slide 5. Worldwide retail sales of new Harley-Davidson Motorcycles were down 0.6% in the fourth quarter, an improvement from the last three quarters trend when sales were down 1.4%. The decline in U.S. retail sales was partially offset by increases in international markets during the quarter. Globally, sales were impacted by ongoing aggressive competitive activity the mine macroeconomic challenges. On the positive side, our new 2016 model year motorcycles including the 2 s models, the Road Glide Ultra and our refreshed Forty-Eight and Iron 883 models also very well since our initial roll out. 
For the full year, worldwide retail sales were down 1.3% compared to last year. 2015 retail sales reflected a significant increase in competitiveness behind currency-driven discounting and the introduction of new products by a number of our competitors. 
During 2015, we took significant steps to improve our competitiveness without engaging and brand damaging discounting.  We have significantly, shifted our operating investment profile for 2016, redirecting approximately $70 million of existing spending toward demand driving marketing and product development investment. 
Let's take a look at the U.S. market on Slide 6. Retail sales in the U.S. were down 3.4% in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year behind intense competitive pressure and a challenging macroeconomic environment. These significant headwinds were partially offset by demand for new products, including our new Cruiser Motorcycles. In fact, U.S. Cruiser retail sales were up in the fourth quarter driven by strong sales of our 2 new Softail S mortals, our first year-over-year increase in the Cruiser segment in 8 quarters.  We also saw strong motorcycle sales Riding Academy graduates, driven by our Military Learn To Ride for program in the U.S. 
For the quarter, U.S. retail market share was flat to last year 51.4%. As expected, the market share trend substantially improved from previous quarter's trend of down 3.7% -- points. The improvement reflects our FX to mitigate the impact of widening pricing gaps and the lapping of the aggressive competitiveness that started late in Q4 2014. 
For the full year, our retail sales were down 1.7%. For our full year market share -- our full year market share of 2.2% was down 3.1 percentage point year-over-year. While we anticipated some level of share loss following the 13.4 points of share that we gained in recent years, our 2015 share was more severely impacted than we expected as a result of the competitive environment and the inclusion of autocycles in the industry numbers. 
Finally, as expected, U.S. dealer retail inventory was up approximately 2,600 motorcycles at the end of 2015 compared to 2014, largely due to the initial dealer fill of our new 2016 motorcycles. We were comfortable with year-end dealer inventory levels as we continued to aggressively manage supply in line with demand. 
On Slide 7, you'll see retail sales and our international markets were up 3.1% in the fourth quarter. EMEA region retail sales were down 1.7% in Q4 due to continued pressure from the introduction of new low price models by the competition and a very tough prior year comparison of up 8.7%. 
For the full year, EMEA retail sales were down 4.5%, and full year market share in Europe was 10.5%. While market share was down 1.5 percentage point for the year, fourth quarter share was down only 0.6 percentage points, an improvement over the prior quarter share trends. Asia Pacific region retail sales were up 8.2% in the fourth quarter, driven by strong sales in emerging markets and in Australia, partially offset by soft sales in Japan. While retail sales were down in Japan, we gained market share during the quarter. For the full year, Asia Pacific retail sales were up 7.3%. Latin America retail sales were down 1.5% in the quarter as a result of declines in Brazil, partially offset by strong growth in Mexico. Brazil retail sales have been impacted by a slowing economy, consumer uncertainty and very aggressive price competition. 
For the full year, retail sales in Latin America was down 4.1%. 
Finally, retail sales in Canada were up 12.3% in the fourth quarter, but down 2.0% for the full year. We believe the market responded well to the chains with direct distribution model and to a price reduction on 2016 model year motorcycles. We plan to leverage international growth opportunities by expanding distribution and increasing our brand relevance by delivering exceptional products that inspire riders. In 2015, we added 40 international dealerships and plan to add 150 to 200 through 2020. 
On Slide 8, you'll see wholesale shipments of Harley-Davidson Motorcycles in the quarter were up 2.1% compared to last year and within our expected range. The shipment mix reflects our product investments in model year 2016, as we shipped a significantly, higher percent of Cruiser and Street Sportster compared to last year. 
On Slide 9, you'll see revenue for Motorcycle and related product segment was down in the fourth quarter despite an increase in motorcycles shipments. Q4 revenue was unfavorably impacted by currency exchange, which reduced revenue by approximately 3.8% and unfavorable mix. 
For the full year, Motorcycles segment revenue was down 4.7% behind a 1.6% decrease in motorcycle shipments and a 4.4% decline due to foreign currency exchange.  The average motorcycle revenue per unit was down for the quarter and full year behind unfavorable foreign currency exchange in mix, partially offset by higher pricing.  Both P&A and General Merchandise revenue was adversely affected by unfavorable foreign currency exchange during 2015. 
On Slide 10, you'll see gross margin in the quarter was 31.9%, which was 1.4 percentage points higher than last year. Gross margin performed well with volume, price, raw materials and manufacturing, all being favorable during the quarter, partially offset by unfavorable mix and foreign currency exchange. During the quarter, overall mix was a headwind of $20.9 million driven by unfavorable motorcycle family mix, reflecting the demand for our 2016 Cruiser and Sportster Motorcycles.
Foreign currency exchange was unfavorable for the fourth quarter. This was driven by the significant weakening of our key foreign currencies on a year-over-year basis. The euro, yen, Brazilian real and Australian dollar devalued an average of 13% compared to prior year quarter. This resulted in an unfavorable revenue impact of approximately 3.8% and unfavorable gross margin of $15.3 million for the fourth quarter. 
Full year gross margin was 36.8%, which was up 0.4 percentage points from last year. We were very pleased to be able to increase our full year gross margin percent, especially in the face of very unfavorable currency exchange and lower volumes and believe it is evidenced of our strong underlying margin structure and flexible manufacturing capability. 
On Slide 11, operating margin as a percent of revenue for the fourth quarter was 0.6%, down 2.9 percentage points compared to last year's fourth quarter. As anticipated, operating income of $6.4 million for the quarter was unfavorably impacted by higher SG&A spending, partially offset by very strong gross margin performance. 
SG&A spending was up $36.2 million, driven by reorganization charges, as well as expenses related to the acquisition and operations of our Canadian distribution. Reorganization charges for the quarter totaled $30 million with $23 million being charged to SG&A. 
For the full year, operating margin as a percent of revenue was 16.5%. Going forward, we remain intensely focused on a cost structure that will enable growth and continuous improvement to drive our business to be stronger, more flexible and more profitable. 
Now let's take a look at our Financial Services segment on Slide 12. During the quarter, HDFS's operating profit decreased $1.5 million or 2.5% compared to last year. The primary factors impacting fourth quarter results were, first, net interest income was favorable to prior year by $9.3 million, driven by higher receivables, partially offset by lower yields on receivables due in part to the 2015 low interest rate promotional activity. And second, the provision for retail credit losses was unfavorable to prior year by $7.8 million due to higher credit, retail credit losses and increased reserve rates. 
On a full year basis, HDFS posted an operating profit of $280.2 million, an increase of 0.9% compared to 2014. HDFS's operations are summarized on Slide 13. During the fourth quarter, HDFS's retail loan originations a decreased 1.7% compared to the same period last year. In 2015, loan originations were comprised of approximately 80% prime loans and 20% subprime. As the predominant industry lender a subprime customers, these originations represent a significant number of retail sales to the company at very attractive returns. 
For the full year, HDFS continued to have a strong U.S. retail market share of new Harley-Davidson Motorcycles. HDFS's market share increased 5.4 percentage points, driven in part by promotional activities during the year. 
At the end of the year, we had $321.8 million of cash and cash equivalents at HDFS. In addition, HDFS had $748 million of available liquidity through bank credit and conduit facilities. This month, HDFS issued $1.2 billion in medium-term notes. 
On Slide 14, you'll see the 30-day delinquency rate for retail motorcycle loans at year-end was 3.8%, or 17 basis points higher than last -- than year-end 2014. Delinquency rates across the portfolio up to remain at new record levels. Annual retail credit losses increased by 20 basis points to 1.24% compared to 2014, driven by expected increased losses in the subprime portfolio, lower recovery values on repossess motorcycles, and a recent deterioration in performance in oil-dependent areas of the U.S. 
During 2015, HDFS continued to maintain a strong liquidity position and contributed strong profitability to the company. HDFS remains focused on enabling sales of Harley-Davidson Motorcycles, while providing attractive return to Harley-Davidson, as demonstrated by the $140 million dividend HDFS paid to Harley-Davidson Inc. this month. The remaining Harley-Davidson Inc. financial are summarized on Slide 15. 
The company generated operating cash of $1.10 billion during 2015, down $47 million from last year, driven by lower net income, an increased wholesale lending, partially offset by favorable working capital. Also, the full year tax rate was 34.6%. During the quarter, the R&D tax credit was reinstated for 2015 and going forward. The full year 2015 benefit was recognized fairly in the fourth quarter.  The company has and intends continued to maintain a minimum of 12 months of projected liquidity needs in our committed credit facilities. 
On Slide 16, we have our full year 2015 results. You will see revenue, net income and earnings per share were all below 2014 levels due to a significant increase in overall market competitiveness and adverse impact from currency exchange and higher SG&A behind reorganization charges and product recall expenses. 
Switching our focus to shareholder value on Slide 17. Returning value to our shareholders is a top priority. During the fourth quarter, we paid a dividend of $0.31 per share, a full year payout ratio of 34%. In addition, we purchased 12.7 million shares for $642.4 million. For the full year, we repurchased nearly 28 million shares for $1.5 billion, which was partially funded by $750 million debt issuance in July.  Looking forward, we expect to continue to return excess cash to our shareholders in the form of increased dividends and continued share repurchases. 
On Slide 18, you will see our overall expectations for 2016. In 2016, we expect to ship 269,000 to 274,000 motorcycles, an increase of approximately 1% to 3%. We expect first quarter shipments to be approximately down 2% to up 4%. We expect 2016 global retail sales to grow year-over-year with international retail sales are growing at a faster rate than the U.S. 
Retail sales will be supported by our increased investments. Starting this year, we had a redirected approximate $70 million to drive demand. We expect our 2016 year-over-year investment in customer facing marketing to be up 65% and product development to be up 35%. We expect 2016 worldwide retail sales will face headwinds, as a competition continues to be aggressive with discounting the new product introductions. 
We also anticipate global macroeconomic challenges, including weakness in oil-dependent areas. Internationally, various markets have experienced economic challenges. In particular, Brazil, we expect significant pressure to continue. In response to the nearly 50% devaluation of the Brazilian real last year, we have raised prices over 20% in 2016, and expect sales to be down for the full year. 
U.S. dealer retail inventory is expected to be up at year-end 2016, driven by a addition of new models this year. For the full year 2016, we expect operating margin for the Motorcycles segment to be between 16% and 17%. We believe 2016's gross margin as a percent of revenue will be down year-over-year. We expect a favorable impact for motorcycle pricing and strong productivity gains. And we expect unfavorable foreign currency exchange, unfavorable mix and higher year-over-year startup cost, as we implement our ERP solution at our Kansas City plant. 
To the foreign currency exchange risk, if currencies held at yesterday's exchange rates for the remainder of 2016, we estimate that our expected full year Motorcycles segment revenue would be adversely impacted by approximately 1%. We would expect an unfavorable impact the gross margin of approximately $60 million, driven by lower revenues and lapping last year's hedge benefits, an unfavorable impact to gross margin by approximately 14 percentage point. 
Looking at SG&A, while we'll invest a significant amount more in marketing and product development, we expect full year spending to be flat to up modestly from 2015. As a percent of revenue, we expect SG&A will decrease. During the first quarter, we expect SG&A to be up roughly $25 million versus prior year, as we ramp up our demand driving marketing. 
For HDFS, we expect operating income will be down modestly in 2016 compared to 2015, as a result of increased borrowing cost and unfavorable credit losses, partially offset by higher revenues. Capital expenditures in 2016 are expected to be between $255 million and $275 million as we increase investment in product development, focused on bringing exciting new products to market and as we continued to invest in our systems infrastructure, most notably the implementation of an ERP system. 
Finally, we expect our full year 2016 effective tax rate will be approximately 34.5%. While results fell short of our expectations during the year, we maintained a strong gross margin percent, increased dividends and repurchased $1.5 billion in shares. We're excited about 2016, and have a clear path forward. We're prepared to navigate through the challenging environment and making investments to drive demand, grow our business and achieve our goals. Thank you for your investment in Harley-Davidson. Now, I'll turn it over to Matt."

In October, we laid out our plans for how we intend to increase our focus, investment and resolve to drive demand in 2016 and beyond. Today, I'll elaborate and provide more color on the steps we're taking to build stronger and deeper connections with our loyal, current customers and reach and win new customers, riders and nonriders alike. 
Before I talk about our plans and the results we expect, I think it's important to share some of my context on the macro level. 2015 was a challenging year. Despite our challenges, we were successful in a number of key areas, areas foundational to our forward plans to leverage not only who we are, but what we've proven works to deliver a highly personal and authentic Harley-Davidson experience. Harley-Davidson experience in brand at distinct and uniquely powerful. Without a doubt, we're currently in the most competitive environment we've seen in years, particularly in United States. Much of it is driven by currency and some of it by new products from competitors all around the world. We've always said that product competition is good for the entire industry. It keeps us all on our toes and ultimately the customer wins. To be blunt, we want customers to choose Harley-Davidson, and we're more motivated -- we are more motivated than ever to deliver our best for them. 
We're not expecting the underlying conditions to improve or the competitiveness to diminish. So we've taken a more continued steps necessary to retain and grow our leadership position and our share of the markets we serve, even as we continue to expand into new markets. We're already encouraged by the early results of our demand driving investments that we began in earnest in Q4 of last year. Although, our dealers, retail motorcycle sales were down in aggregate in 2015, as John noted, we held our ground on U.S. market share in the fourth quarter and saw very favorable trends, as key new products hit the marketplace and we began ramping up our marketing investments heading into 2016. 
Performance in United States going forward is mission-critical and so is achieving a leadership position internationally. Among the real bright spots in 2015 was our performance in our Asia Pacific region, where we had our best year ever for retail registrations overall and our 5th consecutive year of growth. 
In Australia, we drove Harley-Davidson to the #1 share position for on-road registrations of all displacements. With the Street 500, playing a key role, not only in those results, but in serving as a learner-approved motorcycle for that market. 
In Canada, the successful transition of a business to a direct distribution model with our own management and strategy for the Canadian market resulted in a 12.3% increase at retail in the quarter. 
Behind these efforts are the best employees in the industry. People who come to work everyday looking for better ways to serve our customers and drive demand for our products. On the Canadian transition, for example, our team completed a smooth and silent transition to direct distribution. On the manufacturing side, we worked together with the IAM to reach a new 6.5 year labor agreement in New York, which ensures the continued strength of our manufacturing operations and our ability to be responsive to our customers globally. 
These are just a few examples of the momentum we're buildilng together to our focus on performing as a company and driving demand. We know we have more to deliver and more to prove. That's our aim, that's our plan. So let's talk about that plant in 2016. 
In managing our powerful brand, we will continue to keep supply in line with demand. But we're now challenging ourselves to more aggressively work the demand side of that equation. Our objectives are clear, and they're aligning and motivating our entire company. #1, lead in every market; 2, grow the sport of motorcycling in the United States, in part, by growing the number of core customers and growing U.S. outreach at a faster rate; 3, grow U.S. retail sales and grow international retail sales at a faster rate; 4, grow revenue and grow earnings at a faster rate through 2020; and 5, outperform the S&P 500. 
As we shared with you before, to achieve these objectives, we -- we've substantially increased our investments in marketing and product development, focused on 4 key areas. First, increasing product and brand awareness. Second, growing new ridership in the United States. Third, increasing and enhancing brand access. And four, accelerating the cadence and impact of new products. 
Since October, we've been ramping up our efforts to give us a running start into the new year. We not only increased our investment and driving demand, we've increased our focus to have greater impact. We built capabilities based on deeper insights to drive greater precision in our marketing and how we and our dealers nurture relationships with current and prospective customers alike. 
Last year, in our EMEA region for example, we increased Touring sales and Touring share by exposing riders to the distinct advantages and capabilities of our Rushmore line. We also generated awareness for our 2016 Cruisers. As a result of our King of All Test Rides campaign, we generated 600,000 web visits, a 100,000 test rides and delivered progress at retail as the year advanced. So we're building on the success in EMEA, as well as other markets as we move into 2016, demonstrating the cool, the comfort, the power and the grace of our products continuous to be one of the best levers in driving sales, and we're going to be more of it. 
To grow the sport of motorcycling in the United States, we're increasing our investment in our Riding Academy programs and giving more people reasons and opportunities to learn to ride. We recently extended the highly successful and powerful learn to ride for free program to current and former members of U.S. Military and first responders through all of 2016. We also plan to increase new Riding Academy U.S. dealer points by 18% in route to our goal to grow the number of graduates to 65,000 in 2016, a 35% increase from 2015. Graduates learning to ride a Harley-Davidson motorcycle at 1 of our incredible dealerships.  And we have plans in place to further engage with these graduates in a products, brand and dealership experiences to convert more of them to new Harley-Davidson owners. 
We're also looking to expand new rider training not only in the U.S., but another key international markets as well. Our presence and will grow as we reach out to engage and connect with more consumers of all demographics, riders and non-riders alike. We'll -- we will be participating in more events and leveraging our key partnerships in the U.S. like UFC games and in other ways across each of the markets globally to engage customers in high-energy venues to drive high-yield traffic to our dealerships. 
We know that increasingly access to our brand through our outstanding dealerships is a demand catalyst. That's why we've steadily continued to both enhance and expand the dealer network, adding 40 new dealer points globally in 2015, including in China, India, Thailand, Vietnam, Germany, Poland and Mexico. By 2020, we plan to add a 150 to 200 dealerships internationally and we continue to work with each and every dealer to enhance the customer experience for every type of customer. 
Now let's talk motorcycles. Our motorcycles and everything we produced must drive passion and excitement in the heart and soul of every rider and every person everywhere, who dreams to ride. As John mentioned, last August, we introduced the high octane S Series Cruiser, the Softail Slim S and the Fat Boy S, both of these are examples of high-impact motorcycles, developed to inspire customers. These 2 models were instrumental and driving mid-single-digit increase at retail for a large Cruisers in the fourth quarter. 
Further leveraging the product development capabilities, we've build over the past few years, with increased investment, is all about more great bikes, more frequently. Just yesterday, we announced 2 powerful cruisers expected to hit dealerships in the spring, the Low Rider S and the CVO Pro Street breakout. The low rider S is the most powerful regular production dynacruiser ever offered by Harley-Davidson. And the Pro Street breakout with its strong drag racing influence adds punch to our customer vehicle operations. Both are designed to appeal to performance-oriented younger riders and are great additions to our sizable leadership in the cruiser category. We expect these bikes to drive traffic, which further drive sales. 
So the bottom line, we've got results. We've set high expectations for ourselves in 2016 and beyond. Results will be the measure of our success. And I'm confident we can achieve what we set out to do because we've done it before. Back in the depths of the recession, we challenged ourselves and committed to grow our relevance and reach among outreach customers and we did it. Over the past 5 years, sales of new Harley-Davidson Motorcycles to outreach customers have grown at a compound annual growth rate of nearly 7%. In fact, in the U.S., we lead in the sale of motorcycles in every outreach segment that includes African-Americans, Hispanics, women of all ages and young adults between the ages of 18 to 34. In this all important young adult segment, we sell more Harley-Davidson Motorcycles to young adults today than we did to the baby boomers when they were young adults. We're committed to go ridership on The Street has helped us to do just that in the first full year since it's launch. 7 out of 10 Harley-Davidson Street riders were new to the brand, and an EMEA that number was 9 out of 10. In India, nearly all Street customers were new to the Harley-Davidson brand. 
We know what we can achieve when we develop and align and commit to a goal. We're building on a strong foundation and challenging ourselves to drive demand and increase our impact and appeal even more broadly as we move forward. These expectations are part of a solid plan that is the result of our experience, capabilities and commitment to lead. We have loyal and passion customers who would be the envy of any business. We have this brand and its incredible legacy. We've got talented and passionate employees and dealers and we've got results. Together, we've never been more fired up to deliver great thanks to everyone, who wants to be a part of all we do. Now, let's take your questions."

So I was just wondering if you could provide us just some details on what was in your balance sheet inventory? And why there was that large increase? And then also, I understand that you're excited about the new models and they've been getting traction, but just wondering, how you can get comfortable with the plan to build inventory given the macro and the competitive challenges that you face and then also the strong basis used bikes at a dealer level?

Is inventory on the balance sheet is up about $137 million, and this is driven by 3 things, #1, and most predominantly is higher finished goods inventory, I'll come back and talk abou",460,"All right. Thanks Felicia. Let's start with the balance sheet question. Is inventory on the balance sheet is up about $137 million, and this is driven by 3 things, #1, and most predominantly is higher finished goods inventory, I'll come back and talk about that in a second. Secondly is our related business inventory in Parts & Accessories and General Merchandise is up, as we look to improve customer service and optimize our inventory -- our product flows dealer network. And then thirdly, with the acquisition of Canada, we certainly acquired finished goods and Parts & Accessories and General Merchandise accessories with that acquisition. Getting back to the largest driver of that, which is finished goods inventory. We've talked last couple of quarters that we're going to increase production in the fourth quarter. We got very good and flexible manufacturing, and in the previous couple years, we took our production down in the fourth quarter quite significantly. And we hit a point of diminishing returns. So we wanted to put some production back in the fourth quarter, which we've done. And certainly, reflected in our gross margin for the quarter. Secondly, and that's coincident with the change in our investment profile in significantly, increasing the amount of dollars that you are bringing to drive demand and we're pulling that forward very early in the first quarter. That effective we're starting some of that in December. And so we wanted to do is to put forward the shipments for the selling season to our dealer network by several weeks. And so we're coming into the year with a little bit more inventory so that we can get it out to the dealer network and fulfill the inventories with the marketing spending going up. So we feel very good about where we're at and I'm already to start 2016. The second question was with regards to the next year's retail inventory. And we said that we had expect that to be up behind new model introductions. So Felicia, 2 of these new models were just introduced yesterday. So similar to this year, our inventories were up 2,600 units behind a couple new -- incremental models and it just represents the dealer fill for those models, and we would expect the same in 2016. Given the environment that we're in, we're moving into, we feel very comfortable about where we ended our dealer inventories this year. Matter of fact, our dealer network would probably suggest that they would like more inventory they would certainly, suggest they would like more inventory. And we're going to continue to aggressively manage supply in line with demand, next year is no difference, and we would expect the sales to be similar to this year for next year."

The next question that you asked is with regards to discounting at MSRP and our dealerships, our dealers are very independent, and our folks, they can offer discounts and some of them. What we can do is, not allow them to enterprise any discounts and it's something that reinforce very much and we do not condone or what our products to be discounted.

The best thing that we can do is to aggressively manage supply in line with the inventory so that we don't create an environment where we're discounting would be more encouraged."

When we look at the fourth quarter, we saw the decline, our worldwide basis, come down significantly. It was running at 1.4%, down for the first 3 quarters, and was only down 6/10. And in addition to that, I'm very pleased with market share. We have -- we had expected as we got in the lapping the onset of the competitiveness that's started 4 quarters ago late in the fourth quarter, that we would see market share stabilize and we're very pleased to see it. So certainly, a big turnaround in market share in the fourth quarter. We were running down at a rate of 3.7 points and we're flat in the fourth quarter. And in Europe as well, was running down about 1.6 through 3 quarters and down only 6/10. So this is what we would have expected. As we look forward in the 2016, we would expect certainly more stable shares in 2016 versus 2015. The overall growth in the company is going to driven by new products, not 2016 is going very well as Matt has mentioned, our cruisers are up on a year-over-year basis and we just added 2 new cruisers to the lineup as of yesterday. Out doing absolutely, fantastic, up 6.5% this year growing faster than our quote, which is our world. As well as growing at double the date of the industry and that we're par $70 million more marketing spending. So we realize that our price gaps are larger and we don't expect them to close. Because of the discounting, we expect that to continue, but we are bringing a lot more dollars to bear on that to help mitigate the impact of expanded price gaps. And then finally, international expansion, we added 40 dealers last year, most of them in the back half and we'd we expect to have similar levels in the next 5 years year and that will drive a lot of our sales. All of that in the context of much easier comps and for us as we go forward, in the 2016. So we're excited about 2016, and we're confident and our ability to grow 1% to 3%."

So what we're seeing is in the first quarter you are going to see most more of the pronounced mix as we ship those into the dealer network because the band is higher for them and we need to ship into that. But we would also expect to see those to continue to sell well until what products come out in the next model year. So as we talked about in our gross margin, which we expect to be down one of the reasons for that is, unfavorable mix. So we would expect to see, not necessarily the same magnitude as we saw in the first quarter because we're setting up the dealer network with inventory as well, but unfavorable mix due to the fact that we're shipping in those cruisers, which includes the Sportsters that have been redone.

So one of the questions is why we have 123 today and how does that would be on 2016 into the future. And basically, what we tempered from just 3 months ago is, we still feel just as confident about our plans for 2016. Our expectation in the fourth quarter finish right on expectations. We're seeing the improvement that we needed to launch into 2016. The turnaround this growth. All of that's in place. All were recognizing with 1 to 3 is the increased risks in the macroeconomic trends, both in United States and around the world. A lot is changed in those 3 months, whether it be oil prices on the slowdown in China, geopolitical issues around the world, and we're simply recognizing that change. And as the macroeconomics improve, we'll see what would 2017 and '18 brings, but we feel very good about the underlying strength of our business, the sales opportunities, as well as strengths that we've seen in our gross margin."

And I'm working to change some of our underwriting or tweak some of our underwriting to address that. Within the United States, the oil patch represents a minority of our overall volumes, but it is of concern, and we have seen it getting a little bit worse in last several quarters, we still believe it's management as a BR moving to 2016. When you look at Canada, Russia, the Middle East and very so that parts around the world are being affected by low oil prices, and I think quite understandably, a lot of those folks are losing their employment and are concerned about their employment and are slowing down on their spending. But again, we've taken that into consideration with our overall guidance and still expect to be able to grow in 2016."

With regards to the industry, industry retail sales, Joe, we do not provide a forward-looking forecast for that.

With regards to the industry, industry retail sales, Joe, we do not provide a forward-looking forecast for that. Certainly, we see more caution, just given the overall macroeconomic trends, but we don't provide a forecast. You can say that over the last 5 years, the industry is growing pretty steady about 3%, this year was no different, overall industry was up 4.8, but when you remove autocycles, which we don't believe competes with the traditional Motorcycles segment, the industry was up about 2.8%. So this year was right in line with the previous 2 years. What I can say is that, as we enter into 2016, we would expect the first quarter or 2, the industry to be down as they lap or the competitors lap, the kind of the growth that the experience only on and the discounting cycle. And some of the forward volumes that they enjoyed. This year, the industry growth was driven by the front half and again, the pull forward of volume into the first couple of quarters. But overall, we're in an environment that we believe we can grow our worldwide shipments by 1 to 3, but are not going to provide a number on the industry. 
The second question was on CapEx. Our CapEx guidance for this year is $255 million to $275 million. Actual CapEx in during the year was $260 million. And as you noted, Joe, is up a bit. And that is driven by 2 things. One is new product development, we talked about that in a quarter ago, that we're increasing our new product spending, which heads SG&A, the expense side of it, by 35% by the certainly, corresponding part of that for us to develop those Motorcycles and fair amount of capital goes into that. And you're seeing that reflected in our guidance. And then secondly is as we continue to extend our ERP solution, we're moving it to Kansas City. We're very excited about that. If you remember about 3 years ago, we put system in New York and it has done a fantastic job for us in terms of helping drive sustainable productivity. So that is another big area of capital spending this year. So on some of these things you're going to see from year-to-year, capital going up and down depending upon quite we might be working on, in terms of systems upgrades or new product development. But we're not going to provide a long-term view of overall capital."

And then another you mentioned, I would point out, that when you look at our overall retail sales for the year and 2015 was a difficult year and we certainly fell short of expectations. But in the vein of keeping at all in perspective, our retail sales were down 1.3% on the year, but when you do adjust for that refleeting of a motorcycles that went into the Rider Academy with our new Street 500 Motorcycles in 2014, retail sales were down only 4/10. And while these results are certainly disappointing to us, we did achieve it in the face of some of the most significant shifts in world currencies that we have ever seen and unprecedented levels of discounting, where 95% of our competition certainly gained a competitive -- price advantage above the 20% to 30%. So with that, overall tough year, a retail sales were only down 4 tenths of a percent of we did it all without damaging on the brand by coming discounting, we did it by growing gross margin in the face of incredible headwinds. We're highly disciplined managing our free dating industries and we do it without violating us mistrust loyalty. to start to get better of my chats. It's been a tough year, but I think keeping all in perspective, is a competition through the best of they could muster and overall, retail sales were down 4/10. And I know there is some out there whether we can grow next year, but given the year we've had this year, all the things that we've realigned to compete into 2016, the money we're bringing to bear, the new products that we're we're bringing to bear including 2 just we came out with the $70 million of incremental spending, the international expansion, again, we feel great about our business, we feel great about moving forward into 2016, and we feel great about our ability to grow in 2016.

Thanks for the question.

One is the number of dealers that offer the academy. The power of having riders learn on a Street -- Harley-Davidson Street Motorcycles that's available for sale. I have personal experience that my wife took Riding Academy in the summer of 2014 on the Street 500 and I tried to give to the buy Softail because I really wanted to get more another motorcycle than I would also ride, and she wanted a Street 500 because she learned to ride on Street 500, and so that's what she got.

The summary of our fourth quarter financial results start on Slide 4.",2619,"Thanks, Amy. Good morning, everyone. Today, I'll provide additional insight around our fourth quarter and full year financial results found in our press release and supporting slides. The summary of our fourth quarter financial results start on Slide 4. 
During the quarter, revenue was $1.18 billion. Net income was $42.2 million, and diluted earnings per share were $0.22. Operating income from the Motorcycle segment was down $29.5 million from last year's fourth quarter. Segment revenue was down versus prior year, driven by unfavorable mix and currency exchange, partially offset by higher shipments. Additionally, SG&A was higher, driven by reorganization charges, which enabled the shift in our operating investment profile to drive more demand. Operating income headwinds were partially offset by strong gross margin percent. 
At HDFS, operating income was down 2.5% year-over-year. The quarter also reflected higher corporate interest expense, resulting from our 2015 recapitalization. Despite the challenging conditions we face throughout 2015, we continue to focus on delivering strong margins and strong returns over the long term. 
Now let's take a look at our retail sales on Slide 5. Worldwide retail sales of new Harley-Davidson Motorcycles were down 0.6% in the fourth quarter, an improvement from the last three quarters trend when sales were down 1.4%. The decline in U.S. retail sales was partially offset by increases in international markets during the quarter. Globally, sales were impacted by ongoing aggressive competitive activity and macroeconomic challenges. On the positive side, our new 2016 model year motorcycles, including the 2 S models, the Road Glide Ultra and our refreshed Forty-Eight and Iron 883 models all sold very well since our initial roll out. 
For the full year, worldwide retail sales were down 1.3% compared to last year. 2015 retail sales reflected a significant increase in competitiveness behind currency-driven discounting and the introduction of new products by a number of our competitors. During 2015, we took significant steps to improve our competitiveness without engaging and brand damaging discounting. We have significantly shifted our operating investment profile for 2016, redirecting approximately $70 million of existing spending toward demand driving marketing and product development investment. 
Let's take a look at the U.S. market on Slide 6. Retail sales in the U.S. were down 3.4% in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year behind intense competitive pressure and a challenging macroeconomic environment. These significant headwinds were partially offset by demand for new products, including our new Cruiser motorcycles. In fact, U.S. Cruiser retail sales were up in the fourth quarter, driven by strong sales of our 2 new Softail S models, our first year-over-year increase in the Cruiser segment in 8 quarters.  We also saw strong motorcycle sales to Riding Academy graduates, driven by our Military Learn To Ride for Free program in the U.S. 
For the quarter, U.S. retail market share was flat to last year at 51.4%. As expected, the market share trend substantially improved from previous quarter's trends of down 3.7% -- 3.7 points. The improvement reflects our FX to mitigate the impact of widening price gaps and the lapping of the aggressive competitiveness that started late in Q4 2014. 
For the full year, our retail sales were down 1.7%. For our full year market share -- our full year market share of 50.2% was down 3.1 percentage points year-over-year. While we anticipated some level of share loss following the 13.4 points of share that we gained in recent years, our 2015 share was more severely impacted than we expected as a result of the competitive environment and the inclusion of autocycles in the industry numbers. Finally, as expected, U.S. dealer retail inventory was up approximately 2,600 motorcycles at the end of 2015 compared to 2014, largely due to the initial dealer fill of our new 2016 motorcycles. We were comfortable with year-end dealer inventory levels as we continued to aggressively manage supply in line with demand. 
On Slide 7, you'll see retail sales and our international markets were up 3.1% in the fourth quarter. EMEA region retail sales were down 1.7% in Q4 due to continued pressure from the introduction of new low price models by the competition and a very tough prior year comparison of up 8.7%. 
For the full year, EMEA retail sales were down 4.5%, and full year market share in Europe was 10.5%. While market share was down 1.5 percentage point for the year, fourth quarter share was down only 0.6 percentage points, an improvement over the prior quarter share trends. Asia Pacific region retail sales were up 8.2% in the fourth quarter, driven by strong sales in emerging markets and in Australia, partially offset by soft sales in Japan. While retail sales were down in Japan, we gained market share during the quarter. For the full year, Asia Pacific retail sales were up 7.3%. Latin America retail sales were down 1.5% in the quarter as a result of declines in Brazil, partially offset by strong growth in Mexico. Brazil's retail sales have been impacted by a slowing economy, consumer uncertainty and very aggressive price competition. For the full year, retail sales in Latin America were down 4.1%. 
Finally, retail sales in Canada were up 12.3% in the fourth quarter, but down 2.0% for the full year. We believe the market responded well to the change with direct distribution model and to a price reduction on 2016 model year motorcycles. We plan to leverage international growth opportunities by expanding distribution and increasing our brand relevance by delivering exceptional products that inspire riders. In 2015, we added 40 international dealerships and plan to add 150 to 200 through 2020. 
On Slide 8, you'll see wholesale shipments of Harley-Davidson Motorcycles in the quarter were up 2.1% compared to last year and within our expected range. The shipment mix reflects our product investments in model year 2016, as we shipped a significantly higher percent of Cruiser and Street Sportster compared to last year. 
On Slide 9, you'll see revenue for the motorcycle and related product segment was down in the fourth quarter despite an increase in motorcycles shipments. Q4 revenue was unfavorably impacted by currency exchange, which reduced revenue by approximately 3.8% and unfavorable mix. 
For the full year, motorcycles segment revenue was down 4.7% behind a 1.6% decrease in motorcycle shipments and a 4.4% decline due to foreign currency exchange.  The average motorcycle revenue per unit was down for the quarter and full year behind unfavorable foreign currency exchange in mix, partially offset by higher pricing.  Both P&A and General Merchandise revenues was adversely affected by unfavorable foreign currency exchange during 2015. 
On Slide 10, you'll see gross margin in the quarter was 31.9%, which was 1.4 percentage points higher than last year. Gross margin performed well with volume, price, raw materials and manufacturing, all being favorable during the quarter, partially offset by unfavorable mix and foreign currency exchange. During the quarter, overall mix was a headwind of $20.9 million, driven by unfavorable motorcycle family mix, reflecting the demand for our 2016 Cruiser and Sportster Motorcycles.
Foreign currency exchange was unfavorable for the fourth quarter. This was driven by the significant weakening of our key foreign currencies on a year-over-year basis. The euro, yen, Brazilian real and Australian dollar devalued an average of 13% compared to prior year quarter. This resulted in an unfavorable revenue impact of approximately 3.8% and unfavorable gross margin of $15.3 million for the fourth quarter. Full year gross margin was 36.8%, which was up 0.4 percentage points from last year. We were very pleased to be able to increase our full year gross margin percent, especially in the face of very unfavorable currency exchange and lower volumes, and believe it is evidence of our strong underlying margin structure and flexible manufacturing capability. 
On Slide 11, operating margin as a percent of revenue for the fourth quarter was 0.6%, down 2.9 percentage points compared to last year's fourth quarter. As anticipated, operating income of $6.4 million for the quarter was unfavorably impacted by higher SG&A spending, partially offset by very strong gross margin performance.  SG&A spending was up $36.2 million, driven by reorganization charges, as well as expenses related to the acquisition and operations of our Canadian distribution. Reorganization charges for the quarter totaled $30 million with $23 million being charged to SG&A. For the full year, operating margin, as a percent of revenue, was 16.5%. Going forward, we remain intensely focused on a cost structure that will enable growth and continuous improvement to drive our business to be stronger, more flexible and more profitable. 
Now let's take a look at our Financial Services segment on Slide 12. During the quarter, HDFS' operating profit decreased $1.5 million or 2.5% compared to last year. The primary factors impacting fourth quarter results were, first, net interest income was favorable to prior year by $9.3 million, driven by higher receivables, partially offset by lower yields on receivables due in part to the 2015 low interest rate promotional activity. And second, the provision for retail credit losses was unfavorable to prior year by $7.8 million due to higher credit, retail credit losses and increased reserve rates.  On a full year basis, HDFS posted an operating profit of $280.2 million, an increase of 0.9% compared to 2014. 
HDFS' operations are summarized on Slide 13. During the fourth quarter, HDFS' retail motorcycle loan originations decreased 1.7% compared to the same period last year. In 2015, loan originations were comprised of approximately 80% prime loans and 20% sub-prime. As the predominant industry lender to sub-prime customers, these originations represent a significant number of retail sales to the company at very attractive returns. For the full year, HDFS continued to have a strong U.S. retail market share of new Harley-Davidson Motorcycles. HDFS' market share increased 5.4 percentage points, driven in part by promotional activity during the year. At the end of the year, we had $321.8 million of cash and cash equivalents at HDFS. In addition, HDFS had $748 million of available liquidity through bank credit and conduit facilities. This month, HDFS issued $1.2 billion in medium-term notes. 
On Slide 14, you'll see the 30-day delinquency rate for retail motorcycle loans at year-end was 3.8% or 17 basis points higher than last -- than year-end 2014. Delinquency rates across the portfolio, while up, remain at new record levels. Annual retail credit losses increased by 20 basis points to 1.42% compared to 2014, driven by expected increased losses in the sub-prime portfolio, lower recovery values on repossessed motorcycles, and a recent deterioration in performance in oil-dependent areas of the U.S. 
During 2015, HDFS continued to maintain a strong liquidity position and contributed strong profitability to the company. HDFS remains focused on enabling sales of Harley-Davidson Motorcycles, while providing attractive return to Harley-Davidson, as demonstrated by the $140 million dividend HDFS paid to Harley-Davidson Inc. this month. The remaining Harley-Davidson Inc. financials are summarized on Slide 15. The company generated operating cash of $1.10 billion during 2015, down $47 million from last year, driven by lower net income, and increased wholesale lending, partially offset by favorable working capital. Also, the full year tax rate was 34.6%. During the quarter, the R&D tax credit was reinstated for 2015 and going forward. The full year 2015 benefit was recognized entirely in the fourth quarter.  The company has and intends to continue to maintain a minimum of 12 months of projected liquidity needs in cash and/or committed credit facilities. 
On Slide 16, we have our full year 2015 results. You will see revenue, net income and earnings per share were all below 2014 levels due to a significant increase in overall market competitiveness and adverse impact from currency exchange and higher SG&A behind reorganization charges and product recall expenses. 
Switching our focus to shareholder value on Slide 17. Returning value to our shareholders is a top priority. During the fourth quarter, we paid a dividend of $0.31 per share, a full year payout ratio of 34%. In addition, we purchased 12.7 million shares for $642.4 million. For the full year, we repurchased nearly 28 million shares for $1.5 billion, which was partially funded by the $750 million debt issuance in July. Looking forward, we expect to continue to return excess cash to our shareholders in the form of increased dividends and continued share repurchases. 
On Slide 18, you will see our overall expectations for 2016. In 2016, we expect to ship 269,000 to 274,000 motorcycles, an increase of approximately 1% to 3%. We expect first quarter shipments to be approximately down 2% to up 4%. We expect 2016 global retail sales to grow year-over-year with international retail sales growing at a faster rate than the U.S. Retail sales will be supported by our increased investments. Starting this year, we have redirected approximately $70 million to drive demand. We expect our 2016 year-over-year investment in customer facing marketing to be up 65% and product development to be up 35%. We expect 2016 worldwide retail sales will face headwinds, as the competition continues to be aggressive with discounting the new product introductions. 
We also anticipate global macroeconomic challenges, including weakness in oil-dependent areas. Internationally, various markets have experienced economic challenges. In particular, Brazil, we expect the significant pressure to continue. In response to the nearly 50% devaluation of the Brazilian real last year, we have raised prices over 20% in 2016, and expect sales to be down for the full year. 
U.S. dealer retail inventory is expected to be up at year-end 2016, driven by the addition of new models this year. For the full year 2016, we expect operating margin for the motorcycles segment to be between 16% and 17%. We believe 2016's gross margin as a percent of revenue will be down year-over-year. We expect a favorable impact for motorcycle pricing and strong productivity gains. And we expect unfavorable foreign currency exchange, unfavorable mix and higher year-over-year startup cost, as we implement our ERP solution at our Kansas City plant. 
To dimensional-ize the foreign currency exchange risk, if currencies held at yesterday's exchange rates for the remainder of 2016, we estimate that our expected full year motorcycles segment revenue would be adversely impacted by approximately 1%. We would expect an unfavorable impact to gross margin of approximately $60 million, driven by lower revenues and lapping last year's hedge benefits, an unfavorable impact to gross margin by approximately 1 full percentage point. 
Looking at SG&A, while we will invest a significant amount more in marketing and product development, we expect full year spending to be flat to up modestly from 2015. As a percent of revenue, we expect SG&A will decrease. During the first quarter, we expect SG&A to be up roughly $25 million versus prior year, as we ramp up our demand driving marketing. For HDFS, we expect operating income will be down modestly in 2016 compared to 2015, as a result of increased borrowing cost and unfavorable credit losses, partially offset by higher revenues. Capital expenditures in 2016 are expected to be between $255 million and $275 million as we increase investment in product development, focused on bringing exciting new products to market, and as we continued to invest in our systems infrastructure, most notably, the implementation of an ERP system. 
Finally, we expect our full year 2016 effective tax rate will be approximately 34.5%. While results fell short of our expectations during the year, we maintained a strong gross margin percent, increased dividends and repurchased $1.5 billion in shares. We're excited about 2016, and have a clear path forward. We're prepared to navigate through the challenging environment and making investments to drive demand, grow our business and achieve our goals. Thank you for your investment in Harley-Davidson. Now I'll turn it over to Matt."

In October, we laid out our plans for how we intend to increase our focus, investment and resolve to drive demand in 2016 and beyond. Today, I'll elaborate and provide more color on the steps we're taking to build stronger and deeper connections with our loyal, current customers and reach and win new customers, riders and non-riders alike. 
Before I talk about our plans and the results we expect, I think it's important to share some of my context on the macro level. 2015 was a challenging year. Yet despite our challenges, we were successful in a number of key areas, areas foundational to our forward plans to leverage not only who we are, but what we've proven works to deliver a highly personal and authentic Harley-Davidson experience. The Harley-Davidson experience in brand are distinct and uniquely powerful. Without a doubt, we're currently in the most competitive environment we've seen in years, particularly in United States. Much of it is driven by currency and some of it by new products from competitors all around the world. We've always said that product competition is good for the entire industry. It keeps us all on our toes, and ultimately, the customer wins. To be blunt, we want customers to choose Harley-Davidson, and we are more motivated than ever to deliver our best for them. 
We're not expecting the underlying conditions to improve or the competitiveness to diminish. So we've taken and we'll continue to take steps necessary to retain and grow our leadership position and our share of the markets we serve even as we continue to expand into new markets. We're already encouraged by the early results of our demand driving investments that we began in earnest in Q4 of last year. Although, our dealers, retail motorcycle sales were down in aggregate in 2015, as John noted, we held our ground on U.S. market share in the fourth quarter and saw very favorable trends, as key new products hit the marketplace and we began ramping up our marketing investments heading into 2016. 
Performance in the United States going forward is mission-critical, and so is achieving a leadership position internationally. Among the real bright spots in 2015 was our performance in our Asia Pacific region, where we had our best year ever for retail registrations overall and our 5th consecutive year of growth. In Australia, we drove Harley-Davidson to the #1 share position for on-road registrations of all displacements with the Street 500, playing a key role, not only in those results, but in serving as a learner-approved motorcycle for that market. In Canada, the successful transition of the business to a direct distribution model with our own management and strategy for the Canadian market resulted in a 12.3% increase at retail in the quarter. 
Behind these efforts are the best employees in the industry, people who come to work everyday looking for better ways to serve our customers and drive demand for our products. On the Canadian transition, for example, our team completed a smooth and silent transition to direct distribution. On the manufacturing side, we worked together with the IAM to reach a new 6.5 year labor agreement in New York, which ensures the continued strength of our manufacturing operations and our ability to be responsive to our customers globally.  These are just a few examples of the momentum we're building together through our focus on performing as a company and driving demand. We know we have more to deliver and more to prove. That's our aim. That's our plan. 
So let's talk about that plan in 2016. In managing our powerful brand, we will continue to keep supply in line with demand, but we're now challenging ourselves to more aggressively work the demand side of that equation. Our objectives are clear, and they're aligning and motivating our entire company: number one, lead in every market; two, grow the sport of motorcycling in the United States, in part by growing the number of core customers and growing U.S. outreach at a faster rate; three, grow U.S. retail sales and grow international retail sales at a faster rate; four, grow revenue and grow earnings at a faster rate through 2020; and five, outperform the S&P 500. 
As we shared with you before, to achieve these objectives, we've substantially increased our investments in marketing and product development, focused on 4 key areas. First, increasing product and brand awareness. Second, growing new ridership in the United States. Third, increasing and enhancing brand access; and four, accelerating the cadence and impact of new products. Since October, we've been ramping up our efforts to give us a running start into the new year. We've not only increased our investment in driving demand, we've increased our focus to have greater impact. We've built capabilities based on deeper insights to drive greater precision in our marketing and how we and our dealers nurture relationships with current and prospective customers alike. 
Last year, in our EMEA region for example, we increased Touring sales and Touring share by exposing riders to the distinct advantages and capabilities of our Rushmore line. We also generated awareness for our 2016 Cruisers. As a result of our ""King of All Test Rides"" campaign, we generated 600,000 web visits, 100,000 test rides and delivered progress at retail as the year advanced. So we're building on the success in EMEA, as well as other markets as we move into 2016, demonstrating the cool, the comfort, the power and the grace of our products continuous to be one of the best levers in driving sales, and we're going to be doing more of it. 
To grow the sport of motorcycling in the United States, we're increasing our investment in our Riding Academy programs and giving more people reasons and opportunities to learn to ride. We recently extended the highly successful and powerful Learn to Ride for Free program to current and former members of U.S. Military and first responders through all of 2016. We also plan to increase new Riding Academy U.S. dealer points by 18% in route to our goal to grow the number of graduates to 65,000 in 2016, a 35% increase from 2015, graduates learning to ride a Harley-Davidson motorcycle at one of our incredible dealerships. And we have plans in place to further engage these graduates in our products, brand and dealership experiences to convert more of them to new Harley-Davidson owners. 
We're also looking to expand new rider training, not only in the U.S., but in other key international markets as well. Our presence will grow as we reach out, engage and connect with more consumers of all demographics, riders and non-riders alike. We'll -- we will be participating in more events and leveraging our key partnerships in the U.S., like UFC and X Games, and in other ways across each market globally to engage customers in high-energy venues to drive high-yield traffic to our dealerships. We know that increasing the access to our brand through our outstanding dealerships is a demand catalyst. That's why we've steadily continued to both enhance and expand the dealer network, adding 40 new dealer points globally in 2015, including in China, India, Thailand, Vietnam, Germany, Poland and Mexico. By 2020, we plan to add 150 to 200 dealerships internationally, and we continue to work with each and every dealer to enhance the customer experience for every type of customer. 
Now let's talk motorcycles. Our motorcycles and everything we produce must drive passion and excitement in the heart and soul of every rider and every person everywhere, who dreams to ride. As John mentioned, last August, we introduced the high octane S Series Cruisers, the Softail Slim S and the Fat Boy S. Both of these are examples of high-impact motorcycles, developed to inspire customers. These 2 models were instrumental and driving mid-single-digit increase at retail for our large Cruisers in the fourth quarter. 
Further leveraging the product development capabilities we've build over the past few years with increased investment is all about more great bikes, more frequently. Just yesterday, we announced 2 powerful cruisers expected to hit dealerships in the spring, the Low Rider S and the CVO Pro Street breakout. The Low Rider S is the most powerful regular production Dyna Cruiser ever offered by Harley-Davidson. And the Pro Street breakout with its strong drag racing influence adds punch to our custom vehicle operations. Both are designed to appeal to performance-oriented younger riders, and are great additions to our sizable leadership in the cruiser category. We expect these bikes to drive traffic, which further drive sales. 
So the bottom line, we've got results. We've set high expectations for ourselves in 2016 and beyond. Results will be the measure of our success. And I'm confident we can achieve what we set out to do because we've done it before. Back in the depths of the recession, we challenged ourselves and committed to grow our relevance and reach among outreach customers and we did it. Over the past 5 years, sales of new Harley-Davidson Motorcycles to outreach customers have grown at a compound annual growth rate of nearly 7%. In fact, in the U.S., we lead in the sale of motorcycles in every outreach segment that includes African-Americans, Hispanics, women of all ages and young adults between the ages of 18 and 34. In this all important young adult segment, we sell more Harley-Davidson Motorcycles to young adults today than we did to the baby boomers when they were young adults. We're committed to grow ridership and The Street has helped us to do just that in the first full year since it's launch. 7 out of 10 Harley-Davidson Street riders were new to the brand, and in EMEA, that number was 9 out of 10. In India, nearly all Street customers were new to the Harley-Davidson brand. 
We know what we can achieve when we develop and align and commit to a goal. We're building on a strong foundation and challenging ourselves to drive demand and increase our impact and appeal even more broadly as we move forward. These expectations are part of a solid plan that is the result of our experience, capabilities and commitment to lead. We have loyal and passionate customers who would be the envy of any business. We have this brand and its incredible legacy. We've got talented and passionate employees and dealers and we got resolve. Together, we've never been more fired up to deliver great thanks to everyone who wants to be a part of all we do. Now let's take your questions."

And then also, I understand that you're excited about the new models and they've been getting traction, but just wondering, how you can get comfortable with the plan to build inventory given the macro and the competitive challenges that you face and then also the strong basis used bikes that are at the dealer level?

Let's start with the balance sheet question is inventory on the balance sheet is up about $137 million, and this is driven by 3 things, number one, and most predominantly, is higher finished goods inventory. I'll come back and",459,"All right. Thanks, Felicia. Let's start with the balance sheet question is inventory on the balance sheet is up about $137 million, and this is driven by 3 things, number one, and most predominantly, is higher finished goods inventory. I'll come back and talk about that in a second. Secondly is our related business inventory in Parts and Accessories and General Merchandise is up, as we look to improve customer service and optimize our product flows dealer network. And then thirdly, with the acquisition of Canada, we certainly acquired finished goods and Parts & Accessories and General Merchandise inventory with that acquisition. Getting back to the largest driver of that, which is finished goods inventory, we've talked the last couple of quarters that we were going to increase production in the fourth quarter. We got very good at flexible manufacturing, and the previous couple years, we took our production down in the fourth quarter quite significantly, and we hit a point of diminishing returns. So we wanted to put some production back in the fourth quarter, which we've done. And certainly, reflected in our gross margin for the quarter. Secondly, and that's coincident with the change in our investment profile and significantly increasing the amount of dollars that we're bringing to drive demand and we're pulling that forward very early in the first quarter. A matter of fact, we started some of that in December. And so what we want to do is to pull forward the shipments for the selling season to our dealer network by several weeks. And so we're coming into the year with a little bit more inventory so that we can get it out to the dealer network and fulfill the inventories with the marketing spending going up. So we feel very good about where we're at and I'm all ready to start 2016. The second question was with regards to next year's retail inventory, and we said that we expect that to be up behind new model introductions. So Felicia, 2 of these new models were just introduced yesterday. So similar to this year, our inventories were up 2,600 units behind a couple new -- incremental models and it just represents the dealer fill for those models, and we would expect the same in 2016. Given the environment that we're in, we're moving into, we feel very comfortable about where we ended our dealer inventories this year. Matter of fact, our dealer network would probably suggest that they would like more inventory. They would certainly suggest they would like more inventory, and we're going to continually aggressively manage supply in line with demand. Next year is no difference, and we would expect day sales to be similar to this year for next year."

It's that there is some softness in prices at auctions, and that's increasing some of the losses that we're seeing at auction. Again, in the dealer network, through the first 3 quarters, prices were very firm. We were noting that Touring was up a little bit.  Sportster were flat. And Softails -- I'm sorry. Cruisers were down. As we move into the fourth quarter, we are seeing a little bit more softness in the dealer network, with prices down slightly."

Can you talk a little bit about deviations from that with regard to your dealer channel just hearing more and more grumblings about dealers cutting sizeable discounts relative to MSRP? And then I guess, related to that used bike question, remind us how you think about sort of the backward-looking credit losses. Obviously, we've seen those losses pick up, and that's impacted in your guidance for HDFS going forward, but at what point do we have to worry about maybe writing-down receivables as we look backward in terms of credit losses?"

What we do is we do inventory a small number of repos as they come in, but you're talking a very small balance. And we mark those. We mark them every month of every quarter that are marked to market. So we would never expect to have a large write-down in terms of the repo inventory that is ours. Again, that's a very nominal amount of bikes that flow through us. The next question that you asked is with regards to discounting at MSRP in our dealerships. Our dealers are independent folks. And they can offer discounts, and some of them do. What we can do is not allow them to advertise any discounts. And it's something that we enforce very much. We do not condone or want our products to be discounted, but as you pointed out, James, they do at times. And they just can't advertise it. The best thing that we can do is to aggressively manage supply in line with inventories so that we don't create an environment where discounting would be more encouraged."

Generally speaking, the health of the dealer network is back to typical levels prerecession, but there is always local issues of -- that are dealt with by the field teams, so there's no structural issue that we see at all.

Our question really revolves around the market and what seems to be a positive change in the competitive environment, at least more recently. However, we're still a little bit surprised as to why the overall market is not improving. I think we're approximately 35% below prior peak in U.S. retail registrations. And presumably, a lot of the core drivers are improving with high-end manufacturing and construction wages growing. Both those are highly correlated with sales. So the market declined in 4Q '15 despite these. What's your take on why growth has stalled in the market? And any perspective on this is really helpful."

When we talk about the new bike sales still being under the peak levels, I think you had mentioned 35%, this is a function of the industry that grew for 20 straight years at a very high CAGR that ended and peaked in 2006. And with the recession that started in 2007 and 2008, we had a kind of a rebalancing of new-used. So leading up to that, it was about 1:1 relationship. And after the recession, for us, it became about 2.5:1. And since then, it's been very stable. I think we're at 2.3:1 right now. We do not expect there to be a bounce back. I mean we said this 5 years ago. It's that it is just the dynamics of a rapidly growing inventory industry. And with that change in the balance of overall new-to-used for us in the industry, we had equilibrium in the fourth quarter of 2010. And we expect to grow off of that but are not expecting any bounce back in any dramatic way to get back to the previous levels. We believe we'll get there, but it is going to take some time."

When we look at the fourth quarter, we saw the decline on a worldwide basis come down significantly. It was running at 1.4%, down for the first 3 quarters and was only down 0.6%. And in addition to that, I'm very pleased with market share. We have -- we had expected, as we got into lapping the onset of the competitiveness that started 4 quarters ago, late in the fourth quarter, that we would see market share stabilize. And we're very pleased to see it. So certainly a big turnaround in market share in the fourth quarter. We were running down at a rate of 3.7 points and were flat in the fourth quarter; and in Europe as well, was running down about 1.6 through 3 quarters and down only 0.6%. So this is what we would have expected. As we look forward into 2016, we would expect certainly more stable shares in 2016 versus 2015. The overall growth in the company is going to be driven by new products. Model year 2016 is doing very well, as Matt had mentioned. Our cruisers are up on a year-over-year basis, and we just added 2 new cruisers to the lineup as of yesterday. Outreach is doing absolutely fantastic, up 6.5% this year; growing faster than our core, which has been our goal, as well as growing at double the rate of the industry. And then we've got $70 million more marketing spending. So we realize that our price gaps are larger. We don't expect them to close because of the discounting. We expect that to continue, but we are bringing a lot more dollars to bear on that to help mitigate the impact of expanded price gaps. And then finally, international expansion, we added 40 dealers net last year, most of them in the back half. And we'd we expect to add similar levels over the next 5 years, and that will drive a lot of our sales. All of that in the context of much easier comps for us as we go forward into 2016. So we are excited about 2016, and we're confident in our ability to grow 1% to 3%."

If you remember, we have the 103 high put out -- output engine across all of our cruisers and certainly the S models. So what we're seeing is -- in the first quarter is you're going to see more of a pronounced mix as we ship those into the dealer network because the band is higher for them and we need to ship into that. But we would also expect to see those to continue to sell well until whatever products we come out at the next model year. So as we had talked about in our gross margin, which we expect to be down, one of the reasons for that is unfavorable mix. So we would expect to see not necessarily the same magnitude as we saw in the first quarter because we're setting up the dealer network with inventory as well; but unfavorable mix due to the fact that we're shipping-in those cruisers, which include the Sportsters that have been redone. And then we'll see what we come out with in 2017. But I'll tell you, even though the financial aspect is negative on a lot of these bikes is we're bringing in a lot of new customers into Harley-Davidson and a lot of outreach customers.

The industry has got a higher used-to-new relationship, but we'd expect them to be in the same range as well. And in terms of FX hedging, we have a fair amount of hedges on. We've got a regular program of hedging, as we've talked about, that hedges largely in a stairstep fashion. We have extended that a bit on some of our currencies, in particular on the euro, given the risk that we face, but overall we feel very good about what we've got hedged. And I talked about in the prepared remarks, though, if currency rates stay where they are today, there will be a sizable currency headwind. A lot of that is made up of the gains that we had last year. As those hedges at higher or more favorable exchange rates wear off, we will have unfavorable variances in gross margin this year because of that. And then we had mentioned that, revenue, we would expect to be down about 1%. With regards to Canada, we'll bring Canada on with our regular hedging program that we do with all of our other currencies. The other question was, I think, on company-owned inventory, the amount that was Canada. I don't have that number.

With regards to industry, we -- industry retail sales, Joe, we do not provide a forward-looking forecast for that. Certainly, we see more caution just given the overall macroeconomic trends, but we don't provide a forecast. You can say that, over the last 5 years, the industry has grown pretty steady at about 3%. This year was no different. Overall industry was up 4.8%, but when you remove autocycles, which we don't believe competes with the traditional motorcycles segment, the industry was up about 2.8%. So this year was right in line with the previous 3 years. What I can say is that, as we enter into 2016, we would expect, the first quarter or 2, the industry to be down as they lap -- or our competitors lap the kind of the growth that they experienced early on in the discounting cycle and some of the pull-forward volumes that they enjoyed. This year, the industry growth was driven by the front half and again the pull-forward of volume into the first couple quarters, but overall we're in an environment that we believe we can grow our worldwide shipments by 1% to 3% but are not going to provide a number on the industry. The second question was on CapEx: Our CapEx guidance for this year is $255 million to $275 million. The actual CapEx during the year was $260 million. And as you noted, Joe, it's up a bit, and that is driven by 2 things. Is -- one is new product development. We've talked about that a quarter ago, that we're increasing our new product spending, which hits SG&A, the expense side of it, by 35%. Well, there's certainly a corresponding part of that for us to develop those motorcycles with a fair amount of capital that goes into that, and you're seeing that reflected in our guidance. And then secondly is, as we continue to extend our ERP solution, we're moving it to Kansas City. And we're very excited about that. If you remember, about 3 years ago, we put a system in York, and it has done a fantastic job for us in terms of helping drive sustainable productivity. So that is another big area of capital spending this year. So on some of these things, you're going to see, from year to year, capital go up and down, depending on what we might be working on in terms of systems upgrades or new product development. But we're not going to provide a long-term view of overall capital."

We did the refleeting in 2014, so everyone at that time received all new bikes in the rider academy program. So every once in a while, they're going to swap out a bike or move one and sell it as used and move a new one in. That would be a very small number. And now that you've mentioned it, I would point out that, when you look at our overall retail sales for the year, 2015 was a difficult year. And we certainly fell short of expectations, but in the vein of keeping it all in perspective: Our retail sales were down 1.3% on the year, but when you do adjust for that refleeting of motorcycles that went into the rider academy with our new Street 500 motorcycles in 2014, retail sales were down only 0.4%. And while these results are certainly disappointing to us, we did achieve it in the face of some of the most significant shifts in world currencies that we've ever seen; and unprecedented levels of discounting, where 95% of our competition certainly gained a competitive price advantage about 20% to 30%. So with that, overall, tough year. I mean retail sales were only down 0.4%, and we did it all without damaging the brand by succumbing to discounting. We did it by growing gross margin in the face of incredible headwinds. We remain highly disciplined on managing our retail inventories. And we did it without violating our customer's trust and loyalty. And so I just had to get that off my chest. It's been a tough year, but I think that, keeping it all in perspective, it's the competition through the best that they could muster. And overall, retail sales were down 0.4%. And I know there's some skepticism out there whether we can grow next year, but given the year that we've had this year; all the things that we've realigned to compete into 2016; the money we're bringing to bear; the new products that we're bringing to bear, including the 2 we just came out with; the $70 million of incremental spending; the international expansion, again, we feel great about our business. We feel great about moving forward into 2016, and we feel great about our ability to grow in 2016. I know that's more than you asked for."

So I -- it's clear we -- and set it in our objectives and our focus areas, increasing ridership, growing the sport of motorcycling in the United States; and the Riding Academy being a very key lever to that. And there are 2",388,"Okay, thanks for the question. So I -- it's clear we -- and set it in our objectives and our focus areas, increasing ridership, growing the sport of motorcycling in the United States; and the Riding Academy being a very key lever to that. And there are 2 real dimensions of it. One is the number of dealers that offer the academy. The power of having riders learn on a Street, a Harley-Davidson Street motorcycle, that's available for sale. I have personal experience that my wife took the Riding Academy in the summer of 2014 on the Street 500. And I tried to get her to buy a Softail because I really wanted to get another motorcycle than I would also ride. And she wanted a Street 500 because she learned to ride on a Street 500, and so that's what she got. So when you just take that sample size of one around the confidence that a new rider has in having really great training and care and support from the dealer and a product they can buy to extend their learning while they're out on the road, it's an incredibly powerful mechanism for us to grow the sport of motorcycling in the United States and grow the number of riders. So we're going to add more dealers, as we mentioned. And we're going to work with the dealers on what best practices are out there that can be deployed to increase the conversion rate. We have 700 independent dealers in the United States. They are all in on Harley-Davidson. They're passionate about what they do. They're working every day on ways to improve their business. Our teams are visiting 100 dealerships a day in the United States. They're picking up these best practices that are being incubated by dealers around the nation, and we're expanding and using that insight and those positive experiences to help other dealers as -- improve as well. And Riding Academy is going to be one of these things that we're going to continue to incubate and improve not only the number of points but that conversion rate, all in the spirit of exposing more people about how awesome it is to ride and how awesome it is to ride on a Harley-Davidson and to have that experience through our great dealerships."

Today, I'll provide additional insight around our fourth quarter and full year financial results found in our press release and supporting slides. The summary of our fourth quarter financial results start on Slide 4.",2620,"Thanks, Amy. Good morning, everyone. Today, I'll provide additional insight around our fourth quarter and full year financial results found in our press release and supporting slides. The summary of our fourth quarter financial results start on Slide 4. 
During the quarter, revenue was $1.18 billion. Net income was $42.2 million and diluted earnings per share were $0.22. Operating income from the Motorcycle segment was down $29.5 million from last year's fourth quarter. Segment revenue was down versus prior year, driven by unfavorable mix and currency exchange, partially offset by higher shipments. Additionally, SG&A was higher, driven by reorganization charges, which enabled the shift in our operating investment profile to drive more demand. Operating income headwinds were partially offset by strong gross margin percent. 
At HDFS, operating income was down 2.5% year-over-year. The quarter also reflected higher corporate interest expense, resulting from our 2015 recapitalization. Despite the challenging conditions we faced throughout 2015, we continue to focus on delivering strong margins and strong returns over the long term. 
Now let's take a look at our retail sales on Slide 5. Worldwide retail sales of new Harley-Davidson Motorcycles were down 0.6% in the fourth quarter, an improvement from the last 3 quarters trend when sales were down 1.4%. The decline in U.S. retail sales was partially offset by increases in international markets during the quarter. Globally, sales were impacted by ongoing aggressive competitive activity and macroeconomic challenges. On the positive side, our new 2016 model year motorcycles, including the 2 S models, the Road Glide Ultra and our refreshed Forty-Eight and Iron 883 models all sold very well since their initial roll out. 
For the full year, worldwide retail sales were down 1.3% compared to last year. 2015 retail sales reflected a significant increase in competitiveness behind currency-driven discounting and the introduction of new products by a number of our competitors. During 2015, we took significant steps to improve our competitiveness without engaging in brand damaging discounting. We have significantly shifted our operating investment profile for 2016, redirecting approximately $70 million of existing spending toward demand driving marketing and product development investment. 
Let's take a look at the U.S. market on Slide 6. Retail sales in the U.S. were down 3.4% in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year behind intense competitive pressure and a challenging macroeconomic environment. These significant headwinds were partially offset by demand for new products, including our new Cruiser motorcycles. In fact, U.S. Cruiser retail sales were up in the fourth quarter, driven by strong sales of our 2 new Softail S models, our first year-over-year increase in the Cruiser segment in 8 quarters. We also saw strong motorcycle sales to Riding Academy graduates, driven by our Military Learn To Ride for Free program in the U.S. 
For the quarter, U.S. retail market share was flat to last year at 51.4%. As expected, the market share trend substantially improved from previous quarter's trends of down 3.7% -- 3.7 points. The improvement reflects our efforts to mitigate the impact of widening price gaps and the lapping of the aggressive competitiveness that started late in Q4 2014. 
For the full year, our retail sales were down 1.7%. For our full year market share -- our full year market share of 50.2% was down 3.1 percentage points year-over-year. While we anticipated some level of share loss following the 13.4 points of share that we gained in recent years, our 2015 share was more severely impacted than we expected as a result of the competitive environment and the inclusion of autocycles in the industry numbers. Finally, as expected, U.S. dealer retail inventory was up approximately 2,600 motorcycles at the end of 2015 compared to 2014, largely due to the initial dealer fill of our new 2016 motorcycles. We were comfortable with year-end dealer inventory levels as we continued to aggressively manage supply in line with demand. 
On Slide 7, you'll see retail sales in our international markets were up 3.1% in the fourth quarter. EMEA region retail sales were down 1.7% in Q4 due to continued pressure from the introduction of new low-price models by the competition and a very tough prior year comparison of up 8.7%. 
For the full year, EMEA retail sales were down 4.5%, and full year market share in Europe was 10.5%. While market share was down 1.5 percentage point for the year, fourth quarter share was down only 0.6 percentage points, an improvement over the prior quarter share trends. Asia Pacific region retail sales were up 8.2% in the fourth quarter, driven by strong sales in emerging markets and in Australia, partially offset by soft sales in Japan. While retail sales were down in Japan, we gained market share during the quarter. For the full year, Asia Pacific retail sales were up 7.3%. Latin America retail sales were down 1.5% in the quarter as a result of declines in Brazil, partially offset by strong growth in Mexico. Brazil's retail sales have been impacted by a slowing economy, consumer uncertainty and very aggressive price competition. For the full year, retail sales in Latin America were down 4.1%. 
Finally, retail sales in Canada were up 12.3% in the fourth quarter, but down 2.0% for the full year. We believe the market responded well to the change to our direct distribution model and to a price reduction on 2016 model year motorcycles. We plan to leverage international growth opportunities by expanding distribution and increasing our brand relevance by delivering exceptional products that inspire riders. In 2015, we added 40 international dealerships and plan to add 150 to 200 through 2020. 
On Slide 8, you'll see wholesale shipments of Harley-Davidson Motorcycles in the quarter were up 2.1% compared to last year and within our expected range. The shipment mix reflects our product investments in model year 2016, as we shipped a significantly higher percent of Cruiser and Street Sportster compared to last year. 
On Slide 9, you'll see revenue for the motorcycle and related product segment was down in the fourth quarter despite an increase in motorcycles shipments. Q4 revenue was unfavorably impacted by currency exchange, which reduced revenue by approximately 3.8% and unfavorable mix. 
For the full year, motorcycles segment revenue was down 4.7% behind a 1.6% decrease in motorcycle shipments and a 4.4% decline due to foreign currency exchange. The average motorcycle revenue per unit was down for the quarter and full year behind unfavorable foreign currency exchange in mix, partially offset by higher pricing. Both P&A and General Merchandise revenues was adversely affected by unfavorable foreign currency exchange during 2015. 
On Slide 10, you'll see gross margin in the quarter was 31.9%, which was 1.4 percentage points higher than last year. Gross margin performed well with volume, price, raw materials and manufacturing, all being favorable during the quarter, partially offset by unfavorable mix and foreign currency exchange. During the quarter, overall mix was a headwind of $20.9 million, driven by unfavorable motorcycle family mix, reflecting the demand for our 2016 Cruiser and Sportster Motorcycles.
Foreign currency exchange was unfavorable for the fourth quarter. This was driven by the significant weakening of our key foreign currencies on a year-over-year basis. The euro, yen, Brazilian real and Australian dollar devalued an average of 13% compared to prior year quarter. This resulted in an unfavorable revenue impact of approximately 3.8% and unfavorable gross margin of $15.3 million for the fourth quarter. Full year gross margin was 36.8%, which was up 0.4 percentage points from last year. We were very pleased to be able to increase our full year gross margin percent, especially in the face of very unfavorable currency exchange and lower volumes, and believe it is evidence of our strong underlying margin structure and flexible manufacturing capability. 
On Slide 11, operating margin as a percent of revenue for the fourth quarter was 0.6%, down 2.9 percentage points compared to last year's fourth quarter. As anticipated, operating income of $6.4 million for the quarter was unfavorably impacted by higher SG&A spending, partially offset by very strong gross margin performance. SG&A spending was up $36.2 million, driven by reorganization charges, as well as expenses related to the acquisition and operations of our Canadian distribution. Reorganization charges for the quarter totaled $30 million with $23 million being charged to SG&A. For the full year, operating margin, as a percent of revenue, was 16.5%. Going forward, we remain intensely focused on a cost structure that will enable growth and continuous improvement to drive our business to be stronger, more flexible and more profitable. 
Now let's take a look at our Financial Services segment on Slide 12. During the quarter, HDFS' operating profit decreased $1.5 million or 2.5% compared to last year. The primary factors impacting fourth quarter results were, first, net interest income was favorable to prior year by $9.3 million, driven by higher receivables, partially offset by lower yields on receivables due in part to the 2015 low interest rate promotional activity. And second, the provision for retail credit losses was unfavorable to prior year by $7.8 million due to higher credit, retail credit losses and increased reserve rates. On a full year basis, HDFS posted an operating profit of $280.2 million, an increase of 0.9% compared to 2014. 
HDFS' operations are summarized on Slide 13. During the fourth quarter, HDFS' retail motorcycle loan originations decreased 1.7% compared to the same period last year. In 2015, loan originations were comprised of approximately 80% prime loans and 20% sub-prime. As the predominant industry lender to sub-prime customers, these originations represent a significant number of retail sales to the company at very attractive returns. For the full year, HDFS continued to have a strong U.S. retail market share of new Harley-Davidson Motorcycles. HDFS' market share increased 5.4 percentage points, driven in part by promotional activity during the year. At the end of the year, we had $321.8 million of cash and cash equivalents at HDFS. In addition, HDFS had $748 million of available liquidity through bank credit and conduit facilities. This month, HDFS issued $1.2 billion in medium-term notes. 
On Slide 14, you'll see the 30-day delinquency rate for retail motorcycle loans at year-end was 3.8% or 17 basis points higher than last -- than year-end 2014. Delinquency rates across the portfolio, while up, remain at near record low levels. Annual retail credit losses increased by 20 basis points to 1.42% compared to 2014, driven by expected increased losses in the sub-prime portfolio, lower recovery values on repossessed motorcycles, and a recent deterioration in performance in oil-dependent areas of the U.S. 
During 2015, HDFS continued to maintain a strong liquidity position and contributed strong profitability to the company. HDFS remains focused on enabling sales of Harley-Davidson Motorcycles, while providing attractive return to Harley-Davidson, as demonstrated by the $140 million dividend HDFS paid to Harley-Davidson Inc. this month. The remaining Harley-Davidson Inc. financials are summarized on Slide 15. The company generated operating cash of $1.10 billion during 2015, down $47 million from last year, driven by lower net income, and increased wholesale lending, partially offset by favorable working capital. Also, the full year tax rate was 34.6%. During the quarter, the R&D tax credit was reinstated for 2015 and going forward. The full year 2015 benefit was recognized entirely in the fourth quarter. The company has and intends to continue to maintain a minimum of 12 months of projected liquidity needs in cash and/or committed credit facilities. 
On Slide 16, we have our full year 2015 results. You will see revenue, net income and earnings per share were all below 2014 levels due to a significant increase in overall market competitiveness and adverse impact from currency exchange and higher SG&A behind reorganization charges and product recall expenses. 
Switching our focus to shareholder value on Slide 17. Returning value to our shareholders is a top priority. During the fourth quarter, we paid a dividend of $0.31 per share, a full year payout ratio of 34%. In addition, we purchased 12.7 million shares for $642.4 million. For the full year, we repurchased nearly 28 million shares for $1.5 billion, which was partially funded by the $750 million debt issuance in July. Looking forward, we expect to continue to return excess cash to our shareholders in the form of increased dividends and continued share repurchases. 
On Slide 18, you will see our overall expectations for 2016. In 2016, we expect to ship 269,000 to 274,000 motorcycles, an increase of approximately 1% to 3%. We expect first quarter shipments to be approximately down 2% to up 4%. We expect 2016 global retail sales to grow year-over-year with international retail sales growing at a faster rate than the U.S. Retail sales will be supported by our increased investments. Starting this year, we have redirected approximately $70 million to drive demand. We expect our 2016 year-over-year investment in customer facing marketing to be up 65% and product development to be up 35%. We expect 2016 worldwide retail sales will face headwinds, as the competition continues to be aggressive with discounting the new product introductions. 
We also anticipate global macroeconomic challenges, including weakness in oil-dependent areas. Internationally, various markets are experienced economic challenges. In particular, Brazil, we expect the significant pressure to continue. In response to the nearly 50% devaluation of the Brazilian real last year, we have raised prices over 20% in 2016, and expect sales to be down for the full year. 
U.S. dealer retail inventory is expected to be up at year-end 2016, driven by the addition of new models this year. For the full year 2016, we expect operating margin for the motorcycles segment to be between 16% and 17%. We believe 2016's gross margin as a percent of revenue will be down year-over-year. We expect a favorable impact for motorcycle pricing and strong productivity gains. And we expect unfavorable foreign currency exchange, unfavorable mix and higher year-over-year startup cost, as we implement our ERP solution at our Kansas City plant. 
To dimensional-ize the foreign currency exchange risk, if currencies held at yesterday's exchange rates for the remainder of 2016, we estimate that our expected full year motorcycles segment revenue would be adversely impacted by approximately 1%. We would expect an unfavorable impact to gross margin of approximately $60 million, driven by lower revenues and lapping last year's hedge benefits, an unfavorable impact to gross margin by approximately 1 full percentage point. 
Looking at SG&A, while we will invest a significant amount more in marketing and product development, we expect full year spending to be flat to up modestly from 2015. As a percent of revenue, we expect SG&A will decrease. During the first quarter, we expect SG&A to be up roughly $25 million versus prior year, as we ramp up our demand driving marketing. For HDFS, we expect operating income will be down modestly in 2016 compared to 2015, as a result of increased borrowing cost and unfavorable credit losses, partially offset by higher revenues. Capital expenditures in 2016 are expected to be between $255 million and $275 million as we increase investment in product development, focused on bringing exciting new products to market, and as we continued to invest in our systems infrastructure, most notably, the implementation of an ERP system. 
Finally, we expect our full year 2016 effective tax rate will be approximately 34.5%. While results fell short of our expectations during the year, we maintained a strong gross margin percent, increased dividends and repurchased $1.5 billion in shares. We're excited about 2016 and have a clear path forward. We're prepared to navigate through the challenging environment and making investments to drive demand, grow our business and achieve our goals. Thank you for your investment in Harley-Davidson. Now I'll turn it over to Matt."

In October, we laid out our plans for how we intend to increase our focus, investment and resolve to drive demand in 2016 and beyond. Today, I'll elaborate and provide more color on the steps we're taking to build stronger and deeper connections with our loyal, current customers and reach and win new customers, riders and non-riders alike. 
Before I talk about our plans and the results we expect, I think it's important to share some of my context on the macro level. 2015 was a challenging year. Yet despite our challenges, we were successful in a number of key areas, areas foundational to our forward plans to leverage not only who we are, but what we've proven works to deliver a highly personal and authentic Harley-Davidson experience. The Harley-Davidson experience and brand are distinct and uniquely powerful. Without a doubt, we're currently in the most competitive environment we've seen in years, particularly in the United States. Much of it is driven by currency and some of it by new products from competitors all around the world. We've always said that product competition is good for the entire industry. It keeps us all on our toes, and ultimately, the customer wins. To be blunt, we want customers to choose Harley-Davidson, and we are more motivated than ever to deliver our best for them. 
We're not expecting the underlying conditions to improve or the competitiveness to diminish. So we've taken and we'll continue to take steps necessary to retain and grow our leadership position and our share of the markets we serve even as we continue to expand into new markets. We're already encouraged by the early results of our demand driving investments that we began in earnest in Q4 of last year. Although our dealers' retail motorcycle sales were down in aggregate in 2015, as John noted, we held our ground on U.S. market share in the fourth quarter and saw very favorable trends, as key new products hit the marketplace and we began ramping up our marketing investments heading into 2016. 
Performance in the United States going forward is mission-critical, and so is achieving a leadership position internationally. Among the real bright spots in 2015 was our performance in our Asia Pacific region, where we had our best year ever for retail registrations overall and our 5th consecutive year of growth. In Australia, we drove Harley-Davidson to the #1 share position for on-road registrations of all displacements with the Street 500 playing a key role, not only in those results but in serving as a learner-approved motorcycle for that market. In Canada, the successful transition of the business to a direct distribution model with our own management and strategy for the Canadian market resulted in a 12.3% increase at retail in the quarter. 
Behind these efforts are the best employees in the industry, people who come to work every day looking for better ways to serve our customers and drive demand for our products. On the Canadian transition, for example, our team completed a smooth and silent transition to direct distribution. On the manufacturing side, we worked together with the IAM to reach a new 6.5 year labor agreement in New York, which ensures the continued strength of our manufacturing operations and our ability to be responsive to our customers globally. These are just a few examples of the momentum we're building together through our focus on performing as a company and driving demand. We know we have more to deliver and more to prove. That's our aim. That's our plan. 
So let's talk about that plan in 2016. In managing our powerful brand, we will continue to keep supply in line with demand, but we're now challenging ourselves to more aggressively work the demand side of that equation. Our objectives are clear and they're aligning and motivating our entire company: number one, lead in every market; two, grow the sport of motorcycling in the United States, in part by growing the number of core customers and growing U.S. outreach at a faster rate; three, grow U.S. retail sales and grow international retail sales at a faster rate; four, grow revenue and grow earnings at a faster rate through 2020; and five, outperform the S&P 500. 
As we shared with you before, to achieve these objectives, we've substantially increased our investments in marketing and product development, focused on 4 key areas: first, increasing product and brand awareness; second, growing new ridership in the United States; third, increasing and enhancing brand access; and four, accelerating the cadence and impact of new products. Since October, we've been ramping up our efforts to give us a running start into the new year. We've not only increased our investment in driving demand, we've increased our focus to have greater impact. We've built capabilities based on deeper insights to drive greater precision in our marketing and how we and our dealers nurture relationships with current and prospective customers alike. 
Last year, in our EMEA region for example, we increased Touring sales and Touring share by exposing riders to the distinct advantages and capabilities of our Rushmore line. We also generated awareness for our 2016 Cruisers. As a result of our ""King of All Test Rides"" campaign, we generated 600,000 web visits, 100,000 test rides and delivered progress at retail as the year advanced. So we're building on the success in EMEA, as well as other markets as we move into 2016, demonstrating the cool, the comfort, the power and the grace of our products continues to be one of the best levers in driving sales, and we're going to be doing more of it. 
To grow the sport of motorcycling in the United States, we're increasing our investment in our Riding Academy programs and giving more people reasons and opportunities to learn to ride. We recently extended the highly successful and powerful Learn to Ride for Free program to current and former members of U.S. Military and first responders through all of 2016. We also plan to increase new Riding Academy U.S. dealer points by 18% in route to our goal to grow the number of graduates to 65,000 in 2016, a 35% increase from 2015, graduates learning to ride a Harley-Davidson motorcycle at one of our incredible dealerships. And we have plans in place to further engage these graduates in our products, brand and dealership experiences to convert more of them to new Harley-Davidson owners. 
We're also looking to expand new rider training, not only in the U.S. but in other key international markets as well. Our presence will grow as we reach out, engage and connect with more consumers of all demographics, riders and non-riders alike. We'll -- we will be participating in more events and leveraging our key partnerships in the U.S., like UFC and X Games, and in other ways across each market globally to engage customers in high-energy venues to drive high-yield traffic to our dealerships. We know that increasing the access to our brand through our outstanding dealerships is a demand catalyst. That's why we've steadily continued to both enhance and expand the dealer network, adding 40 new dealer points globally in 2015, including in China, India, Thailand, Vietnam, Germany, Poland and Mexico. By 2020, we plan to add 150 to 200 dealerships internationally, and we continue to work with each and every dealer to enhance the customer experience for every type of customer. 
Now let's talk motorcycles. Our motorcycles and everything we produce must drive passion and excitement in the heart and soul of every rider and every person everywhere, who dreams to ride. As John mentioned, last August, we introduced the high octane S Series Cruisers, the Softail Slim S and the Fat Boy S. Both of these are examples of high-impact motorcycles developed to inspire customers. These 2 models were instrumental in driving mid-single-digit increase at retail for our large Cruisers in the fourth quarter. 
Further leveraging the product development capabilities we've built over the past few years with increased investment is all about more great bikes, more frequently. Just yesterday, we announced 2 powerful cruisers expected to hit dealerships in the spring, the Low Rider S and the CVO Pro Street breakout. The Low Rider S is the most powerful regular production Dyna Cruiser ever offered by Harley-Davidson. And the Pro Street breakout with its strong drag racing influence adds punch to our custom vehicle operations. Both are designed to appeal to performance-oriented younger riders, and are great additions to our sizable leadership in the cruiser category. We expect these bikes to drive traffic, which further drive sales. 
So the bottom line, we've got results. We've set high expectations for ourselves in 2016 and beyond. Results will be the measure of our success. And I'm confident we can achieve what we set out to do because we've done it before. Back in the depths of the recession, we challenged ourselves and committed to grow our relevance and reach among outreach customers and we did it. Over the past 5 years, sales of new Harley-Davidson Motorcycles to outreach customers have grown at a compound annual growth rate of nearly 7%. In fact, in the U.S. we lead in the sale of motorcycles in every outreach segment, that includes African-Americans, Hispanics, women of all ages and young adults between the ages of 18 and 34. In this all important young adult segment, we sell more Harley-Davidson Motorcycles to young adults today than we did to the baby boomers when they were young adults. We're committed to grow ridership and the Street has helped us to do just that in the first full year since its launch. 7 out of 10 Harley-Davidson Street riders were new to the brand, and in EMEA, that number was 9 out of 10. In India, nearly all Street customers were new to the Harley-Davidson brand. 
We know what we can achieve when we develop and align and commit to a goal. We're building on a strong foundation and challenging ourselves to drive demand and increase our impact and appeal even more broadly as we move forward. These expectations are part of a solid plan that is the result of our experience, capabilities and commitment to lead. We have loyal and passionate customers who would be the envy of any business. We have this brand and its incredible legacy. We've got talented and passionate employees and dealers and we've got resolve. Together, we've never been more fired up to deliver great things to everyone who wants to be a part of all we do. Now let's take your questions."

So I was just wondering if you could provide us with some details on what was in your balance sheet inventory and why there was that large increase? And then also, I understand that you're excited about the new models and they've been getting traction, but just wondering how you can get comfortable with the plan to build inventory given the macro and the competitive challenges that you face and then also the strong base of used bikes that are at the dealer level?

I'll come back and",461,"All right. Thanks, Felicia. Let's start with the balance sheet question is inventory on the balance sheet is up about $137 million, and this is driven by 3 things, number one, and most predominantly, is higher finished goods inventory. I'll come back and talk about that in a second. Secondly is our related business inventory in Parts and Accessories and General Merchandise is up, as we look to improve customer service and optimize our product flows to our dealer network. And then thirdly, with the acquisition of Canada, we certainly acquired finished goods and Parts & Accessories and General Merchandise inventory with that acquisition. Getting back to the largest driver of that, which is finished goods inventory, we've talked the last couple of quarters that we were going to increase production in the fourth quarter. We got very good at flexible manufacturing, and the previous couple years we took our production down in the fourth quarter quite significantly, and we hit a point of diminishing returns. So we wanted to put some production back in the fourth quarter, which we've done. And certainly, reflected in our gross margin for the quarter. Secondly, and that's coincident with the change in our investment profile and significantly increasing the amount of dollars that we're bringing to drive demand and we're pulling that forward very early in the first quarter. A matter of fact, we started some of that in December. And so what we want to do is to pull forward the shipments for the selling season to our dealer network by several weeks. And so we're coming into the year with a little bit more inventory so that we can get it out to the dealer network and fulfill the inventories with the marketing spending going up. So we feel very good about where we're at and I'm all ready to start 2016. The second question was with regards to next year's retail inventory, and we said that we expect that to be up behind new model introductions. So Felicia, 2 of these new models were just introduced yesterday. So similar to this year, our inventories were up 2,600 units behind a couple new -- incremental models and it just represents the dealer fill for those models, and we would expect the same in 2016. Given the environment that we're in, we're moving into, we feel very comfortable about where we ended our dealer inventories this year. Matter of fact, our dealer network would probably suggest that they would like more inventory. They would certainly suggest they would like more inventory, and we're going to continually aggressively manage supply in line with demand. Next year is no difference, and we would expect day sales to be similar to this year for next year."

It's that there is some softness in prices at auctions, and that's increasing some of the losses that we're seeing at auction. Again, in the dealer network, through the first 3 quarters, prices were very firm. We were noting that Touring was up a little bit. Sportsters were flat. And Softails -- I'm sorry.

With respect to new bikes, your goal had historically been to align supply and demand and ultimately pricing such that dealers would sell at MSRP. Can you talk a little bit about deviations from that with regard to your dealer channel? Just hearing more and more grumblings about dealers cutting sizeable discounts relative to MSRP. And then I guess, related to that used bike question, remind us how you think about sort of the backward-looking credit losses. Obviously, we've seen those losses pick up, and that's impacted in your guidance for HDFS going forward, but at what point do we have to worry about maybe writing-down receivables as we look backward in terms of credit losses?"

There -- we would not expect to write-down anything. The only -- in -- those are not our bikes. What we do is we do inventory a small number of repos as they come in, but you're talking a very small balance. And we mark those. We mark them every month of every quarter that are marked to market. So we would never expect to have a large write-down in terms of the repo inventory that is ours. Again, that's a very nominal amount of bikes that flow through us. The next question that you asked is with regards to discounting at MSRP in our dealerships. Our dealers are independent folks. And they can offer discounts, and some of them do. What we can do is not allow them to advertise any discounts. And that's something that we enforce very much. We do not condone or want our products to be discounted, but as you pointed out, James, they do at times. And they just can't advertise it. The best thing that we can do is to aggressively manage supply in line with inventories so that we don't create an environment where discounting would be more encouraged."

When we look at the fourth quarter, we saw the decline on a worldwide basis come down significantly. It was running at 1.4%, down for the first 3 quarters and was only down 0.6%. And in addition to that, I'm very pleased with market share. We have -- we had expected, as we got into lapping the onset of the competitiveness that started 4 quarters ago, late in the fourth quarter, that we would see market share stabilize. And we're very pleased to see it. So certainly a big turnaround in market share in the fourth quarter. We were running down at a rate of 3.7 points and were flat in the fourth quarter; and in Europe as well, was running down about 1.6 through 3 quarters and down only 0.6%. So this is what we would have expected. As we look forward into 2016, we would expect certainly more stable shares in 2016 versus 2015. The overall growth in the company is going to be driven by new products. Model year 2016 is doing very well, as Matt had mentioned. Our cruisers are up on a year-over-year basis, and we just added 2 new cruisers to the lineup as of yesterday. Outreach is doing absolutely fantastic, up 6.5% this year; growing faster than our core, which has been our goal, as well as growing at double the rate of the industry. And then we've got $70 million more marketing spending. So we realize that our price gaps are larger. We don't expect them to close because of the discounting. We expect that to continue, but we are bringing a lot more dollars to bear on that to help mitigate the impact of expanded price gaps. And then finally, international expansion, we added 40 dealers net last year, most of them in the back half. And we'd we expect to add similar levels over the next 5 years, and that will drive a lot of our sales. All of that in the context of much easier comps for us as we go forward into 2016.

And so now as we're getting into lapping that, we're in a much more stable place to start to grow off of. And so no, not a surprise at all. The teams are doing a great job. We've mentioned in the prepared remarks one of our large investments that we've chosen to deploy and to grow the industry is offering military folks free Learn to Ride at our Riding Academy programs.

So what we're seeing is -- in the first quarter is you're going to see more of a pronounced mix as we ship those into the dealer network because the band is higher for them and we need to ship into that. But we would also expect to see those to continue to sell well until whatever products we come out at the next model year. So as we had talked about in our gross margin, which we expect to be down, one of the reasons for that is unfavorable mix. So we would expect to see not necessarily the same magnitude as we saw in the first quarter because we're setting up the dealer network with inventory as well; but unfavorable mix due to the fact that we're shipping in those cruisers, which include the Sportsters that have been redone. And then we'll see what we come out with in 2017. But I'll tell you, even though the financial aspect is negative on a lot of these bikes is we're bringing in a lot of new customers into Harley-Davidson and a lot of outreach customers.

The industry has got a higher used-to-new relationship, but we'd expect them to be in the same range as well. And in terms of FX hedging, we have a fair amount of hedges on. We've got a regular program of hedging, as we've talked about, that hedges largely in a stair step fashion. We have extended that a bit on some of our currencies, in particular on the euro, given the risk that we face, but overall we feel very good about what we've got hedged. And I talked about in the prepared remarks, though, if currency rates stay where they are today, there will be a sizable currency headwind. A lot of that is made up of the gains that we had last year. As those hedges at higher or more favorable exchange rates wear off, we will have unfavorable variances in gross margin this year because of that. And then we had mentioned that, revenue, we would expect to be down about 1%. With regards to Canada, we'll bring Canada on with our regular hedging program that we do with all of our other currencies. The other question was, I think, on company-owned inventory, the amount that was Canada. I don't have that number. Overall, Tim, when we purchased Canada, the working capital that we acquired was $10 million. I don't have the number of inventory in Canada in front of me, for the end of the fourth quarter."

We're seeing the improvement that we needed to launch into 2016, the turnaround on this to grow. All of that's in place. Also, what we're recognizing with the 1% to 3% is the increased risks in the macroeconomic trends both in the United States and around the world. A lot has changed in those 3 months, whether it be oil prices, the slowdown in China, geopolitical issues around the world. And we're simply recognizing that change.

With regards to industry, we -- industry retail sales, Joe, we do not provide a forward-looking forecast for that. Certainly, we see more caution just given the overall macroeconomic trends, but we don't provide a forecast. You can say that, over the last 5 years, the industry has grown pretty steady at about 3%. This year was no different. Overall industry was up 4.8%, but when you remove autocycles, which we don't believe competes with the traditional motorcycle segment, the industry was up about 2.8%. So this year was right in line with the previous 3 years. What I can say is, is that as we enter into 2016, we would expect the first quarter or 2, the industry to be down as they lap -- or our competitors lap the kind of the growth that they experienced early on in the discounting cycle and some of the pull-forward volumes that they enjoyed. This year, the industry growth was driven by the front half and again the pull-forward of volume into the first couple quarters, but overall we're in an environment that we believe we can grow our worldwide shipments by 1% to 3% but are not going to provide a number on the industry. The second question was on CapEx. Our CapEx guidance for this year is $255 million to $275 million. The actual CapEx during the year was $260 million. And as you noted, Joe, it's up a bit, and that is driven by 2 things. Is -- one is new product development. We've talked about that a quarter ago, that we're increasing our new product spending, which hits SG&A, the expense side of it, by 35%. Well, there's certainly a corresponding part of that for us to develop those motorcycles with a fair amount of capital that goes into that, and you're seeing that reflected in our guidance. And then secondly is, as we continue to extend our ERP solution, we're moving it to Kansas City. And we're very excited about that. If you remember, about 3 years ago, we put a system in York, and it has done a fantastic job for us in terms of helping drive sustainable productivity. So that is another big area of capital spending this year. So on some of these things you're going to see, from year to year, capital go up and down, depending on what we might be working on in terms of systems upgrades or new product development. But we're not going to provide a long-term view of overall capital."

So every once in a while, they're going to swap out a bike or move one and sell it as used and move a new one in. That would be a very small number. And now that you've mentioned it, I would point out that when you look at our overall retail sales for the year, 2015 was a difficult year. And we certainly fell short of expectations, but in the vein of keeping it all in perspective: Our retail sales were down 1.3% on the year, but when you do adjust for that refleeting of motorcycles that went into the rider academy with our new Street 500 motorcycles in 2014, retail sales were down only 0.4%. And while these results are certainly disappointing to us, we did achieve it in the face of some of the most significant shifts in world currencies that we've ever seen; and unprecedented levels of discounting, where 95% of our competition certainly gained a competitive price advantage about 20% to 30%. So with that, overall, tough year. I mean retail sales were only down 0.4%, and we did it all without damaging the brand by succumbing to discounting. We did it by growing gross margin in the face of incredible headwinds. We remain highly disciplined on managing our retail inventories. And we did it without violating our customers' trust and loyalty. And so I just had to get that off my chest. It's been a tough year, but I think that keeping it all in perspective, it's the competition through the best that they could muster. And overall, retail sales were down 0.4%. And I know there's some skepticism out there whether we can grow next year, but given the year that we've had this year; all the things that we've realigned to compete into 2016; the money we're bringing to bear; the new products that we're bringing to bear, including the 2 we just came out with; the $70 million of incremental spending; the international expansion, again, we feel great about our business. We feel great about moving forward into 2016, and we feel great about our ability to grow in 2016. I know that's more than you asked for."

So I -- it's clear, we said it in our objectives and our focus areas, increasing ridership, growing the sport of motorcycling in the United States; and the Riding Academy being a very key lever to that. And there are 2 real dimensions of it. One is the number of dealers that offer the academy. The power of having riders learn on a Street, a Harley-Davidson Street motorcycle, that's available for sale. I have personal experience that my wife took the Riding Academy in the summer of 2014 on the Street 500. And I tried to get her to buy a Softail because I really wanted to get another motorcycle that I would also ride. And she wanted a Street 500 because she learned to ride on a Street 500, and so that's what she got. So when you just take that sample size of one around the confidence that a new rider has in having really great training and care and support from the dealer and a product they can buy to extend their learning while they're out on the road, it's an incredibly powerful mechanism for us to grow the sport of motorcycling in the United States and grow the number of riders. So we're going to add more dealers, as we mentioned. And we're going to work with the dealers on what best practices are out there that can be deployed to increase the conversion rate. We have 700 independent dealers in the United States. They are all in on Harley-Davidson. They're passionate about what they do. They're working every day on ways to improve their business. Our teams are visiting 100 dealerships a day in the United States. They're picking up these best practices that are being incubated by dealers around the nation, and we're expanding and using that insight and those positive experiences to help other dealers improve as well. And Riding Academy is going to be one of these things that we're going to continue to incubate and improve not only the number of points but that conversion rate, all in the spirit of exposing more people about how awesome it is to ride and how awesome it is to ride on a Harley-Davidson and to have that experience through our great dealerships."

Overall, we are pleased with",2480,"Thanks, Amy good morning, everyone. Today I'll provide additional insight around our first quarter inside found in our press release and supporting slides. The summary of our first quarter financial results starts on Slide 4. Overall, we are pleased with the first quarter performance. Despite the challenging conditions we continue to face, we remain focused on driving demand and delivering strong margins and strong returns over the long term. During the quarter, revenue was $1.75 billion. Net income was $250.5 million and diluted earnings per share were $1.36. Operating income from the Motorcycles segment was down 3.8% from last year's first quarter. Segment revenue was up 4.4% in the quarter behind a 4.3% increase in motorcycle shipments. As anticipated, gross margin as a percent of revenue decreased versus prior year as a result of unfavorable product mix and currency exchange in addition to higher year-over-year start-up costs. SG&A was also up in the quarter as we significantly increased our investments in demand-driving marketing and product development. Operating income as a percent of revenue in Q1 was 21.1%. At HDFS, operating income was down 12.8% year-over-year. The quarter also reflected higher corporate expense resulting from our 2015 recapitalization. 
Now let's take a look at retail sales on Slide 5. Worldwide retail sales of new Harley-Davidson Motorcycles in the first quarter were up 1.4% versus prior year, an improvement from being down 0.6% in Q4 2015. Retail sales were up in our international regions and down slightly in the U.S. During the quarter, we made progress against our long-term growth objectives. We are driving demand in an environment of intense global competition. We believe Q1 retail sales benefited from our demand driving marketing investments and a strong reception to our new 2016 model year motorcycles. Starting in the first quarter and throughout 2016, we plan to invest an incremental $70 million to drive demand. We expect our 2016 year-over-year investment in customer-facing marketing to be up 65% and product development investment to be up 35%. Our new motorcycle -- our new 2016 model year motorcycles continue to sell well during the quarter. [indiscernible] sales were strong driven by our team new Softail S models and our 2 Refresh Sportsters. Touring sales also benefited from the new Road Glide Ultra. While retail sales were up on a worldwide basis, we continue to experience headwinds from an intense competitive implement and challenging macroeconomic conditions around the world. We are confident in our strong brand and our ability to grow in this highly competitive environment without engaging in brand damaging discounting. 
Let's take a look at the U.S. market on Slide 6. In the first quarter, we saw a slight decline in retail sales of 0.5%. As we anticipated, retail sales improved from recent trends despite increasingly intense competitive discounting and declines in oil dependent areas. During the quarter, we significantly increased our marketing investment focused on growing product awareness and growing ridership in the U.S. Retail market share for the first quarter continued to stabilize, down slightly compared to the same period last year. The industry continued to grow, up 0.8% in the first quarter on top of the 9.0% increase in Q1 of last year. Finally, as expected, U.S. dealer retail inventory was up approximately 4,900 motorcycles at the end of the quarter compared to 2015, largely due to the initial dealer fill of our new 2016 models. We continue to be diligent in our efforts to manage supply in line with demand, and we're comfortable with the dealer inventory at the end of the quarter. 
On Slide 7, you'll see retail sales in our international markets were up 4.5% in the first quarter driven by sales increases in EMEA, Asia Pacific and Canada, partially offset by weakness in Brazil. In fact, excluding Brazil, international markets were up a strong 8.9%. EMEA region retail sales were up 8.8% in Q1 reflecting the significant increase in demand-driving investments in that market. All major markets across EMEA were up in the quarter, with strong gains in France, Switzerland, Italy and emerging markets in the region. First quarter market share in Europe was up -- was 10.3%, up 0.5 percentage points versus prior year, which is an improvement in recent market share trends. Market share growth was driven by increased investment and a great reception to our new motorcycles. Asia Pacific retail sales were up 6.6% in the first quarter, our best ever first quarter. This growth was accomplished despite the adverse impact of temporarily exiting retail sales in Indonesia as we replaced the dealer network in order to improve the customer experience in that market. Latin America retail sales were down 26.5% in the quarter as a result of declines in Brazil, partially offset by strong growth in Mexico. Brazil's retail sales continue to be impacted by a challenging economy and consumer uncertainty. In response to the nearly 50% devaluation of Brazilian real last year, we raised model year 2016 prices approximately 20%. While profitability for motorcycle improved, we expect retail sales to be down for the year. Finally, retail sales in Canada were up 16.3% in the first quarter. We believe the market continued to respond well to the change in a direct distribution model. In support of our strategic focus on increasing brand access, we plan to continue to expand our international distribution. We added 5 new international dealerships in the first quarter. 
On Slide 8, you'll see wholesale shipments of Harley-Davidson motorcycles in the first quarter were up 4.3% compared to last year, at the high-end of our expected range for the quarter. During the quarter, we shipped a higher percent of Cruiser motorcycles compared to last year given our product investments and model year 2016 motorcycles launched last August, as well as the Low Rider S and CVO ProStreet Breakout we started shipping toward the end of the first quarter. We exited 2015 with increased motorcycle inventory on our balance sheet. This increase was aimed at supplying more motorcycles early in the year than typical in order to support our 2016 marketing plan and investments. While Q1 company inventory was down from year-end, it was still up versus prior year to support the selling season and our increased investments in marketing. Throughout the second quarter, we expect elevated year-over-year inventory as we anticipate lost production in the third quarter associated with the implementation of our ERP system in our Kansas City plant. 
On Slide 9, you'll see revenue for the motorcycles and related products segment was up in the first quarter behind a 4.3% increase in motorcycle shipments. Q1 revenue was unfavorably impacted by currency exchange, which reduced revenue growth by nearly a percentage point. The average motorcycle revenue per unit was up slightly for the quarter behind higher pricing partially offset by unfavorable currency exchange. During the quarter, P&A revenue was flat and General Merchandise revenue was up 6.3% behind stronger sales of riding gear. Both P&A and General Merchandise revenues were adversely affected by unfavorable currency exchange during the quarter. 
On Slide 10, you'll see gross margin as a percent of revenue in the quarter was down 1.7 percentage points versus last year. Gross margin was supported by favorable volume, price and raw materials, offset by unfavorable mix, foreign currency exchange and manufacturing costs. During the quarter, overall mix was the headwind of $14.8 million driven by a shift in both motorcycles and related product mix. Foreign currency exchange was unfavorable behind the significant weakening of our key foreign currencies on a year-over-year basis. On a combined basis, the euro, yen, Brazilian real and Australian dollars devalued an average of 4% compared to the prior-year quarter. In the first quarter, gross margin was adversely impacted by $10.6 million as a result of lower revenue. Manufacturing was unfavorable by $15.6 million driven by higher year-over-year start-up costs, including the costs related to the implementation of our ERP system in the Kansas City plant, which we expect to be complete by the end of Q3. In addition, we experienced lower fixed cost absorption as a result of lower production in Q1 versus the same period last year. 
On Slide 11, operating margin as a percent of revenue for the first quarter was a very strong 21.1% but down 1.8 percentage points compared to last year's first quarter. As anticipated, operating income of $332.5 million for the quarter was unfavorably impacted by higher SG&A. While SG&A spending was lower than we expected due to a shift in timing of spending from Q1 to Q2, SG&A was up $13.0 million year-over-year driven by our increased investment in marketing and product development and costs associated with managing our Canadian operations, which we acquired in August of 2015. We remain intensely focused on a cost structure that will enable growth and continuous improvement to drive our business to be stronger, more flexible and more profitable. 
Now let's take a look at our Financial Services segment on Slide 12. During the quarter, HDFS' operating profit decreased $8.3 million, 12.8% compared to last year. The primary factors impacting first quarter results were, first, net interest income was up over prior year by $1.6 million, driven by higher receivables, partially offset by higher interest costs and lower yields on receivables due in part to the 2015 low interest rate promotional activity; and second, the provision for retail motorcycle loan losses was increased over prior year by $12.9 million driven by higher retail credit losses and an associated increase in the allowance for retail credit losses. 
HDFS' operations are summarized on Slide 13. During the first quarter, HDFS''s retail motorcycle loan originations increased 8.9% compared to the same period last year. In the first quarter, loan originations were comprised of approximately 80% prime loans and 20% subprime. As a predominant industry lender to subprime customers, these originations represent a significant number of retail sales to the company at very attractive returns. For the quarter, HDFS continued to have a strong U.S. market -- retail market share of new Harley-Davidson Motorcycles at 56.8%, up 3.5 percentage points. At the end of the quarter, we had $344.7 million of cash and cash equivalents to HDFS. In addition, HDFS had $1.1 billion of available liquidity through bank credit and conduit facilities. This quarter, HDFS issued $1.2 billion in medium term notes and paid $140 million dividend to Harley-Davidson Inc. 
On Slide 14, you'll see 30 day delinquency rate for retail motorcycle loans at the end of the first quarter was 2.88% or 24 basis points higher than Q1 2015. The delinquency rate was up particularly in oil-dependent areas. Despite the increase, delinquency remained at low levels. Annual retail credit losses increased by 42 basis points to 1.98% compared to 2015. The increase was a result of higher losses on loans in oil-independent areas, normalizing subprime performance and lower used bike values at auction. During the quarter, HDFS continue to maintain a strong liquidity position and contributed strong profitability to the company. 
The remaining Harley-Davidson Inc. financial results are summarized on Slide 15. The company generated operating cash of $41.1 million during the quarter down from last year, driven by increased wholesale lending and higher working capital. Also, the tax rate was 34.5%, which is in line with last year's rate. The company has and intends to continue to maintain a minimum of 12 months of projected liquidity needs in cash and/or committed credit facilities. 
Switching our focus to shareholder value on Slide 16, returning value to our shareholders is a top priority. During the first quarter, we raised our quarterly dividend from $0.31 to $0.35 per share, up 12.9%. In addition, we repurchased 3.4 million shares of our stock for $144.6 million. Looking forward, we expect to continue to return excess cash to our shareholders in the form of increasing dividends and continued share repurchases. 
On Slide 17, you'll see our overall expectations for 2016. In 2016, we continue to expect to ship 269 to 274,000 motorcycles, an increase of approximately 1% to 3%. We expect second quarter shipments to be approximately down 3% to up 3% versus last year's second quarter. U.S. dealer retail inventory is expected to be up at year-end 2016 to support incremental models and increased marketing investment. For the full year 2016, we expect operating margin for the Motorcycle segment to be between 16% and 17%. We believe 2016's gross margin as a percent of revenue will be down year-over-year driven by unfavorable foreign currency exchange, unfavorable mix, higher year-over-year start-up costs associated with the implementation of our ERP system at our Kansas City plant. To dimentionalize the foreign currency exchange risks, if currencies held at recent exchange rates for the remainder of 2016, we estimate that our expected full year Motorcycle segment revenue will be slightly unfavorable on a year-over-year basis. We would expect an unfavorable impact to gross margin of approximately $50 million, driven by lapping last year's hedge benefits, an unfavorable impact to gross margin of nearly 1 percentage point on a full year basis. During the second quarter, we expect gross margin expressed as a percent of revenue to be down on a year-over-year basis, driven by, first, unfavorable currency exchange. Currency is expected to adversely impact gross margin by $25 million to $30 million in the quarter primarily due to lapping a year ago hedge gains of $20 million, lowering gross margin by approximately 1.5 percentage points. Next, we expect shipment mix will continue to be unfavorable in Q2 behind a stronger shipment mix of Cruisers and Sportsters, supporting the strong demand we have seen in these segments in our recently announced new product introductions. Finally, we expect manufacturing cost to continue to be unfavorable behind higher year-over-year start-up costs. 
Looking at SG&A, while we will invest a significant amount more in marketing and product development, we expect full year spending to be flat to up modestly from 2015. As a percent of revenue, we expect SG&A will decrease. For HDFS, we expect operating income will be down modestly in 2016 compared to 2015 as a result of increased borrowing cost and higher credit losses, partially offset by increased revenues. Capital expenditures in 2016 are expected to be between $255 million and $275 million as we increase investment in product development focused on bringing exciting products to market and as we continue to invest in our systems infrastructure, most notably the implementation of an ERP system. Finally, we continue to expect our full year 2016 effective tax rate will be approximately 34.5%. 
We are pleased to deliver a return to retail sales growth and stabilizing market shares in the first quarter. We will continue to navigate through the challenging environment and are making investments to drive demand and deliver strong margins and strong returns over the long term. Thank you for your investment in Harley-Davidson. 
Now I'll turn it over to Matt."

As we shared in January, our plan for 2016 and beyond increases our focus, investment and resolve to drive increased demand for exceptional brand and products. I'll share with you some highlights and how we're progressing on the plan, but first I would like to provide my perspective on our first quarter results. As John mentioned we saw overall growth in worldwide retail sales reach 1.4%. It demonstrates the initial success we're having with our strategy to drive demand and deliver results in a highly competitive environment. As I've said before, competition is a great thing for the entire industry and the customer. It drives us to be better than we've ever been in every respect to grow our leadership position and run a strong and profitable business while we do so. We don't expect the current environment to change. In fact, we view it as the new normal, so we will continue to take steps necessary to further strengthen the company and compete effectively in our quest to lead in every market. As I reflect on the quarter, international continues to be a real bright spot, with great results in EMEA, Asia Pacific and Canada. Our international retail sales have continued to grow, and we anticipate growing international retail sales at a faster rate than in the U.S. over time. And while retail sales were down 0.5% in the U.S., they were an improvement over recent trends and we're working with diligence, skill and commitment to maintain and enhance our leadership position here in the United States. Importantly, while we recognize we made progress in the first quarter, we also recognized we still have more to do and more to deliver. 
So let's get to the key elements of our demand-driving strategy. Harley-Davidson enjoys customer loyalty and brand appeal that would be the envy of any business, and the core goal of our plan to drive demand is to build an even stronger, deeper bond with our existing loyal customers while creating powerful connections with new customers. To do this, we set our focus on 4 key areas: First, increase product and brand awareness; second, grow new ridership in the United States; third, increase and enhance brand accelerate; and finally, accelerate the cadence and impact of new products. We kicked off a number of initiatives in these 4 areas at various points in the first quarter, some of which influenced first quarter performance and others we anticipate will bear fruit in the months and years ahead. To increase product and brand awareness, we've stepped up our advertising and PR presence in every region, taking full advantage of digital and traditional media to tell our stories and the stories of our customers. We have also increased our presence at major events and increased the number of demo opportunities for riders to experience first-hand our motorcycles, accessories and apparel that offer unlimited potential for them to make a unique and bold statement about who they are. Nothing reinforces the fundamental of appeal of our products and the many enhancements we've made to our motorcycles in recent years better than a demo ride. So we've been dialing up our demo opportunities around the world. In EMEA, for example, the Discover More Touring campaign more than doubled demand for demo rides during the first quarter compared to the same period in 2015. In Asia Pacific, our increased media investment is driving greater awareness for the brand and our demo events with encouraging results. In Japan, for example, demo rides are up 57% over last year. And Australia and New Zealand are seeing substantial increase in demo rides year-over-year as well. In the United States, we've stepped up our presence in key events such as South by Southwest, the X Games and of course, Daytona Bike Week, where we engage riders and connected them with our great dealers. During Bike Week, we saw a 30% increase in the number of demo rides and a 27% increase in total retail sales of new motorcycles through local dealers as compared to 2015. In mid-March, we launched the Live Your Legend integrated marketing campaign. This global campaign highlights real life stories from current Harley-Davidson riders, dealers and employees to encourage new riders to get out and live their legend. What is most powerful about the campaign is the message. It's a rallying cry to inspire the next generation of riders to act now and invest in the experiences that define their legacy. The emotional appeal of our brand, process borders, cultures and generations. It's more than just a motorcycle. It's a way of life and a personal expression for millions of riders around the world, and it's inspiring others to pick up the sport and learn to ride on a Harley-Davidson motorcycle. 
Growing the sport of motorcycling in the United States is also about increasing our investment in Harley-Davidson Riding Academy. In the first quarter, we increase the number of dealers offering the program by 8% and the number of classes offered by 35%. Through March, our dealers train over 8,000 students, a 37% increase from last year. A big driver of that increase is our incredibly successful Learn to Ride for Free program, which we're offering to current and former members of the U.S. military and first responders throughout 2016. Increasing access to our brand through our dealers also remains an important demand catalyst and we're continuing our progress in expanding and enhancing the dealer network, which we believe is the absolute best in the world and a key competitive advantage. During the first quarter we opened new dealer points in Belgium, Brazil, Hong Kong, India and the Philippines. By 2020 [ph], we plan to add 150 to 200 new dealerships internationally. 
Now let's talk a little bit about some awesome products. Our first quarter results reflect the strength and impact of our new 2016 motorcycles, including the Refreshed Iron 883 and 48, as well as the S Series Cruisers and the Road Glide Ultra. We announced of the Low Rider S and this CVO Post Street Breakout Cruisers this quarter and started shipping them to dealerships in March. Just yesterday, we unveiled the new Harley-Davidson Roadster to the world at a media event in Marseille, France, and the reaction has been fantastic. This new model joins the Dark Custom lineup and is featured in the Live Your Legend campaign. We have included a link to the latest spot in today's earnings release, and I encourage you to check it out. 
What I've outlined here is just a sampling of the all-in comprehensive nature of our work to drive demand, work that leverages all the great and strong directions of our brand, further strengthening and reinforcing our incredible foundations of industry leading products, experiences, customer passion and loyalty that are wrapped up in the Harley-Davidson brand. These are investments to deliver the near-term results that will drive long-term performance and value for all our stakeholders. We're confident that our investments will generate interest, drive traffic and drive sales. We're also confident that they will enhance our already unrivaled industry and brand leadership and business performance too. 
Before we move on to questions, I'd like to share some important customer information with you. As you know, one of our strategic objectives is to grow the sport of motorcycling in the United States, in part by growing the number of core customers and growing outreach at a faster rate. As highlighted in today's press release, for the eighth straight year, we remain the #1 seller of new on-road motorcycles in the U.S. to young adults aged 18 to 34, to women, African-Americans and Hispanics [indiscernible] ages 35 and up. This is the case in the 601 plus CC segment and across all on-road motorcycles of all displacements. We continue to sell more Harley-Davidson Motorcycles to today's young adults than we did to the baby boomers when they were young adults, and we're bringing new riders of all ages into the sport. Over the last 5 years, an increasing number of on-road first-time riders in the United States have purchased new Harley-Davidson Motorcycles. In 2015, 1/3 of new Harley-Davidson purchasers in the U.S. had not owned a motorcycle previously. We know we've got more to do and more to deliver. We're confident in the strength of our strategy, the passion of our people and the power of our brand. 
The Harley-Davidson brand is among the most iconic on the planet, a position of strength we've built during our continuos 113-year history. No one else has a network of dealers like we do, made up of individuals who get up everyday with the sole purpose of delivering exceptional Harley-Davidson experiences. And no one else has employees like ours who takes such great pride in creating and building legendary Harley-Davidson Motorcycles and delivering our unique experiences to every corner of the planet. Our inspiration and our drive comes from our customers, millions of riders who yearn to experience personal freedom on their individual terms. This is what we do and we do it like no one else. 
So with that, let's take your questions."

Heroes Ride Free, we've talked about our training military folks and police and fire for free. We've seen great results from that. As Matt mentioned, that's up 37%. So one of the measures is are we increasing the number of people we're training. And overall sales are up quite significantly when you look at our graduates that are buying motorcycles. So there is clearly a volume measure there. We've also got discovered more demos, and demos taking place all over the world. The metrics on that is are we getting more people on motorcycles and we certainly follow through with those sales and are those demos to make sure that they are turning into sales and doing the follow-ups. The big thing we're investing in is Battle of the Kings, which accentuates and highlights our customization and personalization which is unique to Harley-Davidson. So all of these things are what we're doing to drive demand versus the alternative and the easy way out which is the discount. So we're taking the high road on this.

Talking about used prices, whenever we talk about used prices, we got to be clear about what market we're talking about. There's really 3 different markets the way we look at it. There is the market that is bikes are sold on driveway",482,"So Tim, this is John. Talking about used prices, whenever we talk about used prices, we got to be clear about what market we're talking about. There's really 3 different markets the way we look at it. There is the market that is bikes are sold on driveways on eBay and those types of things. About 2/3 of the used bikes are sold in that market. We do not have a lot of data with regards to what's happening to used bike prices, supply/demand driven very local. The other part of the market is used bikes are sold in our dealership. About 1/3 of the used bikes go through our dealer network, and that we do have more data on. And then finally, is the repo market. It's a very small market, only about 7% of overall sales. Used bike sales go through it. But important market and that a lot of the services take that data and try to project it forward under retail prices, and it obviously has an impact because we sell repossessed motorcycles on our credit losses. So when we look at the dealer network, we talked about a better part of the 2015 prices held up very well. We saw a little bit of softening in the fourth quarter which we talked about last quarter. That softness has continued into the first quarter, and it's not out of line with what we're seeing in the industry, but it is a little bit softer. And to answer your question on what's driving it or the lead of it are Cruisers. Cruisers are falling more, and that's what we would expect because that's what we're investing in. We certainly saw, when Rushmore came out, it is the Touring bike that fell more. So we are adding a lot of content with power in the new models and that's where we see more softness but that's also where we're adding a lot of the content. Tim, the other question that you asked is on HDFS. I think the question was around subprime, and subprime has been about 20% of our portfolio. Over time, subprime is represented between 15% and 25%. Subprime is a fantastic business. We have tremendous returns on it and sell a lot of incremental motorcycles, and we are seeing subprime normalize a little bit. But the fact of the matter is for the last 7 years, subprime has not behaved like subprime. It has performed extremely well, and we have priced our models for more of a normalized subprime performance, and we are starting to see more of a normalization which we talked about in the last several quarters. Overall, subprime is at about 20%. We do not have a target on subprime. Our objective is to do well-structured loans, and we're always looking for opportunities to improve. But we do not have a target per se."

Remember, a lot of local economies are in recession, and there's a lot of layouts in those areas. So we're seeing higher losses in oil-dependent areas in the United States. Number two is we see continued normalization of subprime and, again, subprime is starting to be a little bit more like subprime. Nothing of great concern because we price for that. And then the third area is lower used prices that we're seeing at the auction. And we saw, again, softness in the first quarter at auction. However, they firmed up quite a bit in the month of March. So we'll keep a close eye on that. But it's all 3. But again, Tim, I want to reiterate that we've talked about this for several years, is that we've expected credit losses to normalize. Coming-out of what has been a very great credit loss performance. And we're just starting to approach average levels of credit losses. So we feel very good about where we're at. We feel very good about the entire portfolio. That remains incredibly profitable. And it's doing what we expected and what we guided on at the beginning of the year.

That will go live right after the end of the second quarter. So that will be implemented in the month of July. Very similar, if you remember when we did this in our York facility a few years ago. With that, we will lose a fair amount of production in the month of July. Production will be down about 20 -- I'm sorry, about 30% in the month of July. So what you will see throughout the second quarter is a higher level of inventory because we're going to lose that production in July that we cannot make up and the rest of the third quarter, leading up to that, we're going to experience start-up costs in readying the organization, the plants to receive the system. It is a big implementation, it's bigger than what we did at our York facility, primarily at Kansas City, but there's other aspects to the launch and that's what you're seeing in the manufacturing expense in the first quarter and you're going to see it for the next several quarters. So a lot of it gets capitalized, but there's a fair amount of expense that goes on, and on a year-over-year basis is showing unfavorability. And that is to ready the organization, the training, the tabletop exercise, a lot of the testing that goes on. And so we're going to see that for the next several quarters.

So overall, we don't expect a big shift when we look at what's variable and fixed in SG&A because of this -- of this shift. It's going to be part of our ongoing spending. We've taken another $70 million out with our ongoing spending, and therefore, there's not a big shift in the 80/20 when we talk about fixed variable on SG&A. And again, in the preamble, we talked a little bit about our shift in timing. We expected there to be more SG&A, to be more unfavorable in the first quarter.

And we would expect it to be in the 2.2% to 2.5% range for the long-term. The second question is with regards to I think our mix of sales in the United States is what you were asking. So right now, 33% of our sales is to folks that are new to Harley-Davidson and new to motorcycling. So we call it new new. They're new to the sport and new to the Harley-Davidson which is one of the key focuses as we look to grow ridership in the United States. And so we're very pleased with it, we believe it's a very strong percentage. When you look at it worldwide, that percentage is up in the 60s. So overall, we're bringing a tremendous amount of new people in. We've talked in different times, and Matt mentioned it today, outreach. About 40% of the folks that buy a motorcycle in any given quarter or month are outreach customers, and important to keep the business moving forward. So there is the percentage, I don't know it off the top of my head, which are folks that come with a trade in. That has not changed dramatically on a year-over-year basis. That's part of the business, and one of the reasons we're investing in motorcycles is to encourage people to trade up. The third question that you asked was with regards to Japan, I think referring to the recent earthquakes in Japan. First of all, all of our employees and our dealers and their families are well. Sustained a little bit of damage to some of the dealerships, but it is an incredibly resilient country and they'll work through it.

And it topped out at about low double digit decline in retail sales in the fourth quarter. The good news is, is that it has not gotten worse in the first quarter. The bad news is it hasn't gotten better. So it had leveled off here, at least in the first quarter, and, hopefully, as we start to lap the successively weaker first quarter performance in 2015, it will get a little bit better here. Overall, it does have an impact on our U.S. retail sales, probably in the range of 1.5% of retail sales."

But maybe walk us through just why the magnitude of that inventory build at retail, I don't think you're saying that any of it has to do with the third quarter production thing and sort of shipping out in front of that, but maybe walk us through that. And then on the factory inventory side, up 30% in the fourth quarter, up 15% in the first quarter. Presumably that was a sizeable benefit to the 4Q gross margin as you get the higher fixed cost absorption. How should we think about that impacted in the first quarter?

And when you look at, you're right, James, that years we have models in and out, but when we look at from a year ago, there are 5 incremental models that we shipped. So",505,"Okay, the first question is with regards to retail inventory, and it's up 4,900 units. And when you look at, you're right, James, that years we have models in and out, but when we look at from a year ago, there are 5 incremental models that we shipped. So with that, there are 730-ish dealers that need to have models on the floor. And if you do the math, that's I think a less of a couple of models for each of those. So that is the driver of why inventory is up, and those dealers need the models to sell. In addition to that though, the primary driver is that we're carrying higher inventory because we are increasing marketing spending by 65%. Most of that coming in the early part of the year, and we want to make sure the availability is there. And as we talked about, we pulled forward a lot of the production, and we made some more in the fourth quarter of last year so that we could get out to a quick start. Part of the strategy has been to spend a lot more marketing money in the south and get units there quicker because they are not in -- the springtime happens a lot earlier than in the north. And so we did that and it's been effective. With that though, we had, as you pointed out, a higher level of inventory on the balance sheet at the end of the year, and it was up $137 million or 33%. That's come down significantly at the end of the first quarter. I think we're up 15%. That is driven by finished goods inventory, and we do have higher level of inventory in finished goods at the second quarter. That is based on one being able to supply the market as we invest more and the fact that we have an ERP system that is coming in the second, at the end of the second quarter. So overall, inventories that we have, whether they be on the balance sheet or in the market, will be elevated in second quarter because we've got to get that trajectory to have enough inventory in order to bridge the ERP implementation and deliver the model year '17 motorcycles in the third week of August. So you will see it higher. That inventory will come out as the year progresses. We did shift more production into the fourth quarter last year than we had talked about some of the inefficiencies and the time that our workers were off, and we put that in. That should be a [indiscernible] onetime adjustment, and that production will be at similar levels in the fourth quarter of this year. So you're not going to see a big impact. The impact was in lower production in the first quarter here, which is part of the unfavorable manufacturing expense is that we did not produce as much in the first quarter because we carried forward more from the fourth quarter."

Today, I'll provide additional insight around our first quarter financial results found in our press release and supporting slides. 
The summary of our first quarter financial results starts on Slide 4. Overall, we are pleased with the first quarter performance. Despite the challenging conditions we continue to face, we remain focused on driving demand and delivering strong margins and strong returns over the long term. During the quarter, revenue was $1.75 billion. Net income was $250.5 million. And diluted earnings per share were $1.36. Operating income from the motorcycle segment was down 3.8% from last year's first quarter. Segment revenue was up 4.4% in the quarter behind a 4.3% increase in motorcycle shipments. As anticipated, gross margin as a percent of revenue decreased versus prior year as a result of unfavorable product mix and currency exchange in addition to higher year-over-year start-up costs. SG&A was also up in the quarter as we significantly increased our investments in demand driving marketing and product development. Operating income, as a percent of revenue in Q1, was 21.1%. At HDFS, operating income was down 12.8% year-over-year. The quarter also reflected higher corporate interest expense resulting from our 2015 recapitalization. 
Now let's take a look at retail sales on Slide 5. Worldwide retail sales of new Harley-Davidson Motorcycles in the first quarter were up 1.4% versus prior year, an improvement from being down 0.6% in Q4 2015. Retail sales were up in our international regions and down slightly in the U.S. During the quarter, we made progress against our long-term growth objectives. We are driving demand in an environment of intense global competition. We believe Q1 retail sales benefited from our demand driving marketing investments and a strong reception to our new 2016 model year motorcycles. 
Starting in the first quarter and throughout 2016, we plan to invest an incremental $70 million to drive demand. We expect our 2016 year-over-year investment in customer-facing marketing to be up 65% and product development investment to be up 35%. Our new motorcycle -- our new 2016 model year motorcycles continue to sell well during the quarter. Cruiser sales were strong driven by our 2 new Softail S models and our 2 Refresh Sportsters. Touring sales also benefited from the new Road Glide Ultra. While retail sales were up on a worldwide basis, we continue to experience headwinds from intense competitive implement and challenging macroeconomic conditions around the world. We are confident in our strong brand and our ability to grow in this highly competitive environment without engaging in brand damaging discounting. 
Let's take a look at the U.S. market on Slide 6. In the first quarter, we saw a slight decline in retail sales of 0.5%. As we anticipated, retail sales improved from recent trends despite the increasingly intense competitive discounting and declines in oil-dependent areas. During the quarter, we significantly increased our marketing investment focused on growing product awareness and growing ridership in the U.S. Retail market share for the first quarter continued to stabilize, down slightly compared to the same period last year. The industry continued to grow, up 0.8% in the first quarter on top of the 9.0% increase in Q1 of last year. Finally, as expected, U.S. dealer retail inventory was up approximately 4,900 motorcycles at the end of the quarter compared to 2015, largely due to the initial dealer fill of our new 2016 models. We continue to be diligent in our efforts to manage supply in line with demand, and we're comfortable with the dealer inventory at the end of the quarter. 
On Slide 7, you'll see retail sales in our international markets were up 4.5% in the first quarter driven by sales increases in EMEA, Asia Pacific and Canada, partially offset by weakness in Brazil. In fact, excluding Brazil, international markets were up a strong 8.9%. EMEA region retail sales were up 8.8% in Q1, reflecting the significant increase in demand-driving investments in that market. All major markets across EMEA were up in the quarter with strong gains in France, Switzerland, Italy and emerging markets in the region. 
First quarter market share in Europe was up -- was 10.3%, up 0.5 percentage points versus prior year, which is an improvement in recent market share trends. Market share growth was driven by increased investment and a great reception to our new motorcycles. Asia Pacific retail sales were up 6.6% in the first quarter, our best ever first quarter. This growth was accomplished despite the adverse impact of temporarily exiting retail sales in Indonesia as we replaced the dealer network in order to improve the customer experience in that market. 
Latin America retail sales were down 26.5% in the quarter as a result of declines in Brazil, partially offset by strong growth in Mexico. Brazil's retail sales continue to be impacted by a challenging economy and consumer uncertainty. In response to the nearly 50% devaluation of Brazilian real last year, we raised model year 2016 prices approximately 20%. While profitability for motorcycle improved, we expect retail sales to be down for the year. Finally, retail sales in Canada were up 16.3% in the first quarter. We believe the market continued to respond well to the change to a direct distribution model. In support of our strategic focus on increasing brand access, we plan to continue to expand our international distribution. We added 5 new international dealerships in the first quarter. 
On Slide 8, you'll see wholesale shipments of Harley-Davidson motorcycles in the quarter were up 4.3% compared to last year, at the high end of our expected range for the quarter. During the quarter, we shipped a higher percent of Cruiser motorcycles compared to last year given our product investments and model year 2016 motorcycles launched last August, as well as the Low Rider S and CVO Pro Street Breakout we started shipping toward the end of the first quarter. We exited 2015 with increased motorcycle inventory on our balance sheet. This increase was aimed at supplying more motorcycles early in the year than typical in order to support our 2016 marketing plan and investments. While Q1 company inventory was down from year end, it was still up versus prior year to support the selling season and our increased investments in marketing. Throughout the second quarter, we expect elevated year-over-year inventory as we anticipate lost production in the third quarter associated with the implementation of our ERP system in our Kansas City plant. 
On Slide 9, you'll see revenue for the motorcycles and related products segment was up in the first quarter behind a 4.3% increase in motorcycle shipments. Q1 revenue was unfavorably impacted by currency exchange, which reduced revenue growth by nearly a percentage point. The average motorcycle revenue per unit was up slightly for the quarter behind higher pricing partially offset by unfavorable currency exchange. During the quarter, P&A revenue was flat. And General Merchandise revenue was up 6.3% behind stronger sales of riding gear. Both P&A and General Merchandise revenues were adversely affected by unfavorable currency exchange during the quarter. 
On Slide 10, you'll see gross margin as a percent of revenue in the quarter was down 1.7 percentage points versus last year. Gross margin was supported by favorable volume, price and raw materials, offset by unfavorable mix, foreign currency exchange and manufacturing costs. During the quarter, overall mix was the headwind of $14.8 million driven by a shift in both motorcycles and related product mix. Foreign currency exchange was unfavorable behind the significant weakening of our key foreign currencies on a year-over-year basis. On a combined basis, the euro, yen, Brazilian real and Australian dollars devalued an average of 4% compared to the prior-year quarter. In the first quarter, gross margin was adversely impacted by $10.6 million as a result of lower revenue. 
Manufacturing was unfavorable by $15.6 million driven by higher year-over-year start-up costs, including the costs related to the implementation of our ERP system in our Kansas City plant, which we expect to be complete by the end of Q3. In addition, we experienced lower fixed cost absorption as a result of lower production in Q1 versus the same period last year. 
On Slide 11, operating margin as a percent of revenue for the first quarter was a very strong 21.1%, but down 1.8 percentage points compared to last year's first quarter. As anticipated, operating income of $332.5 million for the quarter was unfavorably impacted by higher SG&A. While SG&A spending was lower than we expected due to a shift in timing of spending from Q1 to Q2, SG&A was up $13.0 million year-over-year driven by our increased investment in marketing and product development and costs associated with managing our Canadian operations, which we acquired in August of 2015. We remain intensely focused on a cost structure that will enable growth and continuous improvement to drive our business to be stronger, more flexible and more profitable. 
Now let's take a look at our Financial Services segment on Slide 12. During the quarter, HDFS' operating profit decreased $8.3 million, 12.8% compared to last year. The primary factors impacting first quarter results were: First, net interest income was up over prior year by $1.6 million, driven by higher receivables, partially offset by higher interest costs and lower yields on receivables due in part to the 2015 low interest rate promotional activity; and second, the provision for retail motorcycle loan losses was increased over prior year by $12.9 million driven by higher retail credit losses and an associated increase in the allowance for retail credit losses. 
HDFS' operations are summarized on Slide 13. During the first quarter, HDFS' retail motorcycle loan originations increased 8.9% compared to the same period last year. In the first quarter, loan originations were comprised of approximately 80% prime loans and 20% subprime. As a predominant industry lender to subprime customers, these originations represent a significant number of retail sales to the company at very attractive returns. For the quarter, HDFS continued to have a strong U.S. market -- retail market share of new Harley-Davidson Motorcycles at 56.8%, up 3.5 percentage points. At the end of the quarter, we had $344.7 million of cash and cash equivalents at HDFS. In addition, HDFS had $1.1 billion of available liquidity through bank credit and conduit facilities. This quarter, HDFS issued $1.2 billion in medium-term notes and paid $140 million dividend to Harley-Davidson, Inc. 
On Slide 14, you'll see 30-day delinquency rate for retail motorcycle loans at the end of the first quarter was 2.88% or 24 basis points higher than Q1 2015. The delinquency rate was up particularly in oil-dependent areas. Despite the increase, delinquency remained at low levels. Annual retail credit losses increased by 42 basis points to 1.98% compared to 2015. The increase was a result of higher losses on loans in oil-dependent areas, normalizing subprime performance and lower used bike values at auction. During the quarter, HDFS continue to maintain a strong liquidity position and contributed strong profitability to the company. 
The remaining Harley-Davidson, Inc. financial results are summarized on Slide 15. The company generated operating cash of $41.1 million during the quarter down from last year, driven by increased wholesale lending and higher working capital. Also, the tax rate was 34.5%, which is in line with last year's rate. The company has and intends to continue to maintain a minimum of 12 months of projected liquidity needs in cash and/or committed credit facilities. 
Switching our focus to shareholder value on Slide 16, returning value to our shareholders is a top priority. During the first quarter, we raised our quarterly dividend from $0.31 to $0.35 per share, up 12.9%. In addition, we repurchased 3.4 million shares of our stock for $144.6 million. Looking forward, we expect to continue to return excess cash to our shareholders in the form of increasing dividends and continued share repurchases. 
On Slide 17, you'll see our overall expectations for 2016. In 2016, we continue to expect to ship 269,000 to 274,000 motorcycles, an increase of approximately 1% to 3%. We expect second quarter shipments to be approximately down 3% to up 3% versus last year's second quarter. U.S. dealer retail inventory is expected to be up at year-end 2016 to support incremental models and increased marketing investment. For the full year 2016, we expect operating margin for the motorcycle segment to be between 16% and 17%. We believe 2016's gross margin, as a percent of revenue, will be down year-over-year driven by unfavorable foreign currency exchange, unfavorable mix, higher year-over-year start-up costs associated with the implementation of our ERP system at our Kansas City plant. To dimensionalize the foreign currency exchange risks, if currencies held the recent exchange rates for the remainder of 2016, we estimate that our expected full year motorcycle segment revenue would be slightly unfavorable on a year-over-year basis. We would expect an unfavorable impact to gross margin of approximately $50 million, driven by lapping last year's hedge benefits, an unfavorable impact to gross margin of nearly 1 percentage point on a full year basis. 
During the second quarter, we expect gross margin, expressed as a percent of revenue, to be down on a year-over-year basis driven by, first, unfavorable currency exchange. Currency is expected to adversely impact gross margin by $25 million to $30 million in the quarter primarily due to lapping a year ago hedge gains of $20 million, lowering gross margin by approximately 1.5 percentage points. 
Next, we expect shipment mix will continue to be unfavorable in Q2 behind a stronger shipment mix of Cruisers and Sportsters, supporting the strong demand we have seen in these segments and our recently announced new product introductions. Finally, we expect manufacturing cost to continue to be unfavorable behind higher year-over-year start-up costs. 
Looking at SG&A, while we will invest a significant amount more in marketing and product development, we expect full year spending to be flat to up modestly from 2015. As a percent of revenue, we expect SG&A will decrease. For HDFS, we expect operating income will be down modestly in 2016 compared to 2015 as a result of increased borrowing cost and higher credit losses, partially offset by increased revenues. Capital expenditures in 2016 are expected to be between $255 million and $275 million as we increase investment in product development focused on bringing exciting products to market and as we continue to invest in our systems infrastructure, most notably the implementation of an ERP system. 
Finally, we continue to expect our full year 2016 effective tax rate will be approximately 34.5%. We are pleased to deliver a return to retail sales growth and stabilizing market shares in the first quarter. We will continue to navigate through the challenging environment and are making investments to drive demand and deliver strong margins and strong returns over the long term. Thank you for your investment in Harley-Davidson. 
Now I'll turn it over to Matt."

As we shared in January, our plan for 2016 and beyond increases our focus, investment and resolve to drive increased demand for exceptional brand and products. I'll share with you some highlights on how we're progressing with the plan, but first I'd like to provide my perspective on our first quarter results. 
As John mentioned, we saw overall growth in worldwide retail sales reach 1.4%. It demonstrates the initial success we're having with our strategy to drive demand and deliver results in a highly competitive environment. As I've said before, competition is a great thing for the entire industry and the customer. It drives us to be better than we've ever been in every respect to grow our leadership position and run a strong and profitable business while we do so. We don't expect the current environment to change. In fact, we view it as the new normal, so we'll continue to take steps necessary to further strengthen the company and compete effectively in our quest to lead in every market. As I reflect on the quarter, international continues to be a real bright spot with great results in EMEA, Asia Pacific and Canada. Our international retail sales have continued to grow, and we anticipate growing international retail sales at a faster rate than in the U.S. over time. And while retail sales were down 0.5% in the U.S., they were an improvement over recent trends. And we're working with diligence, skill and commitment to maintain and enhance our leadership position here in the United States. Importantly, while we recognize we've made progress in the first quarter, we also recognized we still have more to do and more to deliver. 
So let's get to the key elements of our demand-driving strategy. Harley-Davidson enjoys customer loyalty and brand appeal that would be the envy of any business. And the core goal of our plan to drive demand is to build an even stronger, deeper bond with our existing loyal customers while creating powerful connections with new customers. To do this, we set our 4 -- our focus on 4 key areas: first, increase product and brand awareness; second, grow new ridership in the United States; third, increase and enhance brand access; and finally, accelerate the cadence and impact of new products. We kicked off a number of initiatives in these 4 areas at various points in the first quarter, some of which influenced first quarter performance and others we anticipate will bear fruit in the months and years ahead. To increase product and brand awareness, we've stepped up our advertising and PR presence in every region, taking full advantage of digital and traditional media to tell our story and the stories of our customers. We've also increased our presence at major events and increased the number of demo opportunities for riders to experience first hand our motorcycles, accessories and apparel that offer unlimited potential for them to make a unique and bold statement about who they are. Nothing reinforces the fundamental of appeal of our products and the many enhancements we've made to our motorcycles in recent years better than a demo ride. So we've been dialing up our demo opportunities around the world. 
In EMEA, for example, the Discover More touring campaign more than doubled demand for demo rides during the first quarter compared to the same period in 2015. In Asia Pacific, our increased media investment is driving greater awareness for the brand and our demo events with encouraging results. 
In Japan, for example, demo rides are up 57% over last year. And Australia and New Zealand are seeing substantial increase in demo rides year-over-year as well. In the United States, we've stepped up our presence in key events, such as South by Southwest, the X Games, and of course, Daytona Bike Week, where we engage riders and connected them with our great dealers. During Bike Week, we saw a 30% increase in the number of demo rides and a 27% increase in total retail sales of new motorcycles through local dealers as compared to 2015. 
In mid-March, we launched the Live Your Legend integrated marketing campaign. This global campaign highlights real life stories from current Harley-Davidson riders, dealers and employees to encourage new riders to get out and live their legend. What is most powerful about the campaign is the message. It's a rallying cry to inspire the next generation of riders to act now and invest in the experiences that define their legacy. The emotional appeal of our brand process borders, cultures and generations. It's more than just a motorcycle, it's a way of life and a personal expression for millions of riders around the world. And it's inspiring others to pick up the sport and learn to ride on a Harley-Davidson motorcycle. 
Growing the sport of motorcycling in the United States is also about increasing our investment in the Harley-Davidson Riding Academy. In the first quarter, we increased the number of dealers offering the program by 8% and the number of classes offered by 35%. Through March, our dealers trained over 8,000 students, a 37% increase from last year. A big driver of that increase is our incredibly successful Learn to Ride for Free program, which we're offering to current and former members of the U.S. military and first responders throughout 2016. Increasing access to our brand through our dealers also remains an important demand catalyst. And we're continuing our progress in expanding and enhancing the dealer network, which we believe is the absolute best in the world and a key competitive advantage. During the first quarter we opened new dealer points in Belgium, Brazil, Hong Kong, India and the Philippines. By 2020, we plan to add 150 to 200 new dealerships internationally. 
Now let's talk a little bit about some awesome products. Our first quarter results reflect the strength and impact of our new 2016 motorcycles, including the refreshed Iron 883 and 48, as well as the S Series Cruisers and the Road Glide Ultra. We announced the Low Rider S and the CVO Pro Street Breakout Cruisers this quarter and started shipping them to dealerships in March. Just yesterday, we unveiled the new Harley-Davidson Roadster to the world at a media event in Marseille, France, and the reaction has been fantastic. This new model joins the Dark Custom lineup and is featured in the Live Your Legend campaign. We've included a link to the latest spot in today's earnings release, and I encourage you to check it out. 
What I've outlined here is just a sampling of the all-in comprehensive nature of our work to drive demand, work that leverages all the great and strong directions of our brand, further strengthening and reinforcing our incredible foundations of industry-leading products, experiences, customer passion and loyalty that are wrapped up in Harley-Davidson brand. These are investments to deliver the near-term results that will drive long-term performance and value for all our stakeholders. We're confident that our investments will generate interest, drive traffic and drive sales. We're also confident that they will enhance our already unrivaled industry and brand leadership and business performance too. 
Before we move on to questions, I'd like to share some important customer information with you. As you know, one of our strategic objectives is to grow the sport of motorcycling in the United States, in part by growing the number of core customers and growing outreach at a faster rate. As highlighted in today's press release, for the eighth straight year, we remain the #1 seller of new on-road motorcycles in the U.S. to young adults aged 18 to 34, to women, African-Americans and Hispanics [indiscernible] Caucasian men, ages 35 and up. This is the case in the 601+CC segment and across all on-road motorcycles of all displacements. We continue to sell more Harley-Davidson Motorcycles to today's young adults than we did to the baby boomers when they were young adults. And we're bringing new riders of all ages into the sport. 
Over the last 5 years, an increasing number of on-road first-time riders in the United States have purchased new Harley-Davidson Motorcycles. In 2015, 1/3 of new Harley-Davidson purchasers in the U.S. had not owned a motorcycle previously. We know we've got more to do and more to deliver. We're confident in the strength of our strategy, the passion of our people and the power of our brand. 
The Harley-Davidson brand is among the most iconic on the planet, a position of strength we've built during our continuous 113-year history. No one else has a network of dealers like we do, made up of individuals who get up everyday with the sole purpose of delivering exceptional Harley-Davidson experiences. And no one else has employees like ours, who takes such great pride in creating and building legendary Harley-Davidson Motorcycles and delivering our unique experiences to every corner of the planet. Our inspiration and our drive comes from our customers, millions of riders who yearn to experience personal freedom on their individual terms. This is what we do, and we do it like no one else. 
So with that, let's take your questions."

Again, that's made up of customer-facing marketing and things like, Live Your Legend that Matt just talked about. Heroes Ride Free, we've talked about our training military folks and police and fire for free. We're seeing great results on that. As Matt mentioned, that's up 37%. So one of the measures is, are we increasing the number of people we're training? And overall, sales are up quite significantly when you look at our graduates that are buying motorcycles. So that is clearly a volume measure there. We've also got -- discovered more demos and demos taking place all over the world. The metrics on that is, are we getting more people on motorcycles? And we certainly follow through with those sales and -- or those demos to make sure that they're turning into sales and doing the follow-ups. The other big thing that we're investing in is Battle of the Kings, which accentuates and highlights our customization and personalization, which is unique to Harley-Davidson. So all of these things are what we're doing to drive demand versus the alternative and the easy way out which is the discount. So we're taking the high road on this. We're doing what builds the brand and creates customer loyalty. And we've got measures across all of it. But you're absolutely right, Craig, at the end of the day, it's measured in, are we selling more sales? Or are we selling more motorcycles to our customers?"

Talking about used prices, whenever we talk about used prices, we got to be clear on what market we're talking about. There's really 3 different markets the way we look at it. There is the market that is bikes are sold on driveways on eBay and those types of things. About 2/3 of the used bikes are sold in that market. We do not have a lot of data with regards to what's happening to used bike prices, supply/demand driven very local. The other part of the market is used bikes are sold in our dealership. About 1/3 of the used bikes go through our dealer network, and that we do have more data on. And then finally is the repo market. It's a very small market, only about 7% of overall sales. Used bike sales go through it, but an important market in that a lot of the services take that data and try to project it forward under retail prices. And it obviously has an impact because we sell repossessed motorcycles on our credit losses. So when we look at the dealer network, we talked about a better part of the 2015 prices held up very well. We saw a little bit of softening in the fourth quarter which we talked about last quarter. That softness has continued into the first quarter, and it's not out of line with what we're seeing in the industry, but it is a little bit softer. And to answer your question on what's driving it or the lead of it is Cruisers. Cruisers are falling more, and that's what we would expect because that's what we're investing in. We certainly saw, when Rushmore came out, it was the Touring bikes that fell more. So we're adding a lot of content with power in the new models, and that's where we're seeing more softness. But that's also where we're adding a lot of the content. Tim, the other question that you asked is on HDFS. I think the question was around subprime. And subprime has been about 20% of our portfolio. Over time, subprime is represented between 15% and 25%. Subprime is a fantastic business. We have tremendous returns on it and sell a lot of incremental motorcycles. And we are seeing subprime normalize a little bit. But the fact of the matter is for the last 7 years, subprime has not behaved like subprime. It has performed extremely well, and we have priced our models for more of a normalized subprime performance. And we are starting to see more of a normalization, which we talked about in the last several quarters. Overall, subprime is at about 20%. We do not have a target on subprime. Our objective is to do well-structured loans. And we're always looking for opportunities to improve, but we do not have a target per se."

Number two is we see continued normalization of subprime. And again, subprime is starting to behave a little bit more like subprime. Nothing of great concern because we price for that. And then the third area is lower used prices that we're seeing at the auction. And we saw, again, softness in the first quarter at auction. However, they firmed up quite a bit in the month of March. So we'll keep a close eye on that. But it's all 3. But again, Tim, I want to reiterate that we've talked about this for several years, is that we've expected credit losses to normalize. Coming out of what has been a very great credit loss performance. And we're just starting to approach average levels of credit losses. So we feel very good about where we're at. We feel very good about the entire portfolio. That remains incredibly profitable. And it's doing what we expected and what we guided on at the beginning of the year.

With that, we will lose a fair amount of production in the month of July. Production will be down about 20 -- I'm sorry, about 30% in the month of July. So what you will see throughout the second quarter is a higher level of inventory because we're going to lose that production in July that we cannot make up in the rest of the third quarter. Leading up to that, we're going to experience start-up costs in readying the organization, the plants to receive the system. It is a big implementation, it's bigger than what we did at our York facility, primarily that's on Kansas City, but there's other aspects to the launch. And that's what you're seeing in the manufacturing expense in the first quarter, and you're going to see it for the next several quarters. So a lot of it gets capitalized, but there's a fair amount of expense that goes on. And on a year-over-year basis, it's showing unfavorability. And that is to ready the organization, the training, the tabletop exercise, a lot of the testing that goes on. And so we're going to see that for the next several quarters. But it will launch in the third quarter, and we will lose some production in July. I think the other question that you asked, Gerrick, was with regards to the number of dealers that have Riding Academy."

And we're not going to compete by discounting. We're going to compete by driving equity into the brand. And with that, we believe we need the $70 million to grow the business despite wider price gaps that we expect to compete in the future. Having said that, Rod, we expect that $70 million to continue on into the future. A lot of that was funded out of taking other fixed cost out of our SG&A base. So overall, we don't expect a big shift when we look at what's variable and fixed in SG&A because of this shift. It's going to be part of our ongoing spending. We've taken another $70 million out with our ongoing spending, and therefore, there's not a big shift in the 80/20 when we talk about fixed variable on SG&A. And again, in the preamble, we talked a little bit about our shift in timing. We expected there to be more SG&A, to be more unfavorable in the first quarter. It was $13 million higher, and we would expect certainly the second quarter to be higher and shift some of the spending in the first quarter into the second quarter. In aggregate, on a full year basis, we would expect SG&A to be about flat to up modestly, but we are going to see more of that spending taking place in the first 3 quarters because that's when the motorcycles take place and a lot of our marketing investment will happen."

As we talked about, we don't expect to see that ratio to change much. It inflected and it changed a fair amount in the downturn. And that is just more of the new normal. And we would expect it to be in the 2.2% to 2.5% range for the long term. The second question is with regards to, I think, our mix of sales in the United States is what you were asking. So right now, 33% of our sales is to folks that are new to Harley-Davidson and new to motorcycling. So we call it new-new. They're new to the sport and new to Harley-Davidson, which is one of the key focuses as we look to grow ridership in the United States. So we're very pleased with it. We believe it's a very strong percentage. When you look at that worldwide, that percentage is up in the 60s. So overall, we're bringing a tremendous amount of new people in. We've talked in different times and Matt mentioned it today, outreach. About 40% of the folks that buy a motorcycle in any given quarter or month are outreach customers and important to keep the business moving forward. So there is the percentage, I do not know it off the top of my head, which is folks that come with a trade in. That has not changed dramatically on a year-over-year basis. That's part of the business. And one of the reasons we're investing in motorcycles is to encourage people to trade up. The third question that you asked was with regards to Japan, I think referring to the recent earthquakes in Japan. First of all, all of our employees and our dealers and their families are well. Sustained a little bit of damage to some of the dealerships, but it is an incredibly resilient country, and they'll work through it. We do not see any disruption in the supply chain coming from Japan at this time."

I don't think you're saying that any of it has to do with the third quarter production thing and sort of shipping out in front of that, but maybe walk us through that. And then on the factory inventory side, up 30% in the fourth quarter, up 15% in the first quarter. Presumably that was a sizeable benefit to the 4Q gross margin as you get the higher fixed-cost absorption. How should we think about that impact in the first quarter?

And when you look at the -- you're right, James, that years we have models in and out. But when we look at from a year ago, there are 5 incremental models that we shipped. So with that, there are 730-ish dealers that need to have models on the floor. And if you do the math, that's, I think, less than a couple of models for each of those. So that is the driver of why inventory is up, and those dealers need the models to sell. In addition to that though, the primary driver is that we are carrying higher inventory because we are increasing marketing spending by 65%, most of that coming in the early part of the year. And we want to make sure that the availability is there. And as we talked about, we pulled forward a lot of the production. And we made some more in the fourth quarter of last year so that we could get out to a quick start. Part of the strategy has been to spend a lot more marketing money in the south and get units there quicker because they are not in -- their springtime happens a lot earlier than in the north. And so we did that, and it's been effective. With that though, we had, as you pointed out, a higher level of inventory on the balance sheet at the end of the year. And it was up $137 million or 33%. That's come down significantly at the end of the first quarter. I think we're up 15%. That is driven by finished goods inventory. And we do have higher level of inventory in finished goods at the second quarter. That is based on one being able to supply the market as we invest more and the fact that we have an ERP system that is coming in the second -- at the end of the second quarter. So overall, inventories that we have, whether they be on the balance sheet or in the market will be elevated in second quarter because we've got to get that trajectory to have enough inventory to bridge the ERP implementation and deliver the model year '17 motorcycles in the third week of August. So you will see it higher. That inventory will come out as the year progresses. We did shift more production into the fourth quarter last year. And we had talked about some of the inefficiencies and the time that our workers were off. And we put that in. That should be viewed as part of a onetime adjustment, and that production will be at similar levels in the fourth quarter of this year. So you're not going to see a big impact. The impact was in lower production in the first quarter here, which is part of the unfavorable manufacturing expense is that we did not produce as much in the first quarter because we carried forward more from the fourth quarter."

Today, I'll provide additional insight around our first quarter financial results found in our press release and supporting slides. The summary of our first quarter financial results starts on Slide 4. Overall, w",2483,"Thanks, Amy, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll provide additional insight around our first quarter financial results found in our press release and supporting slides. 
The summary of our first quarter financial results starts on Slide 4. Overall, we are pleased with the first quarter performance. Despite the challenging conditions we continue to face, we remain focused on driving demand and delivering strong margins and strong returns over the long term. During the quarter, revenue was $1.75 billion, net income was $250.5 million and diluted earnings per share were $1.36. Operating income from the motorcycle segment was down 3.8% from last year's first quarter. Segment revenue was up 4.4% in the quarter behind a 4.3% increase in motorcycle shipments. As anticipated, gross margin as a percent of revenue decreased versus prior year as a result of unfavorable product mix and currency exchange in addition to higher year-over-year start-up costs. SG&A was also up in the quarter as we significantly increased our investments in demand driving marketing and product development. Operating income, as a percent of revenue in Q1, was 21.1%. At HDFS, operating income was down 12.8% year-over-year. The quarter also reflected higher corporate interest expense resulting from our 2015 recapitalization. 
Now let's take a look at retail sales on Slide 5. Worldwide retail sales of new Harley-Davidson Motorcycles in the first quarter were up 1.4% versus prior year, an improvement from being down 0.6% in Q4 2015. Retail sales were up in our international regions and down slightly in the U.S. During the quarter, we made progress against our long-term growth objectives. We are driving demand in an environment of intense global competition. We believe Q1 retail sales benefited from our demand driving marketing investments and a strong reception to our new 2016 model year motorcycles. 
Starting in the first quarter and throughout 2016, we plan to invest an incremental $70 million to drive demand. We expect our 2016 year-over-year investment in customer-facing marketing to be up 65% and product development investment to be up 35%. Our new motorcycle -- our new 2016 model year motorcycles continue to sell well during the quarter. Cruiser sales were strong driven by our 2 new Softail S models and our 2 Refresh Sportsters. Touring sales also benefited from the new Road Glide Ultra. While retail sales were up on a worldwide basis, we continue to experience headwinds from intense competitive implement and challenging macroeconomic conditions around the world. We are confident in our strong brand and our ability to grow in this highly competitive environment without engaging in brand damaging discounting. 
Let's take a look at the U.S. market on Slide 6. In the first quarter, we saw a slight decline in retail sales of 0.5%. As we anticipated, retail sales improved from recent trends despite the increasingly intense competitive discounting and declines in oil-dependent areas. During the quarter, we significantly increased our marketing investment focused on growing product awareness and growing ridership in the U.S. Retail market share for the first quarter continued to stabilize, down slightly compared to the same period last year. The industry continued to grow, up 0.8% in the first quarter on top of the 9.0% increase in Q1 of last year. Finally, as expected, U.S. dealer retail inventory was up approximately 4,900 motorcycles at the end of the quarter compared to 2015, largely due to the initial dealer fill of our new 2016 models. We continue to be diligent in our efforts to manage supply in line with demand, and were comfortable with the dealer inventory at the end of the quarter. 
On Slide 7, you'll see retail sales in our international markets were up 4.5% in the first quarter driven by sales increases in EMEA, Asia Pacific and Canada, partially offset by weakness in Brazil. In fact, excluding Brazil, international markets were up a strong 8.9%. EMEA region retail sales were up 8.8% in Q1, reflecting the significant increase in demand-driving investments in that market. All major markets across EMEA were up in the quarter with strong gains in France, Switzerland, Italy and emerging markets in the region. 
First quarter market share in Europe was up -- was 10.3%, up 0.5 percentage points versus prior year, which is an improvement in recent market share trends. Market share growth was driven by increased investment and a great reception to our new motorcycles. Asia Pacific retail sales were up 6.6% in the first quarter, our best ever first quarter. This growth was accomplished despite the adverse impact of temporarily exiting retail sales in Indonesia as we replaced the dealer network in order to improve the customer experience in that market. 
Latin America retail sales were down 26.5% in the quarter as a result of declines in Brazil, partially offset by strong growth in Mexico. Brazil's retail sales continue to be impacted by a challenging economy and consumer uncertainty. In response to the nearly 50% devaluation of Brazilian real last year, we raised model year 2016 prices approximately 20%. While profitability per motorcycle improved, we expect retail sales to be down for the year. Finally, retail sales in Canada were up 16.3% in the first quarter. We believe the market continued to respond well to the change to a direct distribution model. In support of our strategic focus on increasing brand access, we plan to continue to expand our international distribution. We added 5 new international dealerships in the first quarter. 
On Slide 8, you'll see wholesale shipments of Harley-Davidson motorcycles in the quarter were up 4.3% compared to last year, at the high end of our expected range for the quarter. During the quarter, we shipped a higher percent of Cruiser motorcycles compared to last year given our product investments in model year 2016 motorcycles launched last August, as well as the Low Rider S and CVO Pro Street Breakout we started shipping toward the end of the first quarter. We exited 2015 with increased motorcycle inventory on our balance sheet. This increase was aimed at supplying more motorcycles early in the year than typical in order to support our 2016 marketing plan and investments. While Q1 company inventory was down from year end, it was still up versus prior year to support the selling season and our increased investments in marketing. Throughout the second quarter, we expect elevated year-over-year inventory as we anticipate lost production in the third quarter associated with the implementation of our ERP system in our Kansas City plant. 
On Slide 9, you'll see revenue for the motorcycles and related products segment was up in the first quarter behind a 4.3% increase in motorcycle shipments. Q1 revenue was unfavorably impacted by currency exchange, which reduced revenue growth by nearly 1 percentage point. The average motorcycle revenue per unit was up slightly for the quarter behind higher pricing partially offset by unfavorable currency exchange. During the quarter, P&A revenue was flat. And General Merchandise revenue was up 6.3% behind stronger sales of riding gear. Both P&A and General Merchandise revenues were adversely affected by unfavorable currency exchange during the quarter. 
On Slide 10, you'll see gross margin as a percent of revenue in the quarter was down 1.7 percentage points versus last year. Gross margin was supported by favorable volume, price and raw materials, offset by unfavorable mix, foreign currency exchange and manufacturing costs. During the quarter, overall mix was the headwind of $14.8 million driven by a shift in both motorcycles and related product mix. Foreign currency exchange was unfavorable behind the significant weakening of our key foreign currencies on a year-over-year basis. On a combined basis, the euro, yen, Brazilian real and Australian dollars devalued an average of 4% compared to the prior-year quarter. In the first quarter, gross margin was adversely impacted by $10.6 million as a result of lower revenue. Manufacturing was unfavorable by $15.6 million driven by higher year-over-year start-up costs, including the costs related to the implementation of our ERP system in our Kansas City plant, which we expect to be complete by the end of Q3. In addition, we experienced lower fixed cost absorption as a result of lower production in Q1 versus the same period last year. 
On Slide 11, operating margin as a percent of revenue for the first quarter was a very strong 21.1%, but down 1.8 percentage points compared to last year's first quarter. As anticipated, operating income of $332.5 million for the quarter was unfavorably impacted by higher SG&A. While SG&A spending was lower than we expected due to a shift in timing of spending from Q1 to Q2, SG&A was up $13.0 million year-over-year driven by our increased investment in marketing and product development and costs associated with managing our Canadian operations, which we acquired in August of 2015. We remain intensely focused on a cost structure that will enable growth and continuous improvement to drive our business to be stronger, more flexible and more profitable. 
Now let's take a look at our Financial Services segment on Slide 12. During the quarter, HDFS' operating profit decreased $8.3 million, 12.8% compared to last year. The primary factors impacting first quarter results were: First, net interest income was up over prior year by $1.6 million, driven by higher receivables, partially offset by higher interest costs and lower yields on receivables due in part to the 2015 low interest rate promotional activity; and second, the provision for retail motorcycle loan losses was increased over prior year by $12.9 million driven by higher retail credit losses and an associated increase in the allowance for retail credit losses. 
HDFS' operations are summarized on Slide 13. During the first quarter, HDFS' retail motorcycle loan originations increased 8.9% compared to the same period last year. In the first quarter, loan originations were comprised of approximately 80% prime loans and 20% subprime. As a predominant industry lender to subprime customers, these originations represent a significant number of retail sales to the company at very attractive returns. For the quarter, HDFS continued to have a strong U.S. market -- retail market share of new Harley-Davidson Motorcycles at 56.8%, up 3.5 percentage points. At the end of the quarter, we had $344.7 million of cash and cash equivalents at HDFS. In addition, HDFS had $1.1 billion of available liquidity through bank credit and conduit facilities. This quarter, HDFS issued $1.2 billion in medium-term notes and paid $140 million dividend to Harley-Davidson, Inc. 
On Slide 14, you'll see 30-day delinquency rate for retail motorcycle loans at the end of the first quarter was 2.88% or 24 basis points higher than Q1 2015. The delinquency rate was up particularly in oil-dependent areas. Despite the increase, delinquency remained at low levels. Annual retail credit losses increased by 42 basis points to 1.98% compared to 2015. The increase was a result of higher losses on loans in oil-dependent areas, normalizing subprime performance and lower used bike values at auction. During the quarter, HDFS continue to maintain a strong liquidity position and contributed strong profitability to the company. 
The remaining Harley-Davidson, Inc. financial results are summarized on Slide 15. The company generated operating cash of $41.1 million during the quarter down from last year, driven by increased wholesale lending and higher working capital. Also, the tax rate was 34.5%, which is in line with last year's rate. The company has and intends to continue to maintain a minimum of 12 months of projected liquidity needs in cash and/or committed credit facilities. 
Switching our focus to shareholder value on Slide 16, returning value to our shareholders is a top priority. During the first quarter, we raised our quarterly dividend from $0.31 to $0.35 per share, up 12.9%. In addition, we repurchased 3.4 million shares of our stock for $144.6 million. Looking forward, we expect to continue to return excess cash to our shareholders in the form of increasing dividends and continued share repurchases. 
On Slide 17, you'll see our overall expectations for 2016. In 2016, we continue to expect to ship 269,000 to 274,000 motorcycles, an increase of approximately 1% to 3%. We expect second quarter shipments to be approximately down 3% to up 3% versus last year's second quarter. U.S. dealer retail inventory is expected to be up at year-end 2016 to support incremental models and increased marketing investment. For the full year 2016, we expect operating margin for the motorcycle segment to be between 16% and 17%. We believe 2016's gross margin, as a percent of revenue, will be down year-over-year driven by unfavorable foreign currency exchange, unfavorable mix, higher year-over-year start-up costs associated with the implementation of our ERP system at our Kansas City plant. To dimensionalize the foreign currency exchange risk, if currencies held the recent exchange rates for the remainder of 2016, we estimate that our expected full year motorcycle segment revenue would be slightly unfavorable on a year-over-year basis. We would expect an unfavorable impact to gross margin of approximately $50 million, driven by lapping last year's hedge benefits, an unfavorable impact to gross margin of nearly 1 percentage point on a full year basis. 
During the second quarter, we expect gross margin, expressed as a percent of revenue, to be down on a year-over-year basis driven by, first, unfavorable currency exchange. Currency is expected to adversely impact gross margin by $25 million to $30 million in the quarter primarily due to lapping a year ago hedge gains of $20 million, lowering gross margin by approximately 1.5 percentage points. Next, we expect shipment mix will continue to be unfavorable in Q2 behind a stronger shipment mix of Cruisers and Sportsters, supporting the strong demand we have seen in these segments and our recently announced new product introductions. Finally, we expect manufacturing cost to continue to be unfavorable behind higher year-over-year start-up costs. 
Looking at SG&A, while we will invest a significant amount more in marketing and product development, we expect full year spending to be flat to up modestly from 2015. As a percent of revenue, we expect SG&A will decrease. For HDFS, we expect operating income will be down modestly in 2016 compared to 2015 as a result of increased borrowing cost and higher credit losses, partially offset by increased revenues. Capital expenditures in 2016 are expected to be between $255 million and $275 million as we increase investment in product development focused on bringing exciting products to market and as we continue to invest in our systems infrastructure, most notably the implementation of an ERP system. 
Finally, we continue to expect our full year 2016 effective tax rate will be approximately 34.5%. We are pleased to deliver a return to retail sales growth and stabilizing market shares in the first quarter. We will continue to navigate through the challenging environment and are making investments to drive demand and deliver strong margins and strong returns over the long term. Thank you for your investment in Harley-Davidson. 
Now I'll turn it over to Matt."

As we shared in January, our plan for 2016 and beyond increases our focus, investment and resolve to drive increased demand for exceptional brand and products. I'll share with you some highlights on how we're prog",1526,"Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. As we shared in January, our plan for 2016 and beyond increases our focus, investment and resolve to drive increased demand for exceptional brand and products. I'll share with you some highlights on how we're progressing with the plan, but first I'd like to provide my perspective on our first quarter results. 
As John mentioned, we saw overall growth in worldwide retail sales reach 1.4%. It demonstrates the initial success we're having with our strategy to drive demand and deliver results in a highly competitive environment. As I've said before, competition is a great thing for the entire industry and the customer. It drives us to be better than we've ever been in every respect to grow our leadership position and run a strong and profitable business while we do so. We don't expect the current environment to change. In fact, we view it as the new normal, so we'll continue to take steps necessary to further strengthen the company and compete effectively in our quest to lead in every market. 
As I reflect on the quarter, international continues to be a real bright spot with great results in EMEA, Asia Pacific and Canada. Our international retail sales have continued to grow, and we anticipate growing international retail sales at a faster rate than in the U.S. over time. And while retail sales were down 0.5% in the U.S., they were an improvement over recent trends. And we're working with diligence, skill and commitment to maintain and enhance our leadership position here in the United States. Importantly, while we recognize we've made progress in the first quarter, we also recognized we still have more to do and more to deliver. 
So let's get to the key elements of our demand-driving strategy. Harley-Davidson enjoys customer loyalty and brand appeal that would be the envy of any business. And the core goal of our plan to drive demand is to build an even stronger, deeper bond with our existing loyal customers while creating powerful connections with new customers. To do this, we set our 4 -- our focus on 4 key areas: first, increase product and brand awareness; second, grow new ridership in the United States; third, increase and enhance brand access; and finally, accelerate the cadence and impact of new products. We kicked off a number of initiatives in these 4 areas at various points in the first quarter, some of which influenced first quarter performance and others we anticipate will bear fruit in the months and years ahead. 
To increase product and brand awareness, we've stepped up our advertising and PR presence in every region, taking full advantage of digital and traditional media to tell our story and the stories of our customers. We've also increased our presence at major events and increased the number of demo opportunities for riders to experience firsthand our motorcycles, accessories and apparel that offer unlimited potential for them to make a unique and bold statement about who they are. Nothing reinforces the fundamental of appeal of our products and the many enhancements we've made to our motorcycles in recent years better than a demo ride. So we've been dialing up our demo opportunities around the world. 
In EMEA, for example, the Discover More touring campaign more than doubled demand for demo rides during the first quarter compared to the same period in 2015. In Asia Pacific, our increased media investment is driving greater awareness for the brand and our demo events with encouraging results. In Japan, for example, demo rides are up 57% over last year. And Australia and New Zealand are seeing substantial increase in demo rides year-over-year as well. In the United States, we've stepped up our presence in key events, such as South by Southwest, the X Games, and of course, Daytona Bike Week, where we engaged riders and connected them with our great dealers. During Bike Week, we saw a 30% increase in the number of demo rides and a 27% increase in total retail sales of new motorcycles through local dealers as compared to 2015. 
In mid-March, we launched the Live Your Legend integrated marketing campaign. This global campaign highlights real life stories from current Harley-Davidson riders, dealers and employees to encourage new riders to get out and live their legend. What is most powerful about the campaign is the message. It's a rallying cry to inspire the next generation of riders to act now and invest in the experiences that define their legacy. The emotional appeal of our brand crosses borders, cultures and generations. It's more than just a motorcycle, it's a way of life and a personal expression for millions of riders around the world. And it's inspiring others to pick up the sport and learn to ride on a Harley-Davidson motorcycle. 
Growing the sport of motorcycling in the United States is also about increasing our investment in the Harley-Davidson Riding Academy. In the first quarter, we increased the number of dealers offering the program by 8% and the number of classes offered by 35%. Through March, our dealers trained over 8,000 students, a 37% increase from last year. A big driver of that increase is our incredibly successful Learn to Ride for Free program, which we're offering to current and former members of the U.S. military and first responders throughout 2016. Increasing access to our brand through our dealers also remains an important demand catalyst. And we're continuing our progress in expanding and enhancing the dealer network, which we believe is the absolute best in the world and a key competitive advantage. During the first quarter we opened new dealer points in Belgium, Brazil, Hong Kong, India and the Philippines. By 2020, we plan to add 150 to 200 new dealerships internationally. 
Now let's talk a little bit about some awesome products. Our first quarter results reflect the strength and impact of our new 2016 motorcycles, including the refreshed Iron 883 and 48, as well as the S Series Cruisers and the Road Glide Ultra. We announced the Low Rider S and the CVO Pro Street Breakout Cruisers this quarter and started shipping them to dealerships in March. Just yesterday, we unveiled the new Harley-Davidson Roadster to the world at a media event in Marseille, France, and the reaction has been fantastic. This new model joins the Dark Custom lineup and is featured in the Live Your Legend campaign. We've included a link to the latest spot in today's earnings release, and I encourage you to check it out. 
What I've outlined here is just a sampling of the all-in comprehensive nature of our work to drive demand, work that leverages all the great and strong directions of our brand, further strengthening and reinforcing our incredible foundations of industry-leading products, experiences, customer passion and loyalty that are wrapped up in Harley-Davidson brand. These are investments to deliver the near-term results that will drive long-term performance and value for all our stakeholders. We're confident that our investments will generate interest, drive traffic and drive sales. We're also confident that they will enhance our already unrivaled industry and brand leadership and business performance too. 
Before we move on to questions, I'd like to share some important customer information with you. As you know, one of our strategic objectives is to grow the sport of motorcycling in the United States, in part by growing the number of core customers and growing outreach at a faster rate. As highlighted in today's press release, for the eighth straight year, we remain the #1 seller of new on-road motorcycles in the U.S. to young adults aged 18 to 34, to women, African-Americans and Hispanics [indiscernible] Caucasian men, ages 35 and up. This is the case in the 601+CC segment and across all on-road motorcycles of all displacements. We continue to sell more Harley-Davidson Motorcycles to today's young adults than we did to the baby boomers when they were young adults. And we're bringing new riders of all ages into the sport. 
Over the last 5 years, an increasing number of on-road first-time riders in the United States have purchased new Harley-Davidson Motorcycles. In 2015, 1/3 of new Harley-Davidson purchasers in the U.S. had not owned a motorcycle previously. We know we've got more to do and more to deliver. We're confident in the strength of our strategy, the passion of our people and the power of our brand. 
The Harley-Davidson brand is among the most iconic on the planet, a position of strength we've built during our continuous 113-year history. No one else has a network of dealers like we do, made up of individuals who get up every day with the sole purpose of delivering exceptional Harley-Davidson experiences. And no one else has employees like ours, who take such great pride in creating and building legendary Harley-Davidson Motorcycles and delivering our unique experiences to every corner of the planet. Our inspiration and our drive comes from our customers, millions of riders who yearn to experience personal freedom on their individual terms. This is what we do, and we do it like no one else. 
So with that, let's take your questions."

Heroes Ride Free, we've talked about our training military folks and police and fire for free. We're seeing great results on that. As Matt mentioned, that's up 37%. So one of the measures is, are we increasing the number of people we're training? And overall, sales are up quite significantly when you look at our graduates that are buying motorcycles. So that is clearly a volume measure there. We've also got -- discovered more demos and demos taking place all over the world. The metrics on that is, are we getting more people on motorcycles? And we certainly follow through with those sales and -- or those demos to make sure that they're turning into sales and doing the follow-ups. The other big thing that we're investing in is Battle of the Kings, which accentuates and highlights our customization and personalization, which is unique to Harley-Davidson. So all of these things are what we're doing to drive demand versus the alternative and the easy way out which is the discount. So we're taking the high road on this. We're doing what builds the brand and creates customer loyalty. And we've got measures across all of it. But you're absolutely right, Craig, at the end of the day, it's measured in, are we selling more sales? Or are we selling more motorcycles to our customers?"

Talking about used prices, whenever we talk about used prices, we got to be clear on what market we're talking about. There's really 3 different markets the way we look at it. There is the market that is bikes are sold on driveways on eBay and those types of things. About 2/3 of the used bikes are sold in that market. We do not have a lot of data with regards to what's happening to used bike prices, supply/demand driven very local. The other part of the market is used bikes are sold in our dealership. About 1/3 of the used bikes go through our dealer network, and that we do have more data on. And then finally is the repo market. It's a very small market, only about 7% of overall sales. Used bike sales go through it, but an important market in that a lot of the services take that data and try to project it forward under retail prices. And it obviously has an impact because we sell repossessed motorcycles on our credit losses. So when we look at the dealer network, we talked about a better part of the 2015 prices held up very well. We saw a little bit of softening in the fourth quarter which we talked about last quarter. That softness has continued into the first quarter, and it's not out of line with what we're seeing in the industry, but it is a little bit softer. And to answer your question on what's driving it or the lead of it is Cruisers. Cruisers are falling more, and that's what we would expect because that's what we're investing in. We certainly saw it, when Rushmore came out, it was the Touring bikes that fell more. So we're adding a lot of content with power in the new models, and that's where we're seeing more softness. But that's also where we're adding a lot of the content. Tim, the other question that you asked is on HDFS. I think the question was around subprime. And subprime has been about 20% of our portfolio. Over time, subprime has represented between 15% and 25%. Subprime is a fantastic business for us [ph]. We have tremendous returns on it and sell a lot of incremental motorcycles. And we are seeing subprime normalize a little bit. But the fact of the matter is for the last 7 years, subprime has not behaved like subprime. It has performed extremely well, and we have priced our models for more of a normalized subprime performance. And we are starting to see more of a normalization, which we've talked about in the last several quarters. Overall, subprime is at about 20%. We do not have a target on subprime. Our objective is to do well-structured loans. And we're always looking for opportunities to improve, but we do not have a target per se."

Number two is we see a continued normalization of subprime. And again, subprime is starting to behave a little bit more like subprime. Nothing of great concern because we price for that. And then the third area is lower used prices that we're seeing at the auction. And we saw, again, softness in the first quarter at auction. However, they firmed up quite a bit in the month of March. So we'll keep a close eye on that. But it's all 3. But again, Tim, I want to reiterate that we've talked about this for several years, is that we've expected credit losses to normalize, coming out of what has been a very great credit loss performance. And we're just starting to approach average levels of credit losses. So we feel very good about where we're at. We feel very good about the entire portfolio. That remains incredibly profitable. And it's doing what we expected and what we guided on at the beginning of the year. And we expect HDFS income to be down modestly because of rising credit losses and higher interest expense."

That will go live right after the end of the second quarter. So that will be implemented in the month of July, very similar, if you remember when we did this in our York facility a few years ago. With that, we will lose a fair amount of production in the month of July. Production will be down about 20 -- I'm sorry, about 30% in the month of July. So what you will see throughout the second quarter is a higher level of inventory because we're going to lose that production in July that we cannot make up in the rest of the third quarter. Leading up to that, we're going to experience start-up costs in readying the organization, the plants to receive the system. It is a big implementation. It's bigger than what we did at our York facility, primarily that's on Kansas City, but there's other aspects to the launch. And that's what you're seeing in the manufacturing expense in the first quarter, and you're going to see it for the next several quarters. So a lot of it gets capitalized, but there's a fair amount of expense that goes on. And on a year-over-year basis, it's showing unfavorability. And that is to ready the organization, the training, the tabletop exercise, a lot of the testing that goes on. And so we're going to see that for the next several quarters.

So overall, we don't expect a big shift when we look at what's variable and fixed in SG&A because of this shift. It's going to be part of our ongoing spending. We've taken another $70 million out of our ongoing spending, and therefore, there's not a big shift in the 80/20 when we talk about fixed variable on SG&A. And again, in the preamble, we talked a little bit about our shift in timing. We expected there to be more SG&A, to be more unfavorable in the first quarter. It was $13 million higher, and we would expect certainly the second quarter to be higher and shift some of the spending in the first quarter into the second quarter. In aggregate, on a full year basis, we would expect SG&A to be about flat to up modestly, but we are going to see more of that spending taking place in the first 3 quarters because that's when the motorcycles take place and a lot of our marketing investment will happen."

And we would expect it to be in the 2.2% to 2.5% range for the long term. The second question is with regards to, I think, our mix of sales in the United States is what you were asking. So right now, 33% of our sales is to folks that are new to Harley-Davidson and new to motorcycling. So we call it new-new. They're new to the sport and new to Harley-Davidson, which is one of the key focuses as we look to grow ridership in the United States. So we're very pleased with it. We believe it's a very strong percentage. When you look at that worldwide, that percentage is up in the 60s. So overall, we're bringing a tremendous amount of new people in. We've talked in different times and Matt mentioned it today, outreach. About 40% of the folks that buy a motorcycle in any given quarter or month are outreach customers and important to keep the business moving forward. So there is the percentage, I do not know it off the top of my head, which is folks that come with a trade in. That has not changed dramatically on a year-over-year basis. That's part of the business. And one of the reasons we're investing in motorcycles is to encourage people to trade up. The third question that you asked was with regards to Japan, I think referring to the recent earthquakes in Japan. First of all, all of our employees and our dealers and their families are well. Sustained a little bit of damage to some of the dealerships, but it is an incredibly resilient country, and they'll work through it. We do not see any disruption in the supply chain coming from Japan at this time."

I understood when it was Street, which was a whole new sort of line of bikes. But maybe walk us through just why the magnitude of that inventory build at retail? I don't think you're saying that any of it has to do with the third quarter production thing and sort of shipping out in front of that, but maybe walk us through that. And then on the factory inventory side, up 30% in the fourth quarter, up 15% in the first quarter. Presumably that was a sizeable benefit to the 4Q gross margin as you get the higher fixed-cost absorption. How should we think about that impact in the first quarter?

The first question is with regards to retail inventory, and it's up 4,900 units. And when you look at the -- you're right, James, that years we have models in and out.

And when you look at the -- you're right, James, that years we have models in and out. But when we look at from a year ago, there are 5 incremental models that we shipped. So with that, there are 730-ish dealers that need to have models on the floor. And if you do the math, that's, I think, less than a couple of models for each of those. So that is the driver of why inventory is up, and those dealers need the models to sell. In addition to that though, the primary driver is that we are carrying higher inventory because we are increasing marketing spending by 65%, most of that coming in the early part of the year. And we want to make sure that the availability is there. And as we talked about, we pulled forward a lot of the production. And we made some more in the fourth quarter of last year so that we could get out to a quick start. Part of the strategy has been to spend a lot more marketing money in the south and get units there quicker because they are not in -- their springtime happens a lot earlier than in the north. And so we did that, and it's been effective. With that though, we had, as you pointed out, a higher level of inventory on the balance sheet at the end of the year. And it was up $137 million or 33%. That's come down significantly at the end of the first quarter. I think we're up 15%. That is driven by finished goods inventory. And we do have higher level of inventory in finished goods at the second quarter. That is based on one being able to supply the market as we invest more and the fact that we have an ERP system that is coming in the second -- at the end of the second quarter. So overall, inventories that we have, whether they be on the balance sheet or in the market will be elevated in second quarter because we've got to get that trajectory to have enough inventory to bridge the ERP implementation and deliver the model year '17 motorcycles in the third week of August. So you will see it higher. That inventory will come out as the year progresses. We did shift more production into the fourth quarter last year. And we had talked about some of the inefficiencies and the time that our workers were off. And we put that in. That should be viewed as part of a onetime adjustment, and that production will be at similar levels in the fourth quarter of this year. So you're not going to see a big impact. The impact was in lower production in the first quarter here, which is part of the unfavorable manufacturing expense as that we did not produce as much in the first quarter because we carried forward more from the fourth quarter."

We talked in depth about our Q2 results and what we see going forward. You've all read the news release we issued this morning, Jon and I will bring context and perspective to those results and highlight some of the factors that are and you can get the best read on our outlook for Q3, the full year and beyond. Before John goes into the details financials, I would like to comment on 2 things. Market performance and then company performance. From a market perspective, we're very pleased with the share performance in the US where we gained 2 points share in the heavyweight segment for the quarter on top of our already strong share position. As the U.S. remains highly competitive, this gain is an important validation that our initial investments to drive demand are working. Since the beginning of the year, we made investments designed to impact customer choice and support our long-term strategy of growing our reach and impact with customers and strong returns to investors. Our demand driving investments are focused in 4 areas: increasing product and brand awareness, growing new ridership in The United States, increasing and enhancing brand access and accelerating the cadence and impact of new products.
Our teams across the globe launched several initiatives behind these investments with precision and effectiveness delivering solid results in our international markets and driving the market share gains in The United States. Looking internationally, our retail sales were up 4.3%, driven by continued growth in Asia, Canada and Mexico and our best ever quarter for Harley-Davidson in our EMEA region. Our investments to increase demo rides in EMEA, for example, was a major contributor to our growth in the region in Q2, nothing seems to be a better for a new customers that experiencing one of our great bikes firsthand.
In Asia, we maintained our #1 share in Australia, India and Japan. We focused on [indiscernible] growing ridership. And in the U.S., the Live Your Legend campaign and other demand investments build significant allowance and helped drive a 30% increase in demo rides so far this year and a 40% increase in the number of students trained through the Harley Davidson Riding Academy. There are also some real positives in the nature of retail sales and market share gains that further reinforce the strength of our work both near and long-term. Notably, we're very pleased to have growth year-to-date in the all-important young adult segment in United States. The young adult segment is not only important for the long-term, it is the most competitive market segment in the U.S. All of these initiatives combined represent an important long-term play as we seek to grow the sport in U.S. and bring new customers into the brand in all of our markets. I'm encouraged that the actions that we've taken so far this year have been enabled us to make progress and our long-term growth strategy, However, worldwide sales for the quarter were down due to significant declines in the US industry. We expected the industry to be down in the first of the year as we lapped industry growth in 2015 that was stimulated by the shift in currency and the resulting competitive discounting, and as we also expected by continued weakness in the oil-dependent areas. We did not, however, expect the industry as a whole would be as soft as it is. While our share gains helped to blunt the full impact of this weak market, lackluster industry sales have had a significant impact on our results and our forward expectations. As a result, we're taking the prudent step to lower expected 2016 shipments. This is largely due to what we believe will be continued pressure on the industry growth in the U.S., coupled with caution as we consider the potential impact of the macro economic uncertainty on sales globally. We remain steadfast in our commitment to keep supply in line with the demand to protect the premium [indiscernible] and we believe the steps we're taking will ensure dealer inventory is in line by year-end to support the expected sales environment. All in, we now plan to ship fewer motorcycles for the full year, and are revising our shipment guidance from 1% to 3% growth to approximately down 1% to up 1% from 2015. Our production plans and shipment expectations are intended to drive flat inventory at year-end, even with an expanded model range. These actions will have a drag on our earnings for the full year. So we're revising our full year expected operating margin down 1 percentage point to 15% to 16%. Without question, we must assure inventory balance for our long-term competitiveness and profitability for both the company and our incredible dealers.
Now, shifting from market to company performance. You'll see that gross margin declined in the quarter. There are number of factors here that both John and I will address. As we've discussed on prior calls, we expected higher manufacturing costs due to the significant investments we're making to advance our flexible manufacturing strategy. These investments are complex and require discipline, planning and execution, including numerous down days, inventory bridges and careful ramp plans. The net impact can be seen in changes to gross margin, shipments and inventory patterns in the second quarter and the impact will continue in Q3 as we ramp back to full production. The investments are part of the manufacturing flexible really strategy that will enhance cost-effectiveness flexibility now our Kansas City plant.
Another factor in gross margin performance in Q2 is the impact of volume and mix adjustments we made to capture the demand lift from the Cruiser success we experienced in the quarter while also adjusting downward the total volume in the softer-than-expected U.S. industry. The U.S. industry turned swiftly in the second quarter. We responded with discipline and commitment in an effort to keep supply in line with demand and these actions also impacted our gross margin in the quarter. While difficult, these actions were necessary to set us up for success for our model year launch and also for 2017 and beyond. And speaking of new products and our new model launch, I'm incredibly excited about our lineup which  we will unveil to our global dealer network at the end of August. We'll add to the stable of products driving our current success and we've got some incredible products in the pipeline for 2018, our 115th anniversary and beyond. Before I turn it over to John, I will take this opportunity to thank everyone associated with this great company, employees, dealers, suppliers and our passionate riders. I'm proud of our team and all the work that is being done at Harley-Davidson. We're in challenging times.  Political and cultural forces are all working against confidence and security for people everywhere in the world. Everyone in our company is aware and attuned to what we need to do. We have 113-year history of challenges we stood up to and faced down. The power of personal freedom for our riders is stronger than ever take and we all aim to deliver for them. We understand the intense need to manage through these challenges effectively and deliver results. We're stewards this incredible brand and of your investment and we do not take that responsibility lightly. Without question, driving demand, growing the business and delivering strong returns are top priorities for all of us at Harley-Davidson and we're focused every day on delivering for our riders near-term and long-term in order to do so.
With that, I'm going to turn it over to John. Thank you,"

During the quarter, revenue was $1.86 million.",2526,"Thanks, Mike, and good morning to everyone. Today I will provide additional insight around our second quarter financial results found in our press release and supporting [indiscernible]  Starting on Slide 9. During the quarter, revenue was $1.86 million. Net income was $280.4 million. Diluted earnings per share were $1.55. Operating income from the Motorcycles segment was down 15.2% from last year s second quarter. Segment revenue was up 1.2% in the quarter behind a 3.5% increase in Motorcycles shipments. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue decreased versus prior year as a result of unfavorable product mix and currency exchange in addition to higher year-over-year manufacturing cost. SG&A was also up in the quarter as we increased our demand driving and product development investments. Operating income as a percent of revenue in Q2 was 19.3%. At HDFS, operating income was up 9.4% year-over-year in part driven by a gain related to a full securitization. The quarter also reflected a higher corporate interests expense resulting to from our 2015 recapitalization and [indiscernible] for more effective tax rate. Despite the challenging conditions we continue to face, we remain focused on driving demand and delivering strong margins and strong returns over the long-term.
On Slide 10, you will see worldwide retail sales of new Harley-Davidson Motorcycles in Q2 were down 1.9% versus prior year. International retail sales were up year-over-year, while the U.S. retail sales were lower-than-expected on surprisingly weak industry results. Despite the ongoing challenging macroeconomic and motorcycle industry conditions, we were encouraged with our share gains in the second quarter. Our ability to grow internationally and partially offset the industry headwinds in The United States, reinforces our intensified focus on driving demand and enhancing our strong brand.
Our increased investments and driving demand and product development through positive market share results in the U.S. and in Europe during the first half of this year. In addition, the positive response to our new 2016 motorcycle models continued during the second quarter. As Matt noted, we continue to be committed and steadfast in our resolve to manage supply in line with demand. Given the port U.S. industry retail sales in Q2 and softness expected into the second half of 2016, we're taking steps to adjust retail inventory in the U.S. and now expect year-end retail inventory in the U.S. to be in line with prior year versus our previous expectation to grow year-end retail inventory. Considering our desire to reduce year-end U.S. retail inventory in the face of soft U.S. industry sales and the uncertainty resulting from global macroeconomic challenges, we have lowered our full year shipment expectations. Let's take a closer look at the U.S on Slide 11. Q2 retail sales in the U.S. were down 5.2% versus prior year behind weak U.S. industry sales. The impact of the weak U.S. industry on our sales was partially offset by strong gains in market share. The U.S. industry was down 8.6% during the quarter.  While we expected the industry to be down in the first half of 2016, we do not expect the extent to, which the second quarter declined, especially considering the high level of competitive discounting that continued during the quarter. We believe the industry was down due to the following 2 factors: lapping strong year-ago industry growth driven by the onset of aggressive competitive discounting in the year-ago period and weak sales in oil-dependent areas.
While the industry lagged our expectations, we're encouraged both our Q2 market share of 49.5% in the U.S., which was up a strong to 2.0 percentage point. We believe our second quarter market share gains were driven by our demand driving investments focused on growing product awareness and growing ridership in the U.S. and a strong reception to our new 2016 motorcycle models. While our competitors continue to engage in levels of discounting similar to the first quarter, and at more aggressive levels than in last year's second quarter, we were very pleased that we were able to increase market share in the U.S. and enhancing actions. U.S. retail inventory was up at the end of the second quarter driven by 3 factors: First, we offered 5 incremental models versus the prior year; second, inventory was up as we shipped all model year 2016 Motorcycles in advance of the Q3 ERP implementation; and, also as a result of lower-than-expected Q2 retail sales.
On Slide 12, you'll see retail sales in our international markets were up in Q2. All regions were up except Latin America, which was impacted by weakness in Brazil. Excluding Brazil, international markets were up 5.6%. During the quarter, EMEA retail sales were up 8.2% behind a great reception to our new 2016 motorcycle models and increased demand driving investments. This quarter strong retail sales also benefited from lapping prior year retail sales --lower prior year retail sales. Market share in EMEA was up 0.3% [indiscernible] basis.  Asia Pacific retail sales growth slowed as we very strong retail sales comps of up nearly 17%.  And as we temporarily exited the market in Indonesia earlier this year in order to establish a dealer network and a new dealer network and improve customer experience. Latin America retail sales trends improved significantly from last quarter behind continued strong growth in Mexico. Weakness in Brazil drove overall sales declines in the region as the sales continue to be impacted by challenging economic and consumer uncertainty. In response to the nearly 50% devaluation of the Brazilian real last year, we raised model year 2016 prices over 20% to improve profitability per motorcycle. We continue to expect retail sales to be down for the year. Finally, retail sales in Canada were up 2.0% in the second quarter. We believe the market continued to respond well to the change to a direct distribution model and pricing adjustments that were made at the model year.
[indiscernible] of our strategic focus on increasing brand access, we plan to continue to expand our international distribution. We added 6 new international dealerships in the second quarter. On Slide 13, you'll see wholesale shipments of Harley-Davidson Motorcycles in the quarter were slightly above our guidance as we shipped ahead of the Q3 ERP implementation. As a result, U.S. shipments and retail inventory increased during the quarter and company inventory fell below prior year levels. Our production plants were idled earlier this month and overall production was down above 30% in July as we successfully implemented our ERP system in Kansas City. We began model year '17 production on schedule.
Second quarter shipment mix reflected strong demand for our new 2016 Cruiser and Sportster Motorcycles. On Slide 14, you'll see revenue for the Motorcycles and product segment was up in the second quarter behind a 3.5% increase in Motorcycles shipment. Revenue in the quarter was unfavorably impacted [indiscernible] significant shift in mix to our Cruiser and Sportster Motorcycles and slightly unfavorable currency exchange, partially offset by higher pricing. As a result, average motorcycle revenue per unit was down for the quarter.
On Slide 15 you'll see gross margin as a percentage of revenue in the quarter was down to 2.8 percentage points versus last year.  While we expected Q2 gross margin to be unfavorable driven by mix currency and manufacturing, the impacts from mix and manufacturing were more unfavorable than we anticipated. During the quarter, customer demand for our Cruisers and Sportsters exceeded expectations, which led to higher-than-expected mix unfavorability of $17.6 million. As we expected, foreign currency exchange was negative as we lapped significant hedge gains in last year's second quarter, and as we have lower revenues behind a strategy stronger U.S. dollar.
Manufacturing expenses were higher-than-expected, unfavorable $36.1 million during the second quarter. We did expect significant unfavorable variances largely driven by startup cost related to the implementation of our ERP system in Kansas City, and cost associated with significant plant retooling. However, as Matt explained, plant efficiencies over lower-than-expected due to lower production given soft sales in Q2, and other plant disruptions. It is important to note, the increase in manufacturing costs that we've experienced in this first half of this year are largely temporary in nature and we would not expect the majority of these costs to recur in 2017.  Looking forward, we continue to expect Q3 manufacturing expense to be unfavorable behind lower absorption and higher year-over-year startup cost. Conversely, we expect manufacturing favorability in Q4.
On Slide 16, operating margin as a percent of revenue for the second quarter was 19.3%, down compared to last year's second quarter. Operating margin was unfavorably impacted by lower gross margin as well as [indiscernible] SG&A resulting from both our increased investments in driving demand and product development and from costs associated with managing our Canadian operations, which we acquired in August of 2015. For the full year, we expect SG&A to be year-ago levels.
We remain intensely focused on our cost structure that will enable growth and continuous improvement to drive our business to be stronger, more flexible and more profitable.
Moving on to HDFS on Slide 16, during the quarter HDFS's operating profit increased $7.7 million or 9.4% compared to last year. The primary factors impacting second quarter results were: First, net interest income was up over the year by $5.0 million. This increase was driven by higher receivables, partially offset by higher borrowing cost and lower yields, due in part to the 2015 lower interest rate promotional activity. Second, the provision for retail motorcycle loan losses increased over prior year by $8.2 million driven by higher retail credit losses and an associated increase in the allowance. It is important to note that second quarter provision increase was significantly less than what we experienced in the first quarter of 2016. Finally, you will see, on the slide a gain on full securitization. This represents a full securitization in which we sold retail finance receivables with a balance of approximately $302 million, along with all the residual financial interest in those receivables. Because we have no order ship interest in the receivables, the transaction was recorded as a sale, which in this case resulted in a gain of $9.3 million.
HDFS's operational results are summarized on Slide 18. For the quarter, originations were down 3.9% compared to last year, but HDFS's share of U.S  new retail motorcycle loans -- motorcycle sales increased to 63.4%. Year-to-date loan originations were comprised of approximately 80% prime loans and subprime.  As a predominant industry leader to subprime customers, these originations continue to represent a significant number of retail sales to the company at very attractive returns. At the end of the second quarter, we had $419 million of cash and cash equivalents at HDFS. In addition, HDFS had $1.02 billion of available liquidity through bank credit and conduit facilities. HDFS also paid a $43 million dividend to HD Inc. during the quarter, which would I will talk more about in the moment. On Slide 19, you'll see the 30-day delinquency rate for retail motorcycle loan receivables that remained on our balance sheet was 3.16%, or 45 basis points higher than Q2 2015. 14 basis points of the increase represents a change in the mix of the portfolio after the securitization of $302 million [indiscernible] prime receivables. The delinquency rate on a managed basis, including those rules sold in full securitization was still 31 basis points higher than the prior year due in part to deterioration in oil-dependent areas. Despite the increase, delinquencies remain near historically low levels.
Annualized retail credit losses for receivables that remain on our balance sheet was 1.50% or 42 basis points higher than Q2 2015. On a managed basis, the credit loss rate was 1.49%. The increase was a result of higher losses on loans in oil-dependent areas, normalizing loan performance and lower used bike values at auction. During the quarter, HDFS continues to maintain a strong liquidity position and continued strong profitability to the company. The remaining Harley-Davidson Inc. financial results are summarized on Slide 20. A few things to note. Operating cash was down from last year driven by [indiscernible] income, higher working capital, and higher net wholesale lending. And year-to-date tax rate was 32.7%, which was lower than last year's tax rate behind the successful closure of various tax audits allowing us to reduce our tax reserves. The company has and intends to continue to maintain a minimum of 12 months of projected liquidity needs in cash and/or committed credit facilities. Returning value to our shareholders is a top priority. We expect to return all excess cash to our shareholders in the form of increasing dividends and continued share repurchases. On Slide 21, you will see we did both, during the second quarter. In addition, as I mentioned earlier, during the quarter we completed a full securitization, because we sold all ownership interest in the receivables. The receivables and any corresponding that are not recorded on HDFS's balance sheet. Consequently, this allowed HDFS to pay a dividend of HD Inc. of [indiscernible] without impacting HDFS's debt-to-equity ratio. We used the dividend to repurchase shares under the existing share repurchase authorizations.  While we believe the EPS impact was neutral, the shareholder repurchase associated with the full securitization increased our shareholders' ownership in the company at a time when our stock is trading at historically low PE. This was a first-time HDFS or we believe any other manufacturer has utilized this market. Actions such as this demonstrate our commitment to explore avenues to improve funding costs, diversify funding sources and return excess cash to our shareholders. We'll continue to look for additional opportunities to return excess cash to our shareholders without damaging our long-term value of the company or the brand. On Slide 22, you'll see our overall expectations for 2016. We now expect to ship 264,000 to 269,000 Motorcycles, which is approximately down 1% to up 1% over last year. We expect third quarter shipments to be approximately flat to down 9% versus last year's third quarter. For the full year, 2016, we now expect operating margin for the Motorcycles segment to be approximately 15% to 16%. We're lowering our expectations by approximately 1 percentage point due to lost absorption on lower production, unfavorable mix and higher manufacturing expense. Finally, we now expect a full year 2016 effective tax rate will be approximately 33%. Our 2016 directional expectations for gross margin, SG&A, HDFS and capital expenditures are unchanged and noted on the slide.
While the weak U.S. industry and continued intense competition grow less than expected sales during the quarter, we're encouraged by the positive market share results from our demand driving investments and new models. We're also pleased to see international retail sales grow despite macroeconomic headwinds. We continue to [indiscernible] decisions to support a prudent retail inventory position and to protect our strong brand and profitability into the future. We're maintaining our intense focus on maximizing shareholder value by returning cash to our shareholders through share repurchases and increased dividends. We'll continue to navigate through the challenging environment and are making investments to drive demand and deliver stronger -- and deliver strong margins and strong returns over the long term.

Also the significant growth last year, as I mentioned, in the corresponding comp for this year, we knew that, that was going to create pressure. The forecast for the industry growth was kind of in that  2% range and clearly it's not materializing that way.  And so we're looking at it very carefully, investing in new products and awareness and rider training and focusing our efforts what we can do to not only grow share, but grow our sales [indiscernible] and primarily doing that through growing the sport.

Do you think that you are positioned appropriately for the declining industry that seemed to surprise you in the quarter.

Retail inventory was up 20 -- I'm sorry 8300 [indiscernible] largely driven by 5 incremental models. On average our dealers have about 2 1/2 of each of those models in their dealerships and that adds up actually to over 8,000 units, but we also wanted to ship in ahead of the ERP implementation. And so when we look at second quarter and you also -- you look at the retail side, which is up 8,300 units, our company-owned inventory is down quite a bit and when you net those 2, we're basically up in the second quarter, 1/3 of July's production and that's what we expect to lose. So to answer your question, as we exit the first half, we're right in line with what we expected in terms of inventory on a year-over-year basis, again to compensate for the lost production in July. When we extend that forward, we were expecting inventories and the U.S. to grow behind additional models and given that environment that you have mentioned, and certainly that we experienced in the second quarter, we're more cautious and want to be more prudent from an inventory perspective. And with that we do not expect inventories to grow [indiscernible] United States at year-end. And yes, we absolutely feel that is the appropriate level of inventory given the soft retail that we are seeing in the first half of this year."

When we look at the securitization that we recently did about a month ago, there were 2 changes in that securitization from normal securitizations that we execute. [indiscernible] pointed out is that they were made up of 100% of prime receivables. And the second one is we sold the residual interest that allowed us to classify it off the balance sheet. Your question centers around the prime aspect of it.  So historically, we have sold securitization that resemble our originations, about 80% prime and 20% subprime. And for all kinds of speculation as to why we did 100% prime, so let me clear that up. Some of that speculation has been as we can't sel subprime into the market and that is absolute untruth nonsense. So for over a decade we've been selling a mix of prime and subprime into very robust demand in the marketplace and that has not changed at all. What has changed over the last couple of securitization is that our spreads have widened on the securitization to our benchmark. Our benchmark is prime model and there is no one else that does a mixture of securitizations like we do. So we benchmark the prime model. What we have noticed over the last couple securitizations [indiscernible] it widening out a little bit. And so the best way to tether them back was to get a comparable securitization to our benchmark. And with that, we saw extreme tightening of those margins or of those spreads to prime model. So we as we look forward whether we decide to do all-prime or subprime, in-prime, kind of the tethering of the investment community to that spread against prime has been very important us and will pay dividends as we move into the future. So that's why we move forward with the prime securitization. Your second question is with regards to Brexit.  At this point, there is not enough information and not enough time has gone back to understand the impact of Brexit. And I think what we're's very certain of is that Brexit does not provide any benefit retail sales or consumer confidence in Europe. And I think this is what Matt talked about a little [indiscernible] I will put it into a broader bucket instead of just Brexit as overall consumer confidence driven by geopolitical concerns or macroeconomic concerns.  But very excited about the momentum that we have in our European business.  As you can see for the quarter, it was up quite significantly.

When you look at the second quarter, I mean, we did ship a little bit over the high end of guidance and at the same time, during the quarter, we've been cutting production quite dramatically and our retail sales were down. So you're saying is ""Can you help me out,  help me understand this.""  So basically, as we got to the end of the quarter, we had all the product made and that was either in retail or in our company-owned inventory and typically we have a bit of company-owned inventory in United States that facilitates the flow and the orderly shipments of Motorcycles. We made the decision to ship It all out prior to the period, The reason we did that is in the very outside chance that we had any issues with the ERP system. If they are in our system, we may have trouble getting them shipped. So it was just a simple de-risking of the overall ERP implementation. I couldn't be more pleased to say that the team did a fantastic job.  Everything came up as expected.  The ramp plans are on plan and everything is moving forward. But, James, it was simply that.  That is, we can take a little bit more risk out of it. Now having said that, overall inventory as I mentioned, I think to Felicia, overall inventories didn't change, but we had company owned inventories on lower on the year-over-year basis and we put a little bit more into the field. So, overall inventories are where we would have expected them despite the lower unexpected sales based on our production reductions and lower company-owned inventory. The second question that you asked is with regards to our revised guidance, which is down 1 to up 1.  We go through a robust process looking at all factors, and I think that we know in the marketplace, which is centered around new dealerships coming up in the international markets, we will have more dealers in the back half, new dealers in the back half than the front half. We look at the performance of Outreach in The United States. That's performing extremely well. We look at the investments that we've made. I mean the demand driving activities what we expect to come out of those. And certainly and most importantly we look at the new models that we're going to be launching here and 3 to 4 weeks and we couldn't be more excited about that. You take all those together, James, we're very confident that we're going to ship from 264,000 to 269,000 Motorcycles for 2016."

We feel that we're at the right spot, given our forward look at retail sales, given where we expect inventories to be. And  if we haven't shown our resolve to manage this company for the long-term value of our shareholders in the actions that we've taken to keep in the marketplace or aggressively manage supply in line with demand, we're not going to discount our way out of this soft spot that we're expecting. The people are looking. We have got tremendous results and we'll manage the inventory at appropriate levels. And now with regards to pricing, I'm not going to speak a lot of that because in 3 weeks you will see the new models and you will see the pricing and you can answer that question for yourself, Jamie. But again, we feel very comfortable where we're at with regards to the market and we will continue to manage it very tightly. I'm glad you asked about share gains in United States. I couldn't be more thrilled to answer this question. A year ago, we sat here, Matt and I, Matt's first conference call and we said that we had an issue given the shift in world currencies and the incredible competitiveness that came out of that, in particular in discounting. And we said that we were not going to discount our way out of it. We weren't going to drain the industry of profits and chase this thing. And it was going to take us some time, but we were going to spend more time understanding what we need to do and how we can compete in the world of expanded price gaps without cheapening our brand And now, dial forward a couple of quarters, we're there and we delivered 2 points of market share gains. So, let me talk second about those.  The gains were very strong and wide. Number 1, that came in all of our segments, our Touring segments, our Cruisers and our Street Sportster segment size of our Motorcycles. They came in the 7 sales regions that we have in The United States. We gained share in each and every one of them. Our gains were over double than nearest competitor. When you look broadly at those share gains, what we saw is the biggest loser, were in aggregate Japanese competitors. We also saw, while we mentioned in the preamble, that the overall discounting was higher on a year-over-year basis. We did see the Japanese discounting be down a little bit versus a year ago, and it seems to be reflecting in their market share. With that we saw rotation in the brand discounting from the Japanese to the American brands in the second quarter and we're seeing some of the share gains in there. Overall, Europeans market share was down a little bit, but we had some big vendors and big losers in the segment. Hopefully that helps, Jamie."

Those large Cruisers and a little lower margin than our Motorcycles, so that's part of our gross margin deterioration that we just spoke about on the call today.

High-impact product at an increase cadence. And 2017 is going to be no different. It is a formula that is working for us and we have invested more heavily both capital and expense as part of the demand driving shift to make sure that the product that we deliver makes a difference in the marketplace and that we do it well and we do it more rapidly.

In the 8-K that we put out, we talked about this overall transaction is neutral when you look at the present value of earnings per share. So it's a great question. Basically, here is what happens is, in a securitization we sell off of a bunch of bonds to investors. And there is a -- it goes into our trust and all the residual earnings that we get off that, we keep, because -- we keep the risk and we keep that reward. What we [indiscernible] slightly different market and we found an investor to buy that. And what they did is they paid us a bunch of upfront cash to buy that residual interest in the trust or those trailing earnings. We believe that the opportunity cost of the transaction that we did is about $7 million of those trailing earnings. So to do broad math we took a $9 million, gave up about $7 million of opportunity cost. So they would have earned about $16 million. We took $9 million today right. So if you take any discount over the next 7 years that $7 million that would have come in, bring it to the present value and that impact on EPS along with the fact that because it's off balance sheet, we freed up equity at HDFS to maintain the same debt-to-equity, we've now got more equity.  So HDFS wrote a check that works out to be $43 million and we bought shares back with that. And if you take that impact on EPS, they were about neutral. So, the question is why did we do it if it's a neutral? #1 is once you get in the market you don't know how the market is going to exactly respond, but there's 2 reasons that we did this. #1 is this additional source of liquidity. So we're always looking for opportunities, more investors, more liquidity and this is a great opportunity. The other thing, with the additional liquidity opportunity, we also learned that we can monetize the assets on our balance sheet to some extent. And that is very important to know. So that's #1 reason. Number 2 and the more important reason is, is one of our -- we talked about it at every conference call, a top priority of ours is to return value to our shareholders in the form of rising dividends and share repurchases and we would look at every opportunity to do that with the caveat that we're not going to do anything to damage the long-term value of the brand of the company. This transaction fits squarely in there. There is absolutely no extra [indiscernible] in the company or anything like that. What it did is it liberated $43 million of excess cash. That excess cash was used to buy share repurchases. And even though, again, from a present value basis, we're neutral line EPS, we believe that our long-term shareholders would prefer to have at this moment in time, more equity in our company given historically low PEs that we are trading at. And so they get the ownership today versus waiting over that period of time for the opportunity cost of that money."

We saw that increase from a modest amount in the first quarter, increased in the second and third quarter and it hit about 10% rate in the fourth quarter. Now we have seen that hold to 10% in the fourth quarter of last year, the first quarter of this year and the second quarter was also a 10.

We talked in depth about our Q2 results and what we see going forward. You've all read the news release we issued this morning, John and I will bring context and perspective to those results and highlight some of the factors that are at play so you can get the best read on our outlook for Q3, the full year and beyond. 
Before John goes into the detailed financials, I'd like to comment on 2 themes: market performance and then company performance. From a market perspective, we're very pleased with the share performance in the U.S. where we gained 2 points of share in the heavyweight segment for the quarter on top of our already strong share position. As the U.S. remains highly competitive, this gain is an important validation that our initial investments to drive demand are working. Since the beginning of the year, we made investments designed that impacts customer choice and support our long-term strategy of growing our reach and impact with customers and strong returns to investors. 
Our demand driving investments are focused in 4 areas: increasing product and brand awareness, growing new ridership in the United States, increasing and enhancing brand access and accelerating the cadence and the impact of new products. Our teams across the globe launched several initiatives behind these investments with precision and effectiveness delivering solid results in our international markets and driving the market share gains in the United States. 
Looking internationally, our retail sales were up 4.3%, driven by continued growth in Asia, Canada and Mexico, and our best ever quarter for Harley-Davidson in our EMEA region. Our investments to increase demo rides in EMEA, for example, was a major contributor to our growth in the region in Q2, nothing seals the deal better for a new customer than experiencing one of our great bikes firsthand.
In Asia, where we maintained our #1 market share in Australia, India and Japan, we focused our investment [indiscernible] demo rides and growing ridership. And in the U.S., the Live Your Legend campaign and other demand-driving investments build significant relevance and helped drive a 30% increase in demo rides, so far this year, and a 40% increase in the number of students trained through the Harley-Davidson Riding Academy. There are also some real positives in the nature of retail sales and market share gains that further reinforce the strength of our work both near and long term. 
Notably, we are very pleased to have growth year-to-date in the all-important young adult segment in the United States. The young adult segment is not only important for the long term, it's the most competitive market segment in the U.S. All of these initiatives combined, represent an important long-term play as we seek to grow the sport in the U.S. and bring new customers into the brand in all of our markets. 
I'm encouraged that the actions that we've taken so far this year have enabled us to make progress on our long-term growth strategy. However, [indiscernible] sales for the quarter were down due to significant declines in the U.S. industry, which was far weaker than expected. We expected the industry to be down in the first half of the year as we lapped industry growth in 2015 that was stimulated by the shift in currency and the resulting competitive discounting. And as we also expected, by continued weakness in the oil-dependent areas. We did not, however, expect the industry as a whole would be as soft as it is. While our share gains helped to blunt the full impact of this weak market, lackluster industry sales have had a significant impact on our results and our forward expectations. 
As a result, we're taking the prudent step to lower expected 2016 shipments. This is largely due to what we believe will be continued pressure on industry growth in the U.S., coupled with caution as we consider the potential impact of the macroeconomic uncertainty on sales globally. We remain steadfast in our commitment to keep supply in line with demand to protect the premium [indiscernible] and we believe the steps we're taking will ensure dealer inventory is in line by year-end to support the expected sales environment. 
All in, we now plan to ship fewer motorcycles for the full year and are revising our shipment guidance from 1% to 3% growth to approximately down 1% to up 1% from 2015. Our production plans and shipment expectations are intended to drive flat inventory at year-end, even with our expanded model range. These actions will have a drag on earnings for the full year. So we're revising our full year expected operating margin down 1 percentage point to 15% to 16%. Without question, we must assure inventory balance for our long-term competitiveness and profitability for both the company and our incredible dealers.
Now shifting from market to company performance. You'll see that gross margin declined in the quarter. There are a number of factors here that both John and I will address. As we've discussed in prior calls, we expected higher manufacturing costs due to the significant investments we're making to advance our flexible manufacturing strategy. These investments are complex and require discipline, planning and execution, including numerous down days, inventory bridges and careful ramp plans. The net impact can be seen in changes to gross margin, shipments and inventory patterns in the second quarter, and the impact will continue in Q3 as we ramp back to full production. The investments are part of the manufacturing flexibility strategy that will enhance cost-effective flexibility now at our Kansas City plant.
Another factor in gross margin performance in Q2 is the impact of volume and mix adjustments we made to capture the demand lift from the Cruiser success we experienced in the quarter, while also adjusting downward the total volume in the softer-than-expected U.S. industry. The U.S. industry turned swiftly in the second quarter. We responded with discipline and commitment in an effort to keep supply in line with demand and these actions also impacted our gross margin in the quarter. While difficult, these actions were necessary to set us up for success for our model year launch and also for 2017 and beyond. 
And speaking of new products and our new model launch, I'm incredibly excited about our lineup which we will unveil to our global dealer network at the end of August. We will add to the stable of products driving our current success and we've got some incredible products in the pipeline for 2018, our 115th anniversary and beyond. 
Before I turn it over to John, I want to take this opportunity to thank everyone associated with this great company: employees, dealers, suppliers and our passionate riders. I'm proud of our team and all the work that's being done at Harley-Davidson. We're in challenging times, political, economic and cultural forces are all working against confidence and security for people everywhere in the world. Everyone in our company is aware and attuned to what we need to do. We have 113-year history of challenges we stood up to and faced down. 
The power of personal freedom for our riders is stronger than ever take and we all aim to deliver for them. We understand the intense need to manage through these challenges effectively and deliver results. We are stewards of this incredible brand and of your investment, and we do not take that responsibility lightly. Without question, driving demand, growing the business and delivering strong returns are top priorities for all of us at Harley-Davidson, and we're focused every day on delivering for our riders near term and long term in order to do so.
With that, I'm going to turn it over to John. Thank you."

Today I'll provide additional insight around our second quarter financial results found in our press release and supporting [indiscernible] starting on Slide 9. During the quarter, revenue was $1.86 billion, net i",2549,"Thanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. Today I'll provide additional insight around our second quarter financial results found in our press release and supporting [indiscernible] starting on Slide 9. During the quarter, revenue was $1.86 billion, net income was $280.4 million and diluted earnings per share were $1.55. Operating income from the motorcycles segment was down 15.2% from last year's second quarter. Segment revenue was up 1.2% in the quarter, behind a 3.5% increase in motorcycles shipments. Gross margin as a percent of revenue decreased versus prior year as a result of unfavorable product mix and currency exchange in addition to higher year-over-year manufacturing cost. 
SG&A was also up in the quarter as we increased our demand driving and product development investments. Operating income as a percent of revenue in Q2 was 19.3%. At HDFS, operating income was up 9.4% year-over-year in part driven by a gain related to a full securitization. The quarter also reflected higher corporate interests expense resulting from our 2015 recapitalization and lower [ph] effective tax rate. Despite the challenging conditions we continue to face, we remain focused on driving demand and delivering strong margins and strong returns over the long term.
On Slide 10, you'll see worldwide retail sales of new Harley-Davidson Motorcycles in Q2 were down 1.9% versus prior year. International retail sales were up year-over-year, while the U.S. retail sales were lower than expected on surprisingly weak industry results. Despite the ongoing challenging macroeconomic and motorcycle industry conditions, we were encouraged with our share gains in the second quarter. Our ability to grow internationally and partially offset the industry headwinds in the United States, reinforces our intensified focus on driving demand and enhancing our strong brand.
Our increased investments and driving demand and product development drove positive market share results in the U.S. and in Europe during the first half of this year. In addition, the positive response to our new 2016 motorcycle models continued during the second quarter. As Matt noted, we continue to be committed and steadfast in our resolve to manage supply in line with demand. Given the poor U.S. industry retail sales in Q2 and softness expected into the second half of 2016, we are taking steps to adjust retail inventory in the U.S. and now expect year-end retail inventory in the U.S. to be in line with prior year versus our previous expectation to grow year-end retail inventory. Considering our desire to reduce year-end U.S. retail inventory in the face of soft U.S. industry sales and the uncertainty resulting from global macroeconomic challenges, we have lowered our full year shipment expectations. 
Let's take a closer look at the U.S on Slide 11. Q2 retail sales in the U.S. were down 5.2% versus prior year, behind weak U.S. industry sales. The impact of the weak U.S. industry on our sales was partially offset by strong gains in market share. The U.S. industry was down 8.6% during the quarter. While we expected the industry to be down in the first half of 2016, we did not expect the extent to which the second quarter declined, especially considering the high level of competitive discounting that continued during the quarter. We believe the industry was down due to the following 2 factors: lapping strong year-ago industry growth driven by the onset of aggressive competitive discounting in the year-ago period and weak sales in oil-dependent areas.
While the industry lagged our expectations, we're encouraged with our Q2 market share of 49.5% in the U.S., which was up a strong to 2.0 percentage points. We believe our second quarter market share gains were driven by our demand driving investments focused on growing product awareness and growing ridership in the U.S. and a strong reception to our new 2016 motorcycle models. While our competitors continue to engage in levels of discounting similar to the first quarter and at more aggressive levels than in last year's second quarter, we were very pleased that we were able to increase market share in the U.S. [indiscernible] and enhancing actions. 
U.S. retail inventory was up at the end of the second quarter driven by 3 factors: first, we offered 5 incremental models versus the prior year; second, inventory was up as we shipped all model year 2016 motorcycles in advance of the Q3 ERP implementation; and also as a result of lower-than-expected Q2 retail sales.
On Slide 12, you'll see retail sales in our international markets were up in Q2. All regions were up except Latin America, which was impacted by weakness in Brazil. Excluding Brazil, international markets were up 5.6%. During the quarter, EMEA retail sales were up 8.2% behind a great reception to our new 2016 motorcycle models and increased demand driving investments. This quarter's strong retail sales also benefited from lapping prior year retail sales -- lower prior year retail sales. Market share in EMEA was up 0.3% [indiscernible] basis. Asia Pacific retail sales growth slowed as we lapped very strong year-ago retail sales comps of up nearly 17% and as we temporarily exited the market in Indonesia earlier this year in order to establish a dealer network -- a new dealer network and improve customer experience. 
Latin America retail sales trends improved significantly from last quarter behind continued strong growth in Mexico. Weakness in Brazil drove overall sales declines in the region as sales continue to be impacted by a challenging economy and consumer uncertainty. In response to the nearly 50% devaluation of the Brazilian real last year, we raised model year 2016 prices over 20% to improve profitability per motorcycle. We continue to expect retail sales to be down for the year. 
Finally, retail sales in Canada were up 2.0% in the second quarter. We believe the market continue to respond well to the change to a direct distribution model and pricing adjustments that were made at the model year. [indiscernible] of our strategic focus on increasing brand access, we plan to continue to expand our international distribution. We added 6 new international dealerships in the second quarter. 
On Slide 13, you'll see wholesale shipments of Harley-Davidson Motorcycles in the quarter were slightly above our guidance as we shipped ahead of the Q3 ERP implementation. As a result, U.S. shipments and retail inventory increased during the quarter and company inventory fell below prior year levels. Our production plants were idled earlier this month and overall production was down about 30% in July as we successfully implemented our ERP system in Kansas City. We began model year '17 production on schedule. Second quarter shipment mix reflected strong demand for our new 2016 Cruiser and Sportster motorcycles. 
On Slide 14, you'll see revenue for the motorcycles and related product segment was up in the second quarter behind a 3.5% increase in motorcycles shipment. Revenue in the quarter was unfavorably impacted [indiscernible] significant shift in mix to our Cruiser and Sportster motorcycles and slightly unfavorable currency exchange, partially offset by higher pricing. As a result, average motorcycle revenue per unit was down for the quarter.
On Slide 15 you'll see gross margin as a percent of revenue in the quarter was down to 2.8 percentage points versus last year. While we expected Q2 gross margin to be unfavorable driven by mix, currency and manufacturing, the impacts from mix and manufacturing were more unfavorable than we anticipated. During the quarter, customer demand for our Cruisers and Sportsters exceeded our expectations, which led to higher-than-expected mix unfavorability of $17.6 million. As we expected, foreign currency exchange was negative as we lapped significant hedge gains in last year's second quarter, and as we have lower revenues behind a slightly stronger U.S. dollar.
Manufacturing expenses were higher-than-expected, unfavorable $36.1 million during the second quarter. We did expect significant unfavorable variances largely driven by startup cost related to the implementation of our ERP system in Kansas City and cost associated with significant plant retooling. However, as Matt explained, plant efficiencies were lower than expected due to lower production given soft sales in Q2 and other plant disruptions. It is important to note, the increase in manufacturing costs that we have experienced in this first half of this year are largely temporary in nature and we would not expect the majority of these costs to recur in 2017. Looking forward, we continue to expect Q3 manufacturing expense to be unfavorable behind lower absorption and higher year-over-year startup cost. Conversely, we expect manufacturing favorability in Q4.
On Slide 16, operating margin as a percent of revenue for the second quarter was 19.3%, down compared to last year's second quarter. Operating margin was unfavorably impacted by lower gross margin as well as higher [ph] SG&A resulting from both our increased investments in driving demand and product development, and from costs associated with managing our Canadian operations which we acquired in August of 2015. For the full year, we expect SG&A to be near year-ago levels. We remain intensely focused on a cost structure that will enable growth and continuous improvement to drive our business to be stronger, more flexible and more profitable.
Moving on to HDFS on Slide 16 (sic) [ 17 ]. During the quarter HDFS' operating profit increased $7.7 million or 9.4% compared to last year. The primary factors impacting second quarter results were: First, net interest income was up over the year by $5.0 million. This increase was driven by higher receivables, partially offset by higher borrowing cost and lower yields, due in part to the 2015 low interest rate promotional activity. Second, the provision for retail motorcycle loan losses increased [ph] over prior year by $8.2 million driven by higher retail credit losses and an associated increase in the allowance. It is important to note that second quarter provision increase was significantly less than what we experienced in the first quarter of 2016. 
Finally, you will see on the slide a gain on full securitization. This represents a full securitization in which we sold retail finance receivables with a principal balance of approximately $302 million, along with all the residual financial interest in those receivables. Because we have no ownership interest in the receivables, the transaction was recorded as a sale which, in this case, resulted in a gain of $9.3 million.
HDFS' operational results are summarized on Slide 18. For the quarter, originations were down 3.9% compared to last year, but HDFS' share of U.S. new retail motorcycle loans -- motorcycle sales increased to 63.4%. Year-to-date loan originations were comprised of approximately 80% prime loans and 20% subprime. As a predominant industry leader to subprime customers, these originations continue to represent a significant number of retail sales to the company at very attractive returns. 
At the end of the second quarter, we had $419 million of cash and cash equivalents at HDFS. In addition, HDFS had $1.02 billion of available liquidity through bank credit and conduit facilities. HDFS also paid a $43 million dividend to H-D Inc. during the quarter, which I will talk more about in a moment. 
On Slide 19, you'll see the 30-day delinquency rate for retail motorcycle loan receivables that remained on our balance sheet was 3.16% or 45 basis points higher than Q2 2015. 14 basis points of the increase represents a change in the mix of the portfolio after the securitization of 302 [indiscernible] prime receivables. The delinquency rate on a managed basis, including those loans sold in full securitization, was still 31 basis points higher than the prior year due in part to deterioration in oil-dependent areas. Despite the increase, delinquencies remain near historically low levels.
The annualized retail credit losses for receivables that remain on our balance sheet was 1.50% or 42 basis points higher than Q2 2015. On a managed basis, the credit loss rate was 1.49%. The increase was a result of higher losses on loans in oil-dependent areas, normalizing loan performance and lower used bike values at auction. During the quarter, HDFS continued to maintain a strong liquidity position and continued strong profitability to the company. 
The remaining Harley-Davidson Inc. financial results are summarized on Slide 20. A few things to note: operating cash was down from last year driven by lower net [ph] income, higher working capital and higher net wholesale lending. And year-to-date tax rate was 32.7%, which was lower than last year's tax rate behind the successful closure of various tax audits allowing us to reduce our tax reserves. The company has and intends to continue to maintain a minimum of 12 months of projected liquidity needs in cash and/or committed credit facilities. 
Returning value to our shareholders is a top priority. We expect to return all excess cash to our shareholders in the form of increasing dividends and continued share repurchases. On Slide 21, you will see we did both during the second quarter. In addition, as I mentioned earlier, during the quarter we completed a full securitization. Because we sold all ownership interest in the receivables, the receivables and any corresponding debt are not recorded on HDFS' balance sheet. Consequently, this allowed HDFS to pay a dividend of H-D Inc. of [indiscernible] without impacting HDFS' debt-to-equity ratio. We used the dividend to repurchase shares under the existing share repurchase authorizations. While we believe the EPS impact was neutral, the shareholder repurchase associated with the full securitization increased our shareholders' ownership in the company at a time when our stock is trading at historically low P/E. This was the first time HDFS or we believe any other manufacturer has utilized this market. Actions such as this demonstrate our commitment to explore avenues to improve funding costs, diversify funding sources and return excess cash to our shareholders. We will continue to look for additional opportunities to return excess cash to our shareholders without damaging the long-term value of the company or the brand. 
On Slide 22, you'll see our overall expectations for 2016. We now expect to ship 264,000 to 269,000 motorcycles, which is approximately down 1% to up 1% over last year. We expect third quarter shipments to be approximately flat to down 9% versus last year's third quarter. For the full year 2016, we now expect operating margin for the Motorcycles segment to be approximately 15% to 16%. We are lowering our expectations by approximately 1 percentage point due to lost absorption on lower production, unfavorable mix and higher manufacturing expense. Finally, we now expect our full year 2016 effective tax rate will be approximately 33%. Our 2016 directional expectations for gross margin, SG&A, HDFS and capital expenditures are unchanged and noted on this slide.
While the weak U.S. industry and continued intense competition drove less than expected retail sales during the quarter, we are encouraged by the positive market share results from our demand-driving investments and new models. We are also pleased to see international retail sales growth despite macroeconomic headwinds. We continue to [indiscernible] decisions to support a prudent retail inventory position and to protect our strong brand and profitability into the future. We are maintaining our intense focus on maximizing shareholder value by returning cash to our shareholders through share repurchases and increased dividends. We will continue to navigate through the challenging environment and are making investments to drive demand and deliver stronger -- and deliver strong margins and strong returns over the long term.

Also, the significant growth last year, as I mentioned, and the corresponding comp for this year, we knew that, that was going to create pressure. The forecast for the industry growth were kind of in that 2% range. And clearly, it's not materializing that way. And so we're looking at it very carefully.

Do you think that you're positioned appropriately for the declining industry that seemed to surprise you in the quarter? I'm just wondering if your plans for the second half and also for next year are appropriate for the current environment. I mean, I understand the reasons behind the inventory build that you talked about, positioning for the new models, getting ahead of Kansas City ERP, but just given the environment, given the surprises that continue to come and given the competition, I'm just wondering how much have you stress tested your growth plans for the second half and for next year?"

Retail inventory was up 20 -- or I'm sorry, 8,300 units [ph] largely driven by 5 incremental models. On average, our dealers have about 2 1/2 of each of those models in their dealerships and that adds up actually to over 8,000 units, but we also wanted to ship in ahead of the ERP implementation. And so when we look at second quarter and you also -- you look at the retail side, which is up 8,300 units, our company-owned inventory is down quite a bit. And when you net those 2, we're basically up in the second quarter, 1/3 of July's production and that's what we expect to lose. So to answer your question, as we exit the first half, we're right in line with what we expected in terms of inventory on a year-over-year basis, again, to compensate for the lost production in July. When we extend that forward, we were expecting inventories and the U.S. to grow behind additional models. And given that environment that you have mentioned and then certainly that we experienced in the second quarter, we are more cautious and want to be more prudent from an inventory perspective. And with that, we do not expect inventories to grow [indiscernible] in the United States at year-end. And yes, we absolutely feel that is the appropriate level of inventory given the soft retail sales that we're seeing in the first half of this year."

And you can read from that, that we expect and we believe is embedded in our numbers, the industry to continue to be soft for the balance of the year and probably into next year as well. And so we feel we're adequately provisioning and preparing for that. But -- and I guess, also, with a healthy dose of realism, given what we saw, that was quite surprising here in the second quarter.

When we look at the securitization that we recently did about a month ago, there were 2 changes in that securitization from normal securitizations that we execute. [indiscernible] pointed out is that they were made up of 100% of prime receivables. And the second one is we sold the residual interest that allowed us to classify it off-balance sheet. Your question centers around the prime aspect of it. So historically, we've sold securitizations that resemble our originations, about 80% prime and 20% subprime. And for all kinds of speculation as to why we did 100% prime, so let me clear that up, some of that speculation has been is we can't sell subprime into the market and that is absolute untruth nonsense. So for over a decade we've been selling a mix of prime and subprime into very robust demand in the marketplace and that has not changed at all. What has changed over the last couple of securitization is that our spreads have widened on the securitization to our benchmark. Our benchmark is prime model and there is no one else that does a mixture of securitizations like we do, so we benchmark the prime model. What we have noticed over the last couple securitizations [indiscernible] widening out a little bit. And so the best way to tether them back was to get a comparable securitization to our benchmark. And with that, we saw extreme tightening of those margins or of those spreads to prime model. So we as we look forward, whether we decide to do all-prime or subprime and prime, kind of the tethering of the investment community to that spread against prime has been very important us and will pay dividends as we move into the future. So that's why we move forward with the prime securitization. Your second question is with regards to Brexit. At this point, there is not enough information, not enough time has gone back to understand the impact of Brexit. I think what we are very certain of is that Brexit does not provide any benefit to retail sales or consumer confidence in Europe. And I think this is what Matt talked about a little [indiscernible] is I'd put it into a broader bucket instead of just Brexit as overall consumer confidence driven by geopolitical concerns or macroeconomic concerns. We're very excited about the momentum that we have in our European business. As you can see, for the quarter, it was up quite significantly. We'll keep a close eye on Brexit, but we're going to focus on what we can control and continue to drive a great customer experience for our customers around the world."

When you look at the second quarter, we did ship a little bit over the high end of our guidance. And at the same time, during the quarter, we were cutting production quite dramatically and our retail sales were down. So you're saying is, can you help me out -- help me understand this. So basically, as we got toward the end of the quarter, we had all the product made and that was either in retail or in our company-owned inventory. And typically, we have a bit of company-owned inventory in the United States that facilitates the flow and the orderly shipments of motorcycles. We made the decision to ship it all out prior [indiscernible] the period. The reason we did that is in the very outside chance that we had any issues with the ERP system. If they're in our system, we may have trouble getting them shipped. So it was just a simple [indiscernible] derisking of the overall ERP implementation. I couldn't be more pleased to say that the team did a fantastic job. Everything came up as expected. The ramp plans are on plan and everything is moving forward. But James, it was simply that is -- we could take a little bit more risk out of it. Now having said that, overall inventories, as I mentioned, I think to Felicia, overall inventories didn't change. But we had company owned inventories lower on a year-over-year basis and we put a little bit more into the field.

We go through a robust process looking at all factors and everything that we know in the marketplace, which is centered around new dealerships coming up in the international markets, we'll have more dealers in the back half -- new dealers in the back half than the front half. We look at the performance of outreach in the United States, that's performing extremely well. We look at the investments that we've made in the demand-driving activities, what we expect to come out of those. And certainly and most importantly, we look at the new models that we're going to be launching here in 3 to 4 weeks, and we couldn't be more excited about that. You take all those together, James, we are very confident that we are going to ship from 264,000 to 269,000 motorcycles for 2016."

And if we haven't shown our resolve to manage this company for the long-term value of our shareholders in the actions that we've taken to keep in the marketplace or aggressively manage supply in line with demand or to hold to -- we're not going to discount our way out of this soft spot that we're expecting [indiscernible] people aren't looking. We have got tremendous resolve and we will manage the inventory at appropriate levels. And now with regards to pricing, I'm not going to speak a lot of that because in 3 weeks you will see the new models and you will see the pricing and you can answer that question for yourself, Jaime. But again, we feel very comfortable where we're at with regards to the market and we'll continue to manage it very tightly. I'm glad you asked about share gains in the United States, I couldn't be more thrilled to answer this question. A year ago, we sat here, Matt and I, Matt's first conference call, and we said that we had an issue given the shift in world currencies and the incredible competitiveness that came out of it, in particular in discounting. And we said that we were not going to discount our way out of it. We weren't going to drain the industry of profits and chase this thing. And it was going to take us some time, but we were going to spend more time understanding what we need to do and how we can compete [indiscernible] world of expanded price gaps without cheapening our brand. And now, dial forward a couple of quarters, we are there and we delivered 2 points of market share gains. So let me talk a second about those, the gains were very strong and wide. Number one, they came in all of our segments, our Touring segment, our Cruisers and our Street and Sportster segment size of motorcycle. They came in the 7 sales regions that we have in the United States. We gained share in each and every one of them. Our gains were over double the nearest competitor. When you look broadly at those share gains, what we saw is -- the biggest loser were, in aggregate, Japanese competitors. We also saw, while we had mentioned in the preamble that overall discounting was higher on a year-over-year basis, we did see the Japanese discounting be down a little bit versus a year ago and it seems to be reflecting in their market share. With that, we saw a rotation in the brand [indiscernible] discounting from the Japanese to the American brands in the second quarter, and we're seeing some of the share gains in there. Overall, Europeans market share was down a little bit, but we had some big winners and big losers in that segment. Hopefully that helps, Jaime."

And actually, we're incredibly pleased with the model year '16 products and how they drove the market globally.

And clearly, there are a lot of constraints in this competitive environment that we're in, but our product drives customer passion, customer loyalty and sales and market share. We saw that with the shift in sales to large Cruisers, which helped us gain share. Those large Cruisers are a little lower margin than our Touring motorcycles, so that's part of our gross margin deterioration that we just spoke about on the call today. But product is a very key lever for us, it put one of our 4 focus areas to increase both the cadence and the impact of the product. And 2016 is a good example of both high-impact product at an increase cadence. And 2017 is going to be no different. It's a formula that's working for us and we've invested more heavily both capital and expense as part of the demand-driving shift to make sure that the product that we deliver makes a difference in the marketplace and that we do it well and we do it more rapidly.

In the 8-K that we put out, we talked about this overall transaction is neutral when you look at the present value of earnings per share, so it's a great question. Basically, here's whats happened -- what happens is, in a securitization we sell off of a bunch of bonds to investors and there is a -- it goes into a trust and all the residual earnings that we get off that, we keep, because -- we keep the risk and we keep that reward. What we [indiscernible] into a slightly different market and we found an investor to buy that. And what they did is they paid us a bunch of upfront cash to buy that residual interest in the trust or those trailing earnings. We believe that the opportunity cost of the transaction that we did is about $7 million of those trailing earnings. So to do broad math we took a $9 million gain, gave up about $7 million of opportunity cost, so they would have earned about $16 million. We took $9 million today, right? So if you take and you discount over the next 7 years that $7 million that would have come in, bring it to the present value and that impact on EPS, along with the fact that because it's off-balance sheet, we have freed up equity at HDFS to maintain the same debt to equity, we've now got more equity. So HDFS wrote a check that works out to be $43 million and we bought shares back with that. And if you take that impact on EPS, they're about neutral. So the question is why did we do it if it's neutral? Number one is that once you get in the market, you don't know how the market is going to exactly respond. But there's 2 reasons that we did this: Number one, is it's an additional source of liquidity. So we're always looking for opportunities, more investors, more liquidity and this is a great opportunity. The other thing, with the additional liquidity opportunity, we also learned that we can monetize the assets on our balance sheet to some extent, and that is very important to know. So that's number one reason. Number two and the more important reason is, is one of our -- we talked about it at every conference call, a top priority of ours is to return value to our shareholders in the form of rising dividends and share repurchases. And we will look at every opportunity to do that with the caveat that we're not going to do anything to damage the long-term value of the brand or the company. This transaction fits squarely in there. There is absolutely no extra [indiscernible] in the company or anything like that. What it did is it liberated $43 million of excess cash. That excess cash was used to buy share repurchases. And even though, again, from a present value basis, we're neutral on EPS, we believe that our long-term shareholders would prefer to have, at this moment in time, more equity in our company given the historically low P/Es that we're trading at. And so they get the ownership today versus waiting over that period of time for the opportunity cost of that money."

We saw that increase from a modest amount in the first quarter, increased through the second and third quarter, and it hit about 10% rate in the fourth quarter. Now we've seen that hold to 10% in the fourth quarter of last year, the first quarter of this year and the second quarter was also at 10%.

We talked in depth about our Q2 results and what we see going forward. You've all read the news release we issued this morning, John and I will bring context and perspective to those results and highlight some of the factors that are at play so you can get the best read on our outlook for Q3, the full year and beyond. 
Before John goes into the detailed financials, I'd like to comment on 2 themes: market performance and then company performance. From a market perspective, we're very pleased with the share performance in the U.S. where we gained 2 points of share in the heavyweight segment for the quarter on top of our already strong share position. As the U.S. remains highly competitive, this gain is an important validation that our initial investments to drive demand are working. Since the beginning of the year, we made investments designed that impacts customer choice and support our long-term strategy of growing our reach and impact with customers and strong returns to investors. 
Our demand driving investments are focused in 4 areas: increasing product and brand awareness, growing new ridership in the United States, increasing and enhancing brand access and accelerating the cadence and the impact of new products. Our teams across the globe launched several initiatives behind these investments with precision and effectiveness, delivering solid results in our international markets and driving the market share gains in the United States. 
Looking internationally, our retail sales were up 4.3%, driven by continued growth in Asia, Canada and Mexico, and our best ever quarter for Harley-Davidson in our EMEA region. Our investments to increase demo rides in EMEA, for example, was a major contributor to our growth in the region in Q2, nothing seals the deal better for a new customer than experiencing one of our great bikes firsthand.
In Asia, where we maintained our #1 market share. In Australia, India and Japan, we focused our investment on demo rides and growing ridership. And in the U.S., the Live Your Legend campaign and other demand-driving investments build significant relevance and helped drive a 30% increase in demo rides, so far this year, and a 40% increase in the number of students trained through the Harley-Davidson Riding Academy. There are also some real positives in the nature of retail sales and market share gains that further reinforce the strength of our work both near and long term. 
Notably, we are very pleased to have growth year-to-date in the all-important young adult segment in the United States. The young adult segment is not only important for the long term, it's the most competitive market segment in the U.S. All of these initiatives combined, represent an important long-term play as we seek to grow the sport in the U.S. and bring new customers into the brand in all of our markets. 
I'm encouraged that the actions that we've taken so far this year have enabled us to make progress on our long-term growth strategy. However, worldwide sales for the quarter were down due to significant declines in the U.S. industry, which was far weaker than expected. We expected the industry to be down in the first half of the year as we lapped industry growth in 2015 that was stimulated by the shift in currency and the resulting competitive discounting. And as we also expected, by continued weakness in the oil-dependent areas. We did not, however, expect the industry as a whole would be as soft as it is. While our share gains helped to blunt the full impact of this weak market, lackluster industry sales have had a significant impact on our results and our forward expectations. 
As a result, we're taking the prudent step to lower expected 2016 shipments. This is largely due to what we believe will be continued pressure on industry growth in the U.S., coupled with caution as we consider the potential impact of the macroeconomic uncertainty on sales globally. We remain steadfast in our commitment to keep supply in line with demand to protect the premium [indiscernible] and we believe the steps we're taking will ensure dealer inventory is in line by year-end to support the expected sales environment. 
All in, we now plan to ship fewer motorcycles for the full year and are revising our shipment guidance from 1% to 3% growth to approximately down 1% to up 1% from 2015. Our production plans and shipment expectations are intended to drive flat inventory at year-end, even with our expanded model range. These actions will have a drag on earnings for the full year. So we're revising our full year expected operating margin down 1 percentage point to 15% to 16%. Without question, we must assure inventory balance for our long-term competitiveness and profitability for both the company and our incredible dealers.
Now shifting from market to company performance. You'll see that gross margin declined in the quarter. There are a number of factors here that both John and I will address. As we've discussed in prior calls, we expected higher manufacturing costs due to the significant investments we're making to advance our flexible manufacturing strategy. These investments are complex and require discipline, planning and execution, including numerous down days, inventory bridges and careful ramp plans. The net impact can be seen in changes to gross margin, shipments and inventory patterns in the second quarter, and the impact will continue in Q3 as we ramp back to full production. The investments are part of the manufacturing flexibility strategy that will enhance cost-effective flexibility now at our Kansas City plant.
Another factor in gross margin performance in Q2 is the impact of volume and mix adjustments we made to capture the demand lift from the Cruiser success we experienced in the quarter, while also adjusting downward the total volume in the softer-than-expected U.S. industry. The U.S. industry turned swiftly in the second quarter. We responded with discipline and commitment in an effort to keep supply in line with demand and these actions also impacted our gross margin in the quarter. While difficult, these actions were necessary to set us up for success for our model year launch and also for 2017 and beyond. 
And speaking of new products and our new model launch, I'm incredibly excited about our lineup which we will unveil to our global dealer network at the end of August. We will add to the stable of products driving our current success and we've got some incredible products in the pipeline for 2018, our 115th anniversary and beyond. 
Before I turn it over to John, I want to take this opportunity to thank everyone associated with this great company: employees, dealers, suppliers and our passionate riders. I'm proud of our team and all the work that's being done at Harley-Davidson. We're in challenging times, political, economic and cultural forces are all working against confidence and security for people everywhere in the world. Everyone in our company is aware and attuned to what we need to do. We have 113-year history of challenges we stood up to and faced down. 
The power of personal freedom for our riders is stronger than ever take and we all aim to deliver for them. We understand the intense need to manage through these challenges effectively and deliver results. We are stewards of this incredible brand and of your investment, and we do not take that responsibility lightly. Without question, driving demand, growing the business and delivering strong returns are top priorities for all of us at Harley-Davidson, and we're focused every day on delivering for our riders near term and long term in order to do so.
With that, I'm going to turn it over to John. Thank you."

Today I'll provide additional insight around our second quarter financial results found in our press release and supporting [indiscernible] starting on Slide 9. During the quarter, revenue was $1.86 billion, net income was $280.4 million and diluted earnings per share were $1.55. Operating income from the motorcycles segment was down 15.2% from last year's second quarter. Segment revenue was up 1.2% in the quarter, behind a 3.5% increase in motorcycles shipments. Gross margin as a percent of revenue decreased versus prior year as a result of unfavorable product mix and currency exchange in addition to higher year-over-year manufacturing cost. 
SG&A was also up in the quarter as we increased our demand driving and product development investments. Operating income as a percent of revenue in Q2 was 19.3%. At HDFS, operating income was up 9.4% year-over-year in part driven by a gain related to a full securitization. The quarter also reflected higher corporate interests expense resulting from our 2015 recapitalization and lower [ph] effective tax rate. Despite the challenging conditions we continue to face, we remain focused on driving demand and delivering strong margins and strong returns over the long term.
On Slide 10, you'll see worldwide retail sales of new Harley-Davidson Motorcycles in Q2 were down 1.9% versus prior year. International retail sales were up year-over-year, while the U.S. retail sales were lower than expected on surprisingly weak industry results. Despite the ongoing challenging macroeconomic and motorcycle industry conditions, we were encouraged with our share gains in the second quarter. Our ability to grow internationally and partially offset the industry headwinds in the United States, reinforces our intensified focus on driving demand and enhancing our strong brand.
Our increased investments in driving demand and product development drove positive market share results in the U.S. and in Europe during the first half of this year. In addition, the positive response to our new 2016 motorcycle models continued during the second quarter. As Matt noted, we continue to be committed and steadfast in our resolve to manage supply in line with demand. Given the poor U.S. industry retail sales in Q2 and softness expected into the second half of 2016, we are taking steps to adjust retail inventory in the U.S. and now expect year-end retail inventory in the U.S. to be in line with prior year versus our previous expectation to grow year-end retail inventory. Considering our desire to reduce year-end U.S. retail inventory in the face of soft U.S. industry sales and the uncertainty resulting from global macroeconomic challenges, we have lowered our full year shipment expectations. 
Let's take a closer look at the U.S on Slide 11. Q2 retail sales in the U.S. were down 5.2% versus prior year, behind weak U.S. industry sales. The impact of the weak U.S. industry on our sales was partially offset by strong gains in market share. The U.S. industry was down 8.6% during the quarter. While we expected the industry to be down in the first half of 2016, we did not expect the extent to which the second quarter declined, especially considering the high level of competitive discounting that continued during the quarter. We believe the industry was down due to the following 2 factors: lapping strong year-ago industry growth driven by the onset of aggressive competitive discounting in the year-ago period and weak sales in oil-dependent areas.
While the industry lagged our expectations, we're encouraged with our Q2 market share of 49.5% in the U.S., which was up a strong 2.0 percentage points. We believe our second quarter market share gains were driven by our demand driving investments focused on growing product awareness and growing ridership in the U.S. and a strong reception to our new 2016 motorcycle models. While our competitors continue to engage in levels of discounting similar to the first quarter and at more aggressive levels than in last year's second quarter, we were very pleased that we were able to increase market share in the U.S. by brand enhancing actions. 
U.S. retail inventory was up at the end of the second quarter driven by 3 factors: first, we offered 5 incremental models versus the prior year; second, inventory was up as we shipped all model year 2016 motorcycles in advance of the Q3 ERP implementation; and also as a result of lower-than-expected Q2 retail sales.
On Slide 12, you'll see retail sales in our international markets were up in Q2. All regions were up except Latin America, which was impacted by weakness in Brazil. Excluding Brazil, international markets were up 5.6%. During the quarter, EMEA retail sales were up 8.2% behind a great reception to our new 2016 motorcycle models and increased demand driving investments. This quarter's strong retail sales also benefited from lapping prior year retail sales -- lower prior year retail sales. Market share in EMEA was up 0.3% [indiscernible] basis. Asia Pacific retail sales growth slowed as we lapped very strong year-ago retail sales comps of up nearly 17% and as we temporarily exited the market in Indonesia earlier this year in order to establish a dealer network -- a new dealer network and improve customer experience. 
Latin America retail sales trends improved significantly from last quarter behind continued strong growth in Mexico. Weakness in Brazil drove overall sales declines in the region as sales continue to be impacted by a challenging economy and consumer uncertainty. In response to the nearly 50% devaluation of the Brazilian real last year, we raised model year 2016 prices over 20% to improve profitability per motorcycle. We continue to expect retail sales to be down for the year. 
Finally, retail sales in Canada were up 2.0% in the second quarter. We believe the market continue to respond well to the change to a direct distribution model and pricing adjustments that were made at the model year. Part of our strategic focus on increasing brand access, we plan to continue to expand our international distribution. We added 6 new international dealerships in the second quarter. 
On Slide 13, you'll see wholesale shipments of Harley-Davidson Motorcycles in the quarter were slightly above our guidance as we shipped ahead of the Q3 ERP implementation. As a result, U.S. shipments and retail inventory increased during the quarter and company inventory fell below prior year levels. Our production plants were idled earlier this month and overall production was down about 30% in July as we successfully implemented our ERP system in Kansas City. We began model year '17 production on schedule. Second quarter shipment mix reflected strong demand for our new 2016 Cruiser and Sportster motorcycles. 
On Slide 14, you'll see revenue for the motorcycles and related product segment was up in the second quarter behind a 3.5% increase in motorcycles shipment. Revenue in the quarter was unfavorably impacted [indiscernible] significant shift in mix to our Cruiser and Sportster motorcycles and slightly unfavorable currency exchange, partially offset by higher pricing. As a result, average motorcycle revenue per unit was down for the quarter.
On Slide 15 you'll see gross margin as a percent of revenue in the quarter was down 2.8 percentage points versus last year. While we expected Q2 gross margin to be unfavorable driven by mix, currency and manufacturing, the impacts from mix and manufacturing were more unfavorable than we anticipated. During the quarter, customer demand for our Cruisers and Sportsters exceeded our expectations, which led to higher-than-expected mix unfavorability of $17.6 million. As we expected, foreign currency exchange was negative as we lapped significant hedge gains in last year's second quarter, and as we have lower revenues behind a slightly stronger U.S. dollar.
Manufacturing expenses were higher-than-expected, unfavorable $36.1 million during the second quarter. We did expect significant unfavorable variances largely driven by startup cost related to the implementation of our ERP system in Kansas City and cost associated with significant plant retooling. However, as Matt explained, plant efficiencies were lower than expected due to lower production given soft sales in Q2 and other plant disruptions. It is important to note, the increase in manufacturing costs that we have experienced in this first half of this year are largely temporary in nature and we would not expect the majority of these costs to recur in 2017. Looking forward, we continue to expect Q3 manufacturing expense to be unfavorable behind lower absorption and higher year-over-year startup cost. Conversely, we expect manufacturing favorability in Q4.
On Slide 16, operating margin as a percent of revenue for the second quarter was 19.3%, down compared to last year's second quarter. Operating margin was unfavorably impacted by lower gross margin as well as higher [ph] SG&A resulting from both our increased investments in driving demand and product development, and from costs associated with managing our Canadian operations which we acquired in August of 2015. For the full year, we expect SG&A to be near year-ago levels. We remain intensely focused on a cost structure that will enable growth and continuous improvement to drive our business to be stronger, more flexible and more profitable.
Moving on to HDFS on Slide 16 (sic)[17]. During the quarter HDFS' operating profit increased $7.7 million or 9.4% compared to last year. The primary factors impacting second quarter results were: First, net interest income was up over the year by $5.0 million. This increase was driven by higher receivables, partially offset by higher borrowing cost and lower yields, due in part to the 2015 low interest rate promotional activity. Second, the provision for retail motorcycle loan losses increased [ph] over prior year by $8.2 million driven by higher retail credit losses and an associated increase in the allowance. It is important to note that second quarter provision increase was significantly less than what we experienced in the first quarter of 2016. 
Finally, you will see on the slide a gain on full securitization. This represents a full securitization in which we sold retail finance receivables with a principal balance of approximately $302 million, along with all the residual financial interest in those receivables. Because we have no ownership interest in the receivables, the transaction was recorded as a sale which, in this case, resulted in a gain of $9.3 million.
HDFS' operational results are summarized on Slide 18. For the quarter, originations were down 3.9% compared to last year, but HDFS' share of U.S. new retail motorcycle loans -- motorcycle sales increased to 63.4%. Year-to-date loan originations were comprised of approximately 80% prime loans and 20% subprime. As a predominant industry leader to subprime customers, these originations continue to represent a significant number of retail sales to the company at very attractive returns. 
At the end of the second quarter, we had $419 million of cash and cash equivalents at HDFS. In addition, HDFS had $1.02 billion of available liquidity through bank credit and conduit facilities. HDFS also paid a $43 million dividend to H-D Inc. during the quarter, which I will talk more about in a moment. 
On Slide 19, you'll see the 30-day delinquency rate for retail motorcycle loan receivables that remained on our balance sheet was 3.16% or 45 basis points higher than Q2 2015. 14 basis points of the increase represents a change in the mix of the portfolio after the securitization of 302 [indiscernible] prime receivables. The delinquency rate on a managed basis, including those loans sold in full securitization, was still 31 basis points higher than the prior year due in part to deterioration in oil-dependent areas. Despite the increase, delinquencies remain near historically low levels.
The annualized retail credit losses for receivables that remain on our balance sheet was 1.50% or 42 basis points higher than Q2 2015. On a managed basis, the credit loss rate was 1.49%. The increase was a result of higher losses on loans in oil-dependent areas, normalizing loan performance and lower used bike values at auction. During the quarter, HDFS continued to maintain a strong liquidity position and continued strong profitability to the company. 
The remaining Harley-Davidson Inc. financial results are summarized on Slide 20. A few things to note: operating cash was down from last year driven by lower net [ph] income, higher working capital and higher net wholesale lending. And year-to-date tax rate was 32.7%, which was lower than last year's tax rate behind the successful closure of various tax audits allowing us to reduce our tax reserves. The company has and intends to continue to maintain a minimum of 12 months of projected liquidity needs in cash and/or committed credit facilities. 
Returning value to our shareholders is a top priority. We expect to return all excess cash to our shareholders in the form of increasing dividends and continued share repurchases. On Slide 21, you will see we did both during the second quarter. In addition, as I mentioned earlier, during the quarter we completed a full securitization. Because we sold all ownership interest in the receivables, the receivables and any corresponding debt are not recorded on HDFS' balance sheet. Consequently, this allowed HDFS to pay a dividend of H-D Inc. of [indiscernible] without impacting HDFS' debt-to-equity ratio. We used the dividend to repurchase shares under the existing share repurchase authorizations. While we believe the EPS impact was neutral, the shareholder repurchase associated with the full securitization increased our shareholders' ownership in the company at a time when our stock is trading at historically low P/E. This was the first time HDFS or we believe any other manufacturer has utilized this market. Actions such as this demonstrate our commitment to explore avenues to improve funding costs, diversify funding sources and return excess cash to our shareholders. We will continue to look for additional opportunities to return excess cash to our shareholders without damaging the long-term value of the company or the brand. 
On Slide 22, you'll see our overall expectations for 2016. We now expect to ship 264,000 to 269,000 motorcycles, which is approximately down 1% to up 1% over last year. We expect third quarter shipments to be approximately flat to down 9% versus last year's third quarter. For the full year 2016, we now expect operating margin for the Motorcycles segment to be approximately 15% to 16%. We are lowering our expectations by approximately 1 percentage point due to lost absorption on lower production, unfavorable mix and higher manufacturing expense. Finally, we now expect our full year 2016 effective tax rate will be approximately 33%. Our 2016 directional expectations for gross margin, SG&A, HDFS and capital expenditures are unchanged and noted on this slide.
While the weak U.S. industry and continued intense competition drove less than expected retail sales during the quarter, we are encouraged by the positive market share results from our demand-driving investments and new models. We are also pleased to see international retail sales growth despite macroeconomic headwinds. We continue to make necessary decisions to support a prudent retail inventory position and to protect our strong brand and profitability into the future. We are maintaining our intense focus on maximizing shareholder value by returning cash to our shareholders through share repurchases and increased dividends. We will continue to navigate through the challenging environment and are making investments to drive demand and deliver stronger -- and deliver strong margins and strong returns over the long term.

Also, the significant growth last year, as I mentioned, and the corresponding comp for this year, we knew that, that was going to create pressure. The forecast for the industry growth were kind of in that 2% range. And clearly, it's not materializing that way. And so we're looking at it very carefully. Investing in new products and awareness and rider training and focusing our efforts on what we can do to not only grow share, but grow our sales [indiscernible] primarily doing that through growing the sport. So there's a lot of real positive things in that realm, I mentioned some of them in my opening remarks, but clearly, this is a disappointment and we're regrouping as a result of it and doubling down on what we know is working to drive the industry."

Do you think that you're positioned appropriately for the declining industry that seemed to surprise you in the quarter? I'm just wondering if your plans for the second half and also for next year are appropriate for the current environment. I mean, I understand the reasons behind the inventory build that you talked about, positioning for the new models, getting ahead of Kansas City ERP, but just given the environment, given the surprises that continue to come and given the competition, I'm just wondering how much have you stress tested your growth plans for the second half and for next year?"

Retail inventory was up 20 -- or I'm sorry, 8,300 units [ph] largely driven by 5 incremental models. On average, our dealers have about 2 1/2 of each of those models in their dealerships and that adds up actually to over 8,000 units, but we also wanted to ship in ahead of the ERP implementation. And so when we look at second quarter and you also -- you look at the retail side, which is up 8,300 units, our company-owned inventory is down quite a bit. And when you net those 2, we're basically up in the second quarter, 1/3 of July's production and that's what we expect to lose. So to answer your question, as we exit the first half, we're right in line with what we expected in terms of inventory on a year-over-year basis, again, to compensate for the lost production in July. When we extend that forward, we were expecting inventories and the U.S. to grow behind additional models. And given that environment that you have mentioned and then certainly that we experienced in the second quarter, we are more cautious and want to be more prudent from an inventory perspective. And with that, we do not expect inventories to grow [indiscernible] in the United States at year-end. And yes, we absolutely feel that is the appropriate level of inventory given the soft retail sales that we're seeing in the first half of this year."

And you can read from that, that we expect and we believe is embedded in our numbers, the industry to continue to be soft for the balance of the year and probably into next year as well. And so we feel we're adequately provisioning and preparing for that. But -- and I guess, also, with a healthy dose of realism, given what we saw, that was quite surprising here in the second quarter. So we feel like we're in very good shape on both sales and inventory for the balance of the year as well as heading into next year [indiscernible] level."

When we look at the securitization that we recently did about a month ago, there were 2 changes in that securitization from normal securitizations that we execute. [indiscernible] pointed out is that they were made up of 100% of prime receivables. And the second one is we sold the residual interest that allowed us to classify it off-balance sheet. Your question centers around the prime aspect of it. So historically, we've sold securitizations that resemble our originations, about 80% prime and 20% subprime. I've heard all kinds of speculation as to why we did 100% prime, so let me clear that up, some of that speculation has been is we can't sell subprime into the market and that is absolute untruth nonsense. So for over a decade we've been selling a mix of prime and subprime into very robust demand in the marketplace and that has not changed at all. What has changed over the last couple of securitization is that our spreads have widened on the securitization to our benchmark. Our benchmark is prime model and there is no one else that does a mixture of securitizations like we do, so we benchmark the prime model. What we have noticed over the last couple securitizations, the spreads widening out a little bit. And so the best way to tether them back was to get a comparable securitization to our benchmark. And with that, we saw extreme tightening of those margins or of those spreads to prime model. So we as we look forward, whether we decide to do all-prime or subprime and prime, kind of the tethering of the investment community to that spread against prime has been very important us and will pay dividends as we move into the future. So that's why we move forward with the prime securitization. Your second question is with regards to Brexit. At this point, there is not enough information, not enough time has gone by to understand the impact of Brexit. I think what we are very certain of is that Brexit does not provide any benefit to retail sales or consumer confidence in Europe. And I think this is what Matt talked about a little [indiscernible] is I'd put it into a broader bucket instead of just Brexit as overall consumer confidence driven by geopolitical concerns or macroeconomic concerns. We're very excited about the momentum that we have in our European business. As you can see, for the quarter, it was up quite significantly. We'll keep a close eye on Brexit, but we're going to focus on what we can control and continue to drive a great customer experience for our customers around the world."

When you look at the second quarter, we did ship a little bit over the high end of our guidance. And at the same time, during the quarter, we were cutting production quite dramatically and our retail sales were down. So you're saying",435,"Okay. Thanks, James. When you look at the second quarter, we did ship a little bit over the high end of our guidance. And at the same time, during the quarter, we were cutting production quite dramatically and our retail sales were down. So you're saying is, can you help me out -- help me understand this. So basically, as we got toward the end of the quarter, we had all the product made and that was either in retail or in our company-owned inventory. And typically, we have a bit of company-owned inventory in the United States that facilitates the flow and the orderly shipments of motorcycles. We made the decision to ship it all out prior [indiscernible] the period. The reason we did that is in the very outside chance that we had any issues with the ERP system. If they're in our system, we may have trouble getting them shipped. So it was just a simple, after derisking of the overall ERP implementation. I couldn't be more pleased to say that the team did a fantastic job. Everything came up as expected. The ramp plans are on plan and everything is moving forward. But James, it was simply that is -- we could take a little bit more risk out of it. Now having said that, overall inventories, as I mentioned, I think to Felicia, overall inventories didn't change. But we had company owned inventories lower on a year-over-year basis and we put a little bit more into the field. So overall inventories are where we would have expected them, despite the lower unexpected sales based on our production reductions and lower company-owned inventory. The second question that you asked is with regards to our revised guidance, which is down 1% to up 1%. We go through a robust process looking at all factors and everything that we know in the marketplace, which is centered around new dealerships coming up in the international markets, we'll have more dealers in the back half -- new dealers in the back half than the front half. We look at the performance of outreach in the United States, that's performing extremely well. We look at the investments that we've made in the demand-driving activities, what we expect to come out of those. And certainly and most importantly, we look at the new models that we're going to be launching here in 3 to 4 weeks, and we couldn't be more excited about that. You take all those together, James, we are very confident that we are going to ship from 264,000 to 269,000 motorcycles for 2016."

And if we haven't shown our resolve to manage this company for the long-term value of our shareholders in the actions that we've taken to keep in the marketplace or aggressively manage supply in line with demand or to hold to -- we're not going to discount our way out of this soft spot that we're expecting [indiscernible] people aren't looking. We have got tremendous resolve and we will manage the inventory at appropriate levels. And now with regards to pricing, I'm not going to speak a lot of that because in 3 weeks you will see the new models and you will see the pricing and you can answer that question for yourself, Jaime. But again, we feel very comfortable where we're at with regards to the market and we'll continue to manage it very tightly. I'm glad you asked about share gains in the United States, I couldn't be more thrilled to answer this question. A year ago, we sat here, Matt and I, Matt's first conference call, and we said that we had an issue given the shift in world currencies and the incredible competitiveness that came out of it, in particular in discounting. And we said that we were not going to discount our way out of it. We weren't going to drain the industry of profits and chase this thing. And it was going to take us some time, but we were going to spend more time understanding what we need to do and how we can compete [indiscernible] world of expanded price gaps without cheapening our brand. And now, dial forward a couple of quarters, we are there and we delivered 2 points of market share gains. So let me talk a second about those, the gains were very strong and wide. Number one, they came in all of our segments, our Touring segment, our Cruisers and our Street and Sportster segment size of motorcycle. They came in the 7 sales regions that we have in the United States. We gained share in each and every one of them. Our gains were over double the nearest competitor. When you look broadly at those share gains, what we saw is -- the biggest loser were, in aggregate, Japanese competitors. We also saw, while we had mentioned in the preamble that overall discounting was higher on a year-over-year basis, we did see the Japanese discounting be down a little bit versus a year ago and it seems to be reflecting in their market share. With that, we saw a rotation in the brand [indiscernible] discounting from the Japanese to the American brands in the second quarter, and we're seeing some of the share gains in there. Overall, Europeans market share was down a little bit, but we had some big winners and big losers in that segment. Hopefully that helps, Jaime."

And actually, we're incredibly pleased with the model year '16 products and how they drove the market globally. This is a lot of S models that we launched a year ago, basically, as well as the products we introduced during the model year. And clearly, there are a lot of constraints in this competitive environment that we're in, but our product drives customer passion, customer loyalty and sales and market share. We saw that with the shift in sales to large Cruisers, which helped us gain share. Those large Cruisers are a little lower margin than our Touring motorcycles, so that's part of our gross margin deterioration that we just spoke about on the call today. But product is a very key lever for us, it is probably one of our 4 focus areas to increase both the cadence and the impact of the product. And 2016 is a good example of both high-impact product at an increase cadence. And 2017 is going to be no different. It's a formula that's working for us and we've invested more heavily both capital and expense as part of the demand-driving shift to make sure that the product that we deliver makes a difference in the marketplace and that we do it well and we do it more rapidly.

In the 8-K that we put out, we talked about this overall transaction is neutral when you look at the present value of earnings per share, so it's a great question. Basically, here's what happened -- what happens is, in a securitization we sell off of a bunch of bonds to investors and there is a -- it goes into a trust and all the residual earnings that we get off that, we keep, because -- we keep the risk and we keep that reward. What we [indiscernible] into a slightly different market and we found an investor to buy that. And what they did is they paid us a bunch of upfront cash to buy that residual interest in the trust or those trailing earnings. We believe that the opportunity cost of the transaction that we did is about $7 million of those trailing earnings. So to do broad math we took a $9 million gain, gave up about $7 million of opportunity cost, so they would have earned about $16 million. We took $9 million today, right? So if you take and you discount over the next 7 years that $7 million that would have come in, bring it to the present value and that impact on EPS, along with the fact that because it's off-balance sheet, we have freed up equity at HDFS to maintain the same debt to equity, we've now got more equity. So HDFS wrote a check that works out to be $43 million and we bought shares back with that. And if you take that impact on EPS, they're about neutral. So the question is why did we do it if it's neutral? Number one is that once you get in the market, you don't know how the market is going to exactly respond. But there's 2 reasons that we did this: Number one, is it's an additional source of liquidity. So we're always looking for opportunities, more investors, more liquidity and this is a great opportunity. The other thing, with the additional liquidity opportunity, we also learned that we can monetize the assets on our balance sheet to some extent, and that is very important to know. So that's number one reason. Number two and the more important reason is, is one of our -- we talked about it at every conference call, a top priority of ours is to return value to our shareholders in the form of rising dividends and share repurchases. And we will look at every opportunity to do that with the caveat that we're not going to do anything to damage the long-term value of the brand or the company. This transaction fits squarely in there. There is absolutely no extra [indiscernible] in the company or anything like that. What it did is it liberated $43 million of excess cash. That excess cash was used to buy share repurchases. And even though, again, from a present value basis, we're neutral on EPS, we believe that our long-term shareholders would prefer to have, at this moment in time, more equity in our company given the historically low P/Es that we're trading at. And so they get the ownership today versus waiting over that period of time for the opportunity cost of that money."

And what we saw about a year ago, first quarter of 2015, we first noticed that those areas were declining more than other areas in the United States, obviously, driven by the depression in the oil prices. We saw that increase from a modest amount in the first quarter, increased through the second and third quarter, and it hit about 10% rate in the fourth quarter. Now we've seen that hold to 10% in the fourth quarter of last year, the first quarter of this year and the second quarter was also at 10%.

We talked in depth about our Q2 results and what we see going forward. You've all read the news release we issued this morning, John and I will bring context and perspective to those results and highlight some of the factors that are at play so you can get the best read on our outlook for Q3, the full year and beyond. 
Before John goes into the detailed financials, I'd like to comment on 2 themes: market performance and then company performance. From a market perspective, we're very pleased with the share performance in the U.S. where we gained 2 points of share in the heavyweight segment for the quarter on top of our already strong share position. As the U.S. remains highly competitive, this gain is an important validation that our initial investments to drive demand are working. Since the beginning of the year, we made investments designed that impacts customer choice and support our long-term strategy of growing our reach and impact with customers and strong returns to investors. 
Our demand driving investments are focused in 4 areas: increasing product and brand awareness, growing new ridership in the United States, increasing and enhancing brand access and accelerating the cadence and the impact of new products. Our teams across the globe launched several initiatives behind these investments with precision and effectiveness, delivering solid results in our international markets and driving the market share gains in the United States. 
Looking internationally, our retail sales were up 4.3%, driven by continued growth in Asia, Canada and Mexico, and our best ever quarter for Harley-Davidson in our EMEA region. Our investments to increase demo rides in EMEA, for example, was a major contributor to our growth in the region in Q2, nothing seals the deal better for a new customer than experiencing one of our great bikes firsthand.
In Asia, where we maintained our #1 market share. In Australia, India and Japan, we focused our investment on demo rides and growing ridership. And in the U.S., the Live Your Legend campaign and other demand-driving investments build significant relevance and helped drive a 30% increase in demo rides, so far this year, and a 40% increase in the number of students trained through the Harley-Davidson Riding Academy. There are also some real positives in the nature of retail sales and market share gains that further reinforce the strength of our work both near and long term. 
Notably, we are very pleased to have growth year-to-date in the all-important young adult segment in the United States. The young adult segment is not only important for the long term, it's the most competitive market segment in the U.S. All of these initiatives combined, represent an important long-term play as we seek to grow the sport in the U.S. and bring new customers into the brand in all of our markets. 
I'm encouraged that the actions that we've taken so far this year have enabled us to make progress on our long-term growth strategy. However, worldwide sales for the quarter were down due to significant declines in the U.S. industry, which was far weaker than expected. We expected the industry to be down in the first half of the year as we lapped industry growth in 2015 that was stimulated by the shift in currency and the resulting competitive discounting. And as we also expected, by continued weakness in the oil-dependent areas. We did not, however, expect the industry as a whole would be as soft as it is. While our share gains helped to blunt the full impact of this weak market, lackluster industry sales have had a significant impact on our results and our forward expectations. 
As a result, we're taking the prudent step to lower expected 2016 shipments. This is largely due to what we believe will be continued pressure on industry growth in the U.S., coupled with caution as we consider the potential impact of the macroeconomic uncertainty on sales globally. We remain steadfast in our commitment to keep supply in line with demand to protect the premium [indiscernible] and we believe the steps we're taking will ensure dealer inventory is in line by year-end to support the expected sales environment. 
All in, we now plan to ship fewer motorcycles for the full year and are revising our shipment guidance from 1% to 3% growth to approximately down 1% to up 1% from 2015. Our production plans and shipment expectations are intended to drive flat inventory at year-end, even with our expanded model range. These actions will have a drag on earnings for the full year. So we're revising our full year expected operating margin down 1 percentage point to 15% to 16%. Without question, we must assure inventory balance for our long-term competitiveness and profitability for both the company and our incredible dealers.
Now shifting from market to company performance. You'll see that gross margin declined in the quarter. There are a number of factors here that both John and I will address. As we've discussed in prior calls, we expected higher manufacturing costs due to the significant investments we're making to advance our flexible manufacturing strategy. These investments are complex and require discipline, planning and execution, including numerous down days, inventory bridges and careful ramp plans. The net impact can be seen in changes to gross margin, shipments and inventory patterns in the second quarter, and the impact will continue in Q3 as we ramp back to full production. The investments are part of the manufacturing flexibility strategy that will enhance cost-effective flexibility now at our Kansas City plant.
Another factor in gross margin performance in Q2 is the impact of volume and mix adjustments we made to capture the demand lift from the Cruiser success we experienced in the quarter, while also adjusting downward the total volume in the softer-than-expected U.S. industry. The U.S. industry turned swiftly in the second quarter. We responded with discipline and commitment in an effort to keep supply in line with demand and these actions also impacted our gross margin in the quarter. While difficult, these actions were necessary to set us up for success for our model year launch and also for 2017 and beyond. 
And speaking of new products and our new model launch, I'm incredibly excited about our lineup which we will unveil to our global dealer network at the end of August. We will add to the stable of products driving our current success and we've got some incredible products in the pipeline for 2018, our 115th anniversary and beyond. 
Before I turn it over to John, I want to take this opportunity to thank everyone associated with this great company: employees, dealers, suppliers and our passionate riders. I'm proud of our team and all the work that's being done at Harley-Davidson. We're in challenging times, political, economic and cultural forces are all working against confidence and security for people everywhere in the world. Everyone in our company is aware and attuned to what we need to do. We have 113-year history of challenges we stood up to and faced down. 
The power of personal freedom for our riders is stronger than ever take and we all aim to deliver for them. We understand the intense need to manage through these challenges effectively and deliver results. We are stewards of this incredible brand and of your investment, and we do not take that responsibility lightly. Without question, driving demand, growing the business and delivering strong returns are top priorities for all of us at Harley-Davidson, and we're focused every day on delivering for our riders near term and long term in order to do so.
With that, I'm going to turn it over to John. Thank you."

Today I'll provide additional insight around our second quarter financial results found in our press release and supporting [indiscernible] starting on Slide 9. During the quarter, revenue was $1.86 billion, net i",2545,"Thanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. Today I'll provide additional insight around our second quarter financial results found in our press release and supporting [indiscernible] starting on Slide 9. During the quarter, revenue was $1.86 billion, net income was $280.4 million and diluted earnings per share were $1.55. Operating income from the motorcycles segment was down 15.2% from last year's second quarter. Segment revenue was up 1.2% in the quarter, behind a 3.5% increase in motorcycles shipments. Gross margin as a percent of revenue decreased versus prior year as a result of unfavorable product mix and currency exchange in addition to higher year-over-year manufacturing cost. 
SG&A was also up in the quarter as we increased our demand driving and product development investments. Operating income as a percent of revenue in Q2 was 19.3%. At HDFS, operating income was up 9.4% year-over-year in part driven by a gain related to a full securitization. The quarter also reflected higher corporate interests expense resulting from our 2015 recapitalization and lower [ph] effective tax rate. Despite the challenging conditions we continue to face, we remain focused on driving demand and delivering strong margins and strong returns over the long term.
On Slide 10, you'll see worldwide retail sales of new Harley-Davidson Motorcycles in Q2 were down 1.9% versus prior year. International retail sales were up year-over-year, while the U.S. retail sales were lower than expected on surprisingly weak industry results. Despite the ongoing challenging macroeconomic and motorcycle industry conditions, we were encouraged with our share gains in the second quarter. Our ability to grow internationally and partially offset the industry headwinds in the United States, reinforces our intensified focus on driving demand and enhancing our strong brand.
Our increased investments in driving demand and product development drove positive market share results in the U.S. and in Europe during the first half of this year. In addition, the positive response to our new 2016 motorcycle models continued during the second quarter. As Matt noted, we continue to be committed and steadfast in our resolve to manage supply in line with demand. Given the poor U.S. industry retail sales in Q2 and softness expected into the second half of 2016, we are taking steps to adjust retail inventory in the U.S. and now expect year-end retail inventory in the U.S. to be in line with prior year versus our previous expectation to grow year-end retail inventory. Considering our desire to reduce year-end U.S. retail inventory in the face of soft U.S. industry sales and the uncertainty resulting from global macroeconomic challenges, we have lowered our full year shipment expectations. 
Let's take a closer look at the U.S on Slide 11. Q2 retail sales in the U.S. were down 5.2% versus prior year, behind weak U.S. industry sales. The impact of the weak U.S. industry on our sales was partially offset by strong gains in market share. The U.S. industry was down 8.6% during the quarter. While we expected the industry to be down in the first half of 2016, we did not expect the extent to which the second quarter declined, especially considering the high level of competitive discounting that continued during the quarter. We believe the industry was down due to the following 2 factors: lapping strong year-ago industry growth driven by the onset of aggressive competitive discounting in the year-ago period and weak sales in oil-dependent areas.
While the industry lagged our expectations, we're encouraged with our Q2 market share of 49.5% in the U.S., which was up a strong 2.0 percentage points. We believe our second quarter market share gains were driven by our demand driving investments focused on growing product awareness and growing ridership in the U.S. and a strong reception to our new 2016 motorcycle models. While our competitors continue to engage in levels of discounting similar to the first quarter and at more aggressive levels than in last year's second quarter, we were very pleased that we were able to increase market share in the U.S. by brand enhancing actions. 
U.S. retail inventory was up at the end of the second quarter driven by 3 factors: first, we offered 5 incremental models versus the prior year; second, inventory was up as we shipped all model year 2016 motorcycles in advance of the Q3 ERP implementation; and also as a result of lower-than-expected Q2 retail sales.
On Slide 12, you'll see retail sales in our international markets were up in Q2. All regions were up except Latin America, which was impacted by weakness in Brazil. Excluding Brazil, international markets were up 5.6%. During the quarter, EMEA retail sales were up 8.2% behind a great reception to our new 2016 motorcycle models and increased demand driving investments. This quarter's strong retail sales also benefited from lapping prior year retail sales -- lower prior year retail sales. Market share in EMEA was up 0.3% [indiscernible] basis. Asia Pacific retail sales growth slowed as we lapped very strong year-ago retail sales comps of up nearly 17% and as we temporarily exited the market in Indonesia earlier this year in order to establish a dealer network -- a new dealer network and improve customer experience. 
Latin America retail sales trends improved significantly from last quarter behind continued strong growth in Mexico. Weakness in Brazil drove overall sales declines in the region as sales continue to be impacted by a challenging economy and consumer uncertainty. In response to the nearly 50% devaluation of the Brazilian real last year, we raised model year 2016 prices over 20% to improve profitability per motorcycle. We continue to expect retail sales to be down for the year. 
Finally, retail sales in Canada were up 2.0% in the second quarter. We believe the market continue to respond well to the change to a direct distribution model and pricing adjustments that were made at the model year. Part of our strategic focus on increasing brand access, we plan to continue to expand our international distribution. We added 6 new international dealerships in the second quarter. 
On Slide 13, you'll see wholesale shipments of Harley-Davidson Motorcycles in the quarter were slightly above our guidance as we shipped ahead of the Q3 ERP implementation. As a result, U.S. shipments and retail inventory increased during the quarter and company inventory fell below prior year levels. Our production plants were idled earlier this month and overall production was down about 30% in July as we successfully implemented our ERP system in Kansas City. We began model year '17 production on schedule. Second quarter shipment mix reflected strong demand for our new 2016 Cruiser and Sportster motorcycles. 
On Slide 14, you'll see revenue for the motorcycles and related product segment was up in the second quarter behind a 3.5% increase in motorcycles shipment. Revenue in the quarter was unfavorably impacted [indiscernible] significant shift in mix to our Cruiser and Sportster motorcycles and slightly unfavorable currency exchange, partially offset by higher pricing. As a result, average motorcycle revenue per unit was down for the quarter.
On Slide 15 you'll see gross margin as a percent of revenue in the quarter was down 2.8 percentage points versus last year. While we expected Q2 gross margin to be unfavorable driven by mix, currency and manufacturing, the impacts from mix and manufacturing were more unfavorable than we anticipated. During the quarter, customer demand for our Cruisers and Sportsters exceeded our expectations, which led to higher-than-expected mix unfavorability of $17.6 million. As we expected, foreign currency exchange was negative as we lapped significant hedge gains in last year's second quarter, and as we have lower revenues behind a slightly stronger U.S. dollar.
Manufacturing expenses were higher-than-expected, unfavorable $36.1 million during the second quarter. We did expect significant unfavorable variances largely driven by startup cost related to the implementation of our ERP system in Kansas City and cost associated with significant plant retooling. However, as Matt explained, plant efficiencies were lower than expected due to lower production given soft sales in Q2 and other plant disruptions. It is important to note, the increase in manufacturing costs that we have experienced in this first half of this year are largely temporary in nature and we would not expect the majority of these costs to recur in 2017. Looking forward, we continue to expect Q3 manufacturing expense to be unfavorable behind lower absorption and higher year-over-year startup cost. Conversely, we expect manufacturing favorability in Q4.
On Slide 16, operating margin as a percent of revenue for the second quarter was 19.3%, down compared to last year's second quarter. Operating margin was unfavorably impacted by lower gross margin as well as higher [ph] SG&A resulting from both our increased investments in driving demand and product development, and from costs associated with managing our Canadian operations which we acquired in August of 2015. For the full year, we expect SG&A to be near year-ago levels. We remain intensely focused on a cost structure that will enable growth and continuous improvement to drive our business to be stronger, more flexible and more profitable.
Moving on to HDFS on Slide 16 (sic)[17]. During the quarter HDFS' operating profit increased $7.7 million or 9.4% compared to last year. The primary factors impacting second quarter results were: First, net interest income was up over the year by $5.0 million. This increase was driven by higher receivables, partially offset by higher borrowing cost and lower yields, due in part to the 2015 low interest rate promotional activity. Second, the provision for retail motorcycle loan losses increased [ph] over prior year by $8.2 million driven by higher retail credit losses and an associated increase in the allowance. It is important to note that second quarter provision increase was significantly less than what we experienced in the first quarter of 2016. 
Finally, you will see on the slide a gain on full securitization. This represents a full securitization in which we sold retail finance receivables with a principal balance of approximately $302 million, along with all the residual financial interest in those receivables. Because we have no ownership interest in the receivables, the transaction was recorded as a sale which, in this case, resulted in a gain of $9.3 million.
HDFS' operational results are summarized on Slide 18. For the quarter, originations were down 3.9% compared to last year, but HDFS' share of U.S. new retail motorcycle loans -- motorcycle sales increased to 63.4%. Year-to-date loan originations were comprised of approximately 80% prime loans and 20% subprime. As a predominant industry leader to subprime customers, these originations continue to represent a significant number of retail sales to the company at very attractive returns. 
At the end of the second quarter, we had $419 million of cash and cash equivalents at HDFS. In addition, HDFS had $1.02 billion of available liquidity through bank credit and conduit facilities. HDFS also paid a $43 million dividend to H-D Inc. during the quarter, which I will talk more about in a moment. 
On Slide 19, you'll see the 30-day delinquency rate for retail motorcycle loan receivables that remained on our balance sheet was 3.16% or 45 basis points higher than Q2 2015. 14 basis points of the increase represents a change in the mix of the portfolio after the securitization of 302 [indiscernible] prime receivables. The delinquency rate on a managed basis, including those loans sold in full securitization, was still 31 basis points higher than the prior year due in part to deterioration in oil-dependent areas. Despite the increase, delinquencies remain near historically low levels.
The annualized retail credit losses for receivables that remain on our balance sheet was 1.50% or 42 basis points higher than Q2 2015. On a managed basis, the credit loss rate was 1.49%. The increase was a result of higher losses on loans in oil-dependent areas, normalizing loan performance and lower used bike values at auction. During the quarter, HDFS continued to maintain a strong liquidity position and continued strong profitability to the company. 
The remaining Harley-Davidson Inc. financial results are summarized on Slide 20. A few things to note: operating cash was down from last year driven by lower net [ph] income, higher working capital and higher net wholesale lending. And year-to-date tax rate was 32.7%, which was lower than last year's tax rate behind the successful closure of various tax audits allowing us to reduce our tax reserves. The company has and intends to continue to maintain a minimum of 12 months of projected liquidity needs in cash and/or committed credit facilities. 
Returning value to our shareholders is a top priority. We expect to return all excess cash to our shareholders in the form of increasing dividends and continued share repurchases. On Slide 21, you will see we did both during the second quarter. In addition, as I mentioned earlier, during the quarter we completed a full securitization. Because we sold all ownership interest in the receivables, the receivables and any corresponding debt are not recorded on HDFS' balance sheet. Consequently, this allowed HDFS to pay a dividend of H-D Inc. of [indiscernible] without impacting HDFS' debt-to-equity ratio. We used the dividend to repurchase shares under the existing share repurchase authorizations. While we believe the EPS impact was neutral, the shareholder repurchase associated with the full securitization increased our shareholders' ownership in the company at a time when our stock is trading at historically low P/E. This was the first time HDFS or we believe any other manufacturer has utilized this market. Actions such as this demonstrate our commitment to explore avenues to improve funding costs, diversify funding sources and return excess cash to our shareholders. We will continue to look for additional opportunities to return excess cash to our shareholders without damaging the long-term value of the company or the brand. 
On Slide 22, you'll see our overall expectations for 2016. We now expect to ship 264,000 to 269,000 motorcycles, which is approximately down 1% to up 1% over last year. We expect third quarter shipments to be approximately flat to down 9% versus last year's third quarter. For the full year 2016, we now expect operating margin for the Motorcycles segment to be approximately 15% to 16%. We are lowering our expectations by approximately 1 percentage point due to lost absorption on lower production, unfavorable mix and higher manufacturing expense. Finally, we now expect our full year 2016 effective tax rate will be approximately 33%. Our 2016 directional expectations for gross margin, SG&A, HDFS and capital expenditures are unchanged and noted on this slide.
While the weak U.S. industry and continued intense competition drove less than expected retail sales during the quarter, we are encouraged by the positive market share results from our demand-driving investments and new models. We are also pleased to see international retail sales growth despite macroeconomic headwinds. We continue to make necessary decisions to support a prudent retail inventory position and to protect our strong brand and profitability into the future. We are maintaining our intense focus on maximizing shareholder value by returning cash to our shareholders through share repurchases and increased dividends. We will continue to navigate through the challenging environment and are making investments to drive demand and deliver stronger -- and deliver strong margins and strong returns over the long term.
Now let's take your questions."

We have sort of numbers associated with that in particular. Also, the significant growth last year, as I mentioned, and the corresponding comp for this year, we knew that, that was going to create pressure. The forecast for the industry growth were kind of in that 2% range. And clearly, it's not materializing that way. And so we're looking at it very carefully. Investing in new products and awareness and rider training and focusing our efforts on what we can do to not only grow share, but grow our sales [indiscernible] primarily doing that through growing the sport.

Do you think that you're positioned appropriately for the declining industry that seemed to surprise you in the quarter?

Retail inventory was up 20 -- or I'm sorry, 8,300 units [ph] largely driven by 5 incremental models. On average, our dealers have about 2 1/2 of each of those models in their dealerships and that adds up actually to over 8,000 units, but we also wanted to ship in ahead of the ERP implementation. And so when we look at second quarter and you also -- you look at the retail side, which is up 8,300 units, our company-owned inventory is down quite a bit. And when you net those 2, we're basically up in the second quarter, 1/3 of July's production and that's what we expect to lose. So to answer your question, as we exit the first half, we're right in line with what we expected in terms of inventory on a year-over-year basis, again, to compensate for the lost production in July. When we extend that forward, we were expecting inventories and the U.S. to grow behind additional models. And given that environment that you have mentioned and then certainly that we experienced in the second quarter, we are more cautious and want to be more prudent from an inventory perspective. And with that, we do not expect inventories to grow [indiscernible] in the United States at year-end. And yes, we absolutely feel that is the appropriate level of inventory given the soft retail sales that we're seeing in the first half of this year."

And you can read from that, that we expect and we believe is embedded in our numbers, the industry to continue to be soft for the balance of the year and probably into next year as well. And so we feel we're adequately provisioning and preparing for that. But -- and I guess, also, with a healthy dose of realism, given what we saw, that was quite surprising here in the second quarter.

When we look at the securitization that we recently did about a month ago, there were 2 changes in that securitization from normal securitizations that we execute. [indiscernible] pointed out is that they were made up of 100% of prime receivables. And the second one is we sold the residual interest that allowed us to classify it off-balance sheet. Your question centers around the prime aspect of it. So historically, we've sold securitizations that resemble our originations, about 80% prime and 20% subprime. I've heard all kinds of speculation as to why we did 100% prime, so let me clear that up, some of that speculation has been is we can't sell subprime into the market and that is absolute untruth nonsense. So for over a decade we've been selling a mix of prime and subprime into very robust demand in the marketplace and that has not changed at all. What has changed over the last couple of securitization is that our spreads have widened on the securitization to our benchmark. Our benchmark is prime model and there is no one else that does a mixture of securitizations like we do, so we benchmark the prime model. What we have noticed over the last couple securitizations, the spreads widening out a little bit. And so the best way to tether them back was to get a comparable securitization to our benchmark. And with that, we saw extreme tightening of those margins or of those spreads to prime model. So we as we look forward, whether we decide to do all-prime or subprime and prime, kind of the tethering of the investment community to that spread against prime has been very important us and will pay dividends as we move into the future. So that's why we move forward with the prime securitization. Your second question is with regards to Brexit. At this point, there is not enough information, not enough time has gone by to understand the impact of Brexit. I think what we are very certain of is that Brexit does not provide any benefit to retail sales or consumer confidence in Europe. And I think this is what Matt talked about a little [indiscernible] is I'd put it into a broader bucket instead of just Brexit as overall consumer confidence driven by geopolitical concerns or macroeconomic concerns. We're very excited about the momentum that we have in our European business. As you can see, for the quarter, it was up quite significantly.

I think Matt mentioned it in his upfront remarks, is the focus of our European team on getting people on our motorcycles. The demos that they're doing has driven a tremendous amount of volume in that market. Also, our product offering, you got to remember that Europe has got a better mix of Cruisers, the Touring, than we have in the United States. The product is just as well received in Europe as it is here in the United States. That is certainly helping to drive some of the performance. And we expect the team there to continue to focus on getting people exposed to our motorcycles and we couldn't, again, be more pleased with where we're at in growing market share. Again, in just as a competitive market as the United States, not driven by price [indiscernible] in Europe, by tremendous addition of the lower displacement motorcycles and again we're doing well in gaining share and robustly growing market in Europe. The second comment is with regards to market rumors surrounding our stock and a potential private equity investor, we don't comment on any rumors -- any stock market rumors.

When you look at the second quarter, we did ship a little bit over the high end of our guidance. And at the same time, during the quarter, we were cutting production quite dramatically and our retail sales were down. So you're saying is, can you help me out -- help me understand this. So basically, as we got toward the end of the quarter, we had all the product made and that was either in retail or in our company-owned inventory. And typically, we have a bit of company-owned inventory in the United States that facilitates the flow and the orderly shipments of motorcycles. We made the decision to ship it all out prior [indiscernible] the period. The reason we did that is in the very outside chance that we had any issues with the ERP system. If they're in our system, we may have trouble getting them shipped. So it was just a simple, after derisking of the overall ERP implementation. I couldn't be more pleased to say that the team did a fantastic job. Everything came up as expected. The ramp plans are on plan and everything is moving forward. But James, it was simply that is -- we could take a little bit more risk out of it. Now having said that, overall inventories, as I mentioned, I think to Felicia, overall inventories didn't change. But we had company owned inventories lower on a year-over-year basis and we put a little bit more into the field. So overall inventories are where we would have expected them, despite the lower unexpected sales based on our production reductions and lower company-owned inventory. The second question that you asked is with regards to our revised guidance, which is down 1% to up 1%. We go through a robust process looking at all factors and everything that we know in the marketplace, which is centered around new dealerships coming up in the international markets, we'll have more dealers in the back half -- new dealers in the back half than the front half. We look at the performance of outreach in the United States, that's performing extremely well. We look at the investments that we've made in the demand-driving activities, what we expect to come out of those. And certainly and most importantly, we look at the new models that we're going to be launching here in 3 to 4 weeks, and we couldn't be more excited about that. You take all those together, James, we are very confident that we are going to ship from 264,000 to 269,000 motorcycles for 2016."

We have got tremendous resolve and we will manage the inventory at appropriate levels. And now with regards to pricing, I'm not going to speak a lot of that because in 3 weeks you will see the new models and you will see the pricing and you can answer that question for yourself, Jaime. But again, we feel very comfortable where we're at with regards to the market and we'll continue to manage it very tightly. I'm glad you asked about share gains in the United States, I couldn't be more thrilled to answer this question. A year ago, we sat here, Matt and I, Matt's first conference call, and we said that we had an issue given the shift in world currencies and the incredible competitiveness that came out of it, in particular in discounting. And we said that we were not going to discount our way out of it. We weren't going to drain the industry of profits and chase this thing. And it was going to take us some time, but we were going to spend more time understanding what we need to do and how we can compete [indiscernible] world of expanded price gaps without cheapening our brand. And now, dial forward a couple of quarters, we are there and we delivered 2 points of market share gains. So let me talk a second about those, the gains were very strong and wide. Number one, they came in all of our segments, our Touring segment, our Cruisers and our Street and Sportster segment size of motorcycle. They came in the 7 sales regions that we have in the United States. We gained share in each and every one of them. Our gains were over double the nearest competitor. When you look broadly at those share gains, what we saw is -- the biggest loser were, in aggregate, Japanese competitors. We also saw, while we had mentioned in the preamble that overall discounting was higher on a year-over-year basis, we did see the Japanese discounting be down a little bit versus a year ago and it seems to be reflecting in their market share. With that, we saw a rotation in the brand [indiscernible] discounting from the Japanese to the American brands in the second quarter, and we're seeing some of the share gains in there. Overall, Europeans market share was down a little bit, but we had some big winners and big losers in that segment. Hopefully that helps, Jaime."

This is a lot of S models that we launched a year ago, basically, as well as the products we introduced during the model year. And clearly, there are a lot of constraints in this competitive environment that we're in, but our product drives customer passion, customer loyalty and sales and market share. We saw that with the shift in sales to large Cruisers, which helped us gain share. Those large Cruisers are a little lower margin than our Touring motorcycles, so that's part of our gross margin deterioration that we just spoke about on the call today. But product is a very key lever for us, it is probably one of our 4 focus areas to increase both the cadence and the impact of the product. And 2016 is a good example of both high-impact product at an increase cadence. And 2017 is going to be no different.

In the 8-K that we put out, we talked about this overall transaction is neutral when you look at the present value of earnings per share, so it's a great question. Basically, here's what happened -- what happens is, in a securitization we sell off of a bunch of bonds to investors and there is a -- it goes into a trust and all the residual earnings that we get off that, we keep, because -- we keep the risk and we keep that reward. What we [indiscernible] into a slightly different market and we found an investor to buy that. And what they did is they paid us a bunch of upfront cash to buy that residual interest in the trust or those trailing earnings. We believe that the opportunity cost of the transaction that we did is about $7 million of those trailing earnings. So to do broad math we took a $9 million gain, gave up about $7 million of opportunity cost, so they would have earned about $16 million. We took $9 million today, right? So if you take and you discount over the next 7 years that $7 million that would have come in, bring it to the present value and that impact on EPS, along with the fact that because it's off-balance sheet, we have freed up equity at HDFS to maintain the same debt to equity, we've now got more equity. So HDFS wrote a check that works out to be $43 million and we bought shares back with that. And if you take that impact on EPS, they're about neutral. So the question is why did we do it if it's neutral? Number one is that once you get in the market, you don't know how the market is going to exactly respond. But there's 2 reasons that we did this: Number one, is it's an additional source of liquidity. So we're always looking for opportunities, more investors, more liquidity and this is a great opportunity. The other thing, with the additional liquidity opportunity, we also learned that we can monetize the assets on our balance sheet to some extent, and that is very important to know. So that's number one reason. Number two and the more important reason is, is one of our -- we talked about it at every conference call, a top priority of ours is to return value to our shareholders in the form of rising dividends and share repurchases. And we will look at every opportunity to do that with the caveat that we're not going to do anything to damage the long-term value of the brand or the company. This transaction fits squarely in there. There is absolutely no extra [indiscernible] in the company or anything like that. What it did is it liberated $43 million of excess cash. That excess cash was used to buy share repurchases. And even though, again, from a present value basis, we're neutral on EPS, we believe that our long-term shareholders would prefer to have, at this moment in time, more equity in our company given the historically low P/Es that we're trading at. And so they get the ownership today versus waiting over that period of time for the opportunity cost of that money."

We saw that increase from a modest amount in the first quarter, increased through the second and third quarter, and it hit about 10% rate in the fourth quarter. Now we've seen that hold to 10% in the fourth quarter of last year, the first quarter of this year and the second quarter was also at 10%.

on the riHarley-Davidson's place in it. We're focused on influencing customer choice and growing our reach and impact with customers, all with delivering strong returns to investors. We continue to be pleased with our market share performance, given the fierce competition in the U.S. market and ongoing global macroeconomic challenges. Third quarter market share was essentially flat in the U.S., as we maintained our strong leadership with over half of the 601+CC market. Our overall market share performance in the U.S. and gains in other key global markets like Australia and Japan provides strong affirmation of the progress we're making with our investments to drive demand through awareness, access, increased ridership and bold new products to reach more people in more places. 
An absolute highlight of the quarter was the reaction around the world to our model year 2017 new products. One of our key areas of focus is to accelerate the cadence and impact of new products, and in late August, we delivered. We could not be more pleased with the launch of and response to our model year 2017 lineup. Most notably, we've had an extremely positive reaction to our Milwaukee-Eight engine, which we debuted on all of our 3 motorcycles in conjunction with a redesigned upgraded suspension.
We know what our riders want, and we delivered with a big step forward that accentuates everything we're known for, a powertrain and chassis package with innovative technologies that provide more torque, more horsepower, greater comfort and enhanced look, sound and feel. The feedback from riders, dealers and industry experts alike has been tremendous.  All it takes is one ride to feel the power the Milwaukee-Eight engine brings to our riders and to the company going forward. The significance of the Milwaukee-Eight engine is already evident.  In September, we saw touring sales in the U.S. increase by double digits, along with increased demand for test rides. Given initial results, we're confident the entire lineup will drive our retail sales for the remainder of 2016 and position us well heading into the spring riding season and beyond.
As we indicated on our last call, we will continue to manage supply in line with demand. We maintained production ahead of retail in the third quarter in order to support the initial dealer fill of model year '17 motorcycles, and we plan to reduce production in the fourth quarter to finish the year with flat year-over-year U.S. retail inventory.
As we look ahead, continued softness in the U.S. industry is a clear area of concern, and we're taking further steps to be sure we're positioned appropriately. In Q4, we'll be streamlining our organization to execute our demand-driving strategies with increased focus, alignment and agility. John will provide the financial details around these steps momentarily. Our strategy to invest in driving demand around the world is unchanged, and we're steadfast in our commitment to deliver strong returns to investors while doing so.
Harley-Davidson has been in the motorcycle business continuously since 1903. And during that time, we've experienced all types of economic, market and industry ups and downs, and today is no different. We believe our strategy is sound, and every decision we make is tied to driving it forward and delivering for all of our stakeholders. We're intensely focused on gaining and securing market share in the 90-plus markets we're in and doing so profitability. The launch of the Milwaukee-Eight-powered touring motorcycles is one powerful example of how we lead by delivering for our passionate and loyal riders. We're also investing to reach new riders by growing distribution internationally and by training new riders right here in United States. Through September, we've trained over 52,000 riders this year through the Harley-Davidson Riding Academy in the United States, demonstrating that we're building momentum in bringing new riders into our sport and brand through this fantastic competitive advantage.
During the quarter, we opened 9 new international dealerships and a total of 20 year-to-date. In the fourth quarter, we expect to add another 16 new dealers and reenter Indonesia, all part of our strategy to increase access to our sport and brand by adding 150 to 200 new dealerships internationally by 2020. 
Last week, I was with our Asia-Pacific team in China and Singapore. I was able to see the team in action as they continue their efforts to grow our reach and impact in these important markets. I was also privileged to engage with passionate dealers who are investing with confidence in Harley-Davidson's future. It's in these experiences that I'm reminded of what incredible strength we have in our people and in our worldwide dealer network. Looking forward, we acknowledge that economics and political uncertainty weighs on the minds of consumers in the U.S. and in some of the other markets where Harley-Davidson competes. As the industry leader, we believe we're best positioned to strengthen the sport of motorcycling over time. We'll continue to manage the company and brand and will not compromise by taking shortcuts that would diminish customer loyalty and passion or sacrifice our strong company fundamentals.
We'll lean into our strengths in product development and our unrivaled connection to our riders to continue to bring innovative products to market that drive engagement and participation in our brand worldwide. The new Milwaukee-Eight engine is a powerful example, but it's just one example of the strength of our product plan for 2017 and beyond. Harley-Davidson gives people a way to experience and express their own personal freedom. This is our purpose, and it's a powerful motivator for every one of us associated with this brand. You have our commitment to build on our incredible strength and deliver strong returns on your investments in us. 
With that, I'll turn it over to John. Thank you."

Net income w",2109,"Thanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. Today I'll provide additional insight around our third quarter financial results found in our press release and supporting slides. 
Starting on Slide 8. During the quarter, revenue was $1.27 billion. Net income was $114.1 million, and diluted earnings per share were $0.64. We -- as we anticipated, operating income from the motorcycle segment was down 23.9% from last year's third quarter. Segment revenue was down 4.3% in the quarter behind a 9.1% decrease in motorcycle shipments. Gross margin as a percent of revenue decreased versus prior year as a result of higher year-over-year manufacturing cost. SG&A was up in the quarter, as we increased our demand driving in product development investments. Operating income as a percent of revenue in Q3 was 10.0%.
At HDFS, operating income was down 4.6% year-over-year. We remain focused on driving demand and delivering strong margins and strong returns over the long term as we continue to navigate through the ongoing challenging conditions. 
Q3 worldwide retail sales of new Harley-Davidson motorcycles are summarized on Slide 9. Retail sales in international markets were up modestly. U.S. industry slowdown continued, driving Harley-Davidson retail sales down 7.1% in the U.S. and down 4.5% on a worldwide basis. Our increased investments in driving demand and product innovation are mitigating the effects of the intense global competitive environment, including the expanded price gaps to the competition in the U.S. and the impact of new product introductions. This is no more evident than with the overwhelmingly positive response to our model year 2017 motorcycles featuring the Milwaukee-Eight engine. Our new products drove significantly improved U.S. retail sales and market share in September. We also saw positive retail momentum in EMEA. And in Asia-Pacific, we are encouraged by the initial customer response as the 2017 models began arriving at the end of the quarter. 
Let's take a closer look at U.S. sales on Slide 10. Q3 retail sales in the U.S. were down behind continued weak industry results. We believe the industry continues to be impacted by lapping year-ago industry growth, driven by aggressive competitive discounting; weak sales in oil-dependent areas; and softer year-over-year used bike values across the industry. While the overall industry performance is disappointing, we are encouraged with our ongoing market share stability. Our Q3 share of 601+CC market was largely flat; however, our share in the month of September was up a strong 3.2 percentage points. Our year-to-date market share was up 0.8 percentage points to 50.8%. We believe our market share was driven by our demand-driving investments focused on growing product awareness and ridership in the U.S. and the fantastic response to our new 2017 model motorcycles featuring the Milwaukee-Eight engine.
While our competitors continue to engage in levels of discounting comparable to last year's third quarter, we are very pleased that we were able to grow our year-to-date market share in the U.S. with our brand-enhancing actions and our new innovative motorcycles.
In Q3, we completed the initial dealer fill of our 2017 model year motorcycles. This combined with weak retail sales for most of the summer drove higher than desired U.S. retail inventories at the end of the quarter. We are committed to our strategy to aggressively manage supply in line with demand and plan to reduce production in the fourth quarter in order to end the year with U.S. retail inventory flat to prior year.
On Slide 11, you'll see retail sales in our international markets were up 1.0% in Q3. During the quarter, EMEA retail sales were up 1.9%. The Milwaukee-Eight engine has received a great perception and provided a lift to retail sales in the month of September in the region. EMEA year-to-date market share was 10.3%, largely flat to prior year. Asia-Pacific retail sales were up modestly from prior year, driven by strong growth in Japan and Australia. We expect growth in the Asia-Pacific region to accelerate in Q4 behind improving availability of our 2017 model year motorcycles, the planned opening of approximately 11 new dealerships and the reopening of several dealerships in Indonesia, which were exited at the beginning of the year. Retail sales in Latin America were down in the quarter, driven by declines in Brazil.  Brazil's retail sales continued to be impacted by a slowing economy, consumer uncertainty and very aggressive price competition. In Q1, we increased model year 2016 motorcycle prices by approximately 23% in response to the devaluation of the real. 
Finally, retail sales growth in Canada continued in the third quarter, up 4.3% year-over-year. To support our strategic focus on increasing brand access, we plan to continue to expand our international distribution. 
On Slide 12, you'll see wholesale shipments of Harley-Davidson motorcycles in the quarter were down 9.1%, within our shipment guidance range.  Third quarter shipment mix was skewed toward touring, reflecting our investment in new 2017 motorcycles featuring the Milwaukee-Eight engine. 
On Slide 13, you'll see revenue for the motorcycles and related product segment was down in the third quarter behind a weak U.S. retail industry and our corresponding decrease in year-over-year motorcycles shipments. Revenue in the quarter was favorably impacted by currency exchange, higher pricing and mix. As a result, the average motorcycle revenue per unit was up $1,035 for the quarter. Wholesale and MSRP weighted average pricing for our new 2017 model year motorcycles increased by approximately 2 1/4%. After adjusting for the cost of new content, pricing net of cost increased approximately 1 1/4 percentage points expressed as a percent of revenue. Please note that these percent increases are more favorable than the estimates we included in the new model launch video in August. Parts and accessories revenue was down behind lower motorcycle shipments and retail sales during the quarter. General Merchandise revenue was also down, driven by lower sales of sportswear and riding gear. 
Our gross margin review is on Slide 14. As expected, Q3 gross margin was unfavorable, driven by higher manufacturing costs, partially offset by favorable price, mix and raw materials. Additionally, currency exchange was favorable for the first time in 8 quarters, driven by higher revenues behind a slightly weaker U.S. dollar. Manufacturing costs were unfavorable by $18.7 million during the quarter. We expected significant unfavorable variances in manufacturing, largely driven by costs related to both the implementation of our ERP system in Kansas City and the launch of the new Milwaukee-Eight engine. We are also -- we also expect the loss absorption behind lower production during the quarter, as we implemented these 2 very successful programs.  Looking forward, we expect Q4 manufacturing cost to be favorable as we return to normal operations. Over the long term, we will continue to execute our strategies, investing in the future of our brand in the sport or motorcycling globally while delivering strong margins. 
On Slide 15, operating margin as a percent of revenue for the quarter was 10.0%, down compared to last year's third quarter. Operating margin was impacted by lower gross margin as well as higher SG&A, as we increased our investments in demand driving and product development. We remain intensely focused on a cost structure that will enable profitable growth and continuous improvement to drive our business to be stronger, more flexible and more profitable. 
Moving on to HDFS on Slide 16. During the quarter, HDFS' operating profit decreased $3.4 million or 4.6% compared to last year. The primary factors impacting third quarter results were: first, net interest income was up over prior year by $2.5 million. This increase was driven by higher receivables, partially offset by higher borrowing cost. Second, the provision for retail motorcycle loan losses increased over prior year by $10.1 million, driven by higher retail credit losses and associated increase in the allowance. 
HDFS' operational results are summarized on Slide 17. For the quarter, originations were down 10.2% compared to last year. HDFS' share of new -- of U.S. new retail sales were strong at 64.3%, yet down 5 percentage points as we left the impact of last year's low rate finance offers. Year-to-date loan originations were comprised of approximately 80% prime loans and 20% subprime. As a predominant industry lender to subprime customers, these originations continue to represent a significant number of retail sales to the company at very attractive returns. At the end of the quarter, we had $351.4 million of cash and cash equivalents at HDFS. In addition, HDFS had $983.7 million of available liquidity through bank credit and conduit facilities.
On Slide 18, you'll see 30-day delinquency rate for retail motorcycle loan receivables on our balance sheet was 3.61% or 45 basis points higher than Q3 2015. 12 basis points of the increase represents a change in mix of the portfolio after the Q2 full securitization of prime receivables. The delinquency rate on a managed basis, including those loans that were part of the full securitization, was 33 basis points higher than in the prior year, due in part to deterioration in oil-dependent areas and rising delinquencies across the portfolio, which is consistent with industry trends. The annualized credit loss rate for receivables on our balance sheet was 1.59% or 40 basis points higher than Q3 2015. On a managed basis, credit loss rate was 1.57%. The increase was the result of higher losses on loans in oil-dependent areas, normalizing loan performance and lower used bike values at auction. It is important to note that while both delinquencies and credit loss rates were up versus prior year, the rate of increase has remained constant over the last few quarters. During the quarter, HDFS continued to maintain a strong liquidity position and contributed strong profitability to the company. 
The remaining Harley-Davidson, Inc. financial results are summarized on Slide 19. A few things to note. Operating cash was down from last year, driven primarily by lower year-to-date net income. And year-to-date tax rate was 32.9%, which was lower than last year's tax rate behind the successful closure of various tax audits in Q2. The company has and intends to continue to maintain a minimum of 12 months of projected liquidity needs in cash and/or committed credit facilities.
Returning value to our shareholders is a top priority. We expect to return all excess cash to our shareholders in the form of increasing dividends and continued share repurchases. On Slide 20, you'll see we did both during the third quarter. We will continue to look for additional opportunities to maximize shareholder value by returning excess cash to our shareholders without damaging the long-term value of the company or the brand.
On Slide 21, you'll see our overall expectations for 2016. For the remainder of the year, we're confident in our shipment guidance of 264,000 to 269,000 motorcycles or approximately down 1% to up 1%. We are very encouraged by the momentum we experienced in the U.S. in September when our new model year 2017 motorcycles drove an increase in retail sales of approximately 5% and a more than 3 percentage point increase in market share.
We expect worldwide retail sales growth in the fourth quarter, driven by significant demand for our Milwaukee-Eight engine, our increased demand-driving investments, expansion of the international dealer network and lapping last year's U.S. industry decline of 3.8%.
During the quarter, we expect to ship between 44,200 and 49,200 motorcycles, down approximately 8% to up approximately 2%. As mentioned earlier, we expect to end the year with U.S. retail inventory being flat to prior year. Recognizing the slower industry growth that we are continuing to experience in the U.S., we will be streamlining our operations to be even more focused, aligned and agile. We expect a fourth quarter charge of approximately $20 million to $25 million primarily for employee separation and reorganization cost. Including on the reorganization charge, we continue to expect SG&A to be flat to up modestly and operating margin for the motorcycle segment to be 15% to 16% for 2016. As a percent of revenue, we now expect SG&A to be largely flat to prior year.
Overall, we are thrilled with the initial response to our new model year 2017 motorcycles despite the weakness in the U.S. industry retail sales. It highlights Harley-Davidson is a leader in new product innovation and reinforces our strategy to invest in new product development. We are on the right path. Our disciplined and the execution of our strategies and continue to make necessary decisions intended to support the prudent retail inventory position and protect our strong brand and profitability into the future. We will continue to navigate through the challenging environment and are making investments to drive demand and deliver strong margins and strong returns over the long term.

When we look at both delinquencies and credit losses, we certainly have seen an increase on a year-over-year basis.

When we look at both delinquencies and credit losses, we certainly have seen an increase on a year-over-year basis. And starting with delinquencies, as we've discussed, the delinquencies have been at historical lows. I mean, they have really been low since the last 3 or 4 years. And so with the rise -- and we've seen on a year-over-year basis about a 33-basis point increase. That increase has held steady over the last 3-or-so quarters but is higher year-over-year. But even with that, Tim, delinquencies are near historical lows and certainly still much better than they were prior to the downturn that we experienced. So we're keeping an eye on it. HDFS is doing an absolutely fantastic job, working collections as well as tweaking the underwriting that we've got. And we talked a little bit earlier, we made some underwriting adjustments in oil-dependent areas in the United States a couple of quarters ago. The other piece of that is credit losses, and credit losses are also up in the neighborhood of 40 basis points year-over-year, which is certainly a concern. Still, when you look at credit losses over this period of time, Tim, we are in the 10-year historical average that we've had in terms of credit losses. And both in terms of delinquencies and credit losses, we're certainly within the models in our pricing and within our expectation of overall losses. Similarly, with credit losses, we've seen those rise a little bit more and longer than we have in terms of delinquencies. And that is really due to the softness that we've seen in the auction market that really started back in Q4 of 2014, somewhat aligned with the shift in world currencies. But again, overall, we are within what we've seen in historical norms over the last 10 years. We're not providing any projections going forward. But again, HDFS is addressing what we've got and making the changes that are necessary to continue to maintain their industry-leading profitability at HDFS."

And with regards to the overall pricing, we had mentioned that for the model year, we increased prices by 2 1/4%. And when you look at the value that we've added to our motorcycles, in particular touring motorcycles with our first new engine and design in 18 years and the benefits in terms of power acceleration, the suspension, heat management and you can go down the list in vibration and so on and so forth, we believe we've added significantly more value to the motorcycles than the pricing that we've taken. So we're confident with that pricing, and we've enjoyed the ability to price our motorcycles for the last several years. And we feel good about where we're at with this price increase moving into our 2017 model year."

With regards to overall guidance, 264,000 to 269,000 units, we are confident. Third quarter was a tough quarter for us, certainly lower than what we had expected, but still confident in hitting our guidance. And you're absolutely right, inventory was up 9,700 units, much higher than we would like at this point in the year, but in line with what we saw in the second quarter. Second quarter, we were up about 8,600 units and put more inventory in the system because of the ERP implementation that we did. We would hope to burn off more of that inventory over the third quarter. That didn't happen. But we did not take -- as Matt had mentioned upfront, we did not take the actions of reducing production at that time because of the fact that we've got our new model year 2017 motorcycles out. And to get worldwide dealer fill, it was important that we continued to produce. So as we look forward to the fourth quarter, we are committed to bringing inventories in line with prior year levels at the end of the year. And that will happen in 2 ways, Joe: one, we expect retail sales growth in the fourth quarter, driven by several things, the Milwaukee-Eight engine; the demand-driving investments that we're making, which have been very effective; the dealer expansion. I believe in the fourth quarter, we got 16 dealerships opening. And as far as I remember, that's the most we've ever opened in a quarter. So that will help benefit it.  And then finally, lapping the very soft industry on a year-ago basis. So retail sales growth. The other piece is we will be taking production down in the fourth quarter. We are absolutely completely committed to managing supply in line with demand and expect to be flat on a year-over-year basis. Your second question, Joe, is with regards to the savings.  Again, Sharon had asked about $30 million to $35 million of savings, and we will use that again to protect our margins into the future. We will continue to invest at very high levels of marketing spend, and it will also make sure that in a slower growth environment, we're a little bit more defensive and protective of those margins. And we're looking to maintain them as we move into 2017."

Also, benefiting 2016 operating margin would be the fact that we expect manufacturing expense to be favorable. So again, through the first 3 quarters of this year, we had significant unfavorability in manufacturing expense, driven by 2 huge initiatives, the ERP implementation and our first new engine in 18 years.

All of those have gone really well according to our expectations. Obviously, we learn with everything we do, and we continue to dial in our efforts going forward. In particular, Riding Academy is going to continue to be a high leverage asset for us, how do we make sure that the 52,000 people are the right kinds of new riders that have a long life with us and are going through the class and are high-yield riders coming out the other side and working with our dealers to both expand the number of them that offer the class as well as the number of classes they are able to offer and the conversion rate of everybody that goes through it is going to be a key focus of Riding Academy going forward.

Matter of fact is you look at the beginning of the quarter and July and August, we saw the same run rate from the industry, down about 9%. Our sales were down about the same amount, a little bit more and really turned around in the month of September, up 5% United States, also up pretty strong EMEA. Those are the 2 markets that we had distribution of our model year '17 motorcycles in. They just started reaching our Asia-Pacific region very late in the quarter. So we expect certainly a lift from the new product in the fourth quarter in those markets as well as in Latin America. They will arrive even later into the fourth quarter. But the reception has been absolutely fantastic. And so the lift that we're seeing in September, we do believe it will be sustainable in the fourth quarter and drive increased retail sales in the United States as well as around the world with regards to that. Also had a big impact in terms of market share in the U.S and actually the -- brought the industry to near flat for the month of September.

But essentially it would appear that retail was worse than you expected in the third quarter. Inventories are higher as we exit the third quarter. Ultimately shipments are towards the or at the low-end of what you guided and yet your full year guidance is unchanged. So I guess the implication is you're more optimistic about the fourth quarter for us to still be able to get to those same numbers. And I guess, second question sort of in the context of the color you gave on September, the math would seem to suggest that fourth quarter needs to be even better than that 5% growth just to get to the low end of the guidance and probably more or like double digits to get to the midpoint. Have you -- even within your guidance, are you towards the lower end of those numbers? Help us square how third quarter was so much worse than you thought and now you're still maintaining the guidance?"

But, James, we do not need the level of growth that you stated. I think, you said mid-single digits to high or significantly higher than what we did in the month of September. That is not accurate. So, 2 things you need to go back and look at is when you look at the retail sales and try to equate them to wholesale shipments, the base of those 2 numbers starting the year were different couple thousand units. And while we will maintain inventories flat on a year-over-year basis in the United States, we do expect inventory growth in our international markets. We will be adding 36 new dealerships and we will certainly need inventory to help support that growth, which is about 5% increase in our international dealerships.
So with those 2 things included in the computation, it is much less than needed, much less to hold the guidance coming at the low end or the high end of the guidance, for the full year guidance. But again, we do feel very good about the momentum that we've got coming out of the month of September and the reaction to our new product from the media, our dealers, customers around the world."

With regards to manufacturing expense, we have certainly had a tremendous amount of startup cost going on and lower run rates. As we exited the third quarter, #1 is the ERP system came up flawlessly as did the cutover to the new engine. We spent a lot of money training our workforce and making sure that things went well. As we exited the third quarter, the plants were up and running at speed and that will be the biggest driver of our year-over-year improvement from last year. We still will have lower production. So we will have a headwind in overall manufacturing expense on lost absorption. But given the running of the plant and speed that we are at, we would expect manufacturing expenses would be favorable in the fourth quarter.  The second question you asked, David, was of 9,700 units of higher inventory, what percentage is of carryover motorcycles? I do not know the absolute percentage of that. And it really -- it's hard to tell because that's just increasing inventory. What I can tell you is, model year 2016 carryover inventory is a much bigger percentage of the total inventory that we have in the system that we would like at this point. And it is higher than what we had on a year-over-year basis. The dealers are doing a very good job of burning through that carryover, but it is no doubt higher than we want and that is the appropriate level. Remember, coming into the year, we were producing a pullback and as much production as we could in the in the second quarter. We are cutting over to a new model year and so we ended up with higher overall inventories. We are helping the dealers. Our dealers are doing a good job burning through the inventory and we are helping them. We have got a 3-pronged approach in the marketplace right now to help out with that. Two are more consumer focused and one is more dealer focused. Of the 2 consumer-focused programs, one is financing, finance offers which we have on some of the models that are more long on. I believe it is 4 touring models and 1 Dyna model. And with that is 1.99%, no money down offer for top tier. Significantly less coverage than we had a year ago. So less of an opportunity to help our customers and dealers there. And then secondly is a winter warranty program for our customers. This is not a new program to Harley-Davidson but we didn't have it -- we didn't offer in the last couple of years. What that does, David, is any for our customers that buy a motorcycle in the United States in the winter months will get that added on to their warranty coverage. So effectively, everyone that buys motorcycle between now and April 1st, the warranty, 2-year warranty will start effectively April 1st. So a consumer incentive there. And then the final one is that a common practice among our dealers is to trade motorcycles, to get the right color. With a long on one model and short on another, they do a lot of trading. What we have done is for carryover '16 models, we will help defray the cost of the trading that goes on. And so we hope to encourage and facilitate getting the right motorcycles to the right dealers at the right time to move through as much carryover inventory as quickly as we can."

And then they also both track pretty well to retail sales as well, which on a worldwide basis was down 4.5% and 7% in the United States. So when you look at both P&A and General Merchandise, they are down, kind of straddling between what we were down in retail in the quarter in wholesale.

And at that time we said we would burn that inventory off throughout the year and each year -- each periods come down and I'm certainly happy to say that in the third quarter overall inventory was down about $40 million driven largely by finished goods inventory, partially offset by little bit of rise in Parts and Accessories and General Merchandise and so overall inventory is down about 9%.

So when we look at the year and the negative drivers are all based on the industry, David. Market share we couldn't be more pleased with. Again, coming into the year, our direct objective was stabilize market share. On a year-to-date basis market share is up 8/10th of a percent. And even when you look at the third quarter, market share was flat, but if you peel back a little bit farther than that in the categories that we compete in, in the third quarter, that being touring large Cruisers and small Cruisers, our market share was up quite significantly, up a full percentage point in those markets and we gained market share in all 3 segments. So we are competing extremely well without discounting. And that is the equity spending that we are going on brand building activities and Matt talked a little bit about before. So that aspect is going very well, going better than what we had expected.  The negative drivers are clearly are around the industry. And we have seen the industry that has performed very well over the last 5 years up through 2015, CAGR of 2.9%, we got into this year and we had about percentage point increase in the first quarter and then again towards the end of April things really started to fall out. When you look at what's driving the industry, one is 3 quarters is lapping very strong year ago numbers. On a year-to-date basis, the industry was up about 6-point-something percent and that was driven by tt onset of discounting. So last year was the first benefit that the competition got from significant price reductions. So we are facing that headwind. That will start to reverse, David, in the fourth quarter as the year-ago's fourth quarter comp is much easier and actually was down almost 4%. So that we will start to see reversing. The second big driver is the weak oil-dependent sales. And this is again an overall industry problem. We talked about our numbers and the last 3 quarters leading up to the third quarter, we have seen that down about 10%. That's been a significant drag on the industry. Now, in the third quarter, we actually saw that accelerate. Certainly disappointed with that, but we saw that increase to a level of about 15% down in oil-dependent areas in the quarter. The industry also saw an acceleration of that number. So when you talk about going forward, how does that continue? Anyone's guess in the short term, but at some point when that plateaus, we will have a lower base and we will be able to grow off of that. 
And then the third one is soft used values, which the industry has experienced for the last several quarters. Again, we talked about the bikes that go through our dealer network, which is about third of the used bikes. Used bike prices held up very well through the third quarter of 2015 and over the last 3 or 4 quarters, we have seen some softness in used bikes as well as the industry. Our bikes continue to hold its value better than the industry by far but we are seeing used bike values fall. That we'd say short-term headwind and new bike sales. Long term, it's not necessarily a bad thing and that does bring a lot of new people into the industry. And a matter of fact for Harley-Davidson the vast majority of new people coming into the brand come in on used motorcycles. So there is certainly some positive to that. But the industry worked through that softness and we would expect that to stabilize at some point in the future. The second question that you asked, David, was with regards to trading of motorcycles between dealers. And you had used that term 'used' in describing that. What we are doing to move model year '16 carryover motorcycles are just for new motorcycles, have nothing to do with the used. As a matter of fact, there was report out last week that talked about change in used strategy and I think there was some confusion with regards to what we're doing on model year 2016 carryover, new motorcycles to move them, to help our dealers move them, which includes facilitating and defraying the cost of trading versus anything to do with used. So I want to you make that clarification."

Manufacturing cost?  Yes, when we look at overall manufacturing expense line of our gross margin, we have seen a significant amount of cost over the 3 quarters.

Before John goes into the financial results, I'd like to cover the market and company performance for the quarter and provide context on what we see going forward.First, while we",1035,"Thanks, Amy, and thanks to all of you for joining us on the call today. 
Before John goes into the financial results, I'd like to cover the market and company performance for the quarter and provide context on what we see going forward.
First, while we recognize that the environment continues to be challenging, we believe we're on the right course in making prudent decisions for our future by focusing our investments on growing the sport and Harley-Davidson's place in it. We're focused on influencing customer choice and growing our reach and impact with customers, all with delivering strong returns to investors. We continue to be pleased with our market share performance, given the fierce competition in the U.S. market and ongoing global macroeconomic challenges. Third quarter market share was essentially flat in the U.S., as we maintained our strong leadership with over half of the 601+CC market. Our overall market share performance in the U.S. and gains in other key global markets like Australia and Japan provides strong affirmation of the progress we're making with our investments to drive demand through awareness, access, increased ridership and bold new products to reach more people in more places. 
An absolute highlight of the quarter was the reaction around the world to our model year 2017 new products. One of our key areas of focus is to accelerate the cadence and impact of new products, and in late August, we delivered. We could not be more pleased with the launch of and response to our model year 2017 lineup. Most notably, we've had an extremely positive reaction to our Milwaukee-Eight engine, which we debuted on all of our 3 motorcycles in conjunction with a redesigned upgraded suspension.
We know what our riders want, and we delivered with a big step forward that accentuates everything we're known for, a powertrain and chassis package with innovative technologies that provide more torque, more horsepower, greater comfort and enhanced look, sound and feel. The feedback from riders, dealers and industry experts alike has been tremendous.  All it takes is one ride to feel the power the Milwaukee-Eight engine brings to our riders and to the company going forward. The significance of the Milwaukee-Eight engine is already evident.  In September, we saw touring sales in the U.S. increase by double digits, along with increased demand for test rides. Given initial results, we're confident the entire lineup will drive our retail sales for the remainder of 2016 and position us well heading into the spring riding season and beyond.
As we indicated on our last call, we will continue to manage supply in line with demand. We maintained production ahead of retail in the third quarter in order to support the initial dealer fill of model year '17 motorcycles, and we plan to reduce production in the fourth quarter to finish the year with flat year-over-year U.S. retail inventory.
As we look ahead, continued softness in the U.S. industry is a clear area of concern, and we're taking further steps to be sure we're positioned appropriately. In Q4, we'll be streamlining our organization to execute our demand-driving strategies with increased focus, alignment and agility. John will provide the financial details around these steps momentarily. Our strategy to invest in driving demand around the world is unchanged, and we're steadfast in our commitment to deliver strong returns to investors while doing so.
Harley-Davidson has been in the motorcycle business continuously since 1903. And during that time, we've experienced all types of economic, market and industry ups and downs, and today is no different. We believe our strategy is sound, and every decision we make is tied to driving it forward and delivering for all of our stakeholders. We're intensely focused on gaining and securing market share in the 90-plus markets we're in and doing so profitability. The launch of the Milwaukee-Eight-powered touring motorcycles is one powerful example of how we lead by delivering for our passionate and loyal riders. We're also investing to reach new riders by growing distribution internationally and by training new riders right here in United States. Through September, we've trained over 52,000 riders this year through the Harley-Davidson Riding Academy in the United States, demonstrating that we're building momentum in bringing new riders into our sport and brand through this fantastic competitive advantage.
During the quarter, we opened 9 new international dealerships and a total of 20 year-to-date. In the fourth quarter, we expect to add another 16 new dealers and reenter Indonesia, all part of our strategy to increase access to our sport and brand by adding 150 to 200 new dealerships internationally by 2020. 
Last week, I was with our Asia-Pacific team in China and Singapore. I was able to see the team in action as they continue their efforts to grow our reach and impact in these important markets. I was also privileged to engage with passionate dealers who are investing with confidence in Harley-Davidson's future. It's in these experiences that I'm reminded of what incredible strength we have in our people and in our worldwide dealer network. Looking forward, we acknowledge that economics and political uncertainty weighs on the minds of consumers in the U.S. and in some of the other markets where Harley-Davidson competes. As the industry leader, we believe we're best positioned to strengthen the sport of motorcycling over time. We'll continue to manage the company and brand and will not compromise by taking shortcuts that would diminish customer loyalty and passion or sacrifice our strong company fundamentals.
We'll lean into our strengths in product development and our unrivaled connection to our riders to continue to bring innovative products to market that drive engagement and participation in our brand worldwide. The new Milwaukee-Eight engine is a powerful example, but it's just one example of the strength of our product plan for 2017 and beyond. Harley-Davidson gives people a way to experience and express their own personal freedom. This is our purpose, and it's a powerful motivator for every one of us associated with this brand. You have our commitment to build on our incredible strength and deliver strong returns on your investments in us. 
With that, I'll turn it over to John. Thank you."

Starting on Slide 8. During the quarter, revenue was $1.27 billion. Net income was $114.1 million, and diluted earnings per share were $0.64. We -- as we anticipated, operating income from the motorcycle segment was down 23.9% from last year's third quarter. Segment revenue was down 4.3% in the quarter behind a 9.1% decrease in motorcycle shipments. Gross margin as a percent of revenue decreased versus prior year as a result of higher year-over-year manufacturing cost. SG&A was up in the quarter, as we increased our demand driving in product development investments. Operating income as a percent of revenue in Q3 was 10.0%.
At HDFS, operating income was down 4.6% year-over-year. We remain focused on driving demand and delivering strong margins and strong returns over the long term as we continue to navigate through the ongoing challenging conditions. 
Q3 worldwide retail sales of new Harley-Davidson motorcycles are summarized on Slide 9. Retail sales in international markets were up modestly. U.S. industry slowdown continued, driving Harley-Davidson retail sales down 7.1% in the U.S. and down 4.5% on a worldwide basis. Our increased investments in driving demand and product innovation are mitigating the effects of the intense global competitive environment, including the expanded price gaps to the competition in the U.S. and the impact of new product introductions. This is no more evident than with the overwhelmingly positive response to our model year 2017 motorcycles featuring the Milwaukee-Eight engine. Our new products drove significantly improved U.S. retail sales and market share in September. We also saw positive retail momentum in EMEA. And in Asia-Pacific, we are encouraged by the initial customer response as the 2017 models began arriving at the end of the quarter. 
Let's take a closer look at U.S. sales on Slide 10. Q3 retail sales in the U.S. were down behind continued weak industry results. We believe the industry continues to be impacted by lapping year-ago industry growth, driven by aggressive competitive discounting; weak sales in oil-dependent areas; and softer year-over-year used bike values across the industry. While the overall industry performance is disappointing, we are encouraged with our ongoing market share stability. Our Q3 share of 601+CC market was largely flat; however, our share in the month of September was up a strong 3.2 percentage points. Our year-to-date market share was up 0.8 percentage points to 50.8%. We believe our market share was driven by our demand-driving investments focused on growing product awareness and ridership in the U.S. and the fantastic response to our new 2017 model motorcycles featuring the Milwaukee-Eight engine.
While our competitors continue to engage in levels of discounting comparable to last year's third quarter, we are very pleased that we were able to grow our year-to-date market share in the U.S. with our brand-enhancing actions and our new innovative motorcycles.
In Q3, we completed the initial dealer fill of our 2017 model year motorcycles. This combined with weak retail sales for most of the summer drove higher than desired U.S. retail inventories at the end of the quarter. We are committed to our strategy to aggressively manage supply in line with demand and plan to reduce production in the fourth quarter in order to end the year with U.S. retail inventory flat to prior year.
On Slide 11, you'll see retail sales in our international markets were up 1.0% in Q3. During the quarter, EMEA retail sales were up 1.9%. The Milwaukee-Eight engine has received a great perception and provided a lift to retail sales in the month of September in the region. EMEA year-to-date market share was 10.3%, largely flat to prior year. Asia-Pacific retail sales were up modestly from prior year, driven by strong growth in Japan and Australia. We expect growth in the Asia-Pacific region to accelerate in Q4 behind improving availability of our 2017 model year motorcycles, the planned opening of approximately 11 new dealerships and the reopening of several dealerships in Indonesia, which were exited at the beginning of the year. Retail sales in Latin America were down in the quarter, driven by declines in Brazil.  Brazil's retail sales continued to be impacted by a slowing economy, consumer uncertainty and very aggressive price competition. In Q1, we increased model year 2016 motorcycle prices by approximately 23% in response to the devaluation of the real. 
Finally, retail sales growth in Canada continued in the third quarter, up 4.3% year-over-year. To support our strategic focus on increasing brand access, we plan to continue to expand our international distribution. 
On Slide 12, you'll see wholesale shipments of Harley-Davidson motorcycles in the quarter were down 9.1%, within our shipment guidance range.  Third quarter shipment mix was skewed toward touring, reflecting our investment in new 2017 motorcycles featuring the Milwaukee-Eight engine. 
On Slide 13, you'll see revenue for the motorcycles and related product segment was down in the third quarter behind a weak U.S. retail industry and our corresponding decrease in year-over-year motorcycles shipments. Revenue in the quarter was favorably impacted by currency exchange, higher pricing and mix. As a result, the average motorcycle revenue per unit was up $1,035 for the quarter. Wholesale and MSRP weighted average pricing for our new 2017 model year motorcycles increased by approximately 2 1/4%. After adjusting for the cost of new content, pricing net of cost increased approximately 1 1/4 percentage points expressed as a percent of revenue. Please note that these percent increases are more favorable than the estimates we included in the new model launch video in August. Parts and Accessories revenue was down behind lower motorcycle shipments and retail sales during the quarter. General Merchandise revenue was also down, driven by lower sales of sportswear and riding gear. 
Our gross margin review is on Slide 14. As expected, Q3 gross margin was unfavorable, driven by higher manufacturing costs, partially offset by favorable price, mix and raw materials. Additionally, currency exchange was favorable for the first time in 8 quarters, driven by higher revenues behind a slightly weaker U.S. dollar. Manufacturing costs were unfavorable by $18.7 million during the quarter. We expected significant unfavorable variances in manufacturing, largely driven by costs related to both the implementation of our ERP system in Kansas City and the launch of the new Milwaukee-Eight engine. We are also -- we also expect the loss absorption behind lower production during the quarter, as we implemented these 2 very successful programs.  Looking forward, we expect Q4 manufacturing cost to be favorable as we return to normal operations. Over the long term, we will continue to execute our strategies, investing in the future of our brand in the sport or motorcycling globally while delivering strong margins. 
On Slide 15, operating margin as a percent of revenue for the quarter was 10.0%, down compared to last year's third quarter. Operating margin was impacted by lower gross margin as well as higher SG&A, as we increased our investments in demand driving and product development. We remain intensely focused on a cost structure that will enable profitable growth and continuous improvement to drive our business to be stronger, more flexible and more profitable. 
Moving on to HDFS on Slide 16. During the quarter, HDFS' operating profit decreased $3.4 million or 4.6% compared to last year. The primary factors impacting third quarter results were: first, net interest income was up over prior year by $2.5 million. This increase was driven by higher receivables, partially offset by higher borrowing cost. Second, the provision for retail motorcycle loan losses increased over prior year by $10.1 million, driven by higher retail credit losses and associated increase in the allowance. 
HDFS' operational results are summarized on Slide 17. For the quarter, originations were down 10.2% compared to last year. HDFS' share of new -- of U.S. new retail sales were strong at 64.3%, yet down 5 percentage points as we left the impact of last year's low rate finance offers. Year-to-date loan originations were comprised of approximately 80% prime loans and 20% subprime. As a predominant industry lender to subprime customers, these originations continue to represent a significant number of retail sales to the company at very attractive returns. At the end of the quarter, we had $351.4 million of cash and cash equivalents at HDFS. In addition, HDFS had $983.7 million of available liquidity through bank credit and conduit facilities.
On Slide 18, you'll see 30-day delinquency rate for retail motorcycle loan receivables on our balance sheet was 3.61% or 45 basis points higher than Q3 2015. 12 basis points of the increase represents a change in mix of the portfolio after the Q2 full securitization of prime receivables. The delinquency rate on a managed basis, including those loans that were part of the full securitization, was 33 basis points higher than in the prior year, due in part to deterioration in oil-dependent areas and rising delinquencies across the portfolio, which is consistent with industry trends. The annualized credit loss rate for receivables on our balance sheet was 1.59% or 40 basis points higher than Q3 2015. On a managed basis, credit loss rate was 1.57%. The increase was the result of higher losses on loans in oil-dependent areas, normalizing loan performance and lower used bike values at auction. It is important to note that while both delinquencies and credit loss rates were up versus prior year, the rate of increase has remained constant over the last few quarters. During the quarter, HDFS continued to maintain a strong liquidity position and contributed strong profitability to the company. 
The remaining Harley-Davidson, Inc. financial results are summarized on Slide 19. A few things to note. Operating cash was down from last year, driven primarily by lower year-to-date net income. And year-to-date tax rate was 32.9%, which was lower than last year's tax rate behind the successful closure of various tax audits in Q2. The company has and intends to continue to maintain a minimum of 12 months of projected liquidity needs in cash and/or committed credit facilities.
Returning value to our shareholders is a top priority. We expect to return all excess cash to our shareholders in the form of increasing dividends and continued share repurchases. On Slide 20, you'll see we did both during the third quarter. We will continue to look for additional opportunities to maximize shareholder value by returning excess cash to our shareholders without damaging the long-term value of the company or the brand.
On Slide 21, you'll see our overall expectations for 2016. For the remainder of the year, we're confident in our shipment guidance of 264,000 to 269,000 motorcycles or approximately down 1% to up 1%. We are very encouraged by the momentum we experienced in the U.S. in September when our new model year 2017 motorcycles drove an increase in retail sales of approximately 5% and a more than 3 percentage point increase in market share.
We expect worldwide retail sales growth in the fourth quarter, driven by significant demand for our Milwaukee-Eight engine, our increased demand-driving investments, expansion of the international dealer network and lapping last year's U.S. industry decline of 3.8%.
During the quarter, we expect to ship between 44,200 and 49,200 motorcycles, down approximately 8% to up approximately 2%. As mentioned earlier, we expect to end the year with U.S. retail inventory being flat to prior year. Recognizing the slower industry growth that we are continuing to experience in the U.S., we will be streamlining our operations to be even more focused, aligned and agile. We expect a fourth quarter charge of approximately $20 million to $25 million primarily for employee separation and reorganization cost. Including on the reorganization charge, we continue to expect SG&A to be flat to up modestly and operating margin for the motorcycle segment to be 15% to 16% for 2016. As a percent of revenue, we now expect SG&A to be largely flat to prior year.
Overall, we are thrilled with the initial response to our new model year 2017 motorcycles despite the weakness in the U.S. industry retail sales. It highlights Harley-Davidson is a leader in new product innovation and reinforces our strategy to invest in new product development. We are on the right path. Our disciplined and the execution of our strategies and continue to make necessary decisions intended to support the prudent retail inventory position and protect our strong brand and profitability into the future. We will continue to navigate through the challenging environment and are making investments to drive demand and deliver strong margins and strong returns over the long term.

When we look at both delinquencies and credit losses, we certainly have seen an increase on a year-over-year basis. And starting with delinquencies, as we've discussed, the delinquencies have been at historical lows. I mean, they have really been low since the last 3 or 4 years. And so with the rise -- and we've seen on a year-over-year basis about a 33-basis point increase. That increase has held steady over the last 3-or-so quarters but is higher year-over-year. But even with that, Tim, delinquencies are near historical lows and certainly still much better than they were prior to the downturn that we experienced. So we're keeping an eye on it. HDFS is doing an absolutely fantastic job, working collections as well as tweaking the underwriting that we've got. And we talked a little bit earlier, we made some underwriting adjustments in oil-dependent areas in the United States a couple of quarters ago. The other piece of that is credit losses, and credit losses are also up in the neighborhood of 40 basis points year-over-year, which is certainly a concern. Still, when you look at credit losses over this period of time, Tim, we are in the 10-year historical average that we've had in terms of credit losses. And both in terms of delinquencies and credit losses, we're certainly within the models in our pricing and within our expectation of overall losses. Similarly, with credit losses, we've seen those rise a little bit more and longer than we have in terms of delinquencies. And that is really due to the softness that we've seen in the auction market that really started back in Q4 of 2014, somewhat aligned with the shift in world currencies. But again, overall, we are within what we've seen in historical norms over the last 10 years. We're not providing any projections going forward. But again, HDFS is addressing what we've got and making the changes that are necessary to continue to maintain their industry-leading profitability at HDFS."

And with regards to the overall pricing, we had mentioned that for the model year, we increased prices by 2 1/4%. And when you look at the value that we've added to our motorcycles, in particular touring motorcycles with our first new engine and design in 18 years and the benefits in terms of power acceleration, the suspension, heat management and you can go down the list in vibration and so on and so forth, we believe we've added significantly more value to the motorcycles than the pricing that we've taken. So we're confident with that pricing, and we've enjoyed the ability to price our motorcycles for the last several years. And we feel good about where we're at with this price increase moving into our 2017 model year."

Second quarter, we were up about 8,600 units and put more inventory in the system because of the ERP implementation that we did. We would hope to burn off more of that inventory over the third quarter. That didn't happen. But we did not take -- as Matt had mentioned upfront, we did not take the actions of reducing production at that time because of the fact that we've got our new model year 2017 motorcycles out. And to get worldwide dealer fill, it was important that we continued to produce. So as we look forward to the fourth quarter, we are committed to bringing inventories in line with prior year levels at the end of the year. And that will happen in 2 ways, Joe: one, we expect retail sales growth in the fourth quarter, driven by several things, the Milwaukee-Eight engine; the demand-driving investments that we're making, which have been very effective; the dealer expansion. I believe in the fourth quarter, we got 16 dealerships opening. And as far as I remember, that's the most we've ever opened in a quarter. So that will help benefit it.  And then finally, lapping the very soft industry on a year-ago basis. So retail sales growth. The other piece is we will be taking production down in the fourth quarter. We are absolutely completely committed to managing supply in line with demand and expect to be flat on a year-over-year basis. Your second question, Joe, is with regards to the savings.  Again, Sharon had asked about $30 million to $35 million of savings, and we will use that again to protect our margins into the future. We will continue to invest at very high levels of marketing spend, and it will also make sure that in a slower growth environment, we're a little bit more defensive and protective of those margins. And we're looking to maintain them as we move into 2017."

Also, benefiting 2016 operating margin would be the fact that we expect manufacturing expense to be favorable. So again, through the first 3 quarters of this year, we had significant unfavorability in manufacturing expense, driven by 2 huge initiatives, the ERP implementation and our first new engine in 18 years. They will provide benefits over the next decade, and moving forward, were quite expensive putting in. And with that, in the fourth quarter, we would expect manufacturing favorability, which will also add to our margin benefit -- our operating margin guidance of 15% to 16%."

The -- in general, the envelope around it is just making sure that we increase awareness and -- of the brand and of the products along the way. All of those have gone really well according to our expectations. Obviously, we learn with everything we do, and we continue to dial in our efforts going forward. In particular, Riding Academy is going to continue to be a high leverage asset for us, how do we make sure that the 52,000 people are the right kinds of new riders that have a long life with us and are going through the class and are high-yield riders coming out the other side and working with our dealers to both expand the number of them that offer the class as well as the number of classes they are able to offer and the conversion rate of everybody that goes through it is going to be a key focus of Riding Academy going forward.

So I guess, the implication is you're more optimistic about the fourth quarter for us to still be able to get to those same numbers. And I guess, second question sort of in the context of the color you gave on September, the math would seem to suggest that the fourth quarter needs to be even better than that 5% growth just to get to the low end of the guidance and probably more like double digits to get to the midpoint. Have your -- even within your guidance, have -- are you -- towards the lower end of those numbers, help us square how third quarter was so much worse than you thought and now you're still maintaining the guidance?"

But, James, we do not need the level of growth that you stated. I think you said mid-single digits to high or significantly higher than what we did in the month of September. That is not accurate. So 2 things you need to go back and look at is when you look at the retail sales and try to equate them to wholesale shipments, the base of those 2 numbers starting the year were different off of a couple of thousand units. And while we'll maintain inventories flat on a year-over-year basis in the United States, we do expect inventory growth in our international markets. We will be adding 36 new dealerships, and we will certainly need inventory to help support that growth, which is about 5% increase in our international dealerships. So with those 2 things included in the computation, it is much less than needed, much less to hold the guidance into coming at the low end or the high end of the guidance for the full year guidance.

Yes, with regards to the manufacturing expense, we have certainly had a tremendous amount of startup cost going on and lower run rates. As we exited the third quarter, #1 is the ERP system came up flawlessly as did the cutover to the new engine. We spent a lot of money on training our workforce and making sure that things went well. As we exited the third quarter, the plants were up and running at speed, and that will be the biggest driver of our year-over-year improvement from last year. We still will have lower production. So we'll have a headwind in overall manufacturing expense on lost absorption. But given the running of the plant and the speed that we're at, we would expect that manufacturing expenses would be favorable in the fourth quarter.  The second question that you asked, David, was of 9,700 units of higher inventory, what percentage is of carryover motorcycles. I do not know the absolute percentage of that. And it really -- it's hard to tell, because that's just the increase in inventory. What I can tell you is model year 2016 carryover inventory is a much bigger percentage of the total inventory that we have in the system than we would like at this point, and it is higher than what we had on a year-over-year basis. The dealers are doing a very good job of burning through that carryover. But it is, no doubt, higher than we want, and that is the appropriate level. Remember, coming into the year, we were producing [indiscernible] pull back and as much production as we could in the second quarter. We were cutting over to a new model year. And so we ended up with higher overall inventories. We are helping the dealers. Our dealers are doing a good job burning through the inventory, and we are helping them. We've got a 3-pronged approach in the marketplace right now to help out with that. 2 are more consumer-focused. 1 is more dealer-focused. Of the 2 consumer-focused programs, 1 is financing, finance offers which we have on some of the models that we're more long on. I believe that's 4 touring models and 1 Dyna model. And what that is, is 1.99% no money down offer for top tier. A significantly less coverage than we had a year ago, so less but an opportunity to help our customers and dealers there. And then secondly is winter warranty program for our customers. This is not a new program to Harley-Davidson, but we didn't have it -- we didn't offer it in the last couple of years. What that does, David, is any for our customers that buy a motorcycle in the United States in the winter months will get that added on to their warranty coverage. So effectively, everyone that buys a motorcycle between now and April 1, their warranty -- 2-year warranty will start effectively April 1, so a consumer incentive there. And then the final one is, is that a common practice among our dealers is to trade motorcycles, to get the right color with a long on one model and short on another. They do a lot of trading. What we've done is for carryover '16 models, we will help defray the cost of that trading that goes on. And so we hope to encourage and facilitate getting the right motorcycles to the right dealers at the right time to move through as much of the carryover inventory as quickly as we can."

But, Jaime, you also have to look at that in context of kind of what they track to. Our overall shipments were down 9.1%. And some of our Parts and Accessories business tracks pretty well with shipments, as dealers get motorcycles in and make changes to them. And then they also both track pretty well to retail sales as well, which on a worldwide basis was down 4.5% and 7% in the United States. So when you look at both P&A and General Merchandise, they're down, kind of straddling between what we were down in retail for the quarter in wholesale. So on a year-to-date basis, Parts and Accessories, I think, is down about 2.5%. And we've got retail sales down about that same amount, 1.9%. So on a year-to-date basis, they're tracking pretty much what we've seen in that relationship historically. Jaime, the second question was with regards to overall inventory. If you remember, going back to the fourth quarter, we had inventory up quite significantly. Matter of fact, it was up about 33%, and that was to get a quick start in supporting the marketing spending that we were doing in the first quarter. And at that time, we said we would burn that inventory off throughout the year and each year -- each periods come down. And I'm certainly happy to say that in the third quarter, overall inventory was down about $40 million, driven largely by finished goods inventory, partially offset by a little bit of rise in Parts and Accessories and General Merchandise. And so overall inventory is down about 9%. As we look to the fourth quarter, we would expect overall inventories to be down as well on a year-end basis."

And we got into this year and we had about a percentage point increase in the first quarter. And then again toward the end of April, things really started to fall out. When you look at what's driving the industry, one is up through 3 quarters is lapping very strong year ago numbers. On a year-to-date basis, the industry was up about 6-point-something percent, and that was driven by the onset of discounting. So last year was the first benefit that the competition got from significant price reductions. So we are facing that headwind. That will start to reverse, David, in the fourth quarter as a year-ago's fourth quarter comp is much easier and actually was down almost 4%. So that we start to see reversing. The second big driver is the weak oil-dependent sales. And this is again an overall industry problem. We've talked about our numbers. And the last 3 quarters leading up to the third quarter, we've seen that down about 10%. So that's been a significant drag on the industry. Now in the third quarter, we actually saw that accelerate. Certainly disappointed with that, but we saw that increase to a level of about, well, 15% down in oil-dependent areas in the quarter. The industry also saw an acceleration of that number. So when you talk about going forward, how does that continue, anyone's guess in the short term, but at some point when that plateaus, we'll have a lower base and be able to grow off of that. And then the third one is soft used values, which the industry has experienced for the last several quarters. Again, we've talked about the bikes that go through our dealer network, which is about 1/3 of the used bikes. Used bike prices held up very well through the third quarter of 2015. And over the last 3 or 4 quarters, we've seen some softness in used bikes as well as the industry. Our bikes continue to hold its value better than the industry by far, but we are seeing used bike values fall. That's short-term headwind and new bike sales. Long term, it's not necessarily a bad thing, and that does bring a lot of new people into the industry. And a matter of fact for Harley-Davidson, the vast majority of new people coming into the brand come in on used motorcycles. So there's certainly some positive to that. But the industry work through that softness, and we would expect that to stabilize at some point in the future. The second question that you asked, David, was with regards to trading of motorcycles between dealers. And you had used the term 'used' in describing that. What we are doing to move model year '16 carryover motorcycles are just for new motorcycles, have nothing to do with used. Matter of fact, there was a report out last week that talked about change in used strategy, and I think there was some confusion with regards to what we're doing on model year 2016 carryover, new motorcycles to move them, help our dealers move them, which includes facilitating and defraying the cost of trading versus anything to do with used. So I want to make that clarification."

There is also other costs in there, lost absorption. Production is down on a year-over-year basis as well as in the second quarter, we had a fair amount of obsolescence as we tried to pull back just before the new model year came out. So we would expect the majority of those not to repeat next year. And again, as I mentioned, that number will become smaller, because will be favorable on manufacturing expense in the fourth quarter."

Before John goes into the financial results, I'd like to cover the market and company performance for the quarter and provide context on what we see going forward.
First, while we recognize that the environment continues to be challenging, we believe we're on the right course in making prudent decisions for our future by focusing our investments on growing the sport and Harley-Davidson's place in it. We're focused on influencing customer choice and growing our reach and impact with customers, all with delivering strong returns to investors. We continue to be pleased with our market share performance, given the fierce competition in the U.S. market and ongoing global macroeconomic challenges. Third quarter market share was essentially flat in the U.S., as we maintained our strong leadership with over half of the 601+CC market. Our overall market share performance in the U.S. and gains in other key global markets, like Australia and Japan, provides strong affirmation of the progress we're making with our investments to drive demand through awareness, access, increased ridership and bold new products to reach more people in more places. 
An absolute highlight of the quarter was the reaction around the world to our model year 2017 new products. One of our key areas of focus is to accelerate the cadence and impact of new products, and in late August, we delivered. We could not be more pleased with the launch of and response to our model year 2017 lineup. Most notably, we've had an extremely positive reaction to our Milwaukee-Eight engine, which we debuted on all of our touring motorcycles in conjunction with a redesigned upgraded suspension.
We know what our riders want, and we delivered with a big step forward that accentuates everything we're known for, a powertrain and chassis package with innovative technologies that provide more torque, more horsepower, greater comfort and enhanced look, sound and feel. The feedback from riders, dealers and industry experts alike has been tremendous.  All it takes is one ride to feel the power the Milwaukee-Eight engine brings to our riders and to the company going forward. The significance of the Milwaukee-Eight engine is already evident.  In September, we saw touring sales in the U.S. increase by double digits, along with increased demand for test rides. Given initial results, we're confident the entire lineup will drive our retail sales for the remainder of 2016 and position us well heading into the spring riding season and beyond.
As we indicated on our last call, we will continue to manage supply in line with demand. We maintained production ahead of retail in the third quarter in order to support the initial dealer fill of model year '17 motorcycles, and we plan to reduce production in the fourth quarter to finish the year with flat year-over-year U.S. retail inventory.
As we look ahead, continued softness in the U.S. industry is a clear area of concern, and we're taking further steps to be sure we're positioned appropriately. In Q4, we'll be streamlining our organization to execute our demand-driving strategies with increased focus, alignment and agility. John will provide the financial details around these steps momentarily. Our strategy to invest in driving demand around the world is unchanged, and we're steadfast in our commitment to deliver strong returns to investors while doing so.
Harley-Davidson has been in the motorcycle business continuously since 1903. And during that time, we've experienced all types of economic, market and industry ups and downs, and today is no different. We believe our strategy is sound, and every decision we make is tied to driving it forward and delivering for all of our stakeholders. We're intensely focused on gaining and securing market share in the 90-plus markets we're in and doing so profitability. The launch of the Milwaukee-Eight-powered touring motorcycles is one powerful example of how we lead by delivering for our passionate and loyal riders. We're also investing to reach new riders by growing distribution internationally and by training new riders right here in United States. Through September, we've trained over 52,000 riders this year through the Harley-Davidson Riding Academy in the United States, demonstrating that we're building momentum in bringing new riders into our sport and brand through this fantastic competitive advantage.
During the quarter, we opened 9 new international dealerships and a total of 20 year-to-date. In the fourth quarter, we expect to add another 16 new dealers and reenter Indonesia, all part of our strategy to increase access to our sport and brand by adding 150 to 200 new dealerships internationally by 2020. 
Last week, I was with our Asia-Pacific team in China and Singapore. I was able to see the team in action as they continue their efforts to grow our reach and impact in these important markets. I was also privileged to engage with passionate dealers who are investing with confidence in Harley-Davidson's future. It's in these experiences that I'm reminded of what incredible strength we have in our people and in our worldwide dealer network. Looking forward, we acknowledge that economics and political uncertainty weighs on the minds of consumers in the U.S. and in some of the other markets where Harley-Davidson competes. As the industry leader, we believe we're best positioned to strengthen the sport of motorcycling over time. We'll continue to manage the company and brand and will not compromise by taking shortcuts that would diminish customer loyalty and passion or sacrifice our strong company fundamentals.
We'll lean into our strengths in product development and our unrivaled connection to our riders to continue to bring innovative products to market that drive engagement and participation in our brand worldwide. The new Milwaukee-Eight engine is a powerful example, but it's just one example of the strength of our product plan for 2017 and beyond. Harley-Davidson gives people a way to experience and express their own personal freedom. This is our purpose, and it's a powerful motivator for every one of us associated with this brand. You have our commitment to build on our incredible strength and deliver strong returns on your investments in us. 
With that, I'll turn it over to John. Thank you."

Net income w",2110,"Thanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. Today I'll provide additional insight around our third quarter financial results found in our press release and supporting slides. 
Starting on Slide 8. During the quarter, revenue was $1.27 billion. Net income was $114.1 million, and diluted earnings per share were $0.64. We -- as we anticipated, operating income from the motorcycle segment was down 23.9% from last year's third quarter. Segment revenue was down 4.3% in the quarter behind a 9.1% decrease in motorcycle shipments. Gross margin as a percent of revenue decreased versus prior year as a result of higher year-over-year manufacturing cost. SG&A was up in the quarter, as we increased our demand driving and product development investments. Operating income as a percent of revenue in Q3 was 10.0%.
At HDFS, operating income was down 4.6% year-over-year. We remain focused on driving demand and delivering strong margins and strong returns over the long term as we continue to navigate through the ongoing challenging conditions. 
Q3 worldwide retail sales of new Harley-Davidson motorcycles are summarized on Slide 9. Retail sales in international markets were up modestly. U.S. industry slowdown continued, driving Harley-Davidson retail sales down 7.1% in the U.S. and down 4.5% on a worldwide basis. Our increased investments in driving demand and product innovation are mitigating the effects of the intense global competitive environment, including the expanded price gaps to the competition in the U.S. and the impact of new product introductions. This is no more evident than with the overwhelmingly positive response to our model year 2017 motorcycles featuring the Milwaukee-Eight engine. Our new products drove significantly improved U.S. retail sales and market share in September. We also saw positive retail momentum in EMEA. And in Asia-Pacific, we are encouraged by the initial customer response as the 2017 models began arriving at the end of the quarter. 
Let's take a closer look at U.S. sales on Slide 10. Q3 retail sales in the U.S. were down behind continued weak industry results. We believe the industry continues to be impacted by lapping year-ago industry growth, driven by aggressive competitive discounting; weak sales in oil-dependent areas; and softer year-over-year used bike values across the industry. While the overall industry performance is disappointing, we are encouraged with our ongoing market share stability. Our Q3 share of 601+CC market was largely flat; however, our share in the month of September was up a strong 3.2 percentage points. Our year-to-date market share was up 0.8 percentage points to 50.8%. We believe our market share was driven by our demand-driving investments focused on growing product awareness and ridership in the U.S. and the fantastic response to our new 2017 model motorcycles featuring the Milwaukee-Eight engine.
While our competitors continue to engage in levels of discounting comparable to last year's third quarter, we are very pleased that we were able to grow our year-to-date market share in the U.S. with our brand-enhancing actions and our new innovative motorcycles.
In Q3, we completed the initial dealer fill of our 2017 model year motorcycles. This, combined with weak retail sales for most of the summer, drove higher than desired U.S. retail inventories at the end of the quarter. We are committed to our strategy to aggressively manage supply in line with demand and plan to reduce production in the fourth quarter in order to end the year with U.S. retail inventory flat to prior year.
On Slide 11, you'll see retail sales in our international markets were up 1.0% in Q3. During the quarter, EMEA retail sales were up 1.9%. The Milwaukee-Eight engine has received a great reception and provided a lift to retail sales in the month of September in the region. EMEA year-to-date market share was 10.3%, largely flat to prior year. Asia-Pacific retail sales were up modestly from prior year, driven by strong growth in Japan and Australia. We expect growth in the Asia-Pacific region to accelerate in Q4 behind improving availability of our 2017 model year motorcycles, the planned opening of approximately 11 new dealerships and the reopening of several dealerships in Indonesia, which were exited at the beginning of the year. Retail sales in Latin America were down in the quarter, driven by declines in Brazil.  Brazil's retail sales continued to be impacted by a slowing economy, consumer uncertainty and very aggressive price competition. In Q1, we increased model year 2016 motorcycle prices by approximately 23% in response to the devaluation of the real. 
Finally, retail sales growth in Canada continued in the third quarter, up 4.3% year-over-year. To support our strategic focus on increasing brand access, we plan to continue to expand our international distribution. 
On Slide 12, you'll see wholesale shipments of Harley-Davidson motorcycles in the quarter were down 9.1%, within our shipment guidance range.  Third quarter shipment mix was skewed toward touring, reflecting our investment in new 2017 touring motorcycles featuring the Milwaukee-Eight engine. 
On Slide 13, you'll see revenue for the motorcycles and related product segment was down in the third quarter behind a weak U.S. retail industry and our corresponding decrease in year-over-year motorcycles shipments. Revenue in the quarter was favorably impacted by currency exchange, higher pricing and mix. As a result, the average motorcycle revenue per unit was up $1,035 for the quarter. Wholesale and MSRP weighted average pricing for our new 2017 model year motorcycles increased by approximately 2 1/4%. After adjusting for the cost of new content, pricing net of cost increased approximately 1 1/4 percentage points expressed as a percent of revenue. Please note that these percent increases are more favorable than the estimates we included in the new model launch video in August. Parts and Accessories revenue was down behind lower motorcycle shipments and retail sales during the quarter. General Merchandise revenue was also down, driven by lower sales of sportswear and riding gear. 
Our gross margin review is on Slide 14. As expected, Q3 gross margin was unfavorable, driven by higher manufacturing costs, partially offset by favorable price, mix and raw materials. Additionally, currency exchange was favorable for the first time in 8 quarters, driven by higher revenues behind a slightly weaker U.S. dollar. Manufacturing costs were unfavorable by $18.7 million during the quarter. We expected significant unfavorable variances in manufacturing, largely driven by costs related to both the implementation of our ERP system in Kansas City and the launch of the new Milwaukee-Eight engine. We are also -- we also expect the loss absorption behind lower production during the quarter, as we implemented these 2 very successful programs.  Looking forward, we expect Q4 manufacturing cost to be favorable as we return to normal operations. Over the long term, we will continue to execute our strategies, investing in the future of our brand and the sport of motorcycling globally while delivering strong margins. 
On Slide 15, operating margin as a percent of revenue for the quarter was 10.0%, down compared to last year's third quarter. Operating margin was impacted by lower gross margin as well as higher SG&A, as we increased our investments in demand driving and product development. We remain intensely focused on a cost structure that will enable profitable growth and continuous improvement to drive our business to be stronger, more flexible and more profitable. 
Moving on to HDFS on Slide 16. During the quarter, HDFS' operating profit decreased $3.4 million or 4.6% compared to last year. The primary factors impacting third quarter results were: first, net interest income was up over prior year by $2.5 million. This increase was driven by higher receivables, partially offset by higher borrowing cost. Second, the provision for retail motorcycle loan losses increased over prior year by $10.1 million, driven by higher retail credit losses and associated increase in the allowance. 
HDFS' operational results are summarized on Slide 17. For the quarter, originations were down 10.2% compared to last year. HDFS' share of new -- of U.S. new retail sales were strong at 64.3%, yet down 5 percentage points as we lapped the impact of last year's low rate finance offers. Year-to-date loan originations were comprised of approximately 80% prime loans and 20% subprime. As a predominant industry lender to subprime customers, these originations continue to represent a significant number of retail sales to the company at very attractive returns. At the end of the quarter, we had $351.4 million of cash and cash equivalents at HDFS. In addition, HDFS had $983.7 million of available liquidity through bank credit and conduit facilities.
On Slide 18, you'll see 30-day delinquency rate for retail motorcycle loan receivables on our balance sheet was 3.61% or 45 basis points higher than Q3 2015. 12 basis points of the increase represents a change in mix of the portfolio after the Q2 full securitization of prime receivables. The delinquency rate on a managed basis, including those loans that were part of the full securitization, was 33 basis points higher than in the prior year, due in part to deterioration in oil-dependent areas and rising delinquencies across the portfolio, which is consistent with industry trends. The annualized credit loss rate for receivables on our balance sheet was 1.59% or 40 basis points higher than Q3 2015. On a managed basis, credit loss rate was 1.57%. The increase was the result of higher losses on loans in oil-dependent areas, normalizing loan performance and lower used bike values at auction. It is important to note that while both delinquencies and credit loss rates were up versus prior year, the rate of increase has remained constant over the last few quarters. During the quarter, HDFS continued to maintain a strong liquidity position and contributed strong profitability to the company. 
The remaining Harley-Davidson, Inc. financial results are summarized on Slide 19. A few things to note. Operating cash was down from last year, driven primarily by lower year-to-date net income. And year-to-date tax rate was 32.9%, which was lower than last year's tax rate behind the successful closure of various tax audits in Q2. The company has and intends to continue to maintain a minimum of 12 months of projected liquidity needs in cash and/or committed credit facilities.
Returning value to our shareholders is a top priority. We expect to return all excess cash to our shareholders in the form of increasing dividends and continued share repurchases. On Slide 20, you'll see we did both during the third quarter. We will continue to look for additional opportunities to maximize shareholder value by returning excess cash to our shareholders without damaging the long-term value of the company or the brand.
On Slide 21, you'll see our overall expectations for 2016. For the remainder of the year, we're confident in our shipment guidance of 264,000 to 269,000 motorcycles or approximately down 1% to up 1%. We are very encouraged by the momentum we experienced in the U.S. in September when our new model year 2017 motorcycles drove an increase in retail sales of approximately 5% and a more than 3 percentage point increase in market share.
We expect worldwide retail sales growth in the fourth quarter, driven by significant demand for our Milwaukee-Eight engine, our increased demand-driving investments, expansion of the international dealer network and lapping last year's U.S. industry decline of 3.8%.
During the quarter, we expect to ship between 44,200 and 49,200 motorcycles, down approximately 8% to up approximately 2%. As mentioned earlier, we expect to end the year with U.S. retail inventory being flat to prior year. Recognizing the slower industry growth that we are continuing to experience in the U.S., we will be streamlining our operations to be even more focused, aligned and agile. We expect a fourth quarter charge of approximately $20 million to $25 million primarily for employee separation and reorganization cost. Including on the reorganization charge, we continue to expect SG&A to be flat to up modestly and operating margin for the motorcycle segment to be 15% to 16% for 2016. As a percent of revenue, we now expect SG&A to be largely flat to prior year.
Overall, we are thrilled with the initial response to our new model year 2017 motorcycles despite the weakness in the U.S. industry retail sales. It highlights Harley-Davidson is a leader in new product innovation and reinforces our strategy to invest in new product development. We are on the right path, are disciplined in the execution of our strategies and continue to make necessary decisions intended to support the prudent retail inventory position and protect our strong brand and profitability into the future. We will continue to navigate through the challenging environment and are making investments to drive demand and deliver strong margins and strong returns over the long term.

And we talked a little bit earlier, we made some underwriting adjustments in oil-dependent areas in the United States a couple of quarters ago. The other piece of that is credit losses, and credit losses are also up in the neighborhood of 40 basis points year-over-year, which is certainly a concern. Still, when you look at credit losses over this period of time, Tim, we are in the 10-year historical average that we've had in terms of credit losses. And both in terms of delinquencies and credit losses, we're certainly within the models in our pricing and within our expectation of overall losses. Similarly, with credit losses, we've seen those rise a little bit more and longer than we have in terms of delinquencies. And that is really due to the softness that we've seen in the auction market that really started back in Q4 of 2014, somewhat aligned with the shift in world currencies. But again, overall, we are within what we've seen in historical norms over the last 10 years. We're not providing any projections going forward. But again, HDFS is addressing what we've got and making the changes that are necessary to continue to maintain their industry-leading profitability at HDFS."

And with regards to the overall pricing, we had mentioned that for the model year, we increased prices by 2 1/4%. And when you look at the value that we've added to our motorcycles, in particular touring motorcycles with our first new engine and design in 18 years and the benefits in terms of power acceleration, the suspension, heat management and you can go down the list in vibration and so on and so forth, we believe we've added significantly more value to the motorcycles than the pricing that we've taken. So we're confident with that pricing, and we've enjoyed the ability to price our motorcycles for the last several years. And we feel good about where we're at with this price increase moving into our 2017 model year."

With regards to overall guidance, 264,000 to 269,000 units, we are confident. Third quarter was a tough quarter for us, certainly lower than what we had expected, but still confident in hitting our guidance. And you're absolutely right, inventory was up 9,700 units, much higher than we would like at this point in the year, but in line with what we saw in the second quarter. Second quarter, we were up about 8,600 units and put more inventory in the system because of the ERP implementation that we did. We would hope to burn off more of that inventory over the third quarter. That didn't happen. But we did not take -- as Matt had mentioned upfront, we did not take the actions of reducing production at that time because of the fact that we've got our new model year 2017 motorcycles out. And to get worldwide dealer fill, it was important that we continued to produce. So as we look forward to the fourth quarter, we are committed to bringing inventories in line with prior year levels at the end of the year. And that will happen in 2 ways, Joe: one, we expect retail sales growth in the fourth quarter, driven by several things, the Milwaukee-Eight engine; the demand-driving investments that we're making, which have been very effective; the dealer expansion. I believe in the fourth quarter, we got 16 dealerships opening. And as far as I remember, that's the most we've ever opened in a quarter. So that will help benefit it.  And then finally, lapping the very soft industry on a year-ago basis. So retail sales growth. The other piece is we will be taking production down in the fourth quarter. We are absolutely completely committed to managing supply in line with demand and expect to be flat on a year-over-year basis. Your second question, Joe, is with regards to the savings.  Again, Sharon had asked about $30 million to $35 million of savings, and we will use that again to protect our margins into the future. We will continue to invest at very high levels of marketing spend, and it will also make sure that in a slower growth environment, we're a little bit more defensive and protective of those margins. And we're looking to maintain them as we move into 2017."

We have added year-to-date 20 and expected 16 in the fourth quarter, helps us with our reach internationally. So those to me are the big hitters. The -- in general, the envelope around it is just making sure that we increase awareness and -- of the brand and of the products along the way. All of those have gone really well according to our expectations. Obviously, we learn with everything we do, and we continue to dial in our efforts going forward. In particular, Riding Academy is going to continue to be a high leverage asset for us, how do we make sure that the 52,000 people are the right kinds of new riders that have a long life with us and are going through the class and are high-yield riders coming out the other side and working with our dealers to both expand the number of them that offer the class as well as the number of classes they are able to offer and the conversion rate of everybody that goes through it is going to be a key focus of Riding Academy going forward. And we'll continue to dial in everything that we're doing, learn from everything that we're doing as well as exploring new opportunities as they emerge to drive demand for the products and for the brand.

Those are the 2 markets that we had distribution of our model year '17 motorcycles in. They just started reaching our Asia-Pacific region very late in the quarter. So we expect certainly a lift from the new product in the fourth quarter in those markets as well as in Latin America. They will arrive even later into the fourth quarter.

So I guess, the implication is you're more optimistic about the fourth quarter for us to still be able to get to those same numbers. And I guess, second question sort of in the context of the color you gave on September, the math would seem to suggest that the fourth quarter needs to be even better than that 5% growth just to get to the low end of the guidance and probably more like double digits to get to the midpoint. Have your -- even within your guidance, have -- are you -- towards the lower end of those numbers, help us square how third quarter was so much worse than you thought and now you're still maintaining the guidance?"

But, James, we do not need the level of growth that you stated. I think you said mid-single digits to high or significantly higher than what we did in the month of September. That is not accurate. So 2 things you need to go back and look at is when you look at the retail sales and try to equate them to wholesale shipments, the base of those 2 numbers starting the year were different off of a couple of thousand units. And while we'll maintain inventories flat on a year-over-year basis in the United States, we do expect inventory growth in our international markets. We will be adding 36 new dealerships, and we will certainly need inventory to help support that growth, which is about 5% increase in our international dealerships. So with those 2 things included in the computation, it is much less than needed, much less to hold the guidance than to come in at the low end or the high end of the guidance for the full year guidance.

Yes, with regards to the manufacturing expense, we have certainly had a tremendous amount of startup cost going on and lower run rates. As we exited the third quarter, #1 is the ERP system came up flawlessly as did the cutover to the new engine. We spent a lot of money on training our workforce and making sure that things went well. As we exited the third quarter, the plants were up and running at speed, and that will be the biggest driver of our year-over-year improvement from last year. We still will have lower production. So we'll have a headwind in overall manufacturing expense on lost absorption. But given the running of the plant and the speed that we're at, we would expect that manufacturing expenses would be favorable in the fourth quarter.  The second question that you asked, David, was of 9,700 units of higher inventory, what percentage is of carryover motorcycles. I do not know the absolute percentage of that. And it really -- it's hard to tell, because that's just the increase in inventory. What I can tell you is model year 2016 carryover inventory is a much bigger percentage of the total inventory that we have in the system than we would like at this point, and it is higher than what we had on a year-over-year basis. The dealers are doing a very good job of burning through that carryover. But it is, no doubt, higher than we want, and that is the appropriate level. Remember, coming into the year, we were producing [indiscernible] pull back on as much production as we could in the second quarter. We were cutting over to a new model year. And so we ended up with higher overall inventories. We are helping the dealers. Our dealers are doing a good job burning through the inventory, and we are helping them. We've got a 3-pronged approach in the marketplace right now to help out with that. 2 are more consumer-focused. 1 is more dealer-focused. Of the 2 consumer-focused programs, 1 is financing, finance offers which we have on some of the models that we're more long on. I believe that's 4 touring models and 1 Dyna model. And what that is, is 1.99% no money down offer for top tier. A significantly less coverage than we had a year ago, so less, but an opportunity to help our customers and dealers there. And then secondly is winter warranty program for our customers. This is not a new program to Harley-Davidson, but we didn't have it -- we didn't offer it in the last couple of years. What that does, David, is any for our customers that buy a motorcycle in the United States in the winter months will get that added on to their warranty coverage. So effectively, everyone that buys a motorcycle between now and April 1, their warranty -- 2-year warranty will start effectively April 1, so a consumer incentive there. And then the final one is, is that a common practice among our dealers is to trade motorcycles, to get the right color. Where they are long on one model and short on another. They do a lot of trading. What we've done is for carryover '16 models, we will help defray the cost of that trading that goes on. And so we hope to encourage and facilitate getting the right motorcycles to the right dealers at the right time to move through as much of the carryover inventory as quickly as we can."

And most of those -- we've got a fair amount of casual workers in the workforce, and certainty, we look to lay those off -- those folks off first. But we did lay off a couple of hundred of our employees. In terms of that workforce, during surge periods, we can surge up to 30%. But in any given period of time, it's much less in terms of casual workforce in the hourly ranks. In terms of on salaried side, I don't know what the percentage is, Adam. But as we look to become leaner and more focused, we will lose some of the contingent workforce that we have working here. And unfortunately, we will also lose some of our full-time employees."

Parts and Accessories and General Merchandise were both soft during the quarter. P&A was down, I believe, 8.3% and General Merchandise 5.5%. But, Jaime, you also have to look at that in context of kind of what they track to. Our overall shipments were down 9.1%. And some of our Parts and Accessories business tracks pretty well with shipments, as dealers get motorcycles in and make changes to them. And then they also both track pretty well to retail sales as well, which on a worldwide basis was down 4.5% and 7% in the United States. So when you look at both P&A and General Merchandise, they're down, kind of straddling between what we were down in retail for the quarter in wholesale. So on a year-to-date basis, Parts and Accessories, I think, is down about 2.5%. And we've got retail sales down about that same amount, 1.9%. So on a year-to-date basis, they're tracking pretty much what we've seen in that relationship historically. Jaime, the second question was with regards to overall inventory. If you remember, going back to the fourth quarter, we had inventory up quite significantly. Matter of fact, it was up about 33%, and that was to get a quick start in supporting the marketing spending that we were doing in the first quarter. And at that time, we said we would burn that inventory off throughout the year and each year -- each periods come down. And I'm certainly happy to say that in the third quarter, overall inventory was down about $40 million, driven largely by finished goods inventory, partially offset by a little bit of rise in Parts and Accessories and General Merchandise. And so overall inventory is down about 9%. As we look to the fourth quarter, we would expect overall inventories to be down as well on a year-end basis."

I had a question, if you had to itemize the sort of negative drivers that you've experienced throughout the industry for this year, what have been the most significant factors affecting U.S. sales? Because it seems like the trend is decidedly departed from the last 3 to 4 years. And following on that, to what extent do you see the current year's weakness as being more cyclical or secular in nature? And a quick follow-up.

So when we look at the year and the negative drivers are all based on the industry, David. Market share, we couldn't be more pleased with.

So when we look at the year and the negative drivers are all based on the industry, David. Market share, we couldn't be more pleased with. Again, coming into the year, our direct objective was to stabilize market share. On a year-to-date basis, market share is up 0.8%. And even when you look at the third quarter, market share was flat. But if you peel back a little bit further than that in the categories that we compete in, in the third quarter, that being touring, large cruisers and small cruisers, our market share was up quite significantly, up a full percentage point in those markets. And we gained market share in all 3 segments. So we're competing extremely well without discounting. And that is the equity spending that we're going on brand-building activities Matt had talked a little bit about before. So that aspect is going very well, going better than what we had expected. What the negative drivers are is clearly around the industry. And we've seen the industry that's performed very well over the last 5 years up through 2015, a CAGR of 2.9%. And we got into this year and we had about a percentage point increase in the first quarter. And then again toward the end of April, things really started to fall out. When you look at what's driving the industry, one is up through 3 quarters is lapping very strong year ago numbers. On a year-to-date basis, the industry was up about 6-point-something percent, and that was driven by the onset of discounting. So last year was the first benefit that the competition got from significant price reductions. So we are facing that headwind. That will start to reverse, David, in the fourth quarter as a year-ago's fourth quarter comp is much easier and actually was down almost 4%. So that we start to see reversing. The second big driver is the weak oil-dependent sales. And this is again an overall industry problem. We've talked about our numbers. And the last 3 quarters leading up to the third quarter, we've seen that down about 10%. So that's been a significant drag on the industry. Now in the third quarter, we actually saw that accelerate. Certainly disappointed with that, but we saw that increase to a level of about, well, 15% down in oil-dependent areas in the quarter. The industry also saw an acceleration of that number. So when you talk about going forward, how does that continue, anyone's guess in the short term, but at some point when that plateaus, we'll have a lower base and be able to grow off of that. And then the third one is soft used values, which the industry has experienced for the last several quarters. Again, we've talked about the bikes that go through our dealer network, which is about 1/3 of the used bikes. Used bike prices held up very well through the third quarter of 2015. And over the last 3 or 4 quarters, we've seen some softness in used bikes as well as the industry. Our bikes continue to hold its value better than the industry by far, but we are seeing used bike values fall. That's short-term headwind on new bike sales. Long term, it's not necessarily a bad thing, and that does bring a lot of new people into the industry. And a matter of fact for Harley-Davidson, the vast majority of new people coming into the brand come in on used motorcycles. So there's certainly some positive to that. But the industry work through that softness, and we would expect that to stabilize at some point in the future. The second question that you asked, David, was with regards to trading of motorcycles between dealers. And you had used the term 'used' in describing that. What we are doing to move model year '16 carryover motorcycles are just for new motorcycles, have nothing to do with used. Matter of fact, there was a report out last week that talked about change in used strategy, and I think there was some confusion with regards to what we're doing on model year 2016 carryover, new motorcycles to move them, help our dealers move them, which includes facilitating and defraying the cost of trading versus anything to do with used. So I want to make that clarification."

There is also other costs in there, loss absorption. Production is down on a year-over-year basis as well as in the second quarter, we had a fair amount of obsolescence as we tried to pull back just before the new model year came out.

Before John goes into the financial results, I'd like to cover the market and company performance for the quarter and provide context on what we see going forward.
First, while we recognize that the environment continues to be challenging, we believe we're on the right course in making prudent decisions for our future by focusing our investments on growing the sport and Harley-Davidson's place in it. We're focused on influencing customer choice and growing our reach and impact with customers, all with delivering strong returns to investors. We continue to be pleased with our market share performance, given the fierce competition in the U.S. market and ongoing global macroeconomic challenges. Third quarter market share was essentially flat in the U.S., as we maintained our strong leadership with over half of the 601+CC market. Our overall market share performance in the U.S. and gains in other key global markets, like Australia and Japan, provides strong affirmation of the progress we're making with our investments to drive demand through awareness, access, increased ridership and bold new products to reach more people in more places. 
An absolute highlight of the quarter was the reaction around the world to our model year 2017 new products. One of our key areas of focus is to accelerate the cadence and impact of new products, and in late August, we delivered. We could not be more pleased with the launch of and response to our model year 2017 lineup. Most notably, we've had an extremely positive reaction to our Milwaukee-Eight engine, which we debuted on all of our touring motorcycles in conjunction with a redesigned upgraded suspension.
We know what our riders want, and we delivered with a big step forward that accentuates everything we're known for, a powertrain and chassis package with innovative technologies that provide more torque, more horsepower, greater comfort and enhanced look, sound and feel. The feedback from riders, dealers and industry experts alike has been tremendous.  All it takes is one ride to feel the power the Milwaukee-Eight engine brings to our riders and to the company going forward. The significance of the Milwaukee-Eight engine is already evident.  In September, we saw touring sales in the U.S. increase by double digits, along with increased demand for test rides. Given initial results, we're confident the entire lineup will drive our retail sales for the remainder of 2016 and position us well heading into the spring riding season and beyond.
As we indicated on our last call, we will continue to manage supply in line with demand. We maintained production ahead of retail in the third quarter in order to support the initial dealer fill of model year '17 motorcycles, and we plan to reduce production in the fourth quarter to finish the year with flat year-over-year U.S. retail inventory.
As we look ahead, continued softness in the U.S. industry is a clear area of concern, and we're taking further steps to be sure we're positioned appropriately. In Q4, we'll be streamlining our organization to execute our demand-driving strategies with increased focus, alignment and agility. John will provide the financial details around these steps momentarily. Our strategy to invest in driving demand around the world is unchanged, and we're steadfast in our commitment to deliver strong returns to investors while doing so.
Harley-Davidson has been in the motorcycle business continuously since 1903. And during that time, we've experienced all types of economic, market and industry ups and downs, and today is no different. We believe our strategy is sound, and every decision we make is tied to driving it forward and delivering for all of our stakeholders. We're intensely focused on gaining and securing market share in the 90-plus markets we're in and doing so profitability. The launch of the Milwaukee-Eight-powered touring motorcycles is one powerful example of how we lead by delivering for our passionate and loyal riders. We're also investing to reach new riders by growing distribution internationally and by training new riders right here in United States. Through September, we've trained over 52,000 riders this year through the Harley-Davidson Riding Academy in the United States, demonstrating that we're building momentum in bringing new riders into our sport and brand through this fantastic competitive advantage.
During the quarter, we opened 9 new international dealerships and a total of 20 year-to-date. In the fourth quarter, we expect to add another 16 new dealers and reenter Indonesia, all part of our strategy to increase access to our sport and brand by adding 150 to 200 new dealerships internationally by 2020. 
Last week, I was with our Asia-Pacific team in China and Singapore. I was able to see the team in action as they continue their efforts to grow our reach and impact in these important markets. I was also privileged to engage with passionate dealers who are investing with confidence in Harley-Davidson's future. It's in these experiences that I'm reminded of what incredible strength we have in our people and in our worldwide dealer network. Looking forward, we acknowledge that economics and political uncertainty weighs on the minds of consumers in the U.S. and in some of the other markets where Harley-Davidson competes. As the industry leader, we believe we're best positioned to strengthen the sport of motorcycling over time. We'll continue to manage the company and brand and will not compromise by taking shortcuts that would diminish customer loyalty and passion or sacrifice our strong company fundamentals.
We'll lean into our strengths in product development and our unrivaled connection to our riders to continue to bring innovative products to market that drive engagement and participation in our brand worldwide. The new Milwaukee-Eight engine is a powerful example, but it's just one example of the strength of our product plan for 2017 and beyond. Harley-Davidson gives people a way to experience and express their own personal freedom. This is our purpose, and it's a powerful motivator for every one of us associated with this brand. You have our commitment to build on our incredible strength and deliver strong returns on your investments in us. 
With that, I'll turn it over to John. Thank you."

Starting on Slide 8. During the quarter, revenue was $1.27 billion. Net income was $114.1 million, and diluted earnings per share were $0.64. We -- as we anticipated, operating income from the motorcycle segment was down 23.9% from last year's third quarter. Segment revenue was down 4.3% in the quarter behind a 9.1% decrease in motorcycle shipments. Gross margin as a percent of revenue decreased versus prior year as a result of higher year-over-year manufacturing cost. SG&A was up in the quarter, as we increased our demand driving and product development investments. Operating income as a percent of revenue in Q3 was 10.0%.
At HDFS, operating income was down 4.6% year-over-year. We remain focused on driving demand and delivering strong margins and strong returns over the long term as we continue to navigate through the ongoing challenging conditions. 
Q3 worldwide retail sales of new Harley-Davidson motorcycles are summarized on Slide 9. Retail sales in international markets were up modestly. U.S. industry slowdown continued, driving Harley-Davidson retail sales down 7.1% in the U.S. and down 4.5% on a worldwide basis. Our increased investments in driving demand and product innovation are mitigating the effects of the intense global competitive environment, including the expanded price gaps to the competition in the U.S. and the impact of new product introductions. This is no more evident than with the overwhelmingly positive response to our model year 2017 motorcycles featuring the Milwaukee-Eight engine. Our new products drove significantly improved U.S. retail sales and market share in September. We also saw positive retail momentum in EMEA. And in Asia-Pacific, we are encouraged by the initial customer response as the 2017 models began arriving at the end of the quarter. 
Let's take a closer look at U.S. sales on Slide 10. Q3 retail sales in the U.S. were down behind continued weak industry results. We believe the industry continues to be impacted by lapping year-ago industry growth, driven by aggressive competitive discounting; weak sales in oil-dependent areas; and softer year-over-year used bike values across the industry. While the overall industry performance is disappointing, we are encouraged with our ongoing market share stability. Our Q3 share of 601+CC market was largely flat; however, our share in the month of September was up a strong 3.2 percentage points. Our year-to-date market share was up 0.8 percentage points to 50.8%. We believe our market share was driven by our demand-driving investments focused on growing product awareness and ridership in the U.S. and the fantastic response to our new 2017 model motorcycles featuring the Milwaukee-Eight engine.
While our competitors continue to engage in levels of discounting comparable to last year's third quarter, we are very pleased that we were able to grow our year-to-date market share in the U.S. with our brand-enhancing actions and our new innovative motorcycles.
In Q3, we completed the initial dealer fill of our 2017 model year motorcycles. This, combined with weak retail sales for most of the summer, drove higher than desired U.S. retail inventories at the end of the quarter. We are committed to our strategy to aggressively manage supply in line with demand and plan to reduce production in the fourth quarter in order to end the year with U.S. retail inventory flat to prior year.
On Slide 11, you'll see retail sales in our international markets were up 1.0% in Q3. During the quarter, EMEA retail sales were up 1.9%. The Milwaukee-Eight engine has received a great reception and provided a lift to retail sales in the month of September in the region. EMEA year-to-date market share was 10.3%, largely flat to prior year. Asia-Pacific retail sales were up modestly from prior year, driven by strong growth in Japan and Australia. We expect growth in the Asia-Pacific region to accelerate in Q4 behind improving availability of our 2017 model year motorcycles, the planned opening of approximately 11 new dealerships and the reopening of several dealerships in Indonesia, which were exited at the beginning of the year. Retail sales in Latin America were down in the quarter, driven by declines in Brazil.  Brazil's retail sales continued to be impacted by a slowing economy, consumer uncertainty and very aggressive price competition. In Q1, we increased model year 2016 motorcycle prices by approximately 23% in response to the devaluation of the real. 
Finally, retail sales growth in Canada continued in the third quarter, up 4.3% year-over-year. To support our strategic focus on increasing brand access, we plan to continue to expand our international distribution. 
On Slide 12, you'll see wholesale shipments of Harley-Davidson motorcycles in the quarter were down 9.1%, within our shipment guidance range.  Third quarter shipment mix was skewed toward touring, reflecting our investment in new 2017 touring motorcycles featuring the Milwaukee-Eight engine. 
On Slide 13, you'll see revenue for the motorcycles and related product segment was down in the third quarter behind a weak U.S. retail industry and our corresponding decrease in year-over-year motorcycles shipments. Revenue in the quarter was favorably impacted by currency exchange, higher pricing and mix. As a result, the average motorcycle revenue per unit was up $1,035 for the quarter. Wholesale and MSRP weighted average pricing for our new 2017 model year motorcycles increased by approximately 2 1/4%. After adjusting for the cost of new content, pricing net of cost increased approximately 1 1/4 percentage points expressed as a percent of revenue. Please note that these percent increases are more favorable than the estimates we included in the new model launch video in August. Parts and Accessories revenue was down behind lower motorcycle shipments and retail sales during the quarter. General Merchandise revenue was also down, driven by lower sales of sportswear and riding gear. 
Our gross margin review is on Slide 14. As expected, Q3 gross margin was unfavorable, driven by higher manufacturing costs, partially offset by favorable price, mix and raw materials. Additionally, currency exchange was favorable for the first time in 8 quarters, driven by higher revenues behind a slightly weaker U.S. dollar. Manufacturing costs were unfavorable by $18.7 million during the quarter. We expected significant unfavorable variances in manufacturing, largely driven by costs related to both the implementation of our ERP system in Kansas City and the launch of the new Milwaukee-Eight engine. We are also -- we also expect the loss absorption behind lower production during the quarter, as we implemented these 2 very successful programs.  Looking forward, we expect Q4 manufacturing cost to be favorable as we return to normal operations. Over the long term, we will continue to execute our strategies, investing in the future of our brand and the sport of motorcycling globally while delivering strong margins. 
On Slide 15, operating margin as a percent of revenue for the quarter was 10.0%, down compared to last year's third quarter. Operating margin was impacted by lower gross margin as well as higher SG&A, as we increased our investments in demand driving and product development. We remain intensely focused on a cost structure that will enable profitable growth and continuous improvement to drive our business to be stronger, more flexible and more profitable. 
Moving on to HDFS on Slide 16. During the quarter, HDFS' operating profit decreased $3.4 million or 4.6% compared to last year. The primary factors impacting third quarter results were: first, net interest income was up over prior year by $2.5 million. This increase was driven by higher receivables, partially offset by higher borrowing cost. Second, the provision for retail motorcycle loan losses increased over prior year by $10.1 million, driven by higher retail credit losses and associated increase in the allowance. 
HDFS' operational results are summarized on Slide 17. For the quarter, originations were down 10.2% compared to last year. HDFS' share of new -- of U.S. new retail sales were strong at 64.3%, yet down 5 percentage points as we lapped the impact of last year's low rate finance offers. Year-to-date loan originations were comprised of approximately 80% prime loans and 20% subprime. As a predominant industry lender to subprime customers, these originations continue to represent a significant number of retail sales to the company at very attractive returns. At the end of the quarter, we had $351.4 million of cash and cash equivalents at HDFS. In addition, HDFS had $983.7 million of available liquidity through bank credit and conduit facilities.
On Slide 18, you'll see 30-day delinquency rate for retail motorcycle loan receivables on our balance sheet was 3.61% or 45 basis points higher than Q3 2015. 12 basis points of the increase represents a change in mix of the portfolio after the Q2 full securitization of prime receivables. The delinquency rate on a managed basis, including those loans that were part of the full securitization, was 33 basis points higher than in the prior year, due in part to deterioration in oil-dependent areas and rising delinquencies across the portfolio, which is consistent with industry trends. The annualized credit loss rate for receivables on our balance sheet was 1.59% or 40 basis points higher than Q3 2015. On a managed basis, credit loss rate was 1.57%. The increase was the result of higher losses on loans in oil-dependent areas, normalizing loan performance and lower used bike values at auction. It is important to note that while both delinquencies and credit loss rates were up versus prior year, the rate of increase has remained constant over the last few quarters. During the quarter, HDFS continued to maintain a strong liquidity position and contributed strong profitability to the company. 
The remaining Harley-Davidson, Inc. financial results are summarized on Slide 19. A few things to note. Operating cash was down from last year, driven primarily by lower year-to-date net income. And year-to-date tax rate was 32.9%, which was lower than last year's tax rate behind the successful closure of various tax audits in Q2. The company has and intends to continue to maintain a minimum of 12 months of projected liquidity needs in cash and/or committed credit facilities.
Returning value to our shareholders is a top priority. We expect to return all excess cash to our shareholders in the form of increasing dividends and continued share repurchases. On Slide 20, you'll see we did both during the third quarter. We will continue to look for additional opportunities to maximize shareholder value by returning excess cash to our shareholders without damaging the long-term value of the company or the brand.
On Slide 21, you'll see our overall expectations for 2016. For the remainder of the year, we're confident in our shipment guidance of 264,000 to 269,000 motorcycles or approximately down 1% to up 1%. We are very encouraged by the momentum we experienced in the U.S. in September when our new model year 2017 motorcycles drove an increase in retail sales of approximately 5% and a more than 3 percentage point increase in market share.
We expect worldwide retail sales growth in the fourth quarter, driven by significant demand for our Milwaukee-Eight engine, our increased demand-driving investments, expansion of the international dealer network and lapping last year's U.S. industry decline of 3.8%.
During the quarter, we expect to ship between 44,200 and 49,200 motorcycles, down approximately 8% to up approximately 2%. As mentioned earlier, we expect to end the year with U.S. retail inventory being flat to prior year. Recognizing the slower industry growth that we are continuing to experience in the U.S., we will be streamlining our operations to be even more focused, aligned and agile. We expect a fourth quarter charge of approximately $20 million to $25 million primarily for employee separation and reorganization cost. Including on the reorganization charge, we continue to expect SG&A to be flat to up modestly and operating margin for the motorcycle segment to be 15% to 16% for 2016. As a percent of revenue, we now expect SG&A to be largely flat to prior year.
Overall, we are thrilled with the initial response to our new model year 2017 motorcycles despite the weakness in the U.S. industry retail sales. It highlights Harley-Davidson is a leader in new product innovation and reinforces our strategy to invest in new product development. We are on the right path, are disciplined in the execution of our strategies and continue to make necessary decisions intended to support the prudent retail inventory position and protect our strong brand and profitability into the future. We will continue to navigate through the challenging environment and are making investments to drive demand and deliver strong margins and strong returns over the long term.

When we look at both delinquencies and credit losses, we certainly have seen an increase on a year-over-year basis. And starting with delinquencies, as we've discussed, the delinquencies have been at historical lows. I mean, they have really been low since the last 3 or 4 years. And so with the rise -- and we've seen on a year-over-year basis about a 33-basis point increase. That increase has held steady over the last 3-or-so quarters but is higher year-over-year. But even with that, Tim, delinquencies are near historical lows and certainly still much better than they were prior to the downturn that we experienced. So we're keeping an eye on it. HDFS is doing an absolutely fantastic job, working collections as well as tweaking the underwriting that we've got. And we talked a little bit earlier, we made some underwriting adjustments in oil-dependent areas in the United States a couple of quarters ago. The other piece of that is credit losses, and credit losses are also up in the neighborhood of 40 basis points year-over-year, which is certainly a concern. Still, when you look at credit losses over this period of time, Tim, we are in the 10-year historical average that we've had in terms of credit losses. And both in terms of delinquencies and credit losses, we're certainly within the models in our pricing and within our expectation of overall losses. Similarly, with credit losses, we've seen those rise a little bit more and longer than we have in terms of delinquencies. And that is really due to the softness that we've seen in the auction market that really started back in Q4 of 2014, somewhat aligned with the shift in world currencies. But again, overall, we are within what we've seen in historical norms over the last 10 years. We're not providing any projections going forward. But again, HDFS is addressing what we've got and making the changes that are necessary to continue to maintain their industry-leading profitability at HDFS."

And with regards to the overall pricing, we had mentioned that for the model year, we increased prices by 2 1/4%. And when you look at the value that we've added to our motorcycles, in particular touring motorcycles with our first new engine and design in 18 years and the benefits in terms of power acceleration, the suspension, heat management and you can go down the list in vibration and so on and so forth, we believe we've added significantly more value to the motorcycles than the pricing that we've taken. So we're confident with that pricing, and we've enjoyed the ability to price our motorcycles for the last several years. And we feel good about where we're at with this price increase moving into our 2017 model year."

With regards to overall guidance, 264,000 to 269,000 units, we are confident. Third quarter was a tough quarter for us, certainly lower than what we had expected, but still confident in hitting our guidance. And you're absolutely right, inventory was up 9,700 units, much higher than we would like at this point in the year, but in line with what we saw in the second quarter. Second quarter, we were up about 8,600 units and put more inventory in the system because of the ERP implementation that we did. We would hope to burn off more of that inventory over the third quarter. That didn't happen. But we did not take -- as Matt had mentioned upfront, we did not take the actions of reducing production at that time because of the fact that we've got our new model year 2017 motorcycles out. And to get worldwide dealer fill, it was important that we continued to produce. So as we look forward to the fourth quarter, we are committed to bringing inventories in line with prior year levels at the end of the year. And that will happen in 2 ways, Joe: one, we expect retail sales growth in the fourth quarter, driven by several things, the Milwaukee-Eight engine; the demand-driving investments that we're making, which have been very effective; the dealer expansion. I believe in the fourth quarter, we got 16 dealerships opening. And as far as I remember, that's the most we've ever opened in a quarter. So that will help benefit it.  And then finally, lapping the very soft industry on a year-ago basis. So retail sales growth. The other piece is we will be taking production down in the fourth quarter. We are absolutely completely committed to managing supply in line with demand and expect to be flat on a year-over-year basis. Your second question, Joe, is with regards to the savings.  Again, Sharon had asked about $30 million to $35 million of savings, and we will use that again to protect our margins into the future. We will continue to invest at very high levels of marketing spend, and it will also make sure that in a slower growth environment, we're a little bit more defensive and protective of those margins. And we're looking to maintain them as we move into 2017."

Also, benefiting 2016 operating margin would be the fact that we expect manufacturing expense to be favorable. So again, through the first 3 quarters of this year, we had significant unfavorability in manufacturing expense, driven by 2 huge initiatives, the ERP implementation and our first new engine in 18 years.

We have added year-to-date 20 and expected 16 in the fourth quarter, helps us with our reach internationally. So those to me are the big hitters. The -- in general, the envelope around it is just making sure that we increase awareness and -- of the brand and of the products along the way. All of those have gone really well according to our expectations. Obviously, we learn with everything we do, and we continue to dial in our efforts going forward. In particular, Riding Academy is going to continue to be a high leverage asset for us, how do we make sure that the 52,000 people are the right kinds of new riders that have a long life with us and are going through the class and are high-yield riders coming out the other side and working with our dealers to both expand the number of them that offer the class as well as the number of classes they are able to offer and the conversion rate of everybody that goes through it is going to be a key focus of Riding Academy going forward. And we'll continue to dial in everything that we're doing, learn from everything that we're doing as well as exploring new opportunities as they emerge to drive demand for the products and for the brand.

So 2 things you need to go back and look at is when you look at the retail sales and try to equate them to wholesale shipments, the base of those 2 numbers starting the year were different off of a couple of thousand units. And while we'll maintain inventories flat on a year-over-year basis in the United States, we do expect inventory growth in our international markets. We will be adding 36 new dealerships, and we will certainly need inventory to help support that growth, which is about 5% increase in our international dealerships. So with those 2 things included in the computation, it is much less than needed, much less to hold the guidance than to come in at the low end or the high end of the guidance for the full year guidance. But again, we do feel very good about the momentum that we've got coming out of the month of September and the reaction to our new product from the media, our dealers and customers around the world."

Yes, with regards to the manufacturing expense, we have certainly had a tremendous amount of startup cost going on and lower run rates. As we exited the third quarter, #1 is the ERP system came up flawlessly as did the cutover to the new engine. We spent a lot of money on training our workforce and making sure that things went well. As we exited the third quarter, the plants were up and running at speed, and that will be the biggest driver of our year-over-year improvement from last year. We still will have lower production. So we'll have a headwind in overall manufacturing expense on lost absorption. But given the running of the plant and the speed that we're at, we would expect that manufacturing expenses would be favorable in the fourth quarter.  The second question that you asked, David, was of 9,700 units of higher inventory, what percentage is of carryover motorcycles. I do not know the absolute percentage of that. And it really -- it's hard to tell, because that's just the increase in inventory. What I can tell you is model year 2016 carryover inventory is a much bigger percentage of the total inventory that we have in the system than we would like at this point, and it is higher than what we had on a year-over-year basis. The dealers are doing a very good job of burning through that carryover. But it is, no doubt, higher than we want, and that is the appropriate level. Remember, coming into the year, we were producing [indiscernible] pull back on as much production as we could in the second quarter. We were cutting over to a new model year. And so we ended up with higher overall inventories. We are helping the dealers. Our dealers are doing a good job burning through the inventory, and we are helping them. We've got a 3-pronged approach in the marketplace right now to help out with that. 2 are more consumer-focused. 1 is more dealer-focused. Of the 2 consumer-focused programs, 1 is financing, finance offers which we have on some of the models that we're more long on. I believe that's 4 touring models and 1 Dyna model. And what that is, is 1.99% no money down offer for top tier. A significantly less coverage than we had a year ago, so less, but an opportunity to help our customers and dealers there. And then secondly is winter warranty program for our customers. This is not a new program to Harley-Davidson, but we didn't have it -- we didn't offer it in the last couple of years. What that does, David, is any for our customers that buy a motorcycle in the United States in the winter months will get that added on to their warranty coverage. So effectively, everyone that buys a motorcycle between now and April 1, their warranty -- 2-year warranty will start effectively April 1, so a consumer incentive there. And then the final one is, is that a common practice among our dealers is to trade motorcycles, to get the right color. Where they are long on one model and short on another. They do a lot of trading. What we've done is for carryover '16 models, we will help defray the cost of that trading that goes on. And so we hope to encourage and facilitate getting the right motorcycles to the right dealers at the right time to move through as much of the carryover inventory as quickly as we can."

Parts and Accessories and General Merchandise were both soft during the quarter. P&A was down, I believe, 8.3% and General Merchandise 5.5%. But, Jaime, you also have to look at that in context of kind of what they track to. Our overall shipments were down 9.1%. And some of our Parts and Accessories business tracks pretty well with shipments, as dealers get motorcycles in and make changes to them. And then they also both track pretty well to retail sales as well, which on a worldwide basis was down 4.5% and 7% in the United States. So when you look at both P&A and General Merchandise, they're down, kind of straddling between what we were down in retail for the quarter in wholesale. So on a year-to-date basis, Parts and Accessories, I think, is down about 2.5%. And we've got retail sales down about that same amount, 1.9%. So on a year-to-date basis, they're tracking pretty much what we've seen in that relationship historically. Jaime, the second question was with regards to overall inventory. If you remember, going back to the fourth quarter, we had inventory up quite significantly. Matter of fact, it was up about 33%, and that was to get a quick start in supporting the marketing spending that we were doing in the first quarter. And at that time, we said we would burn that inventory off throughout the year and each year -- each periods come down. And I'm certainly happy to say that in the third quarter, overall inventory was down about $40 million, driven largely by finished goods inventory, partially offset by a little bit of rise in Parts and Accessories and General Merchandise. And so overall inventory is down about 9%. As we look to the fourth quarter, we would expect overall inventories to be down as well on a year-end basis."

And following on that, to what extent do you see the current year's weakness as being more cyclical or secular in nature? And a quick follow-up.

I was just curious what exactly or the extent to which those costs are material or nor or any additional detail you could provide there."

So when we look at the year and the negative drivers are all based on the industry, David. Market share, we couldn't be more pleased with. Again, coming into the year, our direct objective was to stabilize market share. On a year-to-date basis, market share is up 0.8%. And even when you look at the third quarter, market share was flat. But if you peel back a little bit further than that in the categories that we compete in, in the third quarter, that being touring, large cruisers and small cruisers, our market share was up quite significantly, up a full percentage point in those markets. And we gained market share in all 3 segments. So we're competing extremely well without discounting. And that is the equity spending that we're going on brand-building activities Matt had talked a little bit about before. So that aspect is going very well, going better than what we had expected. What the negative drivers are is clearly around the industry. And we've seen the industry that's performed very well over the last 5 years up through 2015, a CAGR of 2.9%. And we got into this year and we had about a percentage point increase in the first quarter. And then again toward the end of April, things really started to fall out. When you look at what's driving the industry, one is up through 3 quarters is lapping very strong year ago numbers. On a year-to-date basis, the industry was up about 6-point-something percent, and that was driven by the onset of discounting. So last year was the first benefit that the competition got from significant price reductions. So we are facing that headwind. That will start to reverse, David, in the fourth quarter as a year-ago's fourth quarter comp is much easier and actually was down almost 4%. So that we start to see reversing. The second big driver is the weak oil-dependent sales. And this is again an overall industry problem. We've talked about our numbers. And the last 3 quarters leading up to the third quarter, we've seen that down about 10%. So that's been a significant drag on the industry. Now in the third quarter, we actually saw that accelerate. Certainly disappointed with that, but we saw that increase to a level of about, well, 15% down in oil-dependent areas in the quarter. The industry also saw an acceleration of that number. So when you talk about going forward, how does that continue, anyone's guess in the short term, but at some point when that plateaus, we'll have a lower base and be able to grow off of that. And then the third one is soft used values, which the industry has experienced for the last several quarters. Again, we've talked about the bikes that go through our dealer network, which is about 1/3 of the used bikes. Used bike prices held up very well through the third quarter of 2015. And over the last 3 or 4 quarters, we've seen some softness in used bikes as well as the industry. Our bikes continue to hold its value better than the industry by far, but we are seeing used bike values fall. That's short-term headwind on new bike sales. Long term, it's not necessarily a bad thing, and that does bring a lot of new people into the industry. And a matter of fact for Harley-Davidson, the vast majority of new people coming into the brand come in on used motorcycles. So there's certainly some positive to that. But the industry work through that softness, and we would expect that to stabilize at some point in the future. The second question that you asked, David, was with regards to trading of motorcycles between dealers. And you had used the term 'used' in describing that. What we are doing to move model year '16 carryover motorcycles are just for new motorcycles, have nothing to do with used. Matter of fact, there was a report out last week that talked about change in used strategy, and I think there was some confusion with regards to what we're doing on model year 2016 carryover, new motorcycles to move them, help our dealers move them, which includes facilitating and defraying the cost of trading versus anything to do with used. So I want to make that clarification."
