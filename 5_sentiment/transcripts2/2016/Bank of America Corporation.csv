Thanks to all of you for joining us this morning to discuss our fourth quarter results.Before Paul and I take you to the details of the quarter, I just want to provide you with the overall context in our progress in 201",1225,"Thank you, Lee, and good morning. Thanks to all of you for joining us this morning to discuss our fourth quarter results.
Before Paul and I take you to the details of the quarter, I just want to provide you with the overall context in our progress in 2015 and the opportunity and challenges ahead. As you know for the fourth quarter, we reported $3.3 billion in earnings or $0.28 per diluted share. For 2015, we had net income of $15.9 [ph] billion, that's the highest net income we've had in a long time.  Full year returned metrics were 74 basis points for ROA faraway and 9% through return on intangible common equity. 
During 2015, we continued to drive line of business forward. We felt -- we focused on driving responsive growth across all our businesses, and if you look at the annual earnings of the company and see how it goes, you can see how came through. Our consumer and wealth management business serving mass-market customers, following wealthiest Americans delivered $9.3 billion net income this year.
Although our banking business which provides businesses for companies around the world, it is $5.3 [ph] billion in net income this year. When our institutional investor clients, our markets business, with its market-leading research capabilities and top-tier platform across the Globe, delivered $3 billion in earnings after adjusting for EVA in a very challenging market.
What's clear in these earnings despite the duration of the markets, especially at the end of the year last year, is annuity nature that we get from our franchise by driving customer client flows. That's the power of the company -- its balance and scope and its solid and strong customer base. And we aim to continue to improve everyday for our clients and customers and our shareholders.  These results reflect the work we've done over the past several years to develop a more straight forward and simplified operating model and focus on responsible growth. 
As you see on the Slide 2, across a variety of measures, loan growth, business activity, capital, liquidity, credit losses and cost management, we made meaningful progress and believe are positioned for a variety of economic cycles.  At the foundation of this is a strong capital and liquidity base. We add it to our record liquidity levels in 2015, when we believe we are well positioned against the 2017 LCR requirements with total global excess liquidity sources now at over $500 billion. This amount represents nearly 1/4 of our balance sheet, and we have another [ph] capital liquidity to last more than 3 years before we need to test the market refund.
Now our liquidity levels were driven by strong growth in deposits this year. And we were able to put that fund into work to grow along in absolute basis for the first time in several years. Loan growth was all driven by organic activity, consist -- consistent with our risk buster. Our change in common equity of $162 billion is a record levels as well, returned $4.5 billion to shareholders and common dividends and share repurchases. Our tangible book value per share improved 8% in the past 12 months to new high of $15.62. Our responsible lending focus also shows under -- in our underwriting results. Our net charge-offs were down to $4.3 billion this year, consistent with last 2014 but much lower than previous years. 
Commercial charge-offs increased off a very low base, mostly from oil-related charge-offs work as consumer losses as a core have continued to improve.  This reflect both the response of underwriting as we continue to improvement in our legacy portfolios.
And finally, we get to the cost management side. At the heart of the work has been improving expenses, which you can see, are down sequentially from last year, mostly on lower litigation costs but also on improved LAS and other operating costs. And these have improved steadily across the last several years. We began new BAC in 2011 and completed in 2014. Since then, we have been using our simplified and improved initiatives to find savings of more than offset the increased compliance, merit and other inflationary costs. But most importantly, those the savings fund investments in our business, whether it's in technology, our sales force growth or other infrastructure costs.
As we move to Slide 3, we included a few examples of trends business activity in our consumer side of the house -- and wealth management side of the house. As you can see, we grew our average deposits and Consumer Banking wealth management business to $50 billion or 7% comparing year-over-year fourth quarter periods. These deposits were up over $105 billion in core deposits since the end of 2012. This strong organic growth is a result of hard work and improving the customer satisfaction in our franchise by making it easier for customers to do business with our bank -- and strong product management simplifying the product set.  All of this has been done where we've optimized our delivery network, reducing our financial centers divesting certain markets and also, expanding our award-winning mobile capabilities in the customer base that uses that. As you can see, this work also extends to our wealth management business. We had long-term net flows for every quarter for 6.5 years in wealth management. We have record low levels and significant higher deposit levels.  These products and advisers are growing sales force into the leading brands and business division as well here.
When you move to our Global Banking markets area, you can see in the institutional side of the house laid -- setup on Slide 4, we saw solid activity in '15. Loans of commercial and corporate clients around the globe have grown nicely. Plan to management good and our bankers have been our challenge to capture market share response. This focus allowed us to demonstrate a soft -- a strong 12% growth in loans and Global Banking in the past 12 months. And you can see the deposit growth has been strong here over the last year as well.
If you look at the markets business, Tom Montag and the team have done a good job reducing assets and lowering the risk and still generating relatively stable revenues. Despite the recent market challenge, we remain quite profitable in this business and well positioned around the globe above the strong FICC and equity platform.
As we step back, we remain focused on our core customer strategy. We've been -- continuing to invest in the future and needless, we continue to address the legacy issues in the past. We've been able to grow even as the operating and economic environment remains in the low growth mode. Our model is solid but there's still plenty work to do, but also there's plenty of opportunity ahead for us. 
I'm overall, I'm pleased with the progress we've made in 2015, and we have more to do in 2016. But in 2016, you should expect us to focus on responsible growth. We'll continue to drive investments made in the franchise to deliver the value to you, our shareholders -- we'll continue our sharp focus on risk management and we'll continue our cost discipline as we look to continue to improve return on capital -- capital metrics of our company. With that, let me hand it over to Paul."
19049,315610271,919248,"Bank of America Corporation, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 19, 2016",2016-01-19,"Earnings Calls","Bank of America Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Brian. Good morning, everyone. Starting on Slide 5, we present the summary of the income statement returns for this quarter as well as the fourth quarter of last year which had similar seasonal aspects. We earned $3.3 billion in the quarter compar",3834,"Thanks, Brian. Good morning, everyone. Starting on Slide 5, we present the summary of the income statement returns for this quarter as well as the fourth quarter of last year which had similar seasonal aspects. We earned $3.3 billion in the quarter compared to earnings of $3.1 billion in 4Q '14. Earnings per diluted share this quarter were up $0.28, up 12% versus a year ago.
Results include 2 significant charges that were previously announced and impacted EPS by $0.06. First, we recorded a pretax charge of $612 million associated with trust preferred securities which phased out of Tier 2 capital at the end of 2015. Second, we had a tax charge of $290 million associated with the U.K. tax changes that were enacted during the quarter.  Lastly, we had a few other items that benefit EPS this quarter by $0.01 on a net basis. This included a net -- a negative net DVA impact in sales and trading, that was more than offset by a positive impact of market-related adjustments and net interest income and some more on tax benefits.
Revenue on an LTE basis was $19.8 billion this quarter, up 4% from Q4 '14. Expenses were $13.9 billion, approximately $300 million or 2% lower than a year ago, driven by good expense discipline across the company. We also provided returns on the metrics on this page I would remind you that client activity and revenue in our Global Markets segment tend to be low or lowest in the fourth quarter, affecting returns and other statistics.  Lastly, as many of you are aware, there was a recent accounting change that requires certain unrealized debit evaluation adjustments to be recorded directly to OCI rather than through the P&L. We early adopted this change effective as at the beginning of 2015. The slides and the supplemental earnings materials that present 2015 results have been adjusted.
Turning to Slide 6 and focusing on the balance sheet. We grew deposits by $35 billion from Q3, and we used these to increase deposits to fund responsible loan growth. In total, assets climbed $9 billion, as increases in loans and security balances of $30 billion were more than offset by reduction in trading-related assets in cash.  Liquidity rose to just over $500 billion, a record level, and time requires funding remains over 3 years. Tangible common equity of $152 [ph] billion improved modestly from Q3 as earnings were offset by both the return of $1.3 billion in capital to common shareholders and negative OCI driven by security values.  Tangible book value per share increased to $15.62, another new record high. 
Turning to regulatory metrics, we began recording regulatory capital under the advanced approaches for the first time this quarter. On a CET1 transition ratio under Basel III, ended the quarter at 10.2 and this has no comparable metric as transition ratios in prior periods were reported under the standardized approach with lower RWA levels.
On a fully phased in basis, CET1 capital improved modestly to $154.1 billion under the advanced approaches compared to Q3 '15 pro forma estimate, the CET1 ratio increased slightly to 9.8%.  RWA was essentially flat as growth from commercial exposures was modest -- mostly offset by lower activity and balance sheet level in our Global Markets segment.  We also provide our capital metrics under the standardized approach. Here, our CET1 ratio was flat at 10.8%, with modest improvements in capital, offset by modest increase in RWA.
In terms of the supplementary leverage ratios, we estimate that as of 12/31, we continue to exceed U.S. rules applicable beginning in 2018 at both parent and bank. 
Turning to Slide 7. We had strong loan and deposit growth this quarter. Reported loans on an end of period basis increased $15 billion from Q3. This is the third consecutive quarter of reported increases in total loan balances. We continue to see solid loan demand in our primary lending businesses, partially offset by a runoff in LAS and All Other. Excluding declines in LAS and All Other, pending loans in our primary lending segments increased $22 billion from Q3.  $8 billion of this increase was in consumer loans as GWIM increased mortgages and security-based lending. Consumer Banking also saw a good loan growth in mortgages as well as equal loans.
We also had some seasonal growth in credit card, partially offset by selling $1.7 billion of card receivables at the end of the quarter. Commercial loans grew $15 billion spread across multiple industry goods. 
Turning to deposits. On many basis, they've reached nearly $1.2 trillion this quarter, growing $78 billion or 7% from Q4 '14. Growth was solid across the franchise. Consumer led the way, growing 9% year-over-year while both Global Banking and GWIM each grew at a 6% [ph] pace. 
Turning to asset quality on Slide 8. While still strong, we did see net charge-offs increase modestly from recent levels. Total net charge-offs increased $212 million versus Q3, $144 million was from consumer items previously reserved for, and lower recoveries on the sale of NPL in the fourth quarter versus Q3.  We also saw a $73 million increase in net charge-offs from our entry portfolio. Outside of these 2 areas, net charge-offs were stable compared to Q3.
Provision of $110 million in Q4 was relatively flat with Q3. Reserve releases in consumer real estate and credit cards were partially offset by reserve builds in commercial, which were driven by increases in credit exposures as well as loan growth. Reserve releases, excluding the previously reserved items I mentioned earlier, were roughly $200 million.
On Slide 9, we provide credit quality data on our consumer portfolio. Net charge-offs increased $130 million -- $137 million. The 2 items of note that make up this increase were reserved for in prior periods and did not impact provision expense in the quarter. $190 [ph] million was a result of collateral valuation adjustment. In addition, we had some small charge-offs associated with our 2014 DoJ settlement. We expect to complete our commitments under this settlement in the first half of 2016.
Adjusting for these 2 items, consumer net charge-offs were relatively flat versus Q3. Delinquency levels and NPLs continued to decline, and reserve coverage remained strong.
Moving to the commercial side. On Slide 10, net charge-offs increased $75 million, primarily from losses in our energy portfolio. Outside of the energy portfolio, commercial losses remained very low. Given the focus on the impact of low oil prices on companies in the energy sector, we want to spend a minute to describe our energy portfolio and provide some perspective.
The pie chart breaks down our $21 billion of utilized exposure to the energy sector. This represents a little more than 2% of our total loan balances. Within that $21 billion, $8.3 million [ph] or less than 1% of total loans as loans to borrowers in 2 subsectors: Exploration and production as well as oilfield services. We consider these 2 subsectors to have significantly higher risk than the rest of the energy portfolio.
Of our $8.3 billion utilized exposure to these 2 higher risk subsectors, $2.9 million [ph] has already been downgraded to So 35% of the higher risk subsectors has already been downgraded to reserved of creditized exposure, thereby driving a portion of the reserve.
And allowances for loan losses for the entire energy portfolio is approximately $500 million or 6% [ph] of the fund exposure of these 2 subsectors. Companies in the integrated subsector represents $5.8 billion of the energy portfolio. We believe this subsector has a better ability to withstand lower oil prices. Nearly 100% of the company have a market capital of $10 billion or more or their sovereign loan. And the average company has a market cap greater than $60 billion. We will do the remaining exposure and refinance and marketing as well as other is also less dependent on oil prices.
As part of our standard risk management process, we stress test our credit portfolios, including our energy portfolio. Our stress analysis of the energy portfolio includes various sustained low oil prices over extended periods. As an example, if we have oil prices at $35 per barrel for 9 quarters, we estimate our potential losses on the energy portfolio would be roughly $700 million.
In energy, and across our commercial sector, we continue to support clients while managing lending limits and actively engaging with stress borrowers. Before moving from asset quality, I want to refocus on total provision spend and how one should think about it over the next couple of quarters. 
As we continue to assess and react to future changes in the energy sector, the increased lumpiness that could potentially drive the provision expense over $900 million. 
Turning to our net interest income on Slide 11. On an FTE basis, NII was $10 billion, increasing roughly $300 million from Q3. NII included a negative $612 million charge associated with 3 trust preferred securities. These securities were scheduled to be completely phased out of Tier 2 capital as of Jan 1, and with 7% to 8% coupon, became expensive debt. NII also included $115 [ph] million in positive market-related adjustments to the amortization of bond premiums under FAS 91.
NII, excluding market-related adjustments and the charge on the trust preferred, improved $188 million from Q3 to $10.5 billion. This improvement was driven by increased deposit balances which we used to fund growth in loans and securities. 
As we move into the first quarter, please note the following: First, we will have 1 less day of interest; second, recent changes by Congress will lower the amount of dividend we receive from the FRB by approximately $50 million a quarter. Having said that, if the forward curve is realized and if we have some modest deposit loan growth, we still expect to show some growth in NII in Q1 '16 relative to our adjusted NII of $10.5 billion.
With regard to asset sensitivity, at the end of the fourth quarter, our overall asset sensitivity decreased slightly as a result of increases in volume rates as well as security balances. As of 12/31, an instantaneous 100-basis-point parallel increase in rate is estimated to increase NII by approximately $4.3 billion over the subsequent year. A little more half of that improvement comes from the increases in short-end rates and a little less than 1/4 of the benefit comes from market-related adjustments.
Turning to expenses on Slide 12. Noninterest expense was $13.9 billion in Q4, $300 million lower than Q4 '14. This was driven by good expense discipline across the company. Litigation expenses were a little higher this quarter at $428 million and there is lumpiness as we work to resolve our legacy issues. Keep in mind that annual litigation expense decreased from $16.4 [ph] billion in 2014 to $1.2 billion in 2015. Legacy servicing costs, excluding litigation, finished Q4 a little better than our target of $800 million.  As we have said, our net goal is $500 million per quarter. Expenses, excluding litigation and LAS, were $12.6 billion, and represents the fifth quarter of the past 6 below $12.8 billion. We continue to look for ways to streamline and simplify how we do business. This is important because it allows us to invest in growth while maintaining relatively flat core expenses and a sluggish revenue environment. And importantly, this relative flatness continued even as we invested in additional sales professionals and improved technology. 
Looking towards expenses in 2016, let me remind you, in the first quarter, we will record as normal, approximately $1 billion in cost for retirement eligible incentives. In addition to the first quarter -- typically includes seasonality -- seasonally higher favorable taxes of roughly $300 million. And if we experience traditional rebound in Q1 sales of trading revenue, this would also increase incentives and other associated costs.
Turning to the business segments and starting with Consumer Banking on Slide 13. Consumer earned $1.8 billion, 9% greater than Q4 last year. These results reflect good operating leverage on increased customer activity. The segment generated a strong 25% return on allocated capital.  Revenue of $7.8 billion was up modestly from Q4 '14. Net interest income benefited from higher deposit and loan levels. Noninterest income was down slightly from lower mortgage banking.
The decline in mortgage revenue reflects selling fewer nonperforming loans as we hold more on our balance sheet. In addition, there was the absence of $30 million in quarterly revenue from the Q3 sale of the small noncore appraisal business. Expenses declined 2% from Q4 '14, as the savings from reduction in financial centers and personnel more than offset our investment increased sales specialists. The cost of operating deposit franchise remains low at 177 basis points. Operating leverage growth -- improvements in the efficiency ratio of 56% as we continue to experience shifts in customer activity away from branches towards self-serve options.
Mobile banking users increased to 18.7 million, which is up 13% from Q4 '14, and deposit transactions from these devices now represent 15% of deposit transactions. 
Slide 14 presents consumer's progress across a number of customer activities. I would highlight activities in 3 areas: Loans, deposits and brokerage assets, where we continue to grow responsibly. These 3 products are at the core of our rewards program where we share benefits with customers who deepen relationships with us. Average loans grew $12 billion [ph] from Q4 '14, in mortgages and vehicle lending. And deposit growth was strong at $48 billion [ph] or 9% in Q4, or the rate paid declined to 4 basis points.
Regarding brokerage assets. Merrill Edge asset levels of $123 [ph] billion are up 8% from last year, even with the declines in equity markets this year. 
Total mortgage production was up 13% from Q4 last year and stable with Q3. Looking at card activity which includes GWIM, card issuance was strong at 1.3 million. Average U.S. card balances of 83 -- of $89 billion were down modestly from last year but up seasonally from Q3 '15.
U.S. cards credit quality was strong as net charge-offs remain at 78 [ph] low levels 2.5%, with a risk-adjusted margin of 9.4%. Credits spending volume finished on a high note, as Q4 spending was 5% higher than last year, allocating what we believe to be total market spend levels.
Debit spending was strong as well. For example, on Christmas day, we saw a record debit card spending of more than $1 billion. In our consumer segment, we expect technology adoption by customers to continue to be a cornerstone of not only improved customer satisfaction but also efficiency gains and operating leverage. The latest examples of this are around digital selling and appointment setting. Digital sales in the fourth quarter were up more than 31% from last year. Digital appointments reached more than 15,000 [ph] in the recent week. We expect these adopting trend will play an increasing role in future performance in customer satisfaction as we continue to advance online and mobile capabilities. 
Turning to Slide 15. Global wealth and Investment Management produced earnings of $614 million. Results were down in Q4 last year, driven by lower transactional revenue and the impact of the market decline on asset management fees. Transactional revenue continues to be impacted by the shifting of activity from brokerage to managed relationships as well as market uncertainty.
NII benefited from solid loan growth and solid deposit growth but was offset by the company's ALM activities, leaving NII relatively flat with Q4 '14. Noninterest expense was modestly higher than the year-ago period. Investments in client-facing professionals continues, while lower revenue cause decline in incentive compensation that was more than offset by amortization of stock awards issued in prior periods. Pretax margin was 21%, down from Q4 '14.
Beginning in the first quarter of 2016 [ph], we will benefit from lower expense resulting from the completion of amortizations related to advisory retention awards given at the time of the Merrill Lynch merger. 
Moving to Slide 15. Despite the volatility and market levels, we continue to see solid client activity, and we continue to invest in the business, growing multiple advisers 5% from Q4 last year. Long-term AUM growth were $7 billion, and remain positive for the 26th consecutive quarter deposit flows were strong, growing end of balance -- growing end of period balances of $15 billion from Q3. By the way, this is driven in part, by clients market volatility.
Loans continued to grow, improving 10% from last year. This is the 23rd consecutive quarter of average loan growth in this segment.
Turning to Slide 17. Global banking earned $1.4 billion, down 9% from Q4 '14 but still generating a 60% return on allocated capital. The earnings declining from Q4 was driven by higher provision expense. Provision expense was up $264 million from Q4 last year, driven by higher energy-related charge-offs and reserve builds, loan growth and energy-related risks.
Revenue increased modestly from Q4 '14, while expense declined modestly. Driven by higher loan balances, NII improved despite spread compression and the allocation of the company's ALM activities, including higher liquidity costs.  Noninterest income benefited from higher treasury services revenue, higher leasing revenue and a small gain from the sale of its foreclosed property, partially offset by lower IB fees.
Looking at trends on Slide 18, and comparing to Q4 '14, IB fees of $1.3 billion were down 17% as leveraged finance and equity issuance was partially offset by advisory fees that were at second highest level since the Merrill merger. From a market share perspective, we maintained our #3 global fee ranking. Looking at the balance sheet, loans have averaged for $320 billion, up 12% year-over-year. The growth was broad-based across C&I, real estate and leasing. We continue to experience some spread compression, although it has moderated relative to a year ago.
Asset quality of new loans was consistent with the overall portfolio. On deposits, we saw a good performance, with average deposits increasing by $16 billion or 5% over Q4 '14. The mix of these deposits remains very good, with less than 5% classified as 100% run-off balances.
Switching to global markets on Slide 19. Compared to Q4 last year, we are pleased with the results here given challenging market conditions, as the team's increased revenues while using lower asset levels and last VaR. Global Markets earned approximately $200 million, but we think when you considering results excluding DVA. On that basis, adjusted earnings were $308 million which was relatively flat to Q4 '14 on a similarly adjusted basis.  Note that our net DVA loss in this quarter was $198 million and compared to a loss of $626 million in Q4 '14, which included an initial at the a adjustment. Total revenue, excluding DVA, improved $330 million or 10% from the fourth quarter last year on improved or fixed sales and trading. Outside of sales and trading, Global Markets share of lower investment banking fees was offset by a gain on the sale of an equity investment.  Noninterest expense increased 9%, in line with revenue improvement. 
Moving to trends on the next slide and focusing on components of our sales and train performance. Sales and trading revenue of $2.6 billion, excluding net DVA, was up 11.5% from Q4 '14. Compared to Q4 last year, FICC sales and trading of $1.8 billion improved 8% [ph] reflecting improvements across most products, notably in rates and credit-related products.
Equity trading of $822 million declined 3%, reflecting lower client activity. Average trading-related asset levels were down 9% in Q4 '14, while VaR was down 14%. 
Turning to Legacy Assets and Servicing on Slide 21. This segment lost roughly $350 million, in line with the prior year. Focused areas here are mortgage banking income, the number of delinquent loans and expenses, all compared to Q4 '14. First, mortgage banking income which grew slightly, was driven by 3 factors: Revenue for improved $237 million to a position of $9 million this quarter; that favorability was offset by a decline in serve fees increase of $108 million as used service declined, as well as decline in net MSR performance of $152 million.
Next, the number of first mortgage loans that we service, that are 60 days delinquent, continue to decline and are now at 103,000 [ph] units. And last, the team did an excellent job lowering expenses. Excluding litigation, we achieved our goal of $800 million, moving cost down $309 million or 28%.
On Slide 22, we show All Other which reported a loss of $289 million. This was an improvement of $86 million from Q4 '14. This loss was driven by the $612 million pretax charge associated with our trust preferred as well as the impact on the U.K. tax law changes.  This was partially offset by gains in debt security sales as well as reserve releases on consumer real estate loans booked in All Other. 
A comment or 2 on taxes before wrapping up. The company's effective tax rate for the quarter, excluding the U.K. tax charge, was 25%, reflecting reoccurring tax benefits, plus a few small benefits. We would expect the tax rate to be in the low 30s for 2016, excluding unusual items. 
Before closing, I want to cover early adoption of DVA accounting in more detail. In January of this year, the financial Accounting Standard Board issued an update to allow early adoption of a new rule regarding recognition of DVA on financial liabilities on changes in our on credit spreads. The update means that these types of debit valuation adjustments will now flow through OCI instead of the income statement. We believe this change makes earnings comparisons more meaningful and easier to understand, therefore, we adopt early. We restated all prior years -- excuse me, we restated all periods from this year first, the FASB rules, and those numbers are contained in the supplemental package.  This has had no impact on capital as it moved dollars between retained earnings in OCI, but it did impact on revenue, earnings, taxes and EPS in the first 3 quarters of 2015. The That changes reduced previously reported EPS by approximately $0.02 each in Q1, Q2 and Q3.  This accounting standard adoption did not impacted DVA on derivatives which continued to flow through trading account profits. 
Okay, let me conclude by offering a few takeaways. Although the U.S. economy is improving slowly, revenue growth remains challenging. This quarter, we continued our progress on those things we can control and drive. These include delivery for clients and customers within our risk framework and driving client and customer activity that will result in sustainable profits and returns.  Our results reflect this focus. We maintained a strong foundation of capital and liquidity. We grew loans, deposits and investment flows. We continue to invest in our franchise by adding sales professionals and improved technology. Our strength, global capabilities and experience allowed us to deliver for clients in a challenging market environment. And we did all this while closely managing expenses.
With that, we'll open it up to Q&A."

We sort of slowed that down 24 months ago, that started to drop on -- in terms of growth rates. And so because with the client's less price tier there, it's very high level -- very high in clients, multinational clients, et cetera. But we slowed it down just to keep the company in balance and that's been our watch word. If you think about the consumer, those not prime, no cycles, scores, if you look at the coming on FICOs -- are higher -- they're higher than the portfolio still which is -- it's almost hard to believe that charge-offs, delinquencies and both home equities, delinquencies across the last 4 years has continue to come -- getting lower every year. This year was the lowest they've been, all the way back a long time in both the credit card and home equities. And if you look at the client structure in the U.S., a couple of things. One is we're adding officers in our middle-market business but they're going after our target clients, and this is not go find new industries, et cetera. So whether it's the way we're lending in commercial real estate which is down -- which is very high-end real estate developers and et cetera, the way we lend in middle-market, is that -- is very strong. So if you look at price, it's high inflection in the middle-market -- business has been strong, but that's what we're seeing -- is things in our business, banking, small business portfolio. We're actually starting to see growth there against sticky target credit risk, which is the first time in many years that we had to run off some stuff and came in through or Maryland and everything and we're finally seeing nominal growth. And so I think it's client selection, we slowed down international. It's sort of -- Paul is watching, and in fact, using your stress test to make sure you stay balanced. And if you look at us, we feel we are pretty balanced between consumer and commercial, that's sort of 50-50.

We have $500 billion [ph] of RWA some of the advanced approach. That is 25% more than the next highest bank. And that operational risk is for businesses that we are no longer in, for products we no longer sell. It's for a risk profile that we no longer tolerate. So again, that will take time but that's another opportunity for us to lower RWA from an advanced perspective."

Thanks all of you for joining us this morning to discuss our fourth quarter results.
Before Paul Donofrio take you to the details of the quarter, I just want to provide some overall context in our progress in 2015 and the opportunity and challenges ahead. As you know, for the fourth quarter, we reported $3.3 billion in earnings or loan levels. Noninterest income was down slightly from lower mortgage banking. The decline in Mortgage revenue reflects selling fewer nonperforming loans as we hold more on our balance sheet. In addition, there was the absence of $30 million in quarterly revenue from the Q3 sale of a small noncore appraisal business. 
Expenses declined 2% from Q4 '14 as the savings from reductions in financial centers and personnel more than offset our cost from investment in 3 [ph] sales specialists. The cost of operating a deposit franchise remains low at 177 basis points. Operating leverage was an improvement in the efficiency ratio to 56% as we continued to experience shifts in customer activity away from branches towards self-serve options.
Mobile banking users increased to 18.7 million, which is up 13% from Q4 '14, and deposit transactions from these devices now represent 15% of deposit transactions. 
Slide 14 presents consumers' progress across a number of customer activities. I would highlight activities in 3 areas, loans, deposits and brokerage assets, where we continued to grow responsibly. These 3 products are the core of our rewards program, where we share benefits with customers who deepen relationships with us. Average loans grew $12 billion from Q4 '14 in mortgages and vehicle lending. And in deposits, growth was strong at $48 billion or 9% in Q4, while the rate paid declined to 4 basis points.
Regarding brokerage assets. Merrill Edge asset levels of $123 billion are up 8% from last year even with the declines in equity markets this year. 
Total mortgage production was up 13% from Q4 last year and stable with Q3. 
Looking at card activity, which includes GWIM, card issuance was strong at 1.3 million. Average U.S. card balances of $83 billion -- of $89 billion were down modestly from last year but up seasonally from Q3 '15.
U.S. cards' credit quality was strong as net charge-offs remain at [indiscernible] low levels of 2.5% with a risk-adjusted margin of 9.4%. Credit spending volumes finished on a high note as Q4 spending was 5% higher than last year, allocate the -- what we believe to be total market spend levels. Debit spending was strong as well. For example, on Christmas Eve day, we saw record debit card spending of more than $1 billion. 
In our consumer segment, we expect technology adoption by customers to continue to be a cornerstone of not only improved customer satisfaction but also efficiency gains and operating leverage. The latest examples of this are around digital selling and appointment setting. Digital sales in the fourth quarter were up more than 31% from last year. Digital appointments reached more than 15,000 in the recent weeks. We expect these adopting trends to play an increasing role in future performance and customer satisfaction as we continue to advance online and mobile capabilities. 
Turning to Slide 15. Global Wealth and Investment Management produced earnings of $614 million. Results were down from Q4 last year, driven by lower transactional revenue and the impact of the market decline on asset management fees. Transactional revenue continues to be impacted by the shifting of activity from brokerage to managed relationships as well as market uncertainty.
NII benefited from solid loan growth and solid deposit growth but was offset by the company's ALM activities, leaving NII relatively flat with Q4 '14. Noninterest expense was modestly higher than the year-ago period. Investment in client-facing professionals continues, while lower revenue caused a decline in incentive compensation that was more than offset by amortization of stock awards issued in prior periods. Pretax margin was 21%, down from Q4 '14.
Beginning in the first quarter of 2016, we will benefit from lower expense resulting from the completion of amortizations related to advisory retention awards given at the time of the Merrill Lynch merger. 
Moving to Slide 16. Despite the volatility in market levels, we continue to see solid client activity, and we continue to invest in the business, growing wealth advisers 5% from Q4 last year. Long-term AUM flows were $7 billion and remained positive for the 26th consecutive quarter. Deposit flows were strong, growing end-of-balance -- growing end-of-period balances $15 billion from Q3. By the way, this may have been driven in part by client concerns with market volatility.
Loans continued to grow, improving 10% from last year. This is the 23rd consecutive quarter of average loan growth in this segment.
Turning to Slide 17. Global Banking earned $1.4 billion, down 9% from Q4 '14 but still generating a 16% return on allocated capital. The earnings decline from Q4 was driven by higher provision expense. Provision expense was up $264 million from Q4 last year, driven by higher energy-related charge-offs and reserve builds for loan growth and energy-related risks. Revenue increased modestly from Q4 '14 while expense declined modestly. 
Driven by higher loan balances, NII improved despite spread compression and the allocation of the company's ALM activities, including higher liquidity costs.  Noninterest income benefited from higher treasury services revenue, higher leasing revenue and a small gain from the sale of its foreclosed property, partially offset by lower IB fees.
Looking at trends on Slide 18 and comparing to Q4 '14, IB fees of $1.3 billion were down 17% as leveraged finance and equity issuance were partially offset by advisory fees that were at second highest level since the Merrill merger. From a market share perspective, we maintained our #3 global fee ranking. 
Looking at the balance sheet, loans on average were $320 billion, up 12% year-over-year. The growth was broad based across C&I, real estate and leasing. We continue to experience some spread compression, although it has moderated relative to a year ago.
Asset quality of new loans was consistent with the overall portfolio. On deposits, we saw good performance with average deposits increasing by $16 billion or 5% over Q4 '14. The mix of these deposits remained very good with less than 5% classified as 100% run-off balances.
Switching to Global Markets on Slide 19 and comparing to Q4 last year. We are pleased with the results here given challenging market conditions as the teams increased revenues while using lower asset levels and less VaR. Global Markets earned approximately $200 million. But we think when you consider results excluding DVA, on that basis, adjusted earnings were $308 million, which was relatively flat to Q4 '14 on a similarly adjusted basis.  Note that our net DVA loss this quarter was $198 million and compared to a loss of $626 million in Q4 '14, which included an initial FVA adjustment. Total revenue, excluding DVA, improved $313 million or 10% from the fourth quarter last year on improved FICC sales and trading. Outside of sales and trading, Global Markets' share of lower investment banking fees was offset by a gain on the sale of an equity investment. 
Noninterest expense increased 9%, in line with revenue improvement. 
Moving to trends on the next slide and focusing on components of our sales and trading performance. Sales and trading revenue of $2.6 billion, excluding net DVA, was up 11.5% from Q4 '14. Compared to Q4 last year, FICC sales and trading of $1.8 billion improved 20%, reflecting improvements across most products, notably in rates and credit-related products. Equity trading of $822 million declined 3%, reflecting lower client activity. Average traded -- trading-related asset levels were down 9% in Q4 '14 while VaR was down 14%. 
Turning to Legacy Assets and Servicing on Slide 21. This segment lost roughly $350 million, in line with the prior year. Focus areas here are mortgage banking income, the number of delinquent loans and expenses, all compared to Q4 '14. First, mortgage banking income, which improved slightly, was driven by 3 factors. Rep and warranty provisioning improved $237 million to a provision of $9 million this quarter. That favorability was offset by a decline in servicing fees of $108 million and use of service declined, as well as a decline in net MSR hedge performance of $152 million. Next, the number of first mortgage loans that we serviced that are 60 days delinquent, continued to decline and are now at 103,000 units. And last, the team did an excellent job lowering expenses. Excluding litigation, we achieved our goal of $800 million, moving costs down $309 million or 28%.
On Slide 22, we show All Other, which reported a loss of $289 million. This was an improvement of $86 million from Q4 '14. This loss was driven by the $612 million pretax charge associated with our trust preferred as well as the impact on the U.K. tax law changes.  This was partially offset by gains in debt security sales as well as reserve releases on consumer real estate loans booked in All Other. 
A comment or 2 on taxes before wrapping up. The company's effective tax rate for the quarter, excluding the U.K. tax charge, was 25%, reflecting reoccurring tax benefits plus a few small [indiscernible] benefits. We would expect the tax rate to be in the low 30s for 2016, excluding unusual items. 
Before closing, I want to cover our early adoption of DVA accounting in more detail. In January of this year, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued an update to allow early adoption of a new rule regarding recognition of DVA on financial liabilities from changes in our own credit spreads. The update means that these types of debit valuation adjustments will now flow through OCI instead of the income statement. We believe this change makes our earnings comparisons more meaningful and easier to understand. Therefore, we adopted early. We restated all prior years -- we, excuse me, restated all periods this year per the FASB rules, and those numbers are contained in the supplemental package.  This had no impact on capital as it moved dollars between retained earnings and OCI, but it did impact revenue, earnings, taxes and EPS in the first 3 quarters of 2015. The changes reduced previously reported EPS by approximately $0.02 each in Q1, Q2 and Q3.  This accounting standard adoption did not impact DVA on derivatives, which continued to flow to trading account profits. 
Okay, let me conclude by offering a few takeaways. Although the U.S. economy is improving slowly, revenue growth remains challenging. This quarter, we continued our progress on those things we can control and drive. These include delivery for clients and customers within our risk framework and driving client and customer activity that will result in sustainable profits and returns.  Our results reflect this focus. We maintained a strong foundation of capital and liquidity. We grew loans, deposits and investment flows. We continued to invest in our franchise by adding sales professionals and improved technology. Our strength, global capability and experience allowed us to deliver for clients in a challenging market environment. And we did all this while closely managing expenses.
With that, we'll open it up to Q&A."

But if it's a demand in the broadest context, our economies continue to slow down, and that's the broader concern. So we're looking at not only the impact in all the portfolios, thinking about who gets the benefits in our portfolio basis from low energy costs, which are serious benefits to the consumers and to companies that consume energy, versus those producing it. And so there's a balance here that we've got to think through. Right now, it's pretty isolated -- the energy companies, and even if you look at consumers who work for them and are bases by ZIP code and unemployment levels and stuff, we've seen relatively modest deterioration or none, and in the consumer side, people employed in these businesses. So I think as you think about it, the real question is going to come down to for '16 in terms of all our industries, are we in a demand-driven issue, i.e., a general economic issue, or if the United States is going to plug along. And if it does, then I think follow-up guidance is the right one. If you're in the supply, it's going to all be localized on these industries."

Thanks all of you for joining us this morning to discuss our fourth quarter results.Before Paul and [indiscernible] take you to the details of the quarter, I just want to provide some overall context in our progress in",1222,"Thank you, Lee, and good morning. Thanks all of you for joining us this morning to discuss our fourth quarter results.
Before Paul and [indiscernible] take you to the details of the quarter, I just want to provide some overall context in our progress in 2015 and the opportunity and challenges ahead. As you know, for the fourth quarter, we reported $3.3 billion in earnings or $0.28 per diluted share. For 2015, we had net income of $15.9 billion. That's the highest net income we've had in a long time. Full year returned metrics were 74 basis points for ROA and 9% through return on tangible common equity.
During 2015, we continued to drive rate [Ph] lines of business forward. We felt -- we focused on driving responsive growth across all our businesses. And if you look at the annual earnings of the company and see how it [indiscernible], you can see how it came through. Our consumer and wealth management businesses serving mass-market customers all the way to the wealthiest Americans delivered $9.3 billion of net income this year.
Although our banking business, which provides services to small, medium and large companies around the world, it is $5.3 billion in net income this year. And our institutional investor clients, our markets business, with its market-leading research capabilities and top-tier platform across the globe delivered $3 billion in earnings after adjusting for DVA in a very challenging market.
What's clear in these earnings despite the gyrations of markets, especially at the end of the year last year, is annuity nature that we get from our franchise by driving customer and client flows. That's the power of the company, its balance and scope and its solid -- its strong customer base. And we aim to continue to improve it everyday for our clients and customers and our shareholders. These results reflect the work we've done over the past several years to develop a more straight forward, simplified operating model and focus on responsible growth.
As you can see on Slide 2, across a variety of measures, loan growth, business activity, capital, liquidity, credit losses and cost management, we've made meaningful progress and believe we're positioned for a variety of economic cycles. At the foundation of this is a strong capital and liquidity base. We added to our record liquidity levels in 2015, when we believed we are well positioned against the 2017 LCR requirements with total global excess liquidity sources now at over $500 billion. This amount represents nearly 1/4 of our balance sheet, and we have enough parent liquidity to last more than 3 years before we need to test the market refund [ph].
Now our liquidity levels were driven by strong growth in deposits this year, and we were able to put that fund into work to grow loans on an absolute basis for the first time in several years. Loan growth was all driven by organic activity, consistent with our risk posture.
Our tangible common equity of $162 billion is at record levels as well. We returned $4.5 billion to shareholders this year in common dividends and share repurchases. Our tangible book value per share improved 8% in the past 12 months to new high of $15.62. Our responsible lending focus also shows under -- in our underwriting results. Our net charge-offs were down to $4.3 billion this year, consistent with 2014, but much lower than previous years. 
Commercial charge-offs increased off a very low base, mostly from oil-related charge-offs, while consumer losses as a core have continued to improve. This reflects both the response to underwriting as we continue to improvement in our legacy portfolios.
And finally, we get with cost management side. And the heart of our work has been improving expenses, which you can see are down sequentially from last year, mostly on lower litigation costs, but also on improved LAS and other operating costs. And these have improved steadily across the last several years. We began new BAC in 2011 and completed in 2014. Since then, we have been using our simplified and improved initiatives to find savings of more than offset increased compliance, merit and other inflationary costs, but most importantly, the savings fund investments in our business, whether it's in technology, our sales force growth or other infrastructure costs.
As we move to Slide 3, we included a few examples of trends business activity in our consumer side of the house and wealth management side of the house. As you can see, we grew average deposits in Consumer Banking wealth management business to $50 billion or 7% comparing year-over-year fourth quarter periods. These deposits were up over $105 billion in core deposits since the end of 2012. This is strong organic growth. It's a result of hard work and improving the customer satisfaction in our franchise by making it easier for customers to do business with our bank and strong product management simplifying the product set. All this has been done where we've optimized our delivery network, reducing our financial centers, divesting certain markets and also expanding our award-winning mobile capabilities in the customer base that uses that. As you can see, this work also extends to our wealth management business. We had long-term net flows for every quarter for 6.5 years in wealth management. We have record low levels and significant higher deposit levels. Good products and [indiscernible] are growing sales force into the leading brands and business divisions as well here.
When you move to our Global Banking markets area, you can see in the institutional side of the house laid -- setup forth on Slide 4, we saw solid activity in '15. Loans to commercial and corporate clients around the globe have grown nicely. Client demand has been good and our bankers have met our challenge to capture market share response. This focus allowed us to demonstrate a strong 12% growth in loans in Global Banking in the past 12 months. And you can see the deposit growth has been strong here over the last year as well.
If you look at the markets business, Tom Montag and team have done a good job reducing assets and lower the risk and still generating relatively stable revenue. Despite the recent market challenge, we remain quite profitable in this business and well positioned around the globe above the strong FICC and equity platform.
As we step back, we must remain focused on our core customer strategy. We will continue to invest in the future in the events we continue to address the legacy issues of the past. We've been able to grow even as the operating and economic environment remains in a low growth mode. Our model is solid, but there's still plenty work to do, but also there's plenty of opportunity ahead for us.
Overall, I'm pleased with the progress we've made in 2015, and we have more to do in 2016. But in 2016, you should expect us to continue to focus on responsible growth. We'll continue to drive the investments made in the franchise to deliver the value to the shareholders, we'll continue our sharp focus on risk management, and we'll continue our cost discipline as we look to continue to improve return on capital -- capital metrics of our company.
With that, let me hand it over to Paul."
19049,315610271,919331,"Bank of America Corporation, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 19, 2016",2016-01-19,"Earnings Calls","Bank of America Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Brian. Good morning, everyone. Starting on Slide 5, we present a summary of the income statement of returns for this quarter as well as the fourth quarter of last year which had similar seasonal aspects. We earned $3.3 billion in the quarter compa",3834,"Thanks, Brian. Good morning, everyone. Starting on Slide 5, we present a summary of the income statement of returns for this quarter as well as the fourth quarter of last year which had similar seasonal aspects. We earned $3.3 billion in the quarter compared to earnings of $3.1 billion in 4Q '14. Earnings per diluted share this quarter were up $0.28, up 12% versus a year ago.
Results include 2 significant charges that were previously announced and impacted EPS by $0.06. First, we recorded a pretax charge of $612 million associated with trust preferred securities, which phased out of Tier 2 capital at the end of 2015. Second, we had a tax charge of $290 million associated with the U.K. tax changes that were enacted during the quarter. Lastly, we had a few other items that benefit EPS this quarter by $0.01 on a net basis. These included a net -- a negative net DVA impact in sales and trading, that was more than offset by positive impacts of market-related adjustments in net interest income and some more on tax benefits.
Revenue on an FTE basis was $19.8 billion this quarter, up 4% from Q4 '14. Expenses were $13.9 billion, approximately $300 million or 2% lower than a year ago, driven by good expense discipline across the company. We also provided returns on a few other metrics on this page. I would remind you that client activity and revenue in our Global Markets segment tend to be low or lowest in the fourth quarter, affecting returns and other statistics. Lastly, as many of you are aware, there was a recent accounting change that requires certain unrealized debit evaluation adjustments to be recorded directly to OCI rather than through the P&L. We early adopted this change effective as of the beginning of 2015. The slides and the supplemental earning materials that present 2015 results have been adjusted.
Turning to Slide 6 and focusing on the balance sheet. We grew deposits by $35 billion from Q3, and we used these increased deposits to fund responsible loan growth. In total, assets climbed $9 billion, as increases in loans and security balances of $30 billion were more than offset by reduction in trading-related assets and cash. Liquidity rose to just over $500 billion, a record level, and time to required funding remains over 3 years. Tangible common equity of $152 billion improved modestly from Q3 as earnings were offset by both the return of $1.3 billion in capital to common shareholders and negative OCI driven by security values. Tangible book value per share increased to $15.62, another new record high.
Turning to regulatory metrics, we began recording regulatory capital under the advanced approaches for the first time this quarter. And the CET1 transition ratio under Basel III ended the quarter at 10.2 and really has no comparable metric as transition ratios in prior periods were reported under the standardized approach with lower RWA levels.
On a fully phased-in basis, CET1 capital improved modestly to $154.1 billion. Under the advanced approaches, compared to Q3 '15 pro forma estimate, the CET1 ratio increased slightly to 9.8%. RWA was essentially flat as growth from commercial exposures was modest -- mostly offset by lower activity and balance sheet level in our Global Market segment. We also provide our capital metrics under the standardized approach. Here, our CET1 ratio was flat at 10.8%, with modest improvements in capital, offset by modest increase in RWA.
In terms of the supplementary leverage ratios, we estimate that as of 12/31, we continue to exceed U.S. rules applicable beginning in 2018 at both parent and bank.
Turning to Slide 7. We had strong loan and deposit growth this quarter. Reported loans on an end of period basis increased $15 billion from Q3. This is the third consecutive quarter of reported increases in total loan balances. We continue to see solid loan demand in our primary lending businesses, partially offset by a runoff in LAS and All Other. Excluding declines in LAS and All Other, [indiscernible] loans in our primary lending segments increased $22 billion from Q3. $8 billion of this increase was in consumer loans as GWIM increased mortgages and security-based lending. Consumer Banking also saw a good loan growth in mortgages as well as vehicle loans.
We also had some seasonal growth in credit card, partially offset by selling $1.7 billion of card receivables at the end of the quarter. Commercial loans grew $15 billion, spread across multiple industry goods.
Turning to deposits. On many basis, they've reached nearly $1.2 trillion this quarter, growing $78 billion or 7% from Q4 '14. Growth was solid across the franchise. Consumer led the way, growing 9% year-over-year, while both Global Banking and GWIM each grew at a 6% pace.
Turning to asset quality on Slide 8. While still strong, we did see net charge-offs increase modestly from recent levels. Total net charge-offs increased $212 million versus Q3, $144 million was from consumer items previously reserved for, and lower recoveries on the sale of NPL in the fourth quarter versus Q3. We also saw a $73 million increase in net charge-offs from our energy portfolio. Outside of these 2 areas, net charge-offs were stable compared to Q3.
Provision of $110 million in Q4 was relatively flat with Q3. Reserve releases in consumer real estate and credit cards were partially offset by reserve builds in commercial, which were driven by increases in criticized exposures as well as loan growth. Reserve releases, excluding the previously reserved items I mentioned earlier, were roughly $200 million.
On Slide 9, we provide credit quality data on our consumer portfolio. Net charge-offs increased $130 million -- $137 million. The 2 items of note that make up this increase were reserved for in prior periods and did not impact provision expense in the quarter. $119 million was a result of collateral valuation adjustment. In addition, we had some small charge-offs associated with our 2014 DoJ settlement. We expect to complete our commitments under this settlement in the first half of 2016.
Adjusting for these 2 items, consumer net charge-offs were relatively flat versus Q3. Delinquency levels and NPLs continued to decline, and reserve coverage remained strong.
Moving to the commercial side. On Slide 10, net charge-offs increased $75 million, primarily from losses in our energy portfolio. Outside of the energy portfolio, commercial losses remained very low. Given the focus on the impacts of low oil prices on companies in the energy sector, we want to spend a minute to describe our energy portfolio and provide some perspective.
The pie chart breaks down our $21 billion of utilized exposure to the energy sector. This represents a little more than 2% of our total loan balances. Within that $21 billion, $8.3 billion or less than 1% of total loans is loans to borrowers in 2 subsectors: exploration and production as well as oil field services. We consider these 2 subsectors to have significantly higher risk than the rest of the energy portfolio. Of our $8.3 billion utilized exposure to these 2 higher risk subsectors, $2.9 million [ph] has already been downgraded to criticized. So 35% of the higher risk subsectors has already been downgraded to reservable criticized exposure, thereby driving a portion of the reserves. And allowances for loan losses for the entire energy portfolio is approximately $500 million or 6% of the fund exposure of these 2 subsectors.
Companies in the vertically integrated subsector represent $5.8 billion of the energy portfolio. We believe this subsector has a better ability to withstand lower oil prices. Nearly 100% of the companies have a market capital of $10 billion or more for their sovereign loan. And the average company has a market cap greater than $60 billion. [indiscernible] the remaining exposure in refinance and marketing as well as other is also less dependent on oil prices.
As part of our standard risk management process, we stress test our credit portfolios, including our energy portfolio. Our stress analysis of the energy portfolio includes various sustained low oil prices over extended periods. As an example, if we have oil prices at $30 per barrel for 9 quarters, we estimate our potential losses on the energy portfolio would be roughly $700 million. In energy, and across our commercial sector, we continue to support clients while managing lending limits and actively engaging with stress borrowers.
Before moving from asset quality, I want to refocus on total provision spends and how one should think about it over the next couple of quarters. As we continue to assess and react to future changes in the energy sector, we could see lumpiness that could potentially drive provision expense over $900 million.
Turning to our net interest income on Slide 11. On an FTE basis, NII was $10 billion, increasing roughly $300 million from Q3. NII included a negative $612 million charge associated with 3 trust preferred securities. These securities were scheduled to be completely phased out of Tier 2 capital as of Jan 1 and about [ph] 7% to 8% coupons became expensive debt. NII also included $115 million of positive market-related adjustments to the amortization of bond premiums under FAS 91. NII, excluding market-related adjustments and the charge on the trust preferred, improved $188 million from Q3 to $10.5 billion. This improvement was driven by increased deposit balances, which we used to fund growth in loans and securities.
As we move into the first quarter, please note the following: first, we will have 1 less day of interest; second, recent changes by Congress will lower the amount of dividends we receive from the FRB by approximately $50 million a quarter. Having said that, if the forward curve is realized and if we have some modest deposit loan growth, we still expect to show some growth in NII in Q1 '16 relative to our adjusted NII of $10.5 billion.
With regard to asset sensitivity, at the end of the fourth quarter, our overall asset sensitivity decreased slightly as a result of increases in volume rates as well as security balances. As of 12/31, an instantaneous 100 basis point parallel increase in rate is estimated to increase NII by approximately $4.3 billion over the subsequent year. A little more than half of that improvement comes from the increases in short-end rates and a little less than 1/4 of the benefit comes from market-related adjustments.
Turning to expenses on Slide 12. Noninterest expense was $13.9 billion in Q4, $300 million lower than Q4 '14. This was driven by good expense discipline across the company. Litigation expenses were a little higher this quarter at $428 million, exhibiting some lumpiness as we work to resolve legacy issues. Keep in mind that annual litigation expense decreased from $16.4 billion in 2014 to $1.2 billion in 2015. Legacy asset servicing costs, excluding litigation, finished Q4 a little better than our target of $800 million. As we have said, our net goal is $500 million per quarter. Expenses, excluding litigation and LAS, were $12.6 billion and represents the fifth quarter out of the past 6 below $12.8 billion. We continue to look for ways to streamline and simplify how we do business. This is important because it allows us to invest in growth while maintaining relatively flat core expenses in a sluggish revenue environment. And importantly, this relative flatness continued even as we invested in additional sales professionals and improve technology.
Looking towards expenses in 2016, let me remind you, in the first quarter, we will record, as normal, approximately $1 billion in cost for retirement eligible incentives. In addition, the first quarter typically includes seasonality -- seasonally higher favorable taxes of roughly $300 million. And if we experience traditional rebound in Q1 sales and trading revenue, this would also increase incentives and other associated costs.
Turning to the business segments and starting with Consumer Banking on Slide 13. Consumer earned $1.8 billion, 9% greater than Q4 last year. These results reflect good operating leverage on increased customer activity. The segment generated a strong 25% return on allocated capital. Revenue of $7.8 billion was up modestly from Q4 '14. Net interest income benefited from higher deposit and loan levels. Noninterest income was down slightly from lower mortgage banking. The decline in Mortgage revenue reflects selling fewer nonperforming loans as we hold more on our balance sheet. In addition, there was the absence of $30 million in quarterly revenue from the Q3 sale of a small noncore appraisal business. 
Expenses declined 2% from Q4 '14 as the savings from reductions in financial centers and personnel more than offset our cost from investment in 3 [ph] sales specialists. The cost of operating a deposit franchise remains low at 177 basis points. Operating leverage was an improvement in the efficiency ratio to 56% as we continued to experience shifts in customer activity away from branches towards self-serve options.
Mobile banking users increased to 18.7 million, which is up 13% from Q4 '14, and deposit transactions from these devices now represent 15% of deposit transactions. 
Slide 14 presents consumers' progress across a number of customer activities. I would highlight activities in 3 areas, loans, deposits and brokerage assets, where we continued to grow responsibly. These 3 products are the core of our rewards program, where we share benefits with customers who deepen relationships with us. Average loans grew $12 billion from Q4 '14 in mortgages and vehicle lending. And in deposits, growth was strong at $48 billion or 9% in Q4, while the rate paid declined to 4 basis points.
Regarding brokerage assets. Merrill Edge asset levels of $123 billion are up 8% from last year even with the declines in equity markets this year. 
Total mortgage production was up 13% from Q4 last year and stable with Q3. 
Looking at card activity, which includes GWIM, card issuance was strong at 1.3 million. Average U.S. card balances of $83 billion -- of $89 billion were down modestly from last year but up seasonally from Q3 '15.
U.S. cards' credit quality was strong as net charge-offs remain at [indiscernible] low levels of 2.5% with a risk-adjusted margin of 9.4%. Credit spending volumes finished on a high note as Q4 spending was 5% higher than last year, allocate the -- what we believe to be total market spend levels. Debit spending was strong as well. For example, on Christmas Eve day, we saw record debit card spending of more than $1 billion. 
In our consumer segment, we expect technology adoption by customers to continue to be a cornerstone of not only improved customer satisfaction but also efficiency gains and operating leverage. The latest examples of this are around digital selling and appointment setting. Digital sales in the fourth quarter were up more than 31% from last year. Digital appointments reached more than 15,000 in the recent weeks. We expect these adopting trends to play an increasing role in future performance and customer satisfaction as we continue to advance online and mobile capabilities. 
Turning to Slide 15. Global Wealth and Investment Management produced earnings of $614 million. Results were down from Q4 last year, driven by lower transactional revenue and the impact of the market decline on asset management fees. Transactional revenue continues to be impacted by the shifting of activity from brokerage to managed relationships as well as market uncertainty.
NII benefited from solid loan growth and solid deposit growth but was offset by the company's ALM activities, leaving NII relatively flat with Q4 '14. Noninterest expense was modestly higher than the year-ago period. Investment in client-facing professionals continues, while lower revenue caused a decline in incentive compensation that was more than offset by amortization of stock awards issued in prior periods. Pretax margin was 21%, down from Q4 '14.
Beginning in the first quarter of 2016, we will benefit from lower expense resulting from the completion of amortizations related to advisory retention awards given at the time of the Merrill Lynch merger. 
Moving to Slide 16. Despite the volatility in market levels, we continue to see solid client activity, and we continue to invest in the business, growing wealth advisers 5% from Q4 last year. Long-term AUM flows were $7 billion and remained positive for the 26th consecutive quarter. Deposit flows were strong, growing end-of-balance -- growing end-of-period balances $15 billion from Q3. By the way, this may have been driven in part by client concerns with market volatility.
Loans continued to grow, improving 10% from last year. This is the 23rd consecutive quarter of average loan growth in this segment.
Turning to Slide 17. Global Banking earned $1.4 billion, down 9% from Q4 '14 but still generating a 16% return on allocated capital. The earnings decline from Q4 was driven by higher provision expense. Provision expense was up $264 million from Q4 last year, driven by higher energy-related charge-offs and reserve builds for loan growth and energy-related risks. Revenue increased modestly from Q4 '14 while expense declined modestly. 
Driven by higher loan balances, NII improved despite spread compression and the allocation of the company's ALM activities, including higher liquidity costs.  Noninterest income benefited from higher treasury services revenue, higher leasing revenue and a small gain from the sale of its foreclosed property, partially offset by lower IB fees.
Looking at trends on Slide 18 and comparing to Q4 '14, IB fees of $1.3 billion were down 17% as leveraged finance and equity issuance were partially offset by advisory fees that were at second highest level since the Merrill merger. From a market share perspective, we maintained our #3 global fee ranking. 
Looking at the balance sheet, loans on average were $320 billion, up 12% year-over-year. The growth was broad based across C&I, real estate and leasing. We continue to experience some spread compression, although it has moderated relative to a year ago.
Asset quality of new loans was consistent with the overall portfolio. On deposits, we saw good performance with average deposits increasing by $16 billion or 5% over Q4 '14. The mix of these deposits remained very good with less than 5% classified as 100% run-off balances.
Switching to Global Markets on Slide 19 and comparing to Q4 last year. We are pleased with the results here given challenging market conditions as the teams increased revenues while using lower asset levels and less VaR. Global Markets earned approximately $200 million. But we think when you consider results excluding DVA, on that basis, adjusted earnings were $308 million, which was relatively flat to Q4 '14 on a similarly adjusted basis.  Note that our net DVA loss this quarter was $198 million and compared to a loss of $626 million in Q4 '14, which included an initial FVA adjustment. Total revenue, excluding DVA, improved $313 million or 10% from the fourth quarter last year on improved FICC sales and trading. Outside of sales and trading, Global Markets' share of lower investment banking fees was offset by a gain on the sale of an equity investment. 
Noninterest expense increased 9%, in line with revenue improvement. 
Moving to trends on the next slide and focusing on components of our sales and trading performance. Sales and trading revenue of $2.6 billion, excluding net DVA, was up 11.5% from Q4 '14. Compared to Q4 last year, FICC sales and trading of $1.8 billion improved 20%, reflecting improvements across most products, notably in rates and credit-related products. Equity trading of $822 million declined 3%, reflecting lower client activity. Average traded -- trading-related asset levels were down 9% in Q4 '14 while VaR was down 14%. 
Turning to Legacy Assets and Servicing on Slide 21. This segment lost roughly $350 million, in line with the prior year. Focus areas here are mortgage banking income, the number of delinquent loans and expenses, all compared to Q4 '14. First, mortgage banking income, which improved slightly, was driven by 3 factors. Rep and warranty provisioning improved $237 million to a provision of $9 million this quarter. That favorability was offset by a decline in servicing fees of $108 million and use of service declined, as well as a decline in net MSR hedge performance of $152 million. Next, the number of first mortgage loans that we serviced that are 60 days delinquent, continued to decline and are now at 103,000 units. And last, the team did an excellent job lowering expenses. Excluding litigation, we achieved our goal of $800 million, moving costs down $309 million or 28%.
On Slide 22, we show All Other, which reported a loss of $289 million. This was an improvement of $86 million from Q4 '14. This loss was driven by the $612 million pretax charge associated with our trust preferred as well as the impact on the U.K. tax law changes.  This was partially offset by gains in debt security sales as well as reserve releases on consumer real estate loans booked in All Other. 
A comment or 2 on taxes before wrapping up. The company's effective tax rate for the quarter, excluding the U.K. tax charge, was 25%, reflecting reoccurring tax benefits plus a few small [indiscernible] benefits. We would expect the tax rate to be in the low 30s for 2016, excluding unusual items. 
Before closing, I want to cover our early adoption of DVA accounting in more detail. In January of this year, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued an update to allow early adoption of a new rule regarding recognition of DVA on financial liabilities from changes in our own credit spreads. The update means that these types of debit valuation adjustments will now flow through OCI instead of the income statement. We believe this change makes our earnings comparisons more meaningful and easier to understand. Therefore, we adopted early. We restated all prior years -- we, excuse me, restated all periods this year per the FASB rules, and those numbers are contained in the supplemental package.  This had no impact on capital as it moved dollars between retained earnings and OCI, but it did impact revenue, earnings, taxes and EPS in the first 3 quarters of 2015. The changes reduced previously reported EPS by approximately $0.02 each in Q1, Q2 and Q3.  This accounting standard adoption did not impact DVA on derivatives, which continued to flow to trading account profits. 
Okay, let me conclude by offering a few takeaways. Although the U.S. economy is improving slowly, revenue growth remains challenging. This quarter, we continued our progress on those things we can control and drive. These include delivery for clients and customers within our risk framework and driving client and customer activity that will result in sustainable profits and returns.  Our results reflect this focus. We maintained a strong foundation of capital and liquidity. We grew loans, deposits and investment flows. We continued to invest in our franchise by adding sales professionals and improved technology. Our strength, global capability and experience allowed us to deliver for clients in a challenging market environment. And we did all this while closely managing expenses.
With that, we'll open it up to Q&A."

And if it's a supply issue, that affects these companies and related companies and demand from. But if it's a demand in the broadest context, our economies continue to slow down, and that's the broader concern. So we're looking at not only the impact in all the portfolios, thinking about who gets the benefits in our portfolio basis from low energy costs, which are serious benefits to the consumers and to companies that consume energy, versus those producing it. And so there's a balance here that we've got to think through. Right now, it's pretty isolated -- the energy companies, and even if you look at consumers who work for them and are bases by ZIP code and unemployment levels and stuff, we've seen relatively modest deterioration or none, and in the consumer side, people employed in these businesses. So I think as you think about it, the real question is going to come down to for '16 in terms of all our industries, are we in a demand-driven issue, i.e., a general economic issue, or if the United States is going to plug along. And if it does, then I think follow-up guidance is the right one. If you're in the supply, it's going to all be localized on these industries."

19049,315610271,919342,"Bank of America Corporation, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 19, 2016",2016-01-19,"Earnings Calls","Bank of America Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Lee, and good morning. Thanks all of you for joining us this morning to discuss our fourth quarter results.Before Paul Donofrio take you through the details of the quarter, I just want to provide some overall context in our progress in 2015 a",1225,"Thank you, Lee, and good morning. Thanks all of you for joining us this morning to discuss our fourth quarter results.
Before Paul Donofrio take you through the details of the quarter, I just want to provide some overall context in our progress in 2015 and the opportunity and challenges ahead. As you know, for the fourth quarter, we reported $3.3 billion in earnings of $0.28 per diluted share. For 2015, we had net income of $15.9 billion. That's the highest net income we've had in a long time. Full year returned metrics were 74 basis points for ROA and 9% through return on tangible common equity.
During 2015, we continued to drive rate lines of business forward. We felt -- we focused on driving responsive growth across all our businesses. As you look at the annual earnings of the company and see how they fell, you can see how they came through. Our consumer and wealth management businesses serving mass-market customers all the way to the wealthiest Americans delivered $9.3 billion of net income this year.
Our global banking business, which provides services to small, medium and large companies around the world, produced $5.3 billion in net income this year. When our institutional investor clients, our markets business, with its market-leading research capabilities and top-tier platform across the globe delivered $3 billion in earnings after adjusting for DVA in a very challenging market.
What's clear in these earnings despite the gyrations of markets, especially at the end of the year last year, is annuity nature that we get from our franchise by driving customer and client flows. That's the power of the company, its balance and scope and its solid -- its strong customer base. And we aim to continue to improve it every day for our clients and customers and our shareholders. These results reflect the work we've done over the past several years to develop a more straightforward, simplified operating model and focus on responsible growth.
As you can see on Slide 2, across a variety of measures, loan growth, business activity, capital, liquidity, credit losses and cost management, we've made meaningful progress and believe we're positioned for a variety of economic cycles. At the foundation of this is a strong capital and liquidity base. We added to our record liquidity levels in 2015, when we believed we are well positioned against the 2017 LCR requirements with total global excess liquidity sources now at over $500 billion. This amount represents nearly 1/4 of our balance sheet, and we have enough parent liquidity to last more than 3 years before we need to test the market we're funding.
Now our liquidity levels were driven by strong growth in deposits this year, and we were able to put that fund into work to grow loans on an absolute basis for the first time in several years. Loan growth was all driven by organic activity, consistent with our risk posture.
Our tangible common equity of $162 billion is at record levels as well. We returned $4.5 billion to shareholders this year in common dividends and share repurchases. Our tangible book value per share improved 8% in the past 12 months to a new high of $15.62. Our responsible lending focus also shows under -- in our underwriting results. Our net charge-offs were down to $4.3 billion this year, consistent with 2014, but much lower than previous years. 
Commercial charge-offs increased off a very low base, mostly from oil-related charge-offs, while consumer losses as a core have continued to improve. This reflects both the response of underwriting as we continue to improvement in our legacy portfolios.
And finally, we get to the cost management side. At the heart of our work has been improving expenses, which you can see are down sequentially from last year, mostly on lower litigation costs, but also on improved LAS and other operating costs. And these have improved steadily across the last several years. We began new BAC in 2011 and completed in 2014. Since then, we have been using our simplified and improved initiatives to find savings of more than offset increased compliance, merit and other inflationary costs, but most importantly, the savings fund investments in our business, whether it's in technology, our sales force growth or other infrastructure costs.
As we move to Slide 3, we included a few examples of trends business activity in our consumer side of the house and wealth management side of the house. As you can see, we grew average deposits in Consumer Banking wealth management business to $52 billion or 7% comparing year-over-year fourth quarter periods. These deposits were up over $105 billion in core deposits since the end of 2012. This is strong organic growth. It's a result of hard work in improving the customer satisfaction in our franchise by making it easier for customers to do business with our bank and strong product management simplifying the product set. All this has been done where we've optimized our delivery network, reducing our financial centers, divesting certain markets and also expanding our award-winning mobile capabilities in the customer base that uses that. As you can see, this work also extends to our wealth management business. We had long-term net flows for every quarter for 6.5 years in wealth management. We have record low levels and significantly higher deposit levels. Good products and advice, a growing sales force and 2 of the leading brands in business position us well here.
When you move to our Global Banking markets area, you can see in the institutional side of the house laid -- setup forth on Slide 4, we saw solid activity in '15. Loans to commercial and corporate clients around the globe have grown nicely. Client demand has been good and our bankers have met our challenge to capture market share response. This focus allowed us to demonstrate a strong 12% growth in loans in Global Banking in the past 12 months. And you can see the deposit growth has been strong here over the last year as well.
If you look at the markets business, Tom Montag and the team have done a good job reducing assets and lower the risk and still generating relatively stable revenue. Despite the recent market challenge, we remain quite profitable in this business and well positioned around the globe with both a strong FICC and equity platform.
As we step back, we must remain focused on our core customer strategy. We will continue to invest in the future in the events we continue to address the legacy issues of the past. We've been able to grow even as the operating and economic environment remains in a low growth mode. Our model is solid, but there's still plenty work to do, but also there's plenty of opportunity ahead for us.
Overall, I'm pleased with the progress we've made in 2015, and we have more to do in 2016. But in 2016, you should expect us to continue to focus on responsible growth. We'll continue to drive the investments made in the franchise to deliver the value to you as shareholders, we'll continue our sharp focus on risk management, and we'll continue our cost discipline as we look to continue to improve return on capital -- capital metrics of our company.
With that, let me hand it over to Paul."
19049,315610271,919342,"Bank of America Corporation, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 19, 2016",2016-01-19,"Earnings Calls","Bank of America Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Brian. Good morning, everyone. Starting on Slide 5, we present a summary of the income statement of returns for this quarter as well as the fourth quarter of last year which had similar seasonal aspects. We earned $3.3 billion in the quarter compa",3830,"Thanks, Brian. Good morning, everyone. Starting on Slide 5, we present a summary of the income statement of returns for this quarter as well as the fourth quarter of last year which had similar seasonal aspects. We earned $3.3 billion in the quarter compared to earnings of $3.1 billion in 4Q '14. Earnings per diluted share this quarter were up $0.28, up 12% versus a year ago.
Results include 2 significant charges that were previously announced and impacted EPS by $0.06. First, we recorded a pretax charge of $612 million associated with trust preferred securities, which phased out of Tier 2 capital at the end of 2015. Second, we had a tax charge of $290 million associated with the U.K. tax changes that were enacted during the quarter. Lastly, we had a few other items that benefit EPS this quarter by $0.01 on a net basis. These included a net -- a negative net DVA impact in sales and trading that was more than offset by positive impacts of market-related adjustments in net interest income and some one-off tax benefits.
Revenue on an FTE basis was $19.8 billion this quarter, up 4% from Q4 '14. Expenses were $13.9 billion, approximately $300 million or 2% lower than a year ago, driven by good expense discipline across the company. We also provided returns on a few other metrics on this page. I would remind you that client activity and revenue in our Global Markets segment tend to be lower or lowest in the fourth quarter, affecting returns and other statistics. Lastly, as many of you are aware, there was a recent accounting change that requires certain unrealized debit evaluation adjustments to be recorded directly to OCI rather than through the P&L. We early adopted this change effective as of the beginning of 2015. The slides and the supplemental earning materials that present 2015 results have been adjusted.
Turning to Slide 6 and focusing on the balance sheet. We grew deposits by $35 billion from Q3, and we used these increased deposits to fund responsible loan growth. In total, assets climbed $9 billion, as increases in loans and security balances of $30 billion were more than offset by reduction in trading-related assets and cash. Liquidity rose to just over $500 billion, a record level, and time to required funding remains over 3 years. Tangible common equity of $162 billion improved modestly from Q3 as earnings were offset by both the return of $1.3 billion in capital to common shareholders and negative OCI driven by security values. Tangible book value per share increased to $15.62, another new record high.
Turning to regulatory metrics, we began recording regulatory capital under the advanced approaches for the first time this quarter. And the CET1 transition ratio under Basel III ended the quarter at 10.2 and really has no comparable metric as transition ratios in prior periods were reported under the standardized approach with lower RWA levels.
On a fully phased-in basis, CET1 capital improved modestly to $154.1 billion. Under the advanced approaches, compared to Q3 '15 pro forma estimate, the CET1 ratio increased slightly to 9.8%. RWA was essentially flat as growth from commercial exposures was modest -- mostly offset by lower activity and balance sheet level in our Global Market segment. We also provide our capital metrics under the standardized approach. Here, our CET1 ratio was flat at 10.8%, with modest improvements in capital, offset by modest increase in RWA.
In terms of the supplementary leverage ratios, we estimate that as of 12/31, we continue to exceed U.S. rules applicable beginning in 2018 at both parent and bank.
Turning to Slide 7. We had strong loan and deposit growth this quarter. Reported loans on an end of period basis increased $15 billion from Q3. This is the third consecutive quarter of reported increases in total loan balances. We continue to see solid loan demand in our primary lending businesses, partially offset by a runoff in LAS and All Other. Excluding declines in LAS and All Other, ending loans in our primary lending segments increased $22 billion from Q3. $8 billion of this increase was in consumer loans as GWIM increased mortgages and security-based lending. Consumer Banking also saw a good loan growth in mortgages as well as vehicle loans.
We also had some seasonal growth in credit card, partially offset by selling $1.7 billion of card receivables at the end of the quarter. Commercial loans grew $15 billion, spread across multiple industry groups.
Turning to deposits. On many basis, they've reached nearly $1.2 trillion this quarter, growing $78 billion or 7% from Q4 '14. Growth was solid across the franchise. Consumer led the way, growing 9% year-over-year, while both Global Banking and GWIM each grew at a 6% pace.
Turning to asset quality on Slide 8. While still strong, we did see net charge-offs increase modestly from recent levels. Total net charge-offs increased $212 million versus Q3, $144 million was from consumer items previously reserved for, and lower recoveries on the sale of NPL in the fourth quarter versus Q3. We also saw a $73 million increase in net charge-offs from our energy portfolio. Outside of these 2 areas, net charge-offs were stable compared to Q3.
Provision of $110 million in Q4 was relatively flat with Q3. Reserve releases in consumer real estate and credit cards were partially offset by reserve builds in commercial, which were driven by increases in criticized exposures as well as loan growth. Reserve releases, excluding the previously reserved items I mentioned earlier, were roughly $200 million.
On Slide 9, we provide credit quality data on our consumer portfolio. Net charge-offs increased $130 million -- $137 million. The 2 items of note that make up this increase were reserved for in prior periods and did not impact provision expense in the quarter. $119 million was a result of collateral valuation adjustment. In addition, we had some small charge-offs associated with our 2014 DoJ settlement. We expect to complete our commitments under this settlement in the first half of 2016.
Adjusting for these 2 items, consumer net charge-offs were relatively flat versus Q3. Delinquency levels and NPLs continue to decline, and reserve coverage remained strong.
Moving to the commercial side. On Slide 10, net charge-offs increased $75 million, primarily from losses in our energy portfolio. Outside of the energy portfolio, commercial losses remained very low. Given the focus on the impacts of low oil prices on companies in the energy sector, we want to spend a minute to describe our energy portfolio and provide some perspective.
The pie chart breaks down our $21 billion of utilized exposure to the energy sector. This represents a little more than 2% of our total loan balances. Within that $21 billion, $8.3 million or less than 1% of total loans is loans to borrowers in 2 subsectors: exploration and production as well as oil field services. We consider these 2 subsectors to have significantly higher risk than the rest of the energy portfolio. Of our $8.3 billion (sic [$8.3 million] utilized exposure to these 2 higher risk subsectors, $2.9 million has already been downgraded to criticized. So 35% of the higher risk subsectors has already been downgraded to reservable criticized exposure, thereby driving a portion of the reserves. And allowances for loan losses for the entire energy portfolio is approximately $500 million or 6% of the fund exposure of these 2 subsectors.
Companies in the vertically integrated subsector represent $5.8 billion of the energy portfolio. We believe this subsector has a better ability to withstand lower oil prices. Nearly 100% of the companies have a market capital of $10 billion or more for their sovereign loan. And the average company has a market cap greater than $60 billion. We believe the remaining exposure in refining and marketing as well as other is also less dependent on oil prices.
As part of our standard risk management process, we stress test our credit portfolios, including our energy portfolio. Our stress analysis of the energy portfolio includes various sustained low oil prices over extended periods. As an example, if we have oil prices at $30 per barrel for 9 quarters, we estimate our potential losses on the energy portfolio would be roughly $700 million. In energy, and across our commercial sector, we continue to support clients while managing lending limits and actively engaging with stress borrowers.
Before moving from asset quality, I want to refocus on total provision spends and how one should think about it over the next couple of quarters. As we continue to access and react to future changes in the energy sector, we could see lumpiness that could potentially drive provision expense over $900 million.
Turning to our net interest income on Slide 11. On an FTE basis, NII was $10 billion, increasing roughly $300 million from Q3. NII included a negative $612 million charge associated with 3 trust preferred securities. These securities were scheduled to be completely phased out of Tier 2 capital as of Jan 1 and with 7% to 8% coupons became expensive debt. NII also included $115 million of positive market-related adjustments to the amortization of bond premiums under FAS 91. NII, excluding market-related adjustments and the charge on the trust preferred, improved $188 million from Q3 to $10.5 billion. This improvement was driven by increased deposit balances, which we used to fund growth in loans and securities.
As we move into the first quarter, please note the following: first, we will have 1 less day of interest; second, recent changes by Congress will lower the amount of dividends we receive from the FRB by approximately $50 million a quarter. Having said that, if the forward curve is realized and if we have some modest deposit loan growth, we still expect to show some growth in NII in Q1 '16 relative to our adjusted NII of $10.5 billion.
With regard to asset sensitivity, at the end of the fourth quarter, our overall asset sensitivity decreased slightly as a result of increases in volume [ph] rates as well as security balances. As of 12/31, an instantaneous 100 basis point parallel increase in rates is estimated to increase NII by approximately $4.3 billion over the subsequent year. A little more than half of that improvement comes from the increases in short-end rates and a little less than 1/4 of the benefit comes from market-related adjustments.
Turning to expenses on Slide 12. Noninterest expense was $13.9 billion in Q4, $300 million lower than Q4 '14. This was driven by good expense discipline across the company. Litigation expenses were a little higher this quarter at $428 million, exhibiting some lumpiness as we work to resolve legacy issues. Keep in mind that annual litigation expense decreased from $16.4 billion in 2014 to $1.2 billion in 2015. Legacy asset servicing costs, excluding litigation, finished Q4 a little better than our target of $800 million. As we have said, our net goal is $500 million per quarter. Expenses, excluding litigation and LAS, were $12.6 billion and represents the fifth quarter out of the past 6 below $12.8 billion. We continue to look for ways to streamline and simplify how we do business. This is important because it allows us to invest in growth while maintaining relatively flat core expenses in a sluggish revenue environment. And importantly, this relative flatness continued even as we invested in additional sales professionals and improve technology.
Looking towards expenses in 2016, let me remind you, in the first quarter, we will record, as normal, approximately $1 billion in cost for retirement eligible incentives. In addition, the first quarter typically includes seasonality -- seasonally higher favorable taxes of roughly $300 million. And if we experience traditional rebound in Q1 sales and trading revenue, this would also increase incentives and other associated costs.
Turning to the business segments and starting with Consumer Banking on Slide 13. Consumer earned $1.8 billion, 9% greater than Q4 last year. These results reflect good operating leverage on increased customer activity. The segment generated a strong 25% return on allocated capital. Revenue of $7.8 billion was up modestly from Q4 '14. Net interest income benefited from higher deposit and loan levels. 
Noninterest income was down slightly from lower mortgage banking. The decline in Mortgage revenue reflects selling fewer nonperforming loans as we hold more on our balance sheet. In addition, there was the absence of $30 million in quarterly revenue from the Q3 sale of a small noncore appraisal business. 
Expenses declined 2% from Q4 '14 as the savings from reductions in financial centers and personnel more than offset our cost from investment in presale specialists. The cost of operating a deposit franchise remains low at 177 basis points. Operating leverage growth improvement in the efficiency ratio to 56% as we continued to experience shifts in customer activity away from branches towards self-serve options.
Mobile banking users increased to 18.7 million, which is up 13% from Q4 '14, and deposit transactions from these devices now represent 15% of deposit transactions. 
Slide 14 presents consumers' progress across a number of customer activities. I would highlight activities in 3 areas, loans, deposits and brokerage assets, where we continued to grow responsibly. These 3 products are the core of our rewards programs, where we share benefits with customers who deepen relationships with us. Average loans grew $12 billion from Q4 '14 in mortgages and vehicle lending. And in deposits, growth was strong at $48 billion or 9% from Q4, while the rate paid declined to 4 basis points.
Regarding brokerage assets. Merrill Edge asset levels of $123 billion are up 8% from last year even with declines in equity markets this year. 
Total mortgage production was up 13% from Q4 last year and stable with Q3. 
Looking at card activity, which includes GWIM, card issuance was strong at 1.3 million. Average U.S. card balances of $83 billion -- of $89 billion were down modestly from last year but up seasonally from Q3 '15.
U.S. cards' credit quality was strong as net charge-offs remain at deputy [ph] low levels of 2.5% with a risk-adjusted margin of 9.4%. Credit spending volumes finished on a high note as Q4 spending was 5% higher than last year, outpacing what we believe to be total market spend levels. Debit spending was strong as well. For example, on Christmas Eve day, we saw record debit card spending of more than $1 billion. 
In our consumer segment, we expect technology adoption by customers to continue to be a cornerstone of not only improved customer satisfaction but also efficiency gains and operating leverage. The latest examples of this are around digital selling and appointment setting. Digital sales in the fourth quarter were up more than 31% from last year. Digital appointments reached more than 16,000 in the recent week. We expect these adoption trends to play an increasing role in future performance and customer satisfaction as we continue to advance online and mobile capabilities. 
Turning to Slide 15. Global Wealth and Investment Management produced earnings of $614 million. Results were down from Q4 last year, driven by lower transactional revenue and the impact of the market decline on asset management fees. Transactional revenue continues to be impacted by the shifting of activity from brokerage to managed relationships as well as market uncertainty.
NII benefited from solid loan growth and solid deposit growth but was offset by the company's ALM activities, leaving NII relatively flat with Q4 '14. Noninterest expense was modestly higher than the year-ago period. Investment in client-facing professionals continues, while lower revenue caused decline in incentive compensation that was more than offset by amortization of stock awards issued in prior periods. Pretax margin was 21%, down from Q4 '14.
Beginning in the first quarter of 2016, we will benefit from lower expense resulting from the completion of amortizations related to advisory retention awards given at the time of the Merrill Lynch merger. 
Moving to Slide 16. Despite the volatility in market levels, we continue to see solid client activity, and we continue to invest in the business, growing wealth advisers 5% from Q4 last year. Long-term AUM flows were $7 billion and remained positive for the 26th consecutive quarter. Deposit flows were strong, growing end-of-balance -- growing end-of-period balances $15 billion from Q3. By the way, this may have been driven in part by client concerns with market volatility.
Loans continued to grow, improving 10% from last year. This is the 23rd consecutive quarter of average loan growth in this segment.
Turning to Slide 17. Global Banking earned $1.4 billion, down 9% from Q4 '14 but still generating a 16% return on allocated capital. The earnings decline from Q4 was driven by higher provision expense. Provision expense was up $264 million from Q4 last year, driven by higher energy-related charge-offs and reserve builds for loan growth and energy-related risks. Revenue increased modestly from Q4 '14 while expense declined modestly. 
Driven by higher loan balances, NII improved despite spread compression and the allocation of the company's ALM activities, including higher liquidity costs. Noninterest income benefited from higher treasury services revenue, higher leasing revenue and a small gain from the sale of its foreclosed property, partially offset by lower IB fees.
Looking at trends on Slide 18 and comparing to Q4 '14, IB fees of $1.3 billion were down 17% as leveraged finance and equity issuance was partially offset by advisory fees that were at second highest level since the Merrill merger. From a market share perspective, we maintained our #3 global fee ranking. 
Looking at the balance sheet, loans on average were $320 billion, up 12% year-over-year. The growth was broad based across C&I, real estate and leasing. We continue to experience some spread compression, although it has moderated relative to a year ago.
Asset quality of new loans was consistent with the overall portfolio. On deposits, we saw good performance with average deposits increasing by $16 billion or 5% over Q4 '14. The mix of these deposits remains very good with less than 5% classified as 100% run-off balances.
Switching to Global Markets on Slide 19 and compared to Q4 last year. We are pleased with the results here given challenging market conditions as the teams increased revenues while using lower asset levels and less VaR. Global Markets earned approximately $200 million. But we think when you consider results excluding DVA, on that basis, adjusted earnings were $308 million, which was relatively flat to Q4 '14 on a similarly adjusted basis.  Note that our net DVA loss this quarter was $198 million and compared to a loss of $626 million in Q4 '14, which included an initial FVA adjustment. Total revenue, excluding DVA, improved $313 million or 10% from the fourth quarter last year on improved FICC sales and trading. Outside of sales and trading, Global Markets' share of lower investment banking fees was offset by a gain on the sale of an equity investment. 
Noninterest expense increased 9%, in line with revenue improvement. 
Moving to trends on the next slide and focusing on the components of our sales and trading performance. Sales and trading revenue of $2.6 billion, excluding net DVA, was up 11.5% from Q4 '14. Compared to Q4 last year, FICC sales and trading of $1.8 billion improved 20%, reflecting improvements across most products, notably in rates and credit-related products. Equity trading of $822 million declined 3%, reflecting lower client activity. Average traded -- trading-related asset levels were down 9% in Q4 '14 while VaR was down 14%. 
Turning to Legacy Assets and Servicing on Slide 21. This segment lost roughly $350 million, in line with the prior year. Focus areas here are mortgage banking income, the number of delinquent loans and expenses, all compared to Q4 '14. First, mortgage banking income, which improved slightly, was driven by 3 factors. Rep and warranty provisioning improved $237 million to a provision of $9 million this quarter. That favorability was offset by a decline in servicing fees of $108 million as used service declined, as well as a decline in net MSR hedge performance of $152 million. Next, the number of first mortgage loans that we serviced that are 60 days delinquent continued to decline and are now at 103,000 units. And last, the team did an excellent job lowering expenses. Excluding litigation, we achieved our goal of $800 million, moving costs down $309 million or 28%.
On Slide 22, we show All Other, which reported a loss of $289 million. This was an improvement of $86 million from Q4 '14. This loss was driven by the $612 million pretax charge associated with our trust preferred as well as the impact on the U.K. tax law changes.  This was partially offset by gains on debt security sales as well as reserve releases on consumer real estate loans booked in All Other. 
A comment or 2 on taxes before wrapping up. The company's effective tax rate for the quarter, excluding the U.K. tax charge, was 25%, reflecting reoccurring tax benefits plus a few small [indiscernible] benefits. We would expect the tax rate to be in the low 30s for 2016, excluding unusual items. 
Before closing, I want to cover our early adoption of DVA accounting in more detail. In January of this year, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued an update to allow early adoption of a new rule regarding recognition of DVA on financial liabilities from changes in our own credit spreads. The update means that these types of debit valuation adjustments will now flow through OCI instead of the income statement. We believe this change makes our earnings comparisons more meaningful and easier to understand. Therefore, we adopted early. We restated all prior years -- we, excuse me, restated all periods this year per the FASB rules, and those numbers are contained in the supplemental package.  This had no impact on capital as it moved dollars between retained earnings and OCI, but it did impact revenue, earnings, taxes and EPS in the first 3 quarters of 2015. The changes reduced previously reported EPS by approximately $0.02 each in Q1, Q2 and Q3. This accounting standard adoption did not impact DVA on derivatives, which continued to flow through trading account profits. 
Okay, let me conclude by offering a few takeaways. Although the U.S. economy is improving slowly, revenue growth remains challenging. This quarter, we continued our progress on those things we can control and drive. These include delivery for clients and customers within our risk framework and driving client and customer activity that will result in sustainable profits and returns. Our results reflect this focus. We maintain a strong foundation of capital and liquidity. We grew loans, deposits and investment flows. We continue to invest in our franchise by adding sales professionals and improved technology. Our strength, global capability and experience allowed us to deliver for clients in a challenging market environment. And we did all this while closely managing expenses.
With that, we'll open it up to Q&A."

We sort of slowed that down 24 months ago. That's started to drop in terms of growth rate.

But we slowed it down just to keep the company in balance, and that's been our watchword. If you think about the consumer, those sub-prime, no more than FICO scores, if you look at the coming on FICOs are higher than the portfolio still, which is almost hard to believe, the charge-offs, delinquencies. And both home equities delinquencies across the last 4 years has continue to come -- get lower every year and this year was the lowest they've been, all the way back a long time in both the credit card and home equities. And if you look at the client structure in the U.S., a couple of things. One is, we're adding officers in the middle-market business, but they're going after our target clients. And this is not go find new industries, et cetera. So whether it's the way we lend in commercial real estate, which is down -- which is very high-end real estate developers, et cetera. The way we lend in middle-market is very strong. So if you look across this client selection in the middle-market business, it's been strong.

And so I think it's client selection. We slowed down international. It's sort of always watching, and in fact, using your stress test to make sure you stay balanced. And if you look at us, we feel we're pretty balanced between the consumer and commercial, sort of 50-50.

Right now, it's pretty isolated -- the energy companies, and even if you look at consumers who work for them in our bases by ZIP code and unemployment levels and stuff, we've seen relatively modest deterioration or none, and in the consumer side, people employed in these businesses. So I think as you think about it, the real question is going to come down to for '16 in terms of all our industries, are we in a demand-driven issue, i.e., a general economic issue, or is the United States is going to plug along. And if it does, then I think follow-up guidance is the right one. If you're in the supply, it's going to all be localized on these industries."

Right now, we're operating 66%, 67% -- 67%, probably normalized for '15. And between LAS, we can drop that down to 65%. And that's just hard work, and we're grinding away at it every day. You're seeing loans grow. You're seeing deposits grow. And so you should see an improvement in 2016."

I want to thank you for joining us to review our first quarter results. Today, we reported $2.7 billion in earnings this quarter or $0.21 per diluted share. As you can see in the results, 2 large items impac",1056,"Thank you, Lee, and good morning to everyone. I want to thank you for joining us to review our first quarter results. 
Today, we reported $2.7 billion in earnings this quarter or $0.21 per diluted share. As you can see in the results, 2 large items impacted this quarter's results. We recorded negative market-related NII adjustments for bond premium amortization. That adjustment alone cost us $0.07 per diluted share, and we also recorded a $0.05 per share diluted share cost to seasonal retirement-eligible incentives. 
When you think about revenue, net interest income, excluding that bond premium adjustment, was $10.6 billion this quarter. This is an improvement linked quarter and year-over-year. 
Our loans are growing across the franchise and compared to the prior year, are up 11% in our business segments. 
In addition, deposit growth remains very strong. Our deposits are up $64 billion from last year or 6% to over $1.2 trillion. This growth reflects our progress to grow responsibly and deepen relationships with all of our core customers. 
Moving to noninterest income. It declined year-over-year. Of note, the downdraft, and that was driven by capital markets and related activities and, to a lesser degree, mortgage servicing and other fees as we continue to wind down our third-party servicing book. 
However, the other banking sources of noninterest income were relatively stable. 
Switching to costs. We continue to drive cost down in this company. Cost year-over-year in the first quarter were down 6%. FTE were down 3%. That is $1 billion per quarter, $4 billion on annualized basis. 
And if you focus just on the core cost, excluding our LAS and litigation, those were down $600 million quarter -- from first quarter of last year or $2.4 billion annualized. We're going to keep driving those cost down as we continue to move forward through 2016. 
Turning to Slide 3 and looking at the business segment earnings, you can see the good year-over-year results because the operating leverage in those businesses. The only exception is the results in Global Banking, which were negatively impacted by the increased energy related reserves. 
The combination of business segments outside the All Other group earned $4.5 billion in quarter 1 this year compared to $3.9 billion in quarter 1 of 2015. Offsetting those earnings were the $1.9 billion loss in All Other. That loss primarily reflects the 2 large adjustments I mentioned earlier and some legacy litigation costs. You can also see the returns and efficiency ratios for each of our segments and note with the exception of LAS, which came close to breaking even this quarter, they earned above their cost of capital. 
Moving to Slide 4. During the period of -- during the first quarter, there's a lot of talk with the market volatility a company buying surrounding the question about global growth and the forward-looking economic picture. However, we don't see any evidence of our customer base changing. Spending by consumers remain strong and is up year-over-year over 4%. Loan demand remains solid throughout the franchise, and we continue to position our company to face any potential economic outcome. 
When you think about this, it's important to remember the work we've done over the past years to simplify and strengthen our foundation. We remain different company today than that which have been in the last downturn. We start with a clear strategy to serve the core financial needs of the customers. We've gotten out of businesses portfolios products and client relationships that don't meet those strategic goals. We simplified the company in every area. We cut the number of legal entities in half, and we also reduced cost through programs like New BAC that produced loan more than $8 billion in savings, annual savings and our SIM program, which continues to operate today, but at the same time, we continue to invest in the areas we can grow. $3 billion in technology related growth initiatives especially in areas of digital practice, whether it's in Consumer Banking, Commercial Banking, where we lead the industry with mobile and online platforms. We've also invested more in client-facing teammates, funding that investment through elimination of bureaucracy and solicitation and elimination of management jobs. 
We believe that we have to continue to drive our productivity, and we'll continue to do so in 2016. In the end, when you think about all this, it makes our company more resolvable. As you all know, we received the latest input from our regulators on our resolution plans yesterday. Those plans were filed 9 months ago, and we've been busy at work since the day they were filed to continue to remedy the deficiencies and shortcomings dated in those plans, and we'll do so by the October submission date. 
As we move to Slide 5, you can also see the financial foundation that we've built in this company, liquidity and capital at record levels. Tangible book value per share, the marker of what we shareholders on our company, now stands at $16.17, and it has improved over $5 a share over the last few years even as we've taken the hits that are now largely behind us. 
Our funding structure continues to improve. Long-term debt has been cut dramatically. Deposits have increased over 20%, and all that -- most of that growth is coming through our Consumer Banking, Wealth Management segments. 
Our loan book is now well-balanced: half consumer, half commercial. And importantly, the consumer piece is much more secured lending than it was before the last crisis. 
As we look in global markets, whether it's on Level 3 assets, which are more risky, with the trading assets or VaR, they're all down significantly over the last few years. So as you can see, we simplified our company and our operating structure. 
As we look ahead to 2016, we remain focused on what we can control. We intend to keep driving the core customer activity you see in the loan and deposit and customer flow growth in each and every business, focusing intently on the Wealth Management, Global Markets businesses to take advantage as those markets stabilize. We'll continue to drive on focusing on cost to drive cost down, and we'll continue to drive to deliver more capital to you as we did in the first quarter as investors. 
With that, let me hand it over to Paul."

Good morning, everybody, and thanks for joining us. Starting on Slide 6, we present a summary of the income statement and returns for this quarter, highlighting comparisons to Q4 '15 as well as Q1 '15. Earnings this quarter were $2.7 bi",3708,"Thanks, Brian. Good morning, everybody, and thanks for joining us. 
Starting on Slide 6, we present a summary of the income statement and returns for this quarter, highlighting comparisons to Q4 '15 as well as Q1 '15. 
Earnings this quarter were $2.7 billion or $0.21 per share. These earnings include the negative impact of the FAS 91 market-related adjustment, which reduced EPS by $0.07. They also include $850 million of FAS 123 retirement-eligible incentive expense, which reduced EPS by $0.05. 
For comparative purposes, the aggregate impact of these 2 same items in Q1 '15 reduced EPS by $0.08. Revenue on an FTE basis was $19.7 billion this quarter. Adjusted for FAS 91, revenue was $20.9 billion, a decline of $700 million from Q1 '15 on a adjusted basis. This decline was driven by the reduction in sales and trading revenue and IBCs as well as mortgage banking income, offset by the improvement in adjusted NII. 
Expenses were $14.8 billion, approximately $1 billion or 6% lower than a year ago, driven by good discipline across the entire company. Before moving to the balance sheet, I want to note an adjustment to the financial statements this quarter, reclassifying some operating leases. We moved $6 billion of leases to other assets, and we made conforming reclassifications to prior periods to improve comparability. This reclassification had no effect on net income. 
However, as a result of this reclassification, quarterly NII is lower by approximately $50 million, other income is higher by approximately $180 million, and depreciation expense is higher by about $130 million. While these changes are small and don't affect profits, I wanted to note them, so that you can more easily adjust your models. 
Turning to Slide 7 and the balance sheet. Total assets increased $41 billion from Q4, driven by higher Global Markets activity as well as increased cash. Deposits rose $20 billion from Q4 while loans increased $4 billion. Driven by deposit inflows, liquidity rose to $525 billion. Time to required funding while down remains strong at 3 years, and note that the first quarter included the $8.5 billion settlement payment to Bank of New York Mellon as trustee in the Article 77 suit, which was reserved for over 4 years ago. 
Tangible common equity of $167 billion improved $4.7 billion from Q4. On a per share basis, tangible book value increased to $16.17, up 9% from Q1 '15. 
Turning to regulatory metrics. As a reminder, we record regulatory capital under the advanced approaches. 
Our CET1 transition ratio under Basel III ended the quarter at 10.3% and really is only comparable to Q4 as prior periods were reported under the standardized approach prior to our exit from parallel run. On a fully phased-in basis, CET1 capital improved $3.4 billion to $158 billion as improvements from earnings and OCI were partially offset by dividends and repurchases. Under the advanced approaches, compared to Q4 '15, the CET1 ratio increased 30 basis points to 10.1% and is now above our fully phased-in 2019 requirement. 
RWA decreased roughly $18 billion, driven by reductions related to retail exposures as credit quality improved. We also provide our capital metrics under the standardized approach. Here, our CET1 ratio improved to 11% with the same capital improvement as advanced but less of RWA improvement given standardized is less risk sensitive. 
Supplemented leverage ratios for both the parent and the bank continue to exceed U.S. regulatory amendments that take effect in 2018. 
Turning to Slide 8. We had solid loan and deposit growth in the quarter. Reported loans of 800 -- excuse me, reported loans of $901 billion on an end-of-period basis increased $4 billion from Q4 and are up $28 billion or 3% from Q1 '15. Loans in our primary lending segments were up $14 billion or 2% from Q4, which is 8% on an annualized basis. 
We continue to see solid commercial loan growth in Global Banking. In Consumer Banking, we continue to see strong growth in consumer real estate and vehicle lending. Lastly, in Wealth Management, we also saw continued growth in consumer real estate. 
Loans outside the primary lending segments and LAS and All Other were down $10 billion from Q4, driven by continued paid ounce of first- and second-lien mortgages as well as loan sales. During the quarter, we sold FHA loans totaling $2.7 billion and NPLs and other delinquent loans of roughly $1 billion, recording a small gain on sales and other income. 
Turning to deposits. On an ending basis, they reached $1.2 trillion this quarter, growing $64 billion or 6% from Q1 '15. Growth was led by our consumer businesses. Consumer Banking grew $43 billion or 8% year-over-year. GWIM grew nearly $17 billion, a 7% pace, and Global Banking grew at a 3% pace. 
Turning to asset quality on Slide 9. Outside the energy sector, credit quality is strong. Total net charge-offs were $1.1 billion in Q1 and Q4. We had some immaterial movements this quarter from minor adjustments.But overall, very little change in consumer losses. 
Commercial losses declined slightly from Q4 despite a slight increase in energy charge-offs. The provision of $1 billion in Q1 was up $187 million from Q4. While net charge-offs were flat, total reserve release declined as reserve releases in consumer were mostly offset by reserve increases in commercial, driven by energy exposures. 
On Slide 10, we provide credit quality data on our consumer portfolio. Net charge-offs declined $41 million from Q4. Consumer real estate charge-offs benefited from continued portfolio improvement and fewer onetime items, primarily collateral valuation adjustments on the consumer -- on consumer real estate. Adjusting for those items, consumer net charge-offs were relatively flat versus Q4. Delinquency levels and NPLs improved, and reserve coverage remained strong. 
Moving to commercial credit on Slide 11. Net charge-offs improved $35 million. A decline in nonenergy net charge-offs from Q4 more than offset a modest increase in energy losses. Energy charge-offs increased $17 million from Q4 to roughly $100 million in the quarter. 
Given that asset quality outside energy remains relatively stable, let's focus on energy. We continue to support our energy clients while managing limits and actively engaging with stress borrowers. Our overall committed energy exposures declined slightly from Q4 while utilized exposures were up by 100 -- by, excuse me, $500 million. 
As discussed last quarter, within energy, we believe 2 subsectors, refining and marketing as well as vertically integrated, which, by the way, tend to be large market cap and/or sovereign supported, these 2 subsectors are less dependent on oil prices and therefore, carry less risk than our exposures in E&P and oilfield services. 
Looking at our $7.7 billion utilized exposure to the higher risk E&P and oilfield services clients, we saw a decline of $600 million from Q4 as payoffs and charge-offs more than offset drawdowns. In addition, this quarter, we moved $1.6 billion of our energy exposure to reservable criticized, and we added $525 million to our energy reserves. We made these adjustments based upon another quarter of not only low oil prices but also volatile oil prices. This moves our energy reserve to just over $1 billion. And while these reserves cover our full energy portfolio, they would represent 13% of our $7.7 billion E&P and oilfield services exposures. We believe that percentage is probably more relevant as you compare exposures across the industry. 
Turning to Slide 12. Net interest income on an FTE basis was $9.4 billion. Included in NII this quarter was a FAS 91 negative $1.2 billion market-related adjustment for bond premium amortization. This adjustment in Q1 '15 was a negative $500 million. And including TRUPS-related charges, Q4 was also negative $500 million. 
Adjusted NII of $10.6 billion improved approximately $500 million compared to Q1 '15, excluding FAS 91 and improved $100 million from Q4 after also excluding the TRUPS charge. 
Several factors contributed to the improvement from Q4. We had good commercial loan growth funded by deposits. We also had about $100 million in seasonal benefits in Q1. Offsetting these factors, we had 1 less day of interest and lower dividends on our Federal Reserve stock as required to contribute to the Highway Trust Fund. Lower long-term rates also offset some of the benefits of the Fed rate hike in December, pressuring NII. 
Lower long-term rates was also the driver of increased asset sensitivity in the quarter. As of 3/31, an instantaneous 100 basis point parallel increase in rates is estimated to increase NII by approximately $6 billion over the subsequent year. About 40% of this estimated $6 billion increase comes from short-end rate improvement, and the rest is from long-end rate improvement, split equally between FAS 91 and reinvestment at higher rates. 
Turning to Slide 13. Noninterest expense was $14.8 billion in the quarter. That is $1 billion or 6% lower than Q1 '15, driven by good expense discipline across the company. Legacy asset cost, excluding litigation -- excuse me, legacy asset servicing costs, excluding litigation, were $729 million this quarter, declining $292 million from Q1 '15 and $64 million from Q4. 
Litigation expense of $388 million was in line with Q1 '15 as we work to resolve remaining legacy issues. First quarter expense also included FAS 123 annual retirement cost of $850 million, slightly below Q1 '15. First quarter of both years also included about $300 million of seasonally elevated payroll tax expense. Adjusting for all these items, i.e., litigation, LAS, FAS 123 and the elevated payroll tax, expenses were $12.5 billion. This decline of $600 million from Q1 '15 was driven by lower revenue-related costs associated with sales and trading in Investment Banking as well as revenue in our Wealth Management business, the rolloff of advisory retention awards put in place after the combination with Merrill Lynch and lastly, SIM initiatives that are improving productivity and helping us lower cost so that we can continue to invest in growth. 
Our employee base is down 3% from Q1 '15, and increases in client-facing professionals were more than offset by reductions in LAS and other operations staff. 
Lastly, before leaving expense highlights, I want to remind you that quarterly FDIC insurance expense is set to increase at the large banks until the deposit insurance fund reaches 1.35%. For us, this will increase expense by approximately $100 million pretax starting in Q3 '16. 
Okay. Turning to the business segments and starting with Consumer Banking on Slide 14. Consumer earned $1.8 billion, 22% better than Q1 last year. These earnings reflect continued core customer growth coupled with strong expense management. Lower provision expense from continued improvement in asset quality also benefited the bottom line. This work generated a strong 24% return on allocated capital. Note that allocated capital increased slightly for 2016 pursuant to our normal capital allocation reviews completed in Q1. 
On Slide 15, we focus on some important trends. First, in the upper left, we continue to lead the industry in a number of ways as you can see from the stats. 
Revenue increased $242 million or 3% from Q1 '15 as NII growth more than offset lower noninterest income. Net interest income benefited from the higher client balances. Noninterest income was down due to lower mortgage banking income, offset by increases in card income and service charges. We continue to see mortgage banking income come down, given our strategy to book more of our originations on the balance sheet. 
Expenses declined 2% from Q1 '15. On the bottom left, you can see the year-over-year decline in FTEs as Global Banking growth continues to help us optimize our delivery network. Note, while overall FTEs are down year-over-year, sales specialists are up almost 900 from Q1 '15. 
Lastly, our deposit franchise continues to drive operating leverage. Our cost of deposits as a percent of average deposits continues to improve and now stands at 171 basis points, which, we believe, is best in class in the industry. 
Focusing on mobile banking users in the upper right for a minute, we added 910,000 net new mobile users this quarter. We now have nearly 20 million active users, and deposit transactions from mobile devices now represent 16% of deposit transactions. 
Interestingly, this quarter, we added more net new users than any quarter in the last 3 years, and we continue to add new features and capabilities, improving convenience and satisfaction. One way we are [indiscernible] adoption is by deploying digital ambassadors in our financial sectors. Digital ambassadors engage with customers who come to our branches to transact. They educate these customers on alternatives to branch banking, which are not only more convenient for them but also less expensive for us. Digital sales, digital appointments, digital satisfaction all continue to achieve new highs. Focusing on the client balances you can see Merrill edge brokerage assets are up 7% from Q1 '15 on strong flows, offset by lower valuations. 
Moving to the bottom right of the page, note that loans were up 8% from Q1 '15 on strong mortgage and auto growth. 
Okay. Moving to Slide 16. This is a new page that presents some statistics around loan growth and the quality of originations in our Consumer segment. 
Starting with card, we issued 1.2 million cards in the quarter, which is a bit lower than the past few quarters. Average balances were impacted by the sale of a $1.7 billion nonstrategic card portfolio late in Q4. Adjusting for that divestiture, loans were up from Q4. 
Spending on credit card, adjusted for divestitures, was up 8% compared to Q1 '15. As we have discussed many times and shown here, we are originating high-cycle loans that have produced very low loss rates and strong risk-adjusted margins currently exceeding 9%. 
Moving to vehicle lending, one thing similar high-quality, low-risk lending stats. Average booked FICOs are around 780, and loss rates are low. Also, the tenor of these loans is relatively conservative compared to the industry as nearly 90% of our loans are less than 73 months. 
Margins, obviously, aren't as high as credit card, but average debt balances are growing well across multiple channels within the business. Our underwriting standards are producing similar results in consumer real estate lending, which is presented on the bottom of page. 
Net loss rates on first-lien mortgages have been negligible. Remember, we began building these loans in the Consumer segment in the first quarter of 2014, and the macro consumer environment has been healthy, particularly for high FICO borrowers. 
Turning to Slide 17. Global Wealth and Investment Management produced earnings of $740 million, up 13% from Q1 '15. Year-over-year, revenue was down, but expenses declined more, improving pretax margin to 26%. Overall, revenue declined 2% in Q1 '15 as strong NII growth was more than offset by lower market sensitive revenue. 
Asset management revenue declined on lower market values. Transactional revenue was also down and continues to be impacted by the shifting of activity from brokerage to management relationships as well as market uncertainty. 
NII benefited from solid deposit and loan growth. Noninterest expense in the first quarter of 2016 benefited from the fully amortized advisory retention awards given at the time of the Merrill Lynch merger. We have not seen a noticeable attrition as a result of this. Lower revenue-related incentives also contributed to lower expense versus Q1 '15.
Moving to Slide 18. Despite lower market levels, we continued to see overall solid client engagement, and we continue to invest in the business, growing client-facing professionals year-over-year. 
Client balances are $2.5 trillion. Long-term AUM flows were down this quarter as a result of market volatility, which impacted client behavior. Average deposits grew $9 billion from Q4, and average loans also grew this quarter, concentrated in consumer real estate lending. 
Turning to Slide 19. Global Banking earned $1.1 billion, down from both comparative periods as energy reserves weighed on results. Despite this increased provision expense, Global Banking was able to deliver a 12% return on allocated capital, and note that we allocated $2 billion more in capital to Global Banking for 2016 pursuant to our annual evaluation of allocated capital. 
Global Banking continues to drive solid loan growth within its risk and client frameworks, and this drove a nice increase year-over-year in NII, mitigated, to some degree, by spread compression. That NII improvement, combined with revenue growth from credit cards and treasury fees, partially offset a decline in Investment Banking and other marks on loans and hedges. Noninterest expense compared to Q1 '15 reflects a decline in revenue-related expense, offset by the cost of adding sales professionals over the past 12 months. 
Looking at trends on Slide 20 and comparing to Q1 last year, it was obviously a tough quarter for the capital markets with spikes in volatility causing declines in client activity. However, clients still have financing needs. And here is where the diversity and strength of our franchise allows us to continue to deliver for them even when capital markets are less attractive. 
You can see that trend in our average loans and lease balances, which increased again this quarter and are up 14% year-over-year. Growth in loans was broad based across C&I, CRE and leasing although recently, we have slow growth in CRE. Spread compression on average across all our consumer sizes has moderated relative to a year ago. Average deposits also increased from Q1 '15, up $11 billion or 4%. 
We remain focused on our deposit mix, which is strong with only 3% classified as 100% runoff balances. On the other hand, total firm-wide IBCs of $1.2 billion were down 22% from Q1 '15, with the clients broad based across M&A, DCM and ECM. 
Switching to Global Markets on Slide 21 and comparing Q1 last year, again the challenging market condition caused revenue compared to Q1 '15 to be down. The quarter included the benefit from the resolution of a litigation matter, and we also had lower revenue-related cost compared to Q1 '15. All of this resulted in Global Markets reporting earnings just under $1 billion. Reported revenue is down year-over-year, but note that last year, DVA negatively impacted revenue versus added to revenue this quarter. 
Total revenue, excluding DVA, while up from Q4 was down 17% from Q1 last year on lower sales and trading revenue as well as Global Markets' share of lower IBCs. Noninterest expense declined 23% from Q1 '15, driven by lower litigation. Adjusting for litigation, expenses were down 9% as a result of lower revenue-related expenses, demonstrating a disciplined approach to compensation. 
Moving to trends on the next slide and focusing on the components of our sales and trading performance. Sales and trading revenue of $13.3 billion, excluding net DVA, is up 25% from Q4 with improvement in both fixed and equity but down 16% from Q1 last year. Versus Q1 '15, fixed sales and trading of $2.3 billion fell 17%, reflecting a tough environment for credit-related products as well as a tough comparison to a strong Q1 '15 in currencies. 
Equity trading was $1 billion, declining 11%, reflecting weaker trading performance in a challenging market environment. Average trading assets continued to trend down as did VaR, which remains at historically low levels. 
Turning to Legacy Assets and Servicing on Slide 23. This segment lost $40 million this quarter. I'm not going to spend a lot of time here as trends are consistent with past quarters. Revenue is down a bit from lower servicing fees as the portfolio of service loans declines. Revenue was also impacted by lower net [indiscernible]. As the portfolio shrinks, we continue to lower servicing costs, particularly with respect to loans. The number of 60-plus day delinquent first mortgage loans serviced continue to decline and is now only 88,000 units. Excluding litigation, expense this quarter were $729 million, dropping nearly $300 million from Q1 '15 and down $64 million from Q4. 
On Slide 24, we show All Other, which reported a loss of $1.9 billion. Results were impacted by the $1.2 billion FAS 91 market-related adjustment, the FAS 123 seasonal retirement-eligible incentive costs and litigation costs. 
The loss here is higher than Q1 '15 for a number of reasons. First, the market-related adjustment is more negative this year than last. Second, we had higher gains on sale of loans in Q1 '15 than this period. Third, provision expense is higher as both periods had a benefit from provision but this quarter, that benefit was smaller than Q1 '15. Lastly, litigation costs were higher this quarter versus Q1 '15 as we work down legacy issues. 
The effective tax rate for the quarter was about 28%, which is better than we expect for the full year absent any unusual items. One expected item that we want to bring to attention is another U.K. tax rate reduction recently proposed in the Chancellor's budget. We expect this to be signed into law in Q3 and will result in a tax charge of about $350 million to reduce the carrying value of our U.K. DTA. The vast majority of this charge will not impact regulatory capital. 
Okay. So let me offer a few takeaways as I finish. Given the market volatility, revenue growth was challenging this quarter. However, we compensated for this by managing expenses as well. If one adjust this period's reported results for the noncash FAS 91 market-related NII amount and the FAS 123 costs, earnings are largely in line with recent quarters. You can see progress most clearly in our business segments, which don't include these adjustments. 
Taken as a whole, the segments, not including All Other, improved earnings by 16% versus Q1 '15. The drivers of this improvement were solid loan and deposit growth across our customer groups. Net charge-offs were largely unchanged as modest increases in energy were mitigated by other improvements. 
We strengthened our capital liquidity, and we returned $1.5 billion in common dividend and repurchases to shareholders. To Brian's earlier point, we have done years of work to simplify the company and reduce risk. 
With $167 billion in tangible common equity, $12 billion in credit reserves and twice the amount of liquidity of a few years ago, we believe we are well prepared to help customers and clients in good and bad times, and we are focused on growing earnings in many different economic scenarios. 
With that, let's open it up to Q&A."

So then if you flip and say how are we going to get down there? You're exactly right. If you look, we drifted down even further this quarter in numbers of branches, numbers of customers, but deposits were up. If you look at headcount in consumer, we continue to reposition towards sales and relationship management side and away from the transactional side, and so that digitalization, which is we're at 19.6 million mobile banking consumer customers, and interesting enough, we're growing on the online customer base, meaning computer-based customers grew over 1 million customers from last year's first quarter. So all that describes more and more transactions and more and more cost structure day-to-day transactional stuff into those environments and saves us money overall.

Last year this quarter, we had 17 million mobile users. This year, we have 19.5 million. And as Paul said, there's an interesting point that the nominal rate of growth this quarter was one of the highest we ever had. So even though smartphones are penetrated, you think you've kind of penetrated the customer base, it's still growing fast. So that's number one. And then, as I said earlier, Betsy, and you followed our company for a long time, you might have seen a plateauing in the online, the computer-based banking for lack of better term, coming from bankofamerica.com, and that now is growing as fast nominally or faster mobile, which means people also using both sites, and so that's one thing. So the core activities growing. And if you look at this activity in the core customer base from card usage and both debit and credit card usage up 4% plus year-over-year, then that's good. The online mobile part of the spend is now up to 20% of the spend and is growing 15% per year versus the 4.5% growth on a total. So that's tremendous. Then you get into the wallet categories just to give you a sense, just in the last week, the growth rates in enrolled cards was 12% week-on-week growth in terms of volume enrolled, 100-odd thousand cards came on. The payment usage was up 3% week-over-week. So you see this just a phenomenal growth rate. If you annualize that out, that's the weekly growth rate and with holidays and everything else you think about that, and you see that usage going up, but the mobile wallet payments are still less than 0.2% of the total payments made with plastic at Bank of America. So you still have a lot of opportunity to convert activity to the platform, which is more convenient for the consumer. And then the other thing we've -- and then, a part of that you talk about is the new consortium to build a new P2P deployment for the banking system. We're up in operating that. We still have a few more months before the rest of their colleagues in the consortium get up, and that will start to push that out in the market heavily. I think it's a tremendous improvement over what we have today even though we have a fair amount volume on it today through clear exchange, and that was an effort to get us all together. So we could have a very interoperable payment network. We've got the Visa check out work that's going on. We're preloading customers' cards in their wallet. We're about as best we can tell 13%, 14% of all the spend Visa check out today. We've got 1 million-plus cards will drive that forward. We can put that all together you're seeing driven us volume of of all these mechanisms and then, month of March to give you example, we had almost $60 billion of payments off the computer based platform and about $20 billion off the mobile-based pilot form. So we think about the size of that now given all that we still sent out about $8 billion in cash out of our ATMs in the month of March. That's $0.25 billion a day or more. So it's still we had to have all the capabilities, and that's we're building towards and going back to I think Jim's question earlier, the cost structure keeps moving in our favor as we keep driving this activity through."

Then you go to the second quarter, we've obviously got a deal with lower long-term rates. Second quarter's always a little bit seasonally lower for us. So there's some progress there's going to be challenged, but I think as you head to this third quarter and fourth quarter, when you consider what we're, I think, we can do on deposit growth and loan growth and if rates follow the path along the forward curve, we would expect to make progress in the latter half of the year."

Just one more try at it, Paul, just what where these expense savings going if EPS is still the same range?"

So I think it is a good starting point. It will -- in some cases, you would hope it wouldn't go up a lot because that would mean asset management fees and other things are growing, which attach more compensation less marginal profit, which would be good news because the overall profit would grow better, but you should assume that that's a level we should hold onto in a relatively stable environment as we see this quarter starting out. When you go to the fiduciary, we've been working on that obviously just because it's the final rule and it came out recently out we have been working on it. So I don't think -- I think to the extent that there is cost embedded in that a lot of it's the run rate, it will be marginally in the run rate for the next few quarters.

If you look at the roughly $2 trillion of GWIM client assets we have outside of deposits and loans, we think the Department of Labor will probably impact less than 10% of that.

So a lot of quarters core activity was growing but you couldn't find it because you look at that Slide you could see sort of the All Other, which is the investment portfolio, really mortgages and then, the LAS assets are now small enough quarter-to-quarter runoff, but I think it's a solid across the board. I mean, I think in the segments we focus in on a consumer side, prime super prime, there is strong activity mortgages. You could see the origination volumes this quarter were solid. I think if you think of home equities kicked it back up a little bit again because people see home equity their house the auto business is strong with ebb and flow for how many units the only major business although we can gain share there because our share on our direct to consumer business was very low. We didn't even do it 2 years ago, and now we're up to, I don't know, $0.5 billion or more a quarter. So I think from a consumer side, the card business because we've now sold through all the portfolio we have to sell, I think you should see still stable and see better year-over-year comparables than we've had the last several years. Obviously, the last big portfolio went out in the fourth quarter. And so I think we feel that if you look at the online customers the creditworthy customers that we deal with are there to borrow, and we're lending to them. And they go to commercial side as Paul said earlier, I think you'd expect CRE we want to be careful in CRE. So we doing verified really structured loans but in C&I and nice business banking, not a huge business for us frankly, but they finally are making it through runoff, and that's good. And so I think across all those businesses, you should see it may not grow as fast as normally it has. 2 years ago, we had the international book grow in the corporate that we slowed that down based on our judgments about risk, and so I think it's a pretty balanced growth. And so the question always a do you have to compromise your credit standards to grow? No, we don't because you can see that. And secondly, is there opportunity to actually get growth? And the answer is yes, but -- and that's just good hard work."

One is we had a balance portfolios between commercial and consumer. Second, we had to get consumer to secure portfolios, dominating versus unsecured both credit card and other loans that would really put us behind in a tough situation last time. And then third, you got to maintain your individual quality of underwriting consumer it's more formulaic and commercial more deal selection and customer selection, but if you look at it I'll just give you the simplest way to think about this. We have moved probably from 8 out of 10 mortgage holders who are absolutely within our credit box that we do business is giving them mortgage somewhere else to maybe 7. So we still got 7 more to go without talking about expanding the credit parameters and our mortgage business one iota. So think of that as a demonstration point that you can go over and over again. So there's plenty of market share. Then one of the things can we're looking at is we look across our 90-odd markets United States. There are areas where we have tremendous opportunity to expand our market share, where the franchise just wasn't balanced. Some areas of the franchise the Wealth Management business was a high percentage, in some places low. The middle market businesses, very high market, very strong good market shares in certain markets, and 1/3 of that in other markets. And so where we're deploying these people is also based on our view of which markets. So it's going into that market, hiring talent, using this massive customer capability we have to go drive it, again target the exact consumers we want. So even on a geographic basis, whether it's the deposit business and expanding in some of those markets there's also commercial lending business and otherwise there's opportunities without compromising credit."

But leave that aside, the basic principles we continuously look at the franchise to see about optimization. So if -- generally when people asked that question, they are thinking about the couple of different areas. One is the markets area. We show you the markets profitability returns in this business. But if you get into supplement, you'll see you can ever call markets business an annuity business, but what drives our business is really the connection between the issuer clients, the commercial borrowers and commercial clients and the investor clients that we serve and to do that and in our Wealth Management business because that's a group of people that rely on the research platform. If you look at the interconnectedness that is massive and proprietary trading and poker and things like that the whole -- the real business is driven at that. And so if you -- we've taken the balance sheet from implied a time of Merrill probably nearly to $800 billion or more, maybe closer to $1 trillion down to $500 billion and the revenues have stabilized, and I think that's a good place for us to be. #1 research plant in the world, #1 in the U.S. this year, the ability to use it in Wealth Management, the ability to use it to inform our corporate customers. So we look at how we pare away things and look at it. So in international business, we pared back, there was 12 -- 800 to 1,200 people that were downsized in markets and banking in the first quarter. So we -- it's not in or out. It's more how do you keep parrying it back in. So if you look across there, we always look at that question. We continue to look at it. But right now, we realize the franchise and the connectivity between the franchise of all the different elements focused on markets, focused on Wealth Management, focused on the core business. And I think another question is with low rates, we just have to grind the cost down, and that's going to come out of really all the pieces in well, for a while, was kind of you could go at it at a fairly high level and drive it. Now it's really incrementally idea by idea and taking it out, and that's why you see that constant improvement of core cost of $2 billion run rate first quarter last year to first quarter this year is not is working at it.

So the sheer number. So we had 6,100. We're 4,600. Each year, we reposition 200 or 300 of them. I mean, it's what we're doing is getting out of smaller branches building into bigger branches. So we consolidated 3 into 1 and build that branch has its U.S. Trust people, management people, small business sales people. So what we're actually if you think about real estate question, the numbers now as important as their full and that they're marginally driving the profit, and you can get it a lot of sales people per square inch, a lot of customer activity per square inch. That's where we're growing, and so you're going to see some of the new prototypes that we've deployed. You can see them in places like Denver, where we now on our third branch. We'll continue to build out much more like a sales office than what people visions of a traditional branch. But going to the earlier question, Nancy, I don't know where it stops, and I'm not  that's not saying I'm trying to hide answer that I have. It's just that if you and I are here last year, and we were and you said 17 million mobile users, that's good penetration. It's 2 million more a year later. And as computer-based banking is up 1.5 million or something like that, which is kind of remarkable on top. So we don't know where this goes, but we're going to be pushing ahead following our clients and making sure we stay with them the same time, our customer satisfaction scores are now reaching all-time high, which means the way we're doing it works for them, and you've given me your feedback about our customer focus and capability over the years, but back to the highest they've ever been. That's importantly managing the transition carefully, and that's what we've got to keep doing."

Mortgage-backed securities in treasuries and that still has a yield to it not as dollar denominated as much as mortgages but has the yield to it. That has been driven more by the liquidity demands in LCR than it is by anything else, which is the centralized portfolio. We've gone from $100 billion liquidity 4 or 5 years ago to $500 billion.

I want to thank you for joining us to review our first quarter results. Today, we reported $2.7 billion in earnings this quarter or $0.21 per diluted share.

Today, we reported $2.7 billion in earnings this quarter or $0.21 per diluted share. As you can see in the results, 2 large items impacted this quarter's results. We recorded negative market-related NII adjustments for bond premium amortization. That adjustment alone cost us $0.07 per diluted share, and we also recorded a $0.05 per share diluted share cost to seasonal retirement-eligible incentives. 
When you think about revenue, net interest income, excluding that bond premium adjustment, was $10.6 billion this quarter. This is an improvement linked quarter and year-over-year. 
Our loans are growing across the franchise and compared to the prior year, are up a 11% in our business segments. 
In addition, deposit growth remains very strong. Our deposits were up $64 billion from last year or 6% to over $1.2 trillion. This growth reflects our progress to grow responsibly and deepen relationships with all of our core customers. 
Moving to noninterest income. It declined year-over-year. Of note, the downdraft, and that was driven by capital markets and related activities and, to a lesser degree, mortgage servicing and other fees as we continue to wind down our third-party servicing book. 
However, the other banking sources of noninterest income were relatively stable. 
Switching to costs. We continue to drive cost down in this company. Cost year-over-year in the first quarter were down 6%. FTE were down 3%. That is $1 billion per quarter, $4 billion on annualized basis. 
And if you focus just on the core cost, excluding our LAS and litigation, those were down $600 million quarter from first quarter of last year or $2.4 billion annualized. We're going to keep driving those costs down as we continue to move forward through 2016. 
Turning to Slide 3 and looking at the business segment earnings, you can see the good year-over-year results because of the operating leverage in those businesses. The only exception is the results in Global Banking, which were negatively impacted by the increase to energy-related reserves. 
The combination of business segments outside the All Other group earned $4.5 billion in quarter 1 this year compared to $3.9 billion in quarter 1 of 2015. Offsetting those earnings were the $1.9 billion loss in All Other. That loss primarily reflects the 2 large adjustments I mentioned earlier and some legacy litigation cost. You could also see the returns and efficiency ratios for each of our segments and note with the exception at LAS, which came close to breaking even this quarter, they earned above their cost of capital. 
Moving to Slide 4. During the period of -- during the first quarter, there's a lot of talk with the market volatility accompanied by and surrounding the question about global growth and the forward-looking economic picture. However, we don't see any evidence of our customer base changing. Spending by consumers remained strong and is up year-over-year over 4%. Loan demand remains solid throughout the franchise, and we continue to position our company to face any potential economic outcome. 
When you think about this, it's important to remember the work we've done over the past years to simplify and strengthen our foundation. We remain a different company today than that would have -- which have been at the last downturn. We start with a clear strategy to serve the core financial needs of the customers. We've gotten out of businesses, portfolios, products, and client relationships that don't meet those strategic goals. We simplified the company in every area. We cut the number of legal entities in half, and we also reduced cost through programs like New BAC that produced out loan more than $8 billion in savings, annual savings and our SIM program, which continues to operate today, but at the same time, we've continued to invest in the areas we can grow; $3 billion in technology-related growth initiatives especially in areas of digital practice, whether it's in Consumer Banking, Commercial Banking, where we lead the industry with mobile and online platforms. We've also invested more in client-facing teammates, funding that investment through elimination of bureaucracy and simplification and elimination of management jobs. 
We believe that we have to continue to drive our productivity, and we'll continue to do so in 2016. In the end, when you think about all this, it makes our company more resolvable. As you all know, we received the latest input from our regulators on our resolution plans yesterday. Those plans were filed 9 months ago, and we've been busy at work since the day they were filed to continue to remedy the deficiencies and shortcomings stated in those plans, and we'll do so by the October submission date. 
As we move to Slide 5, you can also see the financial foundation that we've built in this company, liquidity and capital at record levels. Tangible book value per share, the marker of what we as shareholders on our company, now stands at $16.17, and it has improved over $5 a share over the last few years even as we've taken the hits that are now largely behind us. 
Our funding structure continues to improve. Long-term debt has been cut dramatically. Deposits have increased over 20%, and all that -- most of that growth is coming through our Consumer Banking, Wealth Management segments. 
Our loan book is now well-balanced: half consumer, half commercial. And importantly, the consumer piece is much more secured lending than it was before the last crisis. 
As we look in global markets, whether it's on Level 3 assets, which are more risky, with a total trading assets or VaR, they're all down significantly over the last few years. So as you can see, we simplified our company and our operating structure. 
As we look ahead to 2016, we remain focused on what we can control. We intend to keep driving the core customer activity you see in the loan and deposit and customer flow growth in each and every business, focusing intently on the Wealth Management, Global Markets businesses to take advantage as markets are stabilized. We'll continue to drive on focusing on cost to drive those cost down, and we'll continue to drive to deliver more capital to you as we did in the first quarter as investors. 
With that, let me hand it over to Paul."

Good morning, everybody, and thanks for joining us. Starting on Slide 6, we present a summary of the income statement and returns for this quarter, highlighting comparisons to Q4 '15 as well as Q1 '15. Earnings this quarter were $2.7 bi",3713,"Thanks, Brian. Good morning, everybody, and thanks for joining us. 
Starting on Slide 6, we present a summary of the income statement and returns for this quarter, highlighting comparisons to Q4 '15 as well as Q1 '15. 
Earnings this quarter were $2.7 billion or $0.21 per share. These earnings include the negative impact of the FAS 91 market-related adjustment, which reduced EPS by $0.07. They also include $850 million of FAS 123 retirement-eligible incentive expense, which reduced EPS by $0.05. 
For comparative purposes, the aggregate impact of these 2 same items in Q1 '15 reduced EPS by $0.08. Revenue on an FTE basis was $19.7 billion this quarter. Adjusted for FAS 91, revenue was $20.9 billion, a decline of $700 million from Q1 '15 on a similarly adjusted basis. This decline was driven by the reduction in sales and trading revenue and IBCs as well as mortgage banking income, offset by improvement in adjusted NII. 
Expenses were $14.8 billion, approximately $1 billion or 6% lower than a year ago, driven by good discipline across the entire company. Before moving to the balance sheet, I want to note an adjustment to the financial statements this quarter, reclassifying some operating leases. We moved $6 billion of leases to other assets, and we made conforming reclassifications to prior periods to improve comparability. This reclassification had no effect on net income. 
However, as a result of this reclassification, quarterly NII is lower by approximately $50 million, other income is higher by approximately $180 million, and depreciation expense is higher by about $130 million. While these changes are small and don't affect profits, I wanted to note them, so that you can more easily adjust your models. 
Turning to Slide 7 and the balance sheet. Total assets increased $41 billion from Q4, driven by higher Global Markets [indiscernible] activity as well as increased cash. Deposits rose $20 billion from Q4 while loans increased $4 billion. Driven by deposit inflows, liquidity rose to $525 billion. Time to required funding while down remains strong at 3 years, and note that the first quarter included the $8.5 billion settlement payment to Bank of New York Mellon as trustee in the Article 77 suit, which was reserved for over 4 years ago. 
Tangible common equity of $167 billion improved $4.7 billion from Q4. On a per share basis, tangible book value increased to $16.17, up 9% from Q1 '15. 
Turning to regulatory metrics. As a reminder, we report regulatory capital under the advanced approaches. 
Our CET1 transition ratio under Basel III ended the quarter at 10.3% and really is only comparable to Q4 as prior periods were reported under the standardized approach prior to our exit from parallel run. On a fully phased-in basis, CET1 capital improved $3.4 billion to $158 billion as improvements from earnings and OCI were partially offset by dividends and repurchases. Under the advanced approaches, compared to Q4 '15, the CET1 ratio increased 30 basis points to 10.1% and is now above our fully phased-in 2019 requirement. 
RWA decreased roughly $18 billion, driven by reductions related to retail exposures as credit quality improved. We also provide our capital metrics under the standardized approach. Here, our CET1 ratio improved to 11% with the same capital improvement as advanced but less of an RWA improvement given standardized is less risk sensitive. 
Supplemented leverage ratios for both the parent and the bank continue to exceed U.S. regulatory amendments that take effect in 2018. 
Turning to Slide 8. We had solid loan and deposit growth in the quarter. Reported loans of 800 -- excuse me, reported loans of $901 billion on an end-of-period basis increased $4 billion from Q4 and are up $28 billion or 3% from Q1 '15. Loans in our primary lending segments were up $14 billion or 2% from Q4, which is 8% on an annualized basis. 
We continue to see solid commercial loan growth in Global Banking. In Consumer Banking, we continue to see strong growth in consumer real estate and vehicle lending. Lastly, in Wealth Management, we also saw continued growth in consumer real estate. 
Loans outside the primary lending segments and LAS and All Other were down $10 billion from Q4, driven by continued paydowns of first- and second-lien mortgages as well as loan sales. During the quarter, we sold FHA loans totaling $2.7 billion and NPLs and other delinquent loans of roughly $1 billion, recording a small gain on sales and other income. 
Turning to deposits. On an ending basis, they reached $1.2 trillion this quarter, growing $64 billion or 6% from Q1 '15. Growth was led by our consumer businesses. Consumer Banking grew $43 billion or 8% year-over-year. GWIM grew nearly $17 billion, a 7% pace, and Global Banking grew at a 3% pace. 
Turning to asset quality on Slide 9. Outside the energy sector, credit quality is strong. Total net charge-offs were $1.1 billion in Q1 and Q4. We had some immaterial movements this quarter from minor adjustments.But overall, very little change in consumer losses. 
Commercial losses declined slightly from Q4 despite a slight increase in energy charge-offs. The provision of $1 billion in Q1 was up $187 million from Q4. While net charge-offs were flat, total reserve release declined as reserve releases in consumer were mostly offset by reserve increases in commercial, driven by energy exposures. 
On Slide 10, we provide credit quality data on our consumer portfolio. Net charge-offs declined $41 million from Q4. Consumer real estate charge-offs benefited from continued portfolio improvement and fewer onetime items, primarily collateral valuation adjustments on the consumer -- on consumer real estate. Adjusting for those items, consumer net charge-offs were relatively flat versus Q4. Delinquency levels and NPLs improved, and reserve coverage remains strong. 
Moving to commercial credit on Slide 11. Net charge-offs improved $35 million. A decline in nonenergy net charge-offs from Q4 more than offset a modest increase in energy losses. Energy charge-offs increased $17 million from Q4 to roughly $100 million in the quarter. 
Given that asset quality outside energy remains relatively stable, let's focus on energy. We continue to support our energy clients while managing lending limits and actively engaging with stress borrowers. Our overall committed energy exposures declined slightly from Q4 while utilized exposures were up by 100 -- by, excuse me, $500 million. 
As discussed last quarter, within energy, we believe 2 subsectors, refining and marketing as well as vertically integrated, which, by the way, tend to be large market cap and/or sovereign supported, these 2 subsectors are less dependent on oil prices and therefore, carry less risk than our exposures in E&P and oilfield services. 
Looking at our $7.7 billion utilized exposure to the higher risk E&P and oilfield services clients, we saw a decline of $600 million from Q4 as payoffs and charge-offs more than offset drawdowns. In addition, this quarter, we moved $1.6 billion of our energy exposure to reservable criticized, and we added $525 million to our energy reserves. We made these adjustments based upon another quarter of not only low oil prices but also volatile oil prices. This moves our energy reserve to just over $1 billion. And while these reserves cover our full energy portfolio, they would represent 13% of our $7.7 billion E&P and oilfield services exposures. We believe that percentage is probably more relevant as you compare exposures across the industry. 
Turning to Slide 12. Net interest income on an FTE basis was $9.4 billion. Included in NII this quarter was a FAS 91 negative $1.2 billion market-related adjustment for bond premium amortization. This adjustment in Q1 '15 was a negative $500 million. And including TRUPS-related charges, Q4 was also negative $500 million. 
Adjusted NII of $10.6 billion improved approximately $500 million compared to Q1 '15, excluding FAS 91 and improved $100 million from Q4 after also excluding the TRUPS charge. 
Several factors contributed to the improvement from Q4. We had good commercial loan growth funded by deposits. We also had about $100 million in seasonal benefits in Q1. Offsetting these factors, we had 1 less day of interest and lower dividends on our Federal Reserve stock as required to contribute to the Highway Trust Fund. Lower long-term rates also offset some of the benefit of the Fed rate hike in December, pressuring NII. 
Lower long-term rates was also the driver of increased asset sensitivity in the quarter. As of 3/31, an instantaneous 100 basis point parallel increase in rates is estimated to increase NII by approximately $6 billion over the subsequent year. About 40% of this estimated $6 billion increase comes from short-end rate improvement, and the rest is from long-end rate improvement, split equally between FAS 91 and reinvestment at higher rates. 
Turning to Slide 13. Noninterest expense was $14.8 billion in the quarter. That is $1 billion or 6% lower than Q1 '15, driven by good expense discipline across the company. Legacy asset cost, excluding litigation -- excuse me, legacy asset servicing costs, excluding litigation, were $729 million this quarter, declining $292 million from Q1 '15 and $64 million from Q4. 
Litigation expense of $388 million was in line with Q1 '15 as we work to resolve remaining legacy issues. First quarter expense also included FAS 123 annual retirement cost of $850 million, slightly below Q1 '15. First quarter of both years also included about $300 million of seasonally elevated payroll tax expense. Adjusting for all these items, i.e., litigation, LAS, FAS 123 and the elevated payroll tax, expenses were $12.5 billion. This decline of $600 million from Q1 '15 was driven by lower revenue-related costs associated with sales and trading in Investment Banking as well as revenue in our Wealth Management business, the rolloff of advisory retention awards put in place after the combination with Merrill Lynch and lastly, SIM initiatives that are improving productivity and helping us lower cost so that we can continue to invest in growth. 
Our employee base is down 3% from Q1 '15, and increases in client-facing professionals were more than offset by reductions in LAS and other operations staff. 
Lastly, before leaving expense highlights, I want to remind you that quarterly FDIC insurance expense is set to increase at the large banks until the deposit insurance fund reaches 1.35%. For us, this will increase expense by approximately $100 million pretax starting in Q3 '16. 
Okay. Turning to the business segments and starting with Consumer Banking on Slide 14. Consumer earned $1.8 billion, 22% better than Q1 last year. These earnings reflect continued core customer growth coupled with strong expense management. Lower provision expense from continued improvement in asset quality also benefited the bottom line. This work generated a strong 24% return on allocated capital. Note that allocated capital increased slightly for 2016 pursuant to our normal capital allocation reviews completed in Q1. 
On Slide 15, we focus on some important trends. First, in the upper left, we continue to lead the industry in a number of ways as you can see from the stats. 
Revenue increased $242 million or 3% from Q1 '15 as NII growth more than offset lower noninterest income. Net interest income benefited from higher client balances. Noninterest income was down due to lower mortgage banking income, offset by increases in card income and service charges. We continue to see mortgage banking income come down, given our strategy to book more of our originations on the balance sheet. 
Expenses declined 2% from Q1 '15. On the bottom left, you can see the year-over-year decline in FTEs as Mobile Banking growth continues to help us optimize our delivery network. Note, while overall FTEs are down year-over-year, sales specialists are up almost 900 from Q1 '15. 
Lastly, our deposit franchise continues to drive operating leverage. Our cost of deposits as a percent of average deposits continues to improve and now stands at 171 basis points, which, we believe, is best in class in the industry. 
Focusing on mobile banking users in the upper right for a minute, we added 910,000 net new mobile users this quarter. We now have nearly 20 million active users, and deposit transactions from mobile devices now represents 16% of deposit transactions. 
Interestingly, this quarter, we added more net new users than any quarter in the last 3 years, and we continue to add new features and capabilities, improving convenience and satisfaction. One way we are promoting adoption is by deploying digital ambassadors in our financial centers. Digital ambassadors engage with customers who come to our branches to transact. They educate these customers on alternatives to branch banking, which are not only more convenient for them but also less expensive for us. Digital sales, digital appointments, digital satisfaction all continue to achieve new highs. Focusing on client balances you can see Merrill Edge brokerage assets are up 7% from Q1 '15 on strong flows, offset by lower valuations. 
Moving to the bottom right of the page, note that loans were up 8% from Q1 '15 on strong mortgage and auto growth. 
Okay. Moving to Slide 16. This is a new page that presents some statistics around loan growth and the quality of originations in our Consumer segment. 
Starting with card, we issued 1.2 million cards in the quarter, which is a bit lower than the past few quarters. Average balances were impacted by the sale of a $1.7 billion nonstrategic card portfolio late in Q4. Adjusting for that divestiture, loans were up from Q4. 
Spending on credit card, adjusted for divestitures, was up 8% compared to Q1 '15. As we have discussed many times and shown here, we are originating high-cycle loans that have produced very low loss rates and strong risk-adjusted margins currently exceeding 9%. 
Moving to vehicle lending, one thing similar high-quality, low-risk lending stats. Average booked FICOs are around 780, and loss rates are low. Also, the tenor of these loans is relatively conservative compared to the industry as nearly 90% of our loans are less than 73 months. 
Margins, obviously, aren't as high as credit card, but average balances are growing well across multiple channels within the business. Our underwriting standards are producing similar results in consumer real estate lending, which is presented on the bottom of the page. 
Net loss rates on first-lien mortgages have been negligible. Remember, we began booking these loans in the Consumer segment in the first quarter of 2014, and the macro consumer environment has been healthy, particularly for high FICO borrowers. 
Turning to Slide 17. Global Wealth and Investment Management produced earnings of $740 million, up 13% from Q1 '15. Year-over-year, revenue was down, but expenses declined more, improving pretax margin to 26%. Overall, revenue declined 2% in Q1 '15 as strong NII growth was more than offset by lower market sensitive revenue. 
Asset management revenue declined on lower market values. Transactional revenue was also down and continues to be impacted by the shifting of activity from brokerage to manage relationships as well as market uncertainty. 
NII benefited from solid deposit and loan growth. Noninterest expense in the first quarter of 2016 benefited from the fully amortized advisory retention awards given at the time of the Merrill Lynch merger. We have not seen a noticeable attrition as a result of this. Lower revenue-related incentives also contributed to lower expense versus Q1 '15.
Moving to Slide 18. Despite lower market levels, we continued to see overall solid client engagement, and we continue to invest in the business, growing client-facing professionals year-over-year. 
Client balances are $2.5 trillion. Long-term AUM flows were down this quarter as a result of market volatility, which impacted client behavior. Average deposits grew $9 billion from Q4, and average loans also grew this quarter, concentrated in consumer real estate lending. 
Turning to Slide 19. Global Banking earned $1.1 billion, down from both comparative periods as energy reserves weighed on results. Despite this increased provision expense, Global Banking was able to deliver a 12% return on allocated capital, and note that we allocated $2 billion more in capital to Global Banking for 2016 pursuant to our annual evaluation of allocated capital. 
Global Banking continues to drive solid loan growth within its risk and client frameworks, and this drove a nice increase year-over-year in NII, mitigated, to some degree, by spread compression. That NII improvement, combined with revenue growth from credit cards and treasury fees, partially offset a decline in Investment Banking and other marks on loans and hedges. Noninterest expense compared to Q1 '15 reflects a decline in revenue-related expense, offset by the cost of adding sales professionals over the past 12 months. 
Looking at trends on Slide 20 and comparing to Q1 last year, it was obviously a tough quarter for the capital markets with spikes in volatility causing declines in client activity. However, clients still have financing needs. And here is where the diversity and strength of our franchise allows us to continue to deliver for them even when capital markets are less attractive. 
You can see that trend in our average loans and lease balances, which increased again this quarter and are up 14% year-over-year. Growth in loans was broad based across C&I, CRE and leasing although recently, we have slow growth in CRE. Spread compression on average across all our consumer sizes has moderated relative to a year ago. Average deposits also increased from Q1 '15, up $11 billion or 4%. 
We remain focused on our deposit mix, which is strong with only 3% classified as 100% runoff balances. On the other hand, total firm-wide IB fees of $1.2 billion were down 22% from Q1 '15, with the clients broad based across M&A, DCM and ECM. 
Switching to Global Markets on Slide 21 and comparing Q1 last year, again the challenging market condition caused revenue compared to Q1 '15 to be down. The quarter included the benefit from the resolution of a litigation matter, and we also had lower revenue-related cost compared to Q1 '15. All of this resulted in Global Markets reporting earnings just under $1 billion. Reported revenue is down year-over-year, but note that last year, DVA negatively impacted revenue versus added to revenue this quarter. 
Total revenue, excluding DVA, while up from Q4 was down 17% from Q1 last year on lower sales and trading revenue as well as Global Markets' share of lower IB fees. Noninterest expense declined 23% from Q1 '15, driven by lower litigation. Adjusting for litigation, expenses were down 9% as a result of lower revenue-related expenses, demonstrating a disciplined approach to compensation. 
Moving to trends on the next slide and focusing on the components of our sales and trading performance. Sales and trading revenue of $13.3 billion, excluding net DVA, is up 25% from Q4 with improvement in both fixed and equity but down 16% from Q1 last year. Versus Q1 '15, fixed sales and trading of $2.3 billion fell 17%, reflecting a tough environment for credit-related products as well as a tough comparison to a strong Q1 '15 in currencies. 
Equity trading was $1 billion, declining 11%, reflecting weaker trading performance in a challenging market environment. Average trading assets continued to trend down as did VaR, which remains at historically low levels. 
Turning to Legacy Assets and Servicing on Slide 23. This segment lost $40 million this quarter. I'm not going to spend a lot of time here as trends are consistent with past quarters. Revenue is down a bit from lower servicing fees as the portfolio of serviced loans declines. Revenue was also impacted by lower net hedge withdrawal. As the portfolio shrinks, we continue to lower servicing costs, particularly with respect to delinquent loans. The number of 60-plus day delinquent first mortgage loans serviced continue to decline and is now only 88,000 units. Excluding litigation, expense this quarter was $729 million, dropping nearly $300 million from Q1 '15 and down $64 million from Q4. 
On Slide 24, we show All Other, which reported a loss of $1.9 billion. Results were impacted by the $1.2 billion FAS 91 market-related adjustment, the FAS 123 seasonal retirement-eligible incentive costs and litigation costs. 
The loss here is higher than Q1 '15 for a number of reasons. First, the market-related adjustment is more negative this year than last. Second, we had higher gains on sale of loans in Q1 '15 than this period. Third, provision expense is higher as both periods had a benefit from provision but this quarter, that benefit was smaller than Q1 '15. Lastly, litigation costs were higher this quarter versus Q1 '15 as we work down legacy issues. 
The effective tax rate for the quarter was about 28%, which is better than we expect for the full year absent any unusual items. One expected item that we want to bring to your attention is another U.K. tax rate reduction recently proposed in the Chancellor's budget. We expect this to be signed into law in Q3 and will result in a tax charge of about $350 million to reduce the carrying value of our U.K. DTA. The vast majority of this charge will not impact regulatory capital. 
Okay. So let me offer a few takeaways as I finish. Given the market volatility, revenue growth was challenging this quarter. However, we compensated for this by managing expenses well. If one adjusts this period's reported results for the noncash FAS 91 market-related NII amount and the FAS 123 costs, earnings are largely in line with recent quarters. You can see progress most clearly in our business segments, which don't include these adjustments. 
Taken as a whole, the segments, not including All Other, improved earnings by 16% versus Q1 '15. The drivers of this improvement were solid loan and deposit growth across our customer groups. Net charge-offs were largely unchanged as modest increases in energy were mitigated by other improvements. 
We strengthened our capital and liquidity, and we returned $1.5 billion in common dividends and repurchase to shareholders. To Brian's earlier point, we have done years of work to simplify the company and reduce risk. 
With $167 billion in tangible common equity, $12 billion in credit reserves and twice the amount of liquidity of a few years ago, we believe we are well prepared to help customers and clients in good and bad times, and we are focused on growing earnings in many different economic scenarios. 
With that, let's open it up to Q&A."

So then if you flip and say, ""How do we gonna get down there?"" You're exactly right. If you look, we drifted down even further this quarter in numbers of branches, numbers of customers, but deposits were up. If you look at headcount in consumer, we continue to reposition it towards sales and relationship management side and away from the transactional side, and so that digitalization, which is, we're at 19.6 million mobile banking consumer customers, and interesting enough, we're growing on the online customer base, meaning computer-based customers grew over 1 million customers from last year's first quarter. So all that describes more and more transactions and more and more cost structure of the day-to-day transactional stuff into those environments and saves us money overall.

And if you see the CCAR analysis over time, you see our loss content continue to come down, and that should serve us in good stead to be able to take out capital over time, as you said. And if you think about the commercial book, it's -- you have things like commercial real estate, we have been very disciplined and what we inherited through all the deals and development loans, all that stuff is really nonexistent at any consequence. So we feel very good about the commercial book."

Last year this quarter, we had 17 million mobile users. This year, we have 19.5 million. And as Paul said, there's an interesting point that the nominal rate of growth this quarter was one of the highest we ever had. So even though smartphones are penetrated, you think you've kind of penetrated the customer base, it's still growing fast. So that's number one. And then, as I said earlier, Betsy, you followed our company for a long time, you might -- you'd have seen a plateauing in the online, the computer-based banking for lack of better term, people coming through bankofamerica.com, and that now is growing as fast nominally or faster mobile, which means people also using both sides, and so that's one thing. So the core activity is growing. And if you look at the activity in the core customer base from card usage and both debit and credit card usage, up 4% plus year-over-year, and that's good. The online mobile part of the spend is now up to 20% of the spend and is growing 15% per year versus the 4.5% growth on the total. So that's tremendous. Then we'll get into the wallet categories just to give you a sense. Just in the last week, the growth rates in enrolled cards was 12% week-on-week growth in terms of volume enrolled, 100-odd thousand cards came on. The payment usage was up 3% week-over-week. So you see this just phenomenal growth rate. If you annualize that out, that's a weekly growth rate and absent flows with holidays and everything else but think about that. And you see that usage going up, but the mobile wallet payments are still less than 0.2% of the total payments made with plastic at Bank of America. So you still have a lots of opportunity to convert activity to a platform, which is more convenient for the consumer. And then the other thing we've -- and then, a part of that you talk about is the new consortium to build a new P2P deployment for the banking system. We're up and operating that. We still have a few more months before the rest of their colleagues in the consortium get up, and then we'll start to push that out in the market heavily. I think it's a tremendous improvement over what we have today, even though we have a fair amount volume on it today through clear exchange, and that was an effort to get us all together, so we could have a very interoperable payment network. We've got the Visa check out work that's going on. We're preloading customers' cards in their wallet. We're about as best we can tell 13%, 14% of all the spend in Visa check out today. We've got 1 million-plus cards will drive that forward. And if you put that all together you're seeing tremendous volume off of all these mechanisms and then, month of March to give you example, we had almost $60 billion of payments off the computer-based platform and about $20 billion off the mobile-based platform. So think about the size of that. Now, given all that we still sent out about $8 billion in cash out of our ATMs in the month of March. That's $0.25 billion a day or more. So it's still, we had to have all the capabilities, and that's we're building towards and going back to. I think Jim's question earlier, if the cost structure keeps moving in our favor as you keep driving this activity through."

So I think year-over-year, checking deposits were up 8% or 10% I think, clearly something like that.

If you look just year-over-year, expenses are down $1 billion or 6%. If you back to Q1, Q1 '11, we've taken quarterly expenses down, core quarterly expenses down $3.5 billion.

So I think it is a good starting point. It will -- in some case, you would hope it wouldn't go up a lot because that would mean asset management fees and other things are growing, which attach more compensation less marginal profit, which would be good news because the overall profit would grow better, but you should assume that that's a level we should hold onto in a relatively stable environment as we see this quarter starting out. When you go to the fiduciary, we've been working on that obviously just because it's the final rule and it came out recently, we have been working on it. So I don't think -- I think to the extent that there is cost embedded in that. A lot of it's the run rate, and it will be marginally fixed in the run rate for the next few quarters.

So they're a lot of quarters where the core activity was growing, but you couldn't find it because -- and if you look at the slide you can see sort of the All Other, which is the investment portfolio, really mortgages and then, the LAS assets are now small enough sort of quarter-to-quarter runoff, but I think it's solid across the board. I mean, I think in the segments we focus in on the consumer side, prime, super prime, there is strong activity mortgages. You could see the origination volumes this quarter were solid. I think if you think the home equity has kicked back up a little bit again, because people see home equity in their house. The auto business is strong, but it will ebb and flow for how many units could sold ultimately because that's the nature of the business, although I think we can gain share there because our share on our direct-to-consumer business was very low. We didn't even do it 2 years ago, and now we're up to, I don't know, $0.5 billion or more a quarter. So I think from a consumer side, the card business because we've now sold through all the portfolios we have to sell, I think you should see stable and start to see better year-over-year comparables than we've had the last several years. Obviously, the last big portfolio went out in the fourth quarter. And so I think we feel good and if you look at the online customers, the creditworthy customers that we deal with are there to borrow, and we're lending to them. And if you go on the commercial side, as Paul said earlier, I think you'd expect the CRE we slow -- we want to be careful on CRE. So we're doing very fundamentally-structured loans but in C&I and a nice -- business banking, not a huge business for us frankly, but they finally are making it through their runoff, and that's good. And so I think across all those businesses, you should see it may not grow as fast as normally it has. Two years ago, we had the international book grown, the corporate that we slowed that down based on our judgments about risk, and so I think it's a pretty balanced yield growth. And so the question always is do you have to compromise your credit standards to grow? No, we don't because you can see that. And then secondly, is there opportunity to actually get growth? And the answer is yes, but -- and that's just good hard work."

One is we had to balance the portfolios between commercial and consumer. Second, we had to get consumer to secure portfolios, dominating versus unsecured, both credit card and other loans that would really put us behind in a tough situation last time. And then third, you got to maintain your individual quality of underwriting consumer. It's more formulaic and commercial, more deal selection and customer selection, but if you look at it let me -- I'll just give you the simplest way to think about this. We have moved probably from 8 out of 10 mortgage holders who are absolutely within our credit box absolutely we do business with, getting their mortgage somewhere else to maybe 7. So we still got 7 more to go without talking about expanding the credit parameters and our mortgage business one iota. So think of that as a demonstration point that you can go over and over again. So there's plenty of market share out there. And then one of the things Ken, we're looking at is we look across our 90-odd markets in the United States. There are areas where we have tremendous opportunity to expand our market share, where the franchise just wasn't balanced. Some areas of the franchise the wealth management business is a high percentage, in some places low. The middle market businesses, very high market, very strong good market shares in certain markets, and 1/3 of that in other markets. And so where we're deploying these people is also based on our view of which markets. So it's going into that market, hiring talent, using this massive customer capability we have to go drive it, again target the exact consumers we want. So even on a geographic basis, whether it's the deposit business and expanding in some of those markets but also in commercial lending business and otherwise there's opportunities without compromising credit."

Litigation was elevated in the quarter from more-than-normalized level that we feel we can achieve and things like that. But leave that aside, the basic principles, we continuously look at the franchise to see about optimization. So if -- generally, when people ask that question, they're thinking about a couple of different areas. One is the markets area. We show you the markets profitability returns in this business. But if you get into the supplement, you'll see, you can never call markets business an annuity business, but what drives our business is really the connection between the issuer clients, the commercial borrowers and commercial clients and the investor clients that we serve and to do that and then our wealth management business because that's a group of people rely on the research platform. And if you look at the interconnectedness, that is massive and -- whether it's by us getting out proprietary trading and Volcker and things like that. The whole -- the real business is driven at that. And so if you -- we've taken the balance sheet from implying at the time of Merrill probably nearly to $800 billion or more, maybe closer to $1 trillion down to $500 billion and the revenues have stabilized, and I think that's a good place for us to be. #1 research plant in the world, #1 in the U.S. this year, the ability to use it in wealth management, the ability to use it to inform our corporate customers. So we look at how we pare away things and look at it. So in international business, we pared back, there was 12 -- 800 to 1,200 people that were downsized in markets, in banking in the first quarter. So we -- it's not in or out. It's more how do you keep parrying it back. And so if you look across there, we always look at that question. We continue to look at it. But right now, we really like the franchise and the connectivity between the franchise of all the different elements focused on markets, focused on wealth management, focused on the core business. And I think, now the question is with low rates, we just have to grind the cost down, and that's going to come out of really all the pieces in -- well, for a while, it was kind of you could go at it at a fairly high level and drive it. Now it's really incrementally idea by idea and taking it out, and that's why you see that constant improvement of core cost of $2 billion run rate, first quarter last year to first quarter this year is not -- is working at it. It just takes more time because 130 million square feet of real estate down to 80 million going to 70 million there's a lot of work to get out of that real estate."

So the sheer number. So we had 6,100. We're 4,600. Each year, we reposition 200 or 300 of them. I mean, it's -- what we're doing is getting out of smaller branches and building into bigger branches. So we consolidated 3 into 1 and build that branch has in it U.S. Trust people, wealth management people, small business sales people. So what we're actually, if you think about as a real estate question, the numbers now as important as their full and that they're marginally driving the profit, and you can get it -- a lot of sales people per square inch, a lot of customer activity per square inch. That's where we're growing, and so you're going to see some of the new prototypes that we've deployed. You can see in place like Denver, where we now are on our third branch, and we'll continue to build out that are much -- look much more like a sales office than what people's visions of a traditional branch. But going to the earlier question, Nancy, I don't know where this stops, and I'm not. That's -- not saying I'm trying to hide an answer that I have. It's just that if you and I are here last year, and we were and you said 17 million mobile users, that's good penetration. It's 2 million more a year later. And as computer-based banking is up 1.5 million or something like that, which is kind of remarkable on top of that. So we don't know where this goes, but we're going to be pushing ahead, following our clients and making sure we stay with them the same time, our customer satisfaction scores are now reaching all-time high, which means the way we're doing it works for them, and you've given me your feedback about our customer focus and capabilities over the years, but they're back to the highest they've ever been, and that's importantly managing that transition carefully, and that's what we got to keep doing."

Mortgage-backed securities in treasuries and that still has a yield to it not as dollar denominated as much as mortgages but has the yield to it. That has been driven more by the liquidity demands in LCR than it is by anything else, which is the centralized portfolio. We've gone from $100 billion liquidity 4 or 5 years ago to $500 billion.

I want to thank you for joining us to review our first quarter results. Today, we reported $2.7 billion in earnings this quarter or $0.21 per diluted share. As you can see in the results, 2 large items impac",1063,"Thank you, Lee, and good morning to everyone. I want to thank you for joining us to review our first quarter results. 
Today, we reported $2.7 billion in earnings this quarter or $0.21 per diluted share. As you can see in the results, 2 large items impacted this quarter's results. We recorded negative market-related NII adjustments for bond premium amortization. That adjustment alone cost us $0.07 per diluted share, and we also recorded a $0.05 per share diluted share cost to seasonal retirement-eligible incentives. 
When you think about revenue, net interest income, excluding that bond premium adjustment, was $10.6 billion this quarter. This is an improvement linked quarter and year-over-year. 
Our loans are growing across the franchise and compared to the prior year, are up 11% in our business segments. 
In addition, deposit growth remains very strong. Our deposits were up $64 billion from last year or 6% to over $1.2 trillion. This growth reflects our progress to grow responsibly and deepen relationships with all of our core customers. 
Moving to noninterest income. It declined year-over-year. Of note, the downdraft, and that was driven by capital markets and related activities and, to a lesser degree, mortgage servicing and other fees as we continue to wind down our third-party servicing book. 
However, the other banking sources of noninterest income were relatively stable. 
Switching to costs. We continue to drive cost down in this company. Cost year-over-year in the first quarter were down 6%. FTE were down 3%. That is $1 billion per quarter, $4 billion on annualized basis. 
And if you focus just on the core cost, excluding our LAS and litigation, those were down $600 million quarter from first quarter of last year or $2.4 billion annualized. We're going to keep driving those costs down as we continue to move forward through 2016. 
Turning to Slide 3 and looking at the business segment earnings, you can see the good year-over-year results because of the operating leverage in those businesses. The only exception is the results in Global Banking, which were negatively impacted by the increase to energy-related reserves. 
The combination of business segments outside the All Other group earned $4.5 billion in quarter 1 this year compared to $3.9 billion in quarter 1 of 2015. Offsetting those earnings were the $1.9 billion loss in All Other. That loss primarily reflects the 2 large adjustments I mentioned earlier and some legacy litigation cost. You could also see the returns and efficiency ratios for each of our segments and note with the exception at LAS, which came close to breaking even this quarter, they earned above their cost of capital. 
Moving to Slide 4. During the period of -- during the first quarter, there's a lot of talk with the market volatility accompanied by and surrounding the question about global growth and the forward-looking economic picture. However, we don't see any evidence of our customer base changing. Spending by consumers remains strong and is up year-over-year over 4%. Loan demand remains solid throughout the franchise, and we continue to position our company to face any potential economic outcome. 
When you think about this, it's important to remember the work we've done over the past years to simplify and strengthen our foundation. We remain a different company today than that would have -- which have ended the last downturn. We start with a clear strategy to serve the core financial needs of the customers. We've gotten out of businesses, portfolios, products, and client relationships that don't meet those strategic goals. We simplified the company in every area. We cut the number of legal entities in half, and we also reduced cost through programs like New BAC that produced -- loaned more than $8 billion in savings, annual savings and our SIM program, which continues to operate today, but at the same time, we've continued to invest in the areas we can grow; $3 billion in technology-related growth initiatives especially in areas of digital practice, whether it's in Consumer Banking, Commercial Banking, where we lead the industry with mobile and online platforms. We've also invested more in client-facing teammates, funding that investment through elimination of bureaucracy and simplification and elimination of management jobs. 
We believe that we have to continue to drive our productivity, and we'll continue to do so in 2016. In the end, when you think about all this, it makes our company more resolvable. As you all know, we received the latest input from our regulators on our resolution plans yesterday. Those plans were filed 9 months ago, and we've been busy at work since the day they were filed to continue to remedy the deficiencies and shortcomings stated in those plans, and we'll do so by the October submission date. 
As we move to Slide 5, you can also see the financial foundation that we've built in this company, liquidity and capital at record levels. Tangible book value per share, the marker of what we as shareholders own in our company, now stands at $16.17, and it has improved over $5 a share over the last few years even as we've taken the hits that are now largely behind us. 
Our funding structure continues to improve. Long-term debt has been cut dramatically. Deposits have increased over 20%, and all that -- most of that growth is coming through our Consumer Banking, Wealth Management segments. 
Our loan book is now well-balanced: half consumer, half commercial. And importantly, the consumer piece is much more secured lending than it was before the last crisis. 
As we look in global markets, whether it's on Level 3 assets, which are more risky, with the total trading assets or VaR, they're all down significantly over the last few years. So as you can see, we simplified our company and our operating structure. 
As we look ahead to 2016, we remain focused on what we can control. We intend to keep driving the core customer activity you see in the loan and deposit and customer flow growth in each and every business, focusing intently on the Wealth Management, Global Markets businesses to take advantage as markets are stabilized. We'll continue to drive on focusing on cost and drive those costs down, and we'll continue to drive to deliver more capital to you as we did in the first quarter as investors. 
With that, let me hand it over to Paul."

Good morning, everybody, and thanks for joining us. Starting on Slide 6, we present a summary of the income statement and returns for this quarter, highlighting comparisons to Q4 '15 as well as Q1 '15. Earnings this quarter were $2.7 bi",3716,"Thanks, Brian. Good morning, everybody, and thanks for joining us. 
Starting on Slide 6, we present a summary of the income statement and returns for this quarter, highlighting comparisons to Q4 '15 as well as Q1 '15. 
Earnings this quarter were $2.7 billion or $0.21 per share. These earnings include the negative impact of the FAS 91 market-related adjustment, which reduced EPS by $0.07. They also include $850 million of FAS 123 retirement-eligible incentive expense, which reduced EPS by $0.05. 
For comparative purposes, the aggregate impact of these 2 same items in Q1 '15 reduced EPS by $0.08. Revenue on an FTE basis was $19.7 billion this quarter. Adjusted for FAS 91, revenue was $20.9 billion, a decline of $700 million from Q1 '15 on a similarly adjusted basis. This decline was driven by the reduction in sales and trading revenue and IBCs as well as mortgage banking income, offset by improvement in adjusted NII. 
Expenses were $14.8 billion, approximately $1 billion or 6% lower than a year ago, driven by good discipline across the entire company. Before moving to the balance sheet, I want to note an adjustment to the financial statements this quarter, reclassifying some operating leases. We moved $6 billion of leases to other assets, and we made conforming reclassifications to prior periods to improve comparability. This reclassification had no effect on net income. 
However, as a result of this reclassification, quarterly NII is lower by approximately $50 million, other income is higher by approximately $180 million, and depreciation expense is higher by about $130 million. While these changes are small and don't affect profits, I wanted to note them, so that you can more easily adjust your models. 
Turning to Slide 7 and the balance sheet. Total assets increased $41 billion from Q4, driven by higher Global Markets repo [ph] activity as well as increased cash. Deposits rose $20 billion from Q4 while loans increased $4 billion. Driven by deposit inflows, liquidity rose to $525 billion. Time to required funding while down remains strong at 3 years, and note that the first quarter included the $8.5 billion settlement payment to Bank of New York Mellon as trustee in the Article 77 suit, which was reserved for over 4 years ago. 
Tangible common equity of $167 billion improved $4.7 billion from Q4. On a per share basis, tangible book value increased to $16.17, up 9% from Q1 '15. 
Turning to regulatory metrics. As a reminder, we report regulatory capital under the advanced approaches. 
Our CET1 transition ratio under Basel III ended the quarter at 10.3% and really is only comparable to Q4 as prior periods were reported under the standardized approach prior to our exit from parallel run. On a fully phased-in basis, CET1 capital improved $3.4 billion to $158 billion as improvements from earnings and OCI were partially offset by dividends and repurchases. Under the advanced approaches, compared to Q4 '15, the CET1 ratio increased 30 basis points to 10.1% and is now above our fully phased-in 2019 requirement. 
RWA decreased roughly $18 billion, driven by reductions related to retail exposures as credit quality improved. We also provide our capital metrics under the standardized approach. Here, our CET1 ratio improved to 11% with the same capital improvement as advanced but less of an RWA improvement given standardized is less risk sensitive. 
Supplemented leverage ratios for both the parent and the bank continue to exceed U.S. regulatory minimums that take effect in 2018. 
Turning to Slide 8. We had solid loan and deposit growth in the quarter. Reported loans of 800 -- excuse me, reported loans of $901 billion on an end-of-period basis increased $4 billion from Q4 and are up $28 billion or 3% from Q1 '15. Loans in our primary lending segments were up $14 billion or 2% from Q4, which is 8% on an annualized basis. 
We continue to see solid commercial loan growth in Global Banking. In Consumer Banking, we continue to see strong growth in consumer real estate and vehicle lending. Lastly, in Wealth Management, we also saw continued growth in consumer real estate. 
Loans outside the primary lending segments and LAS and All Other were down $10 billion from Q4, driven by continued paydowns of first- and second-lien mortgages as well as loan sales. During the quarter, we sold FHA loans totaling $2.7 billion and NPLs and other delinquent loans of roughly $1 billion, recording a small gain on sales and other income. 
Turning to deposits. On an ending basis, they reached $1.2 trillion this quarter, growing $64 billion or 6% from Q1 '15. Growth was led by our consumer businesses. Consumer Banking grew $43 billion or 8% year-over-year. GWIM grew nearly $17 billion, a 7% pace, and Global Banking grew at a 3% pace. 
Turning to asset quality on Slide 9. Outside the energy sector, credit quality is strong. Total net charge-offs were $1.1 billion in Q1 and Q4. We had some immaterial movements this quarter from minor adjustments. But overall, very little change in consumer losses. 
Commercial losses declined slightly from Q4 despite a slight increase in energy charge-offs. The provision of $1 billion in Q1 was up $187 million from Q4. While net charge-offs were flat, total reserve release declined as reserve releases in consumer were mostly offset by reserve increases in commercial, driven by energy exposures. 
On Slide 10, we provide credit quality data on our consumer portfolio. Net charge-offs declined $41 million from Q4. Consumer real estate charge-offs benefited from continued portfolio improvement and fewer onetime items, primarily collateral valuation adjustments on the consumer -- on consumer real estate. Adjusting for those items, consumer net charge-offs were relatively flat versus Q4. Delinquency levels and NPLs improved, and reserve coverage remains strong. 
Moving to commercial credit on Slide 11. Net charge-offs improved $35 million. A decline in nonenergy net charge-offs from Q4 more than offset a modest increase in energy losses. Energy charge-offs increased $17 million from Q4 to roughly $100 million in the quarter. 
Given that asset quality outside energy remains relatively stable, let's focus on energy. We continue to support our energy clients while managing lending limits and actively engaging with stress borrowers. Our overall committed energy exposures declined slightly from Q4 while utilized exposures were up by 100 -- by, excuse me, by $500 million. 
As discussed last quarter, within energy, we believe 2 subsectors, refining and marketing as well as vertically integrated, which, by the way, tend to be large market cap and/or sovereign supported, these 2 subsectors are less dependent on oil prices and therefore, carry less risk than our exposures in E&P and oilfield services. 
Looking at our $7.7 billion utilized exposure to the higher risk E&P and oilfield services clients, we saw a decline of $600 million from Q4 as payoffs and charge-offs more than offset drawdowns. In addition, this quarter, we moved $1.6 billion of our energy exposure to reservable criticized, and we added $525 million to our energy reserves. We made these adjustments based upon another quarter of not only low oil prices but also volatile oil prices. This moves our energy reserve to just over $1 billion. And while these reserves cover our full energy portfolio, they would represent 13% of our $7.7 billion E&P and oilfield services exposures. We believe that percentage is probably more relevant as you compare exposures across the industry. 
Turning to Slide 12. Net interest income on an FTE basis was $9.4 billion. Included in NII this quarter was a FAS 91 negative $1.2 billion market-related adjustment for bond premium amortization. This adjustment in Q1 '15 was a negative $500 million. And including TRUPS-related charges, Q4 was also negative $500 million. 
Adjusted NII of $10.6 billion improved approximately $500 million compared to Q1 '15, excluding FAS 91 and improved $100 million from Q4 after also excluding the TRUPS charge. 
Several factors contributed to the improvement from Q4. We had good commercial loan growth funded by deposits. We also had about $100 million in seasonal benefits in Q1. Offsetting these factors, we had 1 less day of interest and lower dividends on our Federal Reserve stock as required to contribute to the Highway Trust Fund. Lower long-term rates also offset some of the benefit of the Fed rate hike in December, pressuring NII. 
Lower long-term rates was also the driver of increased asset sensitivity in the quarter. As of 3/31, an instantaneous 100 basis point parallel increase in rates is estimated to increase NII by approximately $6 billion over the subsequent year. About 40% of this estimated $6 billion increase comes from short-end rate improvement, and the rest is from long-end rate improvement, split equally between FAS 91 and reinvestment at higher rates. 
Turning to Slide 13. Noninterest expense was $14.8 billion in the quarter. That is $1 billion or 6% lower than Q1 '15, driven by good expense discipline across the company. Legacy asset cost, excluding litigation -- excuse me, legacy asset servicing costs, excluding litigation, were $729 million this quarter, declining $292 million from Q1 '15 and $64 million from Q4. 
Litigation expense of $388 million was in line with Q1 '15 as we work to resolve remaining legacy issues. First quarter expense also included FAS 123 annual retirement costs of $850 million, slightly below Q1 '15. First quarter of both years also included about $300 million of seasonally elevated payroll tax expense. Adjusting for all these items, i.e., litigation, LAS, FAS 123 and the elevated payroll tax, expenses were $12.5 billion. This decline of $600 million from Q1 '15 was driven by lower revenue-related costs associated with sales and trading in Investment Banking as well as revenue in our Wealth Management business, the rolloff of advisory retention awards put in place after the combination with Merrill Lynch and lastly, SIM initiatives that are improving productivity and helping us lower costs so that we can continue to invest in growth. 
Our employee base is down 3% from Q1 '15, and increases in client-facing professionals were more than offset by reductions in LAS and other operations staff. 
Lastly, before leaving expense highlights, I want to remind you that quarterly FDIC insurance expense is set to increase at the large banks until the deposit insurance fund reaches 1.35%. For us, this will increase expense by approximately $100 million pretax starting in Q3 '16. 
Okay. Turning to the business segments and starting with Consumer Banking on Slide 14. Consumer earned $1.8 billion, 22% better than Q1 last year. These earnings reflect continued core customer growth coupled with strong expense management. Lower provision expense from continued improvement in asset quality also benefited the bottom line. This work generated a strong 24% return on allocated capital. Note that allocated capital increased slightly for 2016 pursuant to our normal capital allocation reviews completed in Q1. 
On Slide 15, we focus on some important trends. First, in the upper left, we continue to lead the industry in a number of ways as you can see from the stats. 
Revenue increased $242 million or 3% from Q1 '15 as NII growth more than offset lower noninterest income. Net interest income benefited from higher client balances. Noninterest income was down due to lower mortgage banking income, offset by increases in card income and service charges. We continue to see mortgage banking income come down, given our strategy to book more of our originations on the balance sheet. 
Expenses declined 2% from Q1 '15. On the bottom left, you can see the year-over-year decline in FTEs as Mobile Banking growth continues to help us optimize our delivery network. Note, while overall FTEs are down year-over-year, sales specialists are up almost 900 from Q1 '15. 
Lastly, our deposit franchise continues to drive operating leverage. Our cost of deposits as a percent of average deposits continues to improve and now stands at 171 basis points, which, we believe, is best in class in the industry. 
Focusing on mobile banking users in the upper right for a minute, we added 910,000 net new mobile users this quarter. We now have nearly 20 million active users, and deposit transactions from mobile devices now represents 16% of deposit transactions. 
Interestingly, this quarter, we added more net new users than any quarter in the last 3 years, and we continue to add new features and capabilities, improving convenience and satisfaction. One way we are promoting adoption is by deploying digital ambassadors in our financial centers. Digital ambassadors engage with customers who come to our branches to transact. They educate these customers on alternatives to branch banking, which are not only more convenient for them but also less expensive for us. Digital sales, digital appointments, digital satisfaction all continue to achieve new highs. Focusing on client balances you can see Merrill Edge brokerage assets are up 7% from Q1 '15 on strong flows, offset by lower valuations. 
Moving to the bottom right of the page, note that loans were up 8% from Q1 '15 on strong mortgage and auto growth. 
Okay. Moving to Slide 16. This is a new page that presents some statistics around loan growth and the quality of originations in our Consumer segment. 
Starting with card, we issued 1.2 million cards in the quarter, which is a bit lower than the past few quarters. Average balances were impacted by the sale of a $1.7 billion nonstrategic card portfolio late in Q4. Adjusting for that divestiture, loans were up from Q4. 
Spending on credit card, adjusted for divestitures, was up 8% compared to Q1 '15. As we have discussed many times and shown here, we are originating high-cycle loans that have produced very low loss rates and strong risk-adjusted margins currently exceeding 9%. 
Moving to vehicle lending, one sees similar high-quality, low-risk lending stats. Average booked FICOs are around 780, and loss rates are low. Also, the tenor of these loans is relatively conservative compared to the industry as nearly 90% of our loans are less than 73 months. 
Margins, obviously, aren't as high as credit card, but average balances are growing well across multiple channels within the business. Our underwriting standards are producing similar results in consumer real estate lending, which is presented on the bottom of the page. 
Net loss rates on first-lien mortgages have been negligible. Remember, we began booking these loans in the Consumer segment in the first quarter of 2014, and the macro consumer environment has been healthy, particularly for high FICO borrowers. 
Turning to Slide 17. Global Wealth and Investment Management produced earnings of $740 million, up 13% from Q1 '15. Year-over-year, revenue was down, but expenses declined more, improving pretax margin to 26%. Overall, revenue declined 2% in Q1 '15 as strong NII growth was more than offset by lower market sensitive revenue. 
Asset management revenue declined on lower market values. Transactional revenue was also down and continues to be impacted by the shifting of activity from brokerage to manage relationships as well as market uncertainty. 
NII benefited from solid deposit and loan growth. Noninterest expense in the first quarter of 2016 benefited from the fully amortized advisory retention awards given at the time of the Merrill Lynch merger. We have not seen a noticeable attrition as a result of this. Lower revenue-related incentives also contributed to lower expense versus Q1 '15.
Moving to Slide 18. Despite lower market levels, we continued to see overall solid client engagement, and we continue to invest in the business, growing client-facing professionals year-over-year. 
Client balances are $2.5 trillion. Long-term AUM flows were down this quarter as a result of market volatility, which impacted client behavior. Average deposits grew $9 billion from Q4, and average loans also grew this quarter, concentrated in consumer real estate lending. 
Turning to Slide 19. Global Banking earned $1.1 billion, down from both comparative periods as energy reserves weighed on results. Despite this increased provision expense, Global Banking was able to deliver a 12% return on allocated capital, and note that we allocated $2 billion more in capital to Global Banking for 2016 pursuant to our annual evaluation of allocated capital. 
Global Banking continues to drive solid loan growth within its risk and client frameworks, and this drove a nice increase year-over-year in NII, mitigated, to some degree, by spread compression. That NII improvement, combined with revenue growth from credit cards and treasury fees, partially offset a decline in Investment Banking and other marks on loans and hedges. Noninterest expense compared to Q1 '15 reflects a decline in revenue-related expense, offset by the cost of adding sales professionals over the past 12 months. 
Looking at trends on Slide 20 and comparing to Q1 last year, it was obviously a tough quarter for the capital markets with spikes in volatility causing declines in client activity. However, clients still have financing needs. And here is where the diversity and strength of our franchise allows us to continue to deliver for them even when capital markets are less attractive. 
You can see that trend in our average loans and lease balances, which increased again this quarter and are up 14% year-over-year. Growth in loans was broad based across C&I, CRE and leasing although recently, we have slow growth in CRE. Spread compression on average across all our customer sizes has moderated relative to a year ago. Average deposits also increased from Q1 '15, up $11 billion or 4%. 
We remain focused on our deposit mix, which is strong with only 3% classified as 100% runoff balances. On the other hand, total firm-wide IB fees of $1.2 billion were down 22% from Q1 '15, with the clients broad based across M&A, DCM and ECM. 
Switching to Global Markets on Slide 21 and comparing Q1 last year, again the challenging market condition caused revenue compared to Q1 '15 to be down. The quarter included the benefit from the resolution of a litigation matter, and we also had lower revenue-related cost compared to Q1 '15. All of this resulted in Global Markets reporting earnings just under $1 billion. Reported revenue is down year-over-year, but note that last year, DVA negatively impacted revenue versus added to revenue this quarter. 
Total revenue, excluding DVA, while up from Q4 was down 17% from Q1 last year on lower sales and trading revenue as well as Global Markets' share of lower IB fees. Noninterest expense declined 23% from Q1 '15, driven by lower litigation. Adjusting for litigation, expenses were down 9% as a result of lower revenue-related expenses, demonstrating a disciplined approach to compensation. 
Moving to trends on the next slide and focusing on the components of our sales and trading performance. Sales and trading revenue of $13.3 billion, excluding net DVA, is up 25% from Q4 with improvement in both fixed and equity but down 16% from Q1 last year. Versus Q1 '15, fixed sales and trading of $2.3 billion fell 17%, reflecting a tough environment for credit-related products as well as a tough comparison to a strong Q1 '15 in currencies. 
Equity trading was $1 billion, declining 11%, reflecting weaker trading performance in a challenging market environment. Average trading assets continued to trend down as did VaR, which remains at historically low levels. 
Turning to Legacy Assets and Servicing on Slide 23. This segment lost $40 million this quarter. I'm not going to spend a lot of time here as trends are consistent with past quarters. Revenue is down a bit from lower servicing fees as the portfolio of serviced loans declines. Revenue was also impacted by lower net hedge results. As the portfolio shrinks, we continue to lower servicing costs, particularly with respect to delinquent loans. The number of 60-plus day delinquent first mortgage loans serviced continue to decline and is now only 88,000 units. Excluding litigation, expense this quarter was $729 million, dropping nearly $300 million from Q1 '15 and down $64 million from Q4. 
On Slide 24, we show All Other, which reported a loss of $1.9 billion. Results were impacted by the $1.2 billion FAS 91 market-related adjustment, the FAS 123 seasonal retirement-eligible incentive costs and litigation costs. 
The loss here is higher than Q1 '15 for a number of reasons. First, the market-related adjustment is more negative this year than last. Second, we had higher gains on sale of loans in Q1 '15 than this period. Third, provision expense is higher as both periods had a benefit from provision but this quarter, that benefit was smaller than Q1 '15. Lastly, litigation costs were higher this quarter versus Q1 '15 as we work down legacy issues. 
The effective tax rate for the quarter was about 28%, which is better than we expect for the full year absent any unusual items. One expected item that we want to bring to your attention is another U.K. tax rate reduction recently proposed in the Chancellor's budget. We expect this to be signed into law in Q3 and will result in a tax charge of about $350 million to reduce the carrying value of our U.K. DTA. The vast majority of this charge will not impact regulatory capital. 
Okay. So let me offer a few takeaways as I finish. Given the market volatility, revenue growth was challenging this quarter. However, we compensated for this by managing expenses well. If one adjusts this period's reported results for the noncash FAS 91 market-related NII amount and the FAS 123 costs, earnings are largely in line with recent quarters. You can see progress most clearly in our business segments, which don't include these adjustments. 
Taken as a whole, the segments, not including All Other, improved earnings by 16% versus Q1 '15. The drivers of this improvement were solid loan and deposit growth across our customer groups. Net charge-offs were largely unchanged as modest increases in energy were mitigated by other improvements. 
We strengthened our capital and liquidity, and we returned $1.5 billion in common dividends and repurchase to shareholders. To Brian's earlier point, we have done years of work to simplify the company and reduce risk. 
With $167 billion in tangible common equity, $12 billion in credit reserves and twice the amount of liquidity of a few years ago, we believe we are well prepared to help customers and clients in good and bad times, and we are focused on growing earnings in many different economic scenarios. 
With that, let's open it up to Q&A."

So then if you flip and say, ""How do we going to get down there?"" You're exactly right. If you look, we drifted down even further this quarter in numbers of branches, numbers of customers, but deposits were up. If you look at headcount in consumer, we continue to reposition it towards the sales and relationship management side and away from the transactional side, and so that digitalization, which is, we're at 19.6 million mobile banking consumer customers, and interesting enough, we're growing on the online customer base, meaning computer-based customers grew over 1 million customers from last year's first quarter. So all that just drives more and more transactions and more and more cost structure of the day-to-day transactional stuff into those environments and saves us money overall.

Last year this quarter, we had 17 million mobile users. This year, we have 19.5 million. And as Paul said, there was an interesting point that the nominal rate of growth this quarter was one of the highest we ever had. So even though smartphones are penetrated, you think you've kind of penetrated the customer base, it's still growing fast. So that's number one. And then, as I said earlier, Betsy, and you followed our company for a long time, you might -- you'd have seen a plateauing in the online, the computer-based banking for lack of better term, people coming through bankofamerica.com, and that now is growing as fast nominally or faster mobile, which means people also using both sides, and so that's one thing. So the core activity is growing. And if you look at the activity in the core customer base from card usage and both debit and credit card usage, up 4% plus year-over-year, and that's good. The online mobile part of the spend is now up to 20% of the spend and is growing 15% per year versus the 4.5% growth on the total. So that's tremendous. Then we get into the wallet categories just to give you a sense. Just in the last week, the growth rates in enrolled cards was 12% week-on-week growth in terms of volume enrolled, 100-odd thousand cards came on. The payment usage was up 3% week-over-week. So you see this just phenomenal growth rate. If you annualize that out, that's a weekly growth rate and absent flows with holidays and everything else but think about that. And you see that usage going up, but the mobile wallet payments are still less than 0.2% of the total payments made with plastic at Bank of America. So you still have lots of opportunity to convert activity to a platform which is more convenient for the consumer. And then the other thing we've -- and then, a part of that you talk about is the new consortium to build a new P2P deployment for the banking system. We're up and operating that. We still have a few more months before the rest of their colleagues in the consortium get up, and then we'll start to push that out in the market heavily. I think it's a tremendous improvement over what we have today, even though we have a fair amount of volume on it today through clear exchange, and that was an effort to get us all together, so we could have a very interoperable payment network. We've got the Visa Checkout work that's going on. We're preloading customers' cards in their wallet. We're about as best we can tell 13%, 14% of all the spend in Visa Checkout today. We've got 1 million-plus cards will drive that forward. And if you put that all together you're seeing tremendous volume off of all these mechanisms and then, month of March to give you example, we had almost $60 billion of payments off the computer-based platform and about $20 billion off the mobile-based platform. So think about the size of that. Now, given all that we still sent out about $8 billion in cash out of our ATMs in the month of March. That's $0.25 billion a day or more. So it's still, we had to have all the capabilities, and that's we're building towards and going back to I think Jim's question earlier, the cost structure keeps moving in your favor as you keep driving this activity through."

So a chunk of that is that, the other chunk is good expense management and I said earlier sort of the margin net interest income stabilizing improving, they've been growing the balances, now it's more stable. So I think it is a good starting point. It will -- in some case, you would hope it wouldn't go up a lot because that would mean asset management fees and other things are growing, which attach more compensation, less marginal profit, which would be good news because the overall profit would grow better, but you should assume that that's a level we should hold onto in a relatively stable environment as we see this quarter starting out. When you go to the fiduciary, we've been working on that obviously just because it's the final rule and it came out recently, we have been working on it. So I don't think -- I think to the extent that there is cost embedded in that. A lot of it's in the run rate, and it will be marginally fixed in the run rate for the next few quarters. It's not a hugely substantial cost. And if you even -- look we've put -- spent a lot of time educating our teammates about doing it.

That's a significant investment, and we're guessing that, that investments really going to pay off here in terms of implementing this rule. If you look at the roughly $2 trillion of GWIM client assets we have outside of deposits and loans, we think the Department of Labor will probably impact less than 10% of that.

So they're a lot of quarters where the core activity was growing, but you couldn't find it because -- and if you look at the slide you can see sort of the All Other, which is the investment portfolio, really mortgages and then, the LAS assets are now small enough sort of quarter-to-quarter runoff, but I think it's solid across the board. I mean, I think in the segments we focus in on the consumer side, prime, super prime, there is strong activity mortgages. You could see the origination volumes this quarter were solid. I think if you think the home equity has kicked back up a little bit again, because people see home equity in their house. The auto business is strong, but it will ebb and flow with how many units get sold ultimately because that's the nature of the business, although I think we can gain share there because our share on our direct-to-consumer business was very low. We didn't even do it 2 years ago, and now we're up to, I don't know, $0.5 billion or more a quarter. So I think from a consumer side, the card business because we've now sold through all the portfolios we have to sell, I think you should see stable and start to see better year-over-year comparables than we've had the last several years. Obviously, the last big portfolio went out in the fourth quarter. And so I think we feel good and if you look at the online customers, the creditworthy customers that we deal with are there to borrow, and we're lending to them. And if you go on the commercial side, as Paul said earlier, I think you'd expect the CRE we slow -- we want to be careful on CRE. So we're doing very fundamentally structured loans but in C&I and a nice -- business banking, not a huge business for us frankly, but they finally are making it through their runoff, and that's good. And so I think across all those businesses, you should see it may not grow as fast as nominally it has. Two years ago, we had the international book grow and the corporate that we slowed that down based on our judgments about risk, and so I think it's a pretty balanced yield growth. And so the question always is, do you have to compromise your credit standards to grow? No, we don't because you can see that. And then secondly, is there opportunity to actually get growth? And the answer is yes, but -- and that's just good hard work."

One is we had to balance the portfolios between commercial and consumer. Second, we had to get the consumer to secure portfolios, dominating versus unsecured, both credit card and other loans that would really put us behind in a tough situation last time. And then third, you got to maintain your individual quality of underwriting consumer. It's more formulaic and commercial, more deal selection and customer selection, but if you look at it, let me -- I'll just give you the simplest way to think about this. We have moved probably from 8 out of 10 mortgage holders who are absolutely within our credit box absolutely we do business with, getting their mortgage somewhere else to maybe 7. So we've still got 7 more to go without talking about expanding the credit parameters and our mortgage business one iota. So think of that as a demonstration point that you can go over and over again. So there's plenty of market share out there. And then one of the things, Ken, we're looking at is we look across our 90-odd markets in the United States. There are areas where we have tremendous opportunity to expand our market share, where the franchise just wasn't balanced. Some areas of franchise -- the wealth management business is a high percentage, in some places low. The middle market businesses, very high market, very strong good market shares in certain markets, and 1/3 of that in other markets. And so where we're deploying these people is also based on our view of which markets. So it's going into that market, hiring talent, using this massive customer capability we have to go drive it, again target the exact consumers we want. So even on a geographic basis, whether it's the deposit business and expanding in some of those markets but also in commercial lending business and otherwise there's opportunities without compromising credit."

Litigation was elevated in the quarter from more-than-normalized level that we feel we can achieve and things like that. But leave that aside, the basic principles, we continuously look at the franchise to see about optimization. So if -- generally, when people ask that question, they're thinking about a couple of different areas. One is the markets area. We show you the markets profitability returns in this business. But if you get into the supplement, you'll see, you can never call markets business an annuity business, but what drives our business is really a connection between the issuer clients, the commercial borrowers and commercial clients and the investor clients that we serve and to do that and then our wealth management business because that's a group of people that rely on the research platform. And if you look at the interconnectedness, that is massive and -- whether it's by us getting out of proprietary trading and Volcker and things like that. The whole -- the real business is driven at that. And so if you -- we've taken the balance sheet from impliably at the time of Merrill probably nearly to $800 billion or more, maybe closer to $1 trillion down to $500 billion and the revenues have stabilized, and I think that's a good place for us to be. #1 research plant in the world, #1 in the U.S. this year, the ability to use it in wealth management, the ability to use it to inform our corporate customers. So we look at how we pare away things and look at it. So in international business, we've pared back, there was 12 -- 800 to 1,200 people that were downsized in markets, in banking in the first quarter. So we -- it's not in or out. It's more how do you keep paring it back. And so if you look across there, we always look at that question. We continue to look at it. But right now, we really like the franchise and the connectivity between the franchise of all the different elements focused on markets, focused on wealth management, focused on the core business. And I think, now the question is with low rates, we just have to grind the cost down, and that's going to come out of really all the pieces in -- well, for a while, it was kind of you could go at it at a fairly high level and drive it. Now it's really incrementally idea by idea and taking it out, and that's why you see that constant improvement of core cost of $2 billion run rate, first quarter last year to first quarter this year is not -- is working at it. It just takes more time because 130 million square feet of real estate down to 80 million going to 70 million, there's a lot of work to get out of that real estate."

So what we're actually, if you think about as a real estate question, the number's not as important as they're full and that they're marginally driving the profit, and you can get it -- a lot of sales people per square inch, a lot of customer activity per square inch. That's where we're going, and so you're going to see some of the new prototypes that we've deployed. You can see in place like Denver, where we now are on our third branch, and we'll continue to build out that are much -- look much more like a sales office than what people's visions of a traditional branch. But going to the earlier question, Nancy, I don't know where this stops, and I'm not. That's -- not saying I'm trying to hide an answer that I have. It's just that if you and I are here last year, and we were and you said 17 million mobile users, that's good penetration. It's 2 million more a year later. And as computer-based banking is up 1.5 million or something like that, which is kind of remarkable on top of that. So we don't know where this goes, but we're going to be pushing ahead, following our clients and making sure we stay with them the same time, our customer satisfaction scores are now reaching all-time high, which means the way we're doing it works for them, and you've given me your feedback about our customer focus and capabilities over the years, but they're back to the highest they've ever been, and that's importantly managing that transition carefully, and that's what we got to keep doing."

Mortgage-backed securities in treasuries and that still has a yield to it, not as dollar denominated as much as mortgages but has a yield to it. That has been driven more by the liquidity demands in LCR than it is by anything else, which is the centralized portfolio. We've gone from $100 billion liquidity 4 or 5 years ago to $500 billion.

And good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us to review our second quarter results. I'm beginning on Slide 2 of the materials we sent to you. We reported solid earnings of $4.2 billion after tax or $0.36 per diluted share in w",2183,"Thank you, Lee. And good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us to review our second quarter results. I'm beginning on Slide 2 of the materials we sent to you. 
We reported solid earnings of $4.2 billion after tax or $0.36 per diluted share in what was certainly an eventful quarter for the markets from an overall macro perspective. This compares to $5.1 billion or $0.43 per share in the year-ago quarter. This quarter included negative market-related NII adjustments that cost $0.05 per share and negative DVA that cost us another $0.01 for a total of $0.06. That compares to a $0.03 benefit to EPS for both those items in the second quarter of 2015. 
Earnings neutralizing for the FAS 91 DVA for both periods improved from $0.40 per share to $0.42 per share on a year-over-year basis. Our results represent another quarter of solid progress in the strategies we have been executing. Those strategies are delivering more of the company's capabilities to each and every client we serve. 
At BAC, we focus on what we can control, and despite low rates and other macro events, we continue to focus on managing our risk, our costs and our delivery of quality products and customer service.  In Q2, we grew loans $22 billion or approximately 2.5% versus last year even as we sold a few portfolios during the year. All this growth was organic and consistent with our risk appetite. 
We also grew deposits more than $66 billion or 6% over that same time period, and we did so while maintaining disciplined deposit pricing. 
We also continue to transform our company in a digital way in all things in all businesses. For example, this quarter we crossed over 20 million active mobile users and continue to increase their use of digital channels for both transactions and buying more bank products. Active mobile banking customers logged into their accounts over 900 million times this quarter, depositing more than 25 million checks or more than $20 billion via mobile check deposits. They made over 25 million mobile bill payments, up 30% year-over-year, and made nearly 80 million transfers. 
Person-to-person or P2P payments continue to ramp up as well. While still small a component of the overall consumer payments this quarter, we had $6.7 billion in P2P payments this quarter. That is more than $13 billion year-to-date, and is up 28% from last year. This channel is a value channel for all our customers and made possible by the continued investment we make. 
As we move to Slide 3, we have talked to you -- a lot of you over the last several months, including many of you on the phone today. I thought I'd try to address some of the more common questions we get from those conversations by looking at our results, by looking at the income statements and the items therein. First, one of the core questions is: What if rates stayed lower for longer? Well, for bank management and for U.S. investors, it would be easier if rates were revised but that hasn't happened. 
So the question is: Can we grow earnings without rates improving? We believe we surely can. We can do that by continuous success on things like expense management, by keeping NII stable to growing, stable and growing fees and continue to manage risk well and hold down our credit costs. 
As you can see, revenue this quarter was $20.6 billion on an FTE basis. Adjusted for the negative impacts of market-related NII adjustments and DVA, that number is $21.8 billion. Adjusted for the same items in the year-ago quarter, the total was comparable. 
Now as we focus in on NII, Paul will take you through some of the changes this quarter later in the presentation. However, in summary, adjusted for market-related changes in both last year's second quarter and this year's second quarter, we grew NII by $400 million or 4% year-over-year, and that took place while the 10-year treasury yield fell 86 basis points from last year on a spot basis. Going forward, in a stable interest rate environment, we believe we can maintain NII around the second quarter 2016 level based on the current loan and deposit growth we see. And if rates rise, we would expect NII to grow. 
Another question relates to the Global Markets business. That question is often asked how we need to change this business, especially the FICC area, as many of our customers have. I want to hit this head on. 
First of all, fixed income is a good business for us here at Bank of America. It is a business which benefits not only by its core activities but by coupled -- being coupled with our massive Global Banking franchise that has leadership positions across the globe. Combined together, they generate a pretty steady $1 billion-or-so quarterly investment banking fees. It's also important part of our overall Global Markets platform, the platform which sits on top of the #1 global research team for the past 5 years. 
In the second quarter, this business did well. Global Markets generated $3.7 billion in sales and trading revenue, excluding DVA. Compared to the same period last year, that is up 12%. This year-over-year improvement is driven by FICC sales and trading, which is up 22%. Now think about that. Sales and trading revenue, including DVA, for this quarter was the highest second quarter we experienced in 5 years, and that led to one of the most profitable quarters for Global Markets we have seen in the past 5 years. 
Also, the team served clients well during a period of difficult volatility. So clearly, it remains a profitable, important business for us to serve clients. We're proud of how the team supported their clients through the Brexit vote and the periods of volatility related thereto. 
Another question is getting clarity on how we're transforming the business on the fee lines. Noninterest revenue was $11.2 billion this quarter. Although modestly down from second quarter '15, it was up nicely from the first quarter. There are a lot of items that run through the various lines of fees. 
First, with regard to consumer fees, we are largely done with the big card portfolio divestitures and branch divestitures. Both those impacted both card fees and banking service charges, and you can see them coming off the bottom as you look at the linked quarters. Fees now will grow with the volume of cards and accounts that are now not growing in our company. Our mortgage business is now sized appropriately for our franchise, and the fee line there Paul will talk about later but will be -- that's where it's going to be in the future. 
With regard to revenue more closely tied to markets businesses, the ups and downs in volumes of activity in sales and trading, investment banking and brokerage will move back and forth through the market. But the important thing is we have strong businesses, strong client-facing businesses in these areas, and we're getting our share of these revenue streams even while the markets ebbs and flows. 
So if we look about move from the fee line to the expense line, many of you give us credit for having managed expenses from $70 billion 5 years ago to the mid-$50 billion today. But the question is: Can we do more? And if you look at this quarter, we continue to manage expenses well. 
Noninterest expense this quarter was $13.5 billion, improving more than 3.5% -- or 3% from 2015 second quarter. This continues a trend of performance that is showing expense declining significantly on a quarterly basis quarter after quarter over the past several years. This is the lowest level that we have reported since the fourth quarter of 2008, and that's prior to the Merrill Lynch merger. 
If you look at our efficiency ratio and normalize it for the NII adjustment stated above, it would be about 62% this quarter. That's an improvement of 200 basis points from last year's second quarter. 
Cost control and cost-effectiveness is a focus for our management team here at Bank of America. So the question is: How much more can we do on expenses? So if you think about this, let's start by looking at the cost of the most recent 4 quarters. 
In the trailing 4 quarters, the total expense base was $56.3 billion. As we look out from the second -- the third quarter of 2016 through the next sick quarters -- 6 quarters into 2018, we believe that with our SIM efforts and the continued work we're doing across the board on expenses, we're targeting an annual expense number of around $53 billion in total expenses for the year 2018. So over 6 quarters, we continue to absorb investment, merit increases, rising health care costs and bringing expenses down in nominal amount. Our continued work in driving down costs to service delinquent loans will help with this, but the other reductions are generally coming from the core work in Simplify and Improve, look -- the work we continue to do to simplify those work processes but also the core work we do to allow us to self-fund our growth initiatives, our continuing investments in technology and salespeople. 
While I'm on the topic of expenses, I want to point out another important milestone for our company this quarter. This quarter, we changed our reporting to eliminate the legacy asset servicing segment. This completes transformation. This segment was the last place for product orientation, was reported [ph] not customer orientation. And more importantly, it also reflects the last of legacies really behind us from an operational basis. 
We have added a couple of slides in the appendix today to go along with our 8-K we filed a few days ago. They explain the methodology of the realignment of LAS and highlights the impact of the segment  where those loans and associated P&L are recorded now. 
But what I want to get to you -- across to you is LAS was an -- as an operational segment successfully did what it was tasked to do: to clean up one of the largest mortgage servicing businesses in the U.S. Consider that progress. From 1.4 million delinquent mortgage loans, we're down to 80,000 today. At one point, we had 58,000 teammates and 20,000 contractors working on this task, and now we're down to 10,000 teammates. 
From one peak quarter of $3 billion-plus in expenses, we're down to $600 million this quarter. That phase of the work is complete, and we need to move that operating business in with the rest of the company to do the further consolidation and further work to improve our servicing costs. We are pleased with the accomplishments of this group, but there's still more to be done. 
And that brings us to our provision. Simply point -- put, the question we often get is: Is credit deteriorating? As you can see, we remain very pleased with both consumer and commercial credit performance. Not only have not -- net charge-offs not gotten worse, but they've improved in the most recent quarter, moving back below $1 billion.  Provision expense is and will remain roughly equivalent to net charge-offs. Even on our energy portfolio, we have seen lower exposures, improved losses. 
And that brings us to our returns. In this operating environment, can we get our returns above our cost of capital? Well, as you can see, we made solid progress on our returns this quarter. Our return on tangible common equity adjusted for the market-related and DVA impacts was 10.9%. On a similarly adjusted basis, our ROA has moved to 90 basis points. We still have work to do, but you can see the improvement coming through. 
As we move to Slide 4, you can see our business segment results. You see strong year-over-year results in every business, driven by the generation of operating leverage. Consumer Banking continued its momentum around client activity and operating leverage. Consumer satisfaction continues to improve as does adoption and use of digital capabilities and functionality. 
In our wealth management business, they grew earnings as costs declined more than revenue while we continue to invest in this business. Revenue is impacted by AUM valuations from market variability. 
Our Global Banking team drove results with continued solid loan growth, operating leverage of 9% and strong credit results. Global Markets executed well for its clients, as I stated earlier, in a very difficult period and used operating leverage to grow its earnings year-over-year as well. So on a combined basis, those 4 business segments improved 16% from last year's second quarter, earning about $5 billion this quarter. 
Partially offsetting this was the loss at All Other, and that primary reflects the market-related NII adjustments I spoke about earlier. You can also see the returns and efficiency ratios for each of these segments, and note that each segment is earning well above our cost of capital. 
With that, I'm going to turn it over to Paul to take you through the numbers."

Good morning, everyone. Since Brian covered the income statement, I will start with the balance sheet on Page 5.

Since Brian covered the income statement, I will start with the balance sheet on Page 5. As you know, general deposit flows drive the size of our balance sheet, and they, on an ending basis, were relatively flat this quarter as inflows were partially offset by outflows to fund tax -- seasonal tax payments. 
So total assets were stable compared to Q1, with loans increasing modestly, security balances rising and cash down a corresponding amount. Liquidity also saw small decline. However, we remain well compliant with LCR requirements. 
Tangible common equity of $170 billion improved by $3.6 billion from Q1, driven by earnings and OCI. This was partially offset by $1.1 billion in share repurchases and roughly $500 million in common dividends. As a reminder, following the CCAR results, we announced an increase in both our share repurchase authorization as well as a planned increase of 50% in our quarterly dividend. On a per-share basis, tangible book value per share increased to $16.68, up 11% from Q2 '15. 
Turning to regulatory metrics. As a reminder, we report capital under the advanced approaches. Our CET1 transition ratio under Basel III ended the quarter at 10.6%. On a fully phased-in basis, CET1 capital improved $4.3 billion to $161.8 billion. Under the advanced approaches, compared to Q1 '16, the CET1 ratio increased 37 basis points to 10.5% and is above our current 2019 requirement. RWA declined roughly $13 billion, driven by reductions related to retail exposures, primarily from credit improvement. 
We also provide our capital metrics under the standardized approach. Here, our CET1 ratio improved to 11.4%. Supplementary leverage ratio for both parent and bank continued to exceed U.S. regulatory minimums that take effect in 2018. 
Turning to Slide 6. And on an average basis, total loans were up $7 billion from Q1 and $23 billion or 3% from Q2 '15. On an ending-period basis, loan growth this quarter was impacted by paydowns near the end of the quarter in the non-U.S. corporate loan facilities and about $1.6 billion in FX translations across international loans, including U.K. card. 
Note on this slide, there is a breakdown of the loans in our business segments and All Other. Again, on an average basis, year-over-year, loans in All Other were down $42 billion, driven by continued runoff of first- and second-lien mortgages while loans in our business segments were up $65 billion or 9%. 
In Consumer Banking, we continue to see strong growth in consumer real estate and vehicle lending, offset somewhat by runoff in home equity, outpacing originations. In Wealth Management, we saw growth in consumer real estate and structured lending. Global Banking loans were up $35 billion or 12% year-over-year and up 7% annualized from Q1. 
Deposits were stable with Q1 at $1.2 trillion but grew $67 billion or 6% from Q2 '15. Broad-based growth was led by consumer, increasing more than $44 billion or 8% year-over-year, while Wealth Management deposits grow 6% and deposits with corporate clients in Global Banking improved nearly 4%. 
Turning to asset quality on Slide 7. We saw improvement from Q1. Total net charge-offs improved $83 million from Q1 to less than $1 billion in Q2. Consumer losses declined modestly across a number of products, and while slight, commercial losses also declined from Q1 as a result of lower energy losses. Provision of $976 million in Q2 was down $21 million from Q1. Finally, we had a small overall net reserve release in the quarter as consumer releases were modestly offset by builds in commercial. 
On Slide 8, we provide credit quality data on our consumer portfolio. Net charge-offs declined $68 million from Q1. While driven by lower real estate losses, the improvement, as I mentioned, was broad-based. Over half of the losses in this book are U.S. credit card, with a loss rate improved 5 basis points from Q1 to 2.66%. Delinquency levels and NPLs improved, and reserve coverage remains strong. 
Moving to the commercial credit on Slide 9. Net charge-offs improved $15 million from Q1 as energy losses declined. Energy charge-offs decreased $23 million from Q1 to $79 million this quarter. There isn't a lot of new news on the commercial asset quality front other than the modest improvement in our energy-related exposure. 
As you all know, the price of oil and gas was more stable in Q2. Within this backdrop, we experienced some improvement in both energy losses and exposure. A few clients we've financed with equity issuances and other financing solutions, which also helped improve exposures. 
Overall, our committed energy exposure declined $3 billion from Q1, with utilized exposure declining more modestly. And exposure to exploration and production as well as oil field services, which we believe are the 2 higher-risk subsectors, declined 1% from Q1. Outside of energy, commercial asset quality continues to perform well. 
Let me share with you a few metrics that exhibit the quality of this book and its performance. The reservable criticized exposure ratio is 3.8%, and excluding energy and metals and mining, exposure is 2.4%, which is near prerecession levels. The commercial net charge-off ratio, excluding small business, has been below 15 basis points for 14 consecutive quarters even with the elevated levels of energy charge-offs we experienced over the past 3 quarters. The NPL ratio, which today is at 37 basis points, has been below 40 basis points for 11 consecutive quarters. 
Turning to Slide 10. Net interest income on a reported non-FTE basis was $9.2 billion. Included in NII this quarter was a negative $974 million market-related adjustments to true up bond premium amortization. This follows Q1's more negative adjustment of $1.2 billion, and it's important to note that the adjustment in Q2 '15 was a benefit of $669 million. 
NII on an FTE basis, excluding market-related adjustments, was $10.4 billion. This was lower than Q1 primarily due to the lower long-end rates and Q1's seasonal impacts. Compared to Q2 '15, results were up nearly $400 million or 4% as higher short-end rates, combined with loan growth funded by deposits, offset the negative impact of lower long-end rates. 
Looking forward to Q3. We will benefit from an extra day, which will be offset by the impact of declines in long-end rates over the past 2 quarters and put pressure on our NBS bond yields and reinvestment yields more generally. As we get into Q4 and the next year, we get more optimistic about NII, assuming both the current forward curve and the current pace of loan and deposit growth. With respect to asset sensitivity, as of 6/30, an instantaneous 100 basis point parallel increase in rates is estimated to increase NII by $7.5 billion over the subsequent 12 months, driven by the increase in long-end rates. 
Now we think it's also important to understand what we expect to happen to NII if rates don't rise.  Referring to the bottom left of the slide, the adjusted NII has been fairly stable, averaging between $10.3 billion and $10.4 billion over the past 5 quarters. If we have stability in long-end rates, we would expect to maintain that level in the near term, again assuming modest loan and deposit growth. Rates moving up or down from here would obviously impact that perspective slightly in the near term but building as we extend that scenario into future quarters and years. 
Turning to Slide 11. Noninterest expense was $13.5 billion in the quarter. That is $0.5 billion or 3% lower than Q2 '15, driven by good expense discipline across the company. As you can see, we are presenting expenses a little bit differently now that we have eliminated the LAS segment. Having said that, we made steady progress on reducing legacy loan servicing costs this quarter, and we still expect to achieve our original goal of lowering the former LAS segment costs ex-litigation to $500 million in Q4. 
Q2 litigation expense was $270 million, which was higher by $95 million in Q1 '15. So year-over-year, expense improvement ex-litigation was actually $600 million. Nearly every category of cost was lower year-over-year. It was led by personnel, including the expiration of the fully amortized advisory awards and the revenue-related incentive mostly in wealth management, while the rest of the improvement I would characterize as just good, hard work, grinding expenses lower through SIM and other initiatives. 
While the rate of decline has been slowing, our employee base is down 3% from Q2 '15. As the employee base continues to grind lower, we think it's important to point out that the reductions on a percentage basis now include more highly paid managerial associates. So while the rate of FTE reduction has slowed, the relationship to expense reductions is not linear. 
Also, we continue to increase the number of client-facing associates to drive growth while, at the same time, through SIM and other efforts, simplifying and streamlining activities and thereby reduce non-client-facing positions. Lastly, as I said last quarter, we expect our quarterly FDIC expense to increase approximately $100 million for a number of quarters starting in Q3 '16. 
Turning to the business segments and starting with Consumer Banking on Slide 12. Consumer earned $1.7 billion, continuing its trend of solid improvement and reporting a robust 20% return on allocated capital. Revenue and earnings were driven by deposits and loan growth, coupled with continued expense improvement driving operating leverage. As a result of this operating leverage, the efficiency [ph] ratio improved roughly 360 basis points year-over-year. Note that the lack of reserve releases this quarter versus a meaningful release last year mitigated some of the improvement in the operating leverage. So while earnings were up 3% year-over-year, pretax preprovision earnings rose 11%. 
On Slide 13, we focus on additional key Consumer Banking trends. First, in the upper left, the stats are a reminder of our strong competitive position. Revenue increased by $107 million as NII growth more than offset lower noninterest income. Net interest income continued to improve as we drove deposits and loans higher. Noninterest income was down due mostly to lower mortgage banking income. This decline is in part a result of selling fewer loans and instead holding more on our balance sheet, thereby shifting mortgage banking income to NII. 
Expense declined 5% from Q2 '15. The positive expense trend is a result of a number of initiatives. As an example, I would note that our growth in mobile banking continues to play an important role in helping us optimize our delivery network while improving customer satisfaction. Our cost of deposits as a percent of average deposits also continued to improve and now stands at 162 basis points. 
Focusing on client balances on the bottom of the page, Merrill Lynch brokerage assets at $132 billion are up 8% versus Q2 '15 on strong account flows, partially offset by lower market valuations. We increased the number of Merrill Lynch customers by 10% from Q2 '15. We now have more than 1.6 million households using our platform for self-directed trading. 
Moving across the bottom right of the page, note that loans are up 5% from Q2 '15 on strong mortgage and vehicle lending growth. Average vehicle loans are up 20% from Q2 '15, with average book FICO scores remaining well above the 770 level and net losses remaining below 30 basis points and improving on a linked-quarter basis. Mortgage loan growth was aided by solid mortgage production of $16 billion, up modestly from Q2 '15 as customers took advantage of historically low interest rates. 
On consumer card -- or I should say on U.S. consumer card, we issued more than 1.3 million cards in the quarter, which is the highest level since 2008.  Average balances were modestly down. However, adjusting for divestitures, average card balances grew $1.4 billion compared to Q2 '15. Scanning -- spending on credit cards, adjusted for divestitures, was up 7.5% compared to Q2 '15. As reviewed in previous quarters, we continue to focus on originating high-FICO loans, which generally produce low loss rates and strong risk-adjusted margins. 
Last quarter, we highlighted the quality of our underwriting in the consumer business. This quarter, we are highlighting our leading position in digital banking. This technology continues to reshape how our customers bank. Importantly, as adoption rises, particularly around transaction processing and self-service, we see improved efficiency and customer satisfaction. 
We added more than 2.5 million new mobile customers in the past 12 months. With more than 20 million active users, deposits from mobile devices now represent 17% of deposit transactions. Mobile customers on average process 280,000 deposits per day, an increase of 28% year-over-year and the equivalent volume of 800 financial centers. 
Mobile sales are up nearly 50% from last year. We are promoting mobile sales and electronic adoption by deploying digital ambassadors in our financial centers. We now have more than 3,500 digital ambassadors in our branches engaging with customers who come into the branch to transact. They educate these customers on alternatives to branch banking, which are not only more convenient for them but also more efficient for us. 
Digital sales, appointments and satisfaction all continue to achieve new highs. Also, as you know, we are a leader in person-to-person and person-to-business money movement through digital transfers and bill payment capabilities. The adoption and popularity of these capabilities continues to drive growth, with record volume of $246 billion this quarter, up nearly 5% year-over-year. 
Turning to Slide 15. Global Wealth and Investment Management produced earnings of $722 million, up 8% from Q2 '15. Year-over-year, revenue was down modestly but expenses were down even more, improving pretax margin to 26%, up meaningfully from Q2 '15. This quarter included a modest gain from the previously announced sale of Bank of America Global Capital Management. This reduced AUM comprised of short-term liquid assets by approximately $80 billion. 
Overall, revenue declined 2% from Q2 '15 as strong NII growth and the gain were more than offset by lower market-sensitive revenue. Asset management revenues declined from Q2 '15 on lower market values while improving modestly on a linked-quarter basis. Transactional revenue was down and continues to be impacted by market uncertainty as well as the migration of activity from brokerage to managed relationships. 
NII benefited from solid deposit and loan growth. Noninterest expense declined nearly $200 million or 6% from Q2 '15, with half of that benefit derived from the expiration of the amortization of advisory retention awards that were put in place at the time of the Merrill Lynch merger. The rest of the improvement was a result of lower revenue-related incentives and other support costs. 
Moving to Slide 16. Despite volatile markets, we continued to see overall solid client engagement. Client balances at $2.4 trillion were down from Q1, but excluding the sale I mentioned earlier, were up from Q1 as higher market valuation levels, $10 billion of long-term AUM flows and loan growth more than offset tax-related deposit outflows. 
Driven by the expected seasonality, average deposits were down from Q1 as clients paid income taxes. Importantly, average deposits are up 6% from Q2 '15, driven by growth in the second half of 2015. Average loans also grew this quarter. Growth was concentrated in consumer real estate and structured lending as well. 
Turning to Slide 17. Global Banking earned $1.5 billion, producing solid improvement over both Q1 and year-over-year. Returns on allocated capital was 16%, a 200 basis point improvement from Q2 '15 despite adding $2 billion in allocated capital. Double-digit percent revenue growth year-over-year offset a low single-digit expense growth, creating strong operating leverage that improved the efficiency ratio to 45%. Global Banking continues to drive solid loan growth within its risk and client frameworks, producing solid year-over-year improvement in NII. 
Revenue benefited this quarter from mark-to-market gains on our FPO loan portfolio due to recovery in certain energy and mining exposures. Higher treasury fees and leasing gains also aided the improvement from Q2 '15. While total investment banking fees for the firm were down from Q2 '15, Global Banking gained a little share supported by M&A fees, which were up on an absolute basis. A modest increase in noninterest expense compared to Q2 '15 reflects the cost of adding sales professionals over the past 12 months and a modest increase in incentive related due to the higher revenue. 
Looking at trends on Page 18 and comparing Q2 last year. Clients were comforted -- excuse me, clients were confronted with increased volatility once again this quarter with concerns around both global growth as well as the outcome of the U.K. referendum. However, despite concerns, companies still need to finance as well as to move [ph] their money, and this is when the strength and diversity of our franchise is most appreciated by our clients. 
Average loans on a year-over-year basis grew $35 billion or 12%. Growth was broad-based across large corporates as well as middle-market borrowers and spread across most products. Having said that, we slowed our construction-led commercial real estate lending a few quarters ago. Average deposits increased from Q2 '15, up $11 billion or 4% from both new and existing clients. 
Switching to Global Markets on Slide 19. The past couple of quarters are great examples of the importance of this segment to not only its clients around the world, but also to its -- to our customers and clients in all our business segments. Customers and clients were able to live their financial lives better in Q2 because Global Markets delivered for them under challenging market conditions, helping them raise capital, buy and sell securities as well as manage risks. 
We believe we increased our relevance with clients during Q2 and more specifically, during the market volatility after the U.K. referendum. We did this by showing them that we will be there for them when they need us most, that we are there for them with consistent set of products and services at terms that makes sense for our clients and our shareholders and there for them with thoughtful advice as well as the capabilities, strength and confidence to make markets and execute. All of this result in Global Markets reporting earnings of $1.1 billion and a return on capital of 12%, 13% excluding net DVA impact. 
Revenue was up appreciably year-over-year as well as linked quarter. Total revenue, excluding DVA, was up 8% year-over-year on solid sales and trading results and up 18% over a Q1 that saw challenging market conditions. Strong expense management drove expenses 6% lower year-over-year even while revenue was higher. 
Moving to trends on the next slide and focusing on the components of our sales and trading performance. Sales and trading revenue of $3.7 billion, excluding net DVA, was up 12% from Q2 '15 driven by FICC. In terms of revenue, this was the best second quarter we have had in the past 5 years. 
Excluding DVA and versus Q2 '15, FICC sales and trading of $2.6 billion increased 22% as the improvement, which began in late Q1 continue through Q2 as global concerns abated and central banks took further monetary policy actions. The improvement was across both macro and credit products driven by stronger rates and currency, client activity as well as improved current market conditions. Tighter spreads benefited mortgage trading, and municipal bonds outperformed treasuries with a strong retail demand. Equity sales and trading was $1.1 billion, declining 8% versus Q2 '15, which saw significant client activity in Asia driven by stock market rallies in the region. 
On Slide 21, we show All Other, which reported a loss of $815 million. This loss was driven by the current quarter's $974 million market-related NII adjustment. The loss is lower than Q1 due to both a lower market-related NII adjustment as well as the absent of retirement-eligible incentive costs. Compared to Q2 '15, the difference is driven by a number of factors. First, the negative NII market related adjustment this quarter versus a large positive adjustment in Q2 '15; second, we had reps and warranty recoveries in Q2 '15 related to a court ruling in gains on the sale of consumer real estate loans; third, provision expense declined from Q2 '15 driven by continued portfolio improvement. 
The effective tax rate for the quarter was about 29%, which is in line with what we expect for the remainder of the year absent any unusual items. And as a reminder, we still expect to record a tax charge of about $350 million, most likely in 3Q that reduces the carrying value of our U.K. DTAs as a result of U.K. tax reform announced last year. The vast majority of this charge will not impact regulatory capital. 
Okay. So let me offer a few takeaways as I finish. Q2 was another quarter of solid progress in a challenging global environment. While growth concerns persist in many countries, the U.S. economy continues to steadily improve, albeit at a less than optimum pace. The diversity and strength of our franchise makes us more relevant to clients and customers during times such as these, and you can see that in our results. Clearly, interest rates affected our financial performance this quarter. Still, while we cannot control interest rates, we're not waiting for them to rise. We grew in this environment by focusing on the things that we can control and drive. We grew deposits. We grew loans. We managed risk well, reflected in reduced charge-offs. We delivered for customer, client in another challenging quarter specially around the U.K. referendum. We invested in our future by adding sales professionals and continuing to deploy technology that improves customer satisfaction. We returned capital to shareholders, and we announced plans to return increasing amounts, and we did all of this while we lowered expenses and drove operating leverage. 
Thank you. With that, let's open up to questions."

So I think we're at a point now where we're not going to be see those sorts of divestitures in the future, and we start feeling better about more consistent growth around card. If you look at brokerage income, we've been in a multi-quarter trend of people shifting from brokerage to a more managed accounts. That trend has all the fee pressure on the revenue line because, at the same time that was going on, we have a lot of volatility in the marketplace, lower overall capital markets, lower overall activity, but I think over time, as -- if capital markets continue to rise, we will get -- we will offset that decline in transactional revenue."

In terms -- in the attrition we see is actually in the lower production levels mainly due to people not being able to going to build a book of business, and we're trying to fix that through the integrated business system with our consumer and preferred teams. In terms of DoJ and the fiduciary standard, we're busily implanting this. It's consistent with where we're going with the business. It's consistent with the move from an old view of what financial advisory was versus a managed money fee based loaded with a financial planning driven business. Admittedly, it's a little tricky because the actual rules only apply to a few hundred-odd billion dollars of 401(k) and a retirement assets we have, but it's consistent with where we take in the business and the teams try we don't see meaningful revenue or changes due to that.

And the first",353,"Sure. So let me just back up a little bit. I will definitely answer your question but I want to emphasize again we're talking about LTM $56 billion going to $53 billion and absorbing in that merit health care inflation and other investment. And the first thing I would point out as you sort of think about that, look at what we have accomplished over the last 5 years. In Q2 '11 to Q2 '16, we reduced quarterly expenses by $4.8 billion. That's a $19 billion annualized run rate so -- and we did this by not only reducing legacy mortgage related expenses, which were only make up about $2 billion of that $4.8 billion but just through good expense management in every major category across the company. So from here, it's about a number of things. A lot of those things have been identified through our simplify and improve initiative. We're investing in technology and capabilities to improve efficiency. The most obvious example of that you can see is in the increasing adoption of customers for digital channels, but I do want to emphasize that it is about making progress across the entire company from our leaders and our teams. So if you look in consumer, they're examples now the digital adoption, we've got mobile users up 15% to over 20 million. When they make a deposit, that's 1/10 the cost. You get digital sales up 12% year-over-year. We've got more customers using digital statements. A lot more work to do there were transition from paper to electronic. We are optimizing coverage model in both consumer and GWIM, and they all have goals. We all have goals and initiatives around control expenses, including travel, supplies, control costs. If you look at Global Banking and Global Markets, we are simplifying our legal entity structure business model. We're integrating all wholesale credit origination and processing across the lines of businesses. We're centralizing data platforms. We're expanding electronic abilities, and we're optimizing the coverage model. So there's a lot going on. And if you're going to need all of it to get to our goals."

You can see that even in markets year-over-year we're down 7% in people, where revenue went up. And so it's electrification the fixed-income platform and the equities platform continuing down that road. Every single areas moving. And then if you also have to think about the stability of the platform. This company has now been operating with it consistent strategy and consistent ability to execute for many years and what's going to with a legacy and stuff, that just allows us to keep operating on ourselves, and we always have performed best in history when we had a period of time no acquisitions no divestitures, no legacy asset servicing. So we're very confident that happen. On revenue, I'd say look at it year-over-year, look at it linked quarter. So last 3 or 4 quarters, you're seeing revenue stable. And while bounces around with market activity given quarter the core revenue continues to go forward and the expenses the coming down on a core basis. So we're comfortable that there's nothing -- we want to allow our people responsible growth to give us costs saves and not grow the business. So it has to be sustainable. It has to be actually taking on real work and yet still investing in more client-facing teammates, more sales people and more technology capabilities for customers."

MBI line was down year-over-year. That was planned for. We knew that was coming. I just want to walk so far just want to walk kind of why it's down, and we could talk a little bit about going forward. So kind of 4 items. First, we sold an appraisal business last year. So there was revenue in last year's second quarter that isn't in this quarter. Second, we had some servicing sales in the second quarter of last year for a gain that we didn't have this quarter. Third and probably most significant from a revenue perspective is that we had the ACE decision in the second quarter last year. So we released last year some reps and warranties. That was a significant amount of benefit last year. And then fourth then probably strategically most important point you're getting to is we are selling less mortgages choosing instead to hold on our balance sheet and obviously, there's decreases in BI but increase NII over time. So -- and plus you have to note that as we just talked about, servicing, bad servicing is going to continue to run off. So if servicing's running off and not being replaced as fast, if we are holding more mortgages on the balance sheet as we transition from MBI to NII, you could see that line continue sort of trend lower. In terms of the mortgages, I think in the short term, it's going to be fairly stable, and that trend's going to -- this is a good base this quarter. It's a good base to sort of start from. I think that trend lowers going to be in some quarters very slow because as you point out, other items other line items a little bit messy and bounce around there depending on what happens in interest rates, but that's the trend. In terms of what we're trying to accomplish, all of the loans we originate that are nonconforming, we would like to keep on our balance sheet and even the conforming loans that have the certain characteristic we're going to be holding on our balance sheet. So right now, that's around 75-ish  percent of the loans we're originating are going on our balance sheet. Is that helpful?"

Any amount of deposit that doesn't go to our clients and customers, we're sticking in the securities portfolio and getting as much yield as we can get there within the constraints of liquidity and capital risk and interest rate risk. So we think we can grow in even a flat interest rate environment grow the NII line not necessarily the next quarter but as we again move out into the future.

And good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us to review our second quarter results. I'm beginning on Slide 2 of the materials we sent to you. 
We reported solid earnings of $4.2 billion after tax or $0.36 per diluted share in what was certainly an eventful quarter for the markets from an overall macro perspective. This compares to $5.1 billion or $0.43 per share in the year-ago quarter. This quarter included negative market-related NII adjustments that cost $0.05 per share and negative DVA that cost us another $0.01 for a total of $0.06. That compares to a $0.03 benefit to EPS for both those items in the second quarter of 2015. 
Earnings neutralizing for the FAS 91 DVA for both periods improved from $0.40 per share to $0.42 per share on a year-over-year basis. Our results represent another quarter of solid progress in the strategies we have been executing. Those strategies are delivering more of the company's capabilities to each and every client we serve. 
At BAC, we focus on what we can control, and despite low rates and other macro events, we continue to focus on managing our risk, our costs and our delivery of quality products and customer service.  In Q2, we grew loans $22 billion or approximately 2.5% versus last year even as we sold a few portfolios during the year. All this growth was organic and consistent with our risk appetite. 
We also grew deposits more than $66 billion or 6% over that same time period, and we did so while maintaining disciplined deposit pricing. 
We also continue to transform our company in a digital way in all things in all businesses. For example, this quarter we crossed over 20 million active mobile users and continue to increase their use of digital channels for both transactions and buying more bank products. Active mobile banking customers logged into their accounts over 900 million times this quarter, depositing more than 25 million checks or more than $20 billion via mobile check deposits. They made over 25 million mobile bill payments, up 30% year-over-year, and made nearly 80 million transfers. 
Person-to-person or P2P payments continue to ramp up as well. While still small a component of the overall consumer payments this quarter, we had $6.7 billion in P2P payments this quarter. That is more than $13 billion year-to-date, and is up 28% from last year. This channel is a value channel for all our customers and made possible by the continued investment we make. 
As we move to Slide 3, we have talked to you -- a lot of you over the last several months, including many of you on the phone today. I thought I'd try to address some of the more common questions we get from those conversations by looking at our results, by looking at the income statements and the items therein. First, one of the core questions is: What if rates stayed lower for longer? Well, for bank management and for U.S. investors, it would be easier if rates were revised but that hasn't happened. 
So the question is: Can we grow earnings without rates improving? We believe we surely can. We can do that by continuous success on things like expense management, by keeping NII stable to growing, stable and growing fees and continue to manage risk well and hold down our credit costs. 
As you can see, revenue this quarter was $20.6 billion on an FTE basis. Adjusted for the negative impacts of market-related NII adjustments and DVA, that number is $21.8 billion. Adjusted for the same items in the year-ago quarter, the total was comparable. 
Now as we focus in on NII, Paul will take you through some of the changes this quarter later in the presentation. However, in summary, adjusted for market-related changes in both last year's second quarter and this year's second quarter, we grew NII by $400 million or 4% year-over-year, and that took place while the 10-year treasury yield fell 86 basis points from last year on a spot basis. Going forward, in a stable interest rate environment, we believe we can maintain NII around the second quarter 2016 level based on the current loan and deposit growth we see. And if rates rise, we would expect NII to grow. 
Another question relates to the Global Markets business. That question is often asked how we need to change this business, especially the FICC area, as many of our customers have. I want to hit this head on. 
First of all, fixed income is a good business for us here at Bank of America. It is a business which benefits not only by its core activities but by coupled -- being coupled with our massive Global Banking franchise that has leadership positions across the globe. Combined together, they generate a pretty steady $1 billion-or-so quarterly investment banking fees. It's also important part of our overall Global Markets platform, the platform which sits on top of the #1 global research team for the past 5 years. 
In the second quarter, this business did well. Global Markets generated $3.7 billion in sales and trading revenue, excluding DVA. Compared to the same period last year, that is up 12%. This year-over-year improvement is driven by FICC sales and trading, which is up 22%. Now think about that. Sales and trading revenue, including DVA, for this quarter was the highest second quarter we experienced in 5 years, and that led to one of the most profitable quarters for Global Markets we have seen in the past 5 years. 
Also, the team served clients well during a period of difficult volatility. So clearly, it remains a profitable, important business for us to serve clients. We're proud of how the team supported their clients through the Brexit vote and the periods of volatility related thereto. 
Another question is getting clarity on how we're transforming the business on the fee lines. Noninterest revenue was $11.2 billion this quarter. Although modestly down from second quarter '15, it was up nicely from the first quarter. There are a lot of items that run through the various lines of fees. 
First, with regard to consumer fees, we are largely done with the big card portfolio divestitures and branch divestitures. Both those impacted both card fees and banking service charges, and you can see them coming off the bottom as you look at the linked quarters. Fees now will grow with the volume of cards and accounts that are now not growing in our company. Our mortgage business is now sized appropriately for our franchise, and the fee line there Paul will talk about later but will be -- that's where it's going to be in the future. 
With regard to revenue more closely tied to markets businesses, the ups and downs in volumes of activity in sales and trading, investment banking and brokerage will move back and forth through the market. But the important thing is we have strong businesses, strong client-facing businesses in these areas, and we're getting our share of these revenue streams even while the markets ebbs and flows. 
So if we look about move from the fee line to the expense line, many of you give us credit for having managed expenses from $70 billion 5 years ago to the mid-$50 billion today. But the question is: Can we do more? And if you look at this quarter, we continue to manage expenses well. 
Noninterest expense this quarter was $13.5 billion, improving more than 3.5% -- or 3% from 2015 second quarter. This continues a trend of performance that is showing expense declining significantly on a quarterly basis quarter after quarter over the past several years. This is the lowest level that we have reported since the fourth quarter of 2008, and that's prior to the Merrill Lynch merger. 
If you look at our efficiency ratio and normalize it for the NII adjustment stated above, it would be about 62% this quarter. That's an improvement of 200 basis points from last year's second quarter. 
Cost control and cost-effectiveness is a focus for our management team here at Bank of America. So the question is: How much more can we do on expenses? So if you think about this, let's start by looking at the cost of the most recent 4 quarters. 
In the trailing 4 quarters, the total expense base was $56.3 billion. As we look out from the second -- the third quarter of 2016 through the next sick quarters -- 6 quarters into 2018, we believe that with our SIM efforts and the continued work we're doing across the board on expenses, we're targeting an annual expense number of around $53 billion in total expenses for the year 2018. So over 6 quarters, we continue to absorb investment, merit increases, rising health care costs and bringing expenses down in nominal amount. Our continued work in driving down costs to service delinquent loans will help with this, but the other reductions are generally coming from the core work in Simplify and Improve, look -- the work we continue to do to simplify those work processes but also the core work we do to allow us to self-fund our growth initiatives, our continuing investments in technology and salespeople. 
While I'm on the topic of expenses, I want to point out another important milestone for our company this quarter. This quarter, we changed our reporting to eliminate the legacy asset servicing segment. This completes transformation. This segment was the last place for product orientation, was reported not customer orientation. And more importantly, it also reflects the last of legacies really behind us from an operational basis. 
We have added a couple of slides in the appendix today to go along with our 8-K we filed a few days ago. They explain the methodology of the realignment of LAS and highlights the impact of the segment  where those loans and associated P&L are recorded now. 
But what I want to get to you -- across to you is LAS was an -- as an operational segment successfully did what it was tasked to do: to clean up one of the largest mortgage servicing businesses in the U.S. Consider that progress. From 1.4 million delinquent mortgage loans, we're down to 80,000 today. At one point, we had 58,000 teammates and 20,000 contractors working on this task, and now we're down to 10,000 teammates. 
From one peak quarter of $3 billion-plus in expenses, we're down to $600 million this quarter. That phase of the work is complete, and we need to move that operating business in with the rest of the company to do the further consolidation and further work to improve our servicing costs. We are pleased with the accomplishments of this group, but there's still more to be done. 
And that brings us to our provision. Simply point -- put, the question we often get is: Is credit deteriorating? As you can see, we remain very pleased with both consumer and commercial credit performance. Not only have not -- net charge-offs not gotten worse, but they've improved in the most recent quarter, moving back below $1 billion.  Provision expense is and will remain roughly equivalent to net charge-offs. Even on our energy portfolio, we have seen lower exposures, improved losses. 
And that brings us to our returns. In this operating environment, can we get our returns above our cost of capital? Well, as you can see, we made solid progress on our returns this quarter. Our return on tangible common equity adjusted for the market-related and DVA impacts was 10.9%. On a similarly adjusted basis, our ROA has moved to 90 basis points. We still have work to do, but you can see the improvement coming through. 
As we move to Slide 4, you can see our business segment results. You see strong year-over-year results in every business, driven by the generation of operating leverage. Consumer Banking continued its momentum around client activity and operating leverage. Consumer satisfaction continues to improve as does adoption and use of digital capabilities and functionality. 
In our wealth management business, they grew earnings as costs declined more than revenue while we continue to invest in this business. Revenue is impacted by AUM valuations from market variability. 
Our Global Banking team drove results with continued solid loan growth, operating leverage of 9% and strong credit results. Global Markets executed well for its clients, as I stated earlier, in a very difficult period and used operating leverage to grow its earnings year-over-year as well. So on a combined basis, those 4 business segments improved 16% from last year's second quarter, earning about $5 billion this quarter. 
Partially offsetting this was the loss at All Other, and that primary reflects the market-related NII adjustments I spoke about earlier. You can also see the returns and efficiency ratios for each of these segments, and note that each segment is earning well above our cost of capital. 
With that, I'm going to turn it over to Paul to take you through the numbers."
19049,333737560,1007426,"Bank of America Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 18, 2016",2016-07-18,"Earnings Calls","Bank of America Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Brian. Good morning, everyone. Since Brian covered the income statement, I will start with the balance sheet on Page 5. As you know, general deposit flows drive the size of our balance sheet, and they, on an ending basis, were relatively flat this",3631,"Thanks, Brian. Good morning, everyone. Since Brian covered the income statement, I will start with the balance sheet on Page 5. As you know, general deposit flows drive the size of our balance sheet, and they, on an ending basis, were relatively flat this quarter as inflows were partially offset by outflows to fund tax -- seasonal tax payments. 
So total assets were stable compared to Q1, with loans increasing modestly, security balances rising and cash down a corresponding amount. Liquidity also saw small decline. However, we remain well compliant with LCR requirements. 
Tangible common equity of $170 billion improved by $3.6 billion from Q1, driven by earnings and OCI. This was partially offset by $1.1 billion in share repurchases and roughly $500 million in common dividends. As a reminder, following the CCAR results, we announced an increase in both our share repurchase authorization as well as a planned increase of 50% in our quarterly dividend. On a per-share basis, tangible book value per share increased to $16.68, up 11% from Q2 '15. 
Turning to regulatory metrics. As a reminder, we report capital under the advanced approaches. Our CET1 transition ratio under Basel III ended the quarter at 10.6%. On a fully phased-in basis, CET1 capital improved $4.3 billion to $161.8 billion. Under the advanced approaches, compared to Q1 '16, the CET1 ratio increased 37 basis points to 10.5% and is above our current 2019 requirement. RWA declined roughly $13 billion, driven by reductions related to retail exposures, primarily from credit improvement. 
We also provide our capital metrics under the standardized approach. Here, our CET1 ratio improved to 11.4%. Supplementary leverage ratio for both parent and bank continued to exceed U.S. regulatory minimums that take effect in 2018. 
Turning to Slide 6. And on an average basis, total loans were up $7 billion from Q1 and $23 billion or 3% from Q2 '15. On an ending-period basis, loan growth this quarter was impacted by paydowns near the end of the quarter in the non-U.S. corporate loan facilities and about $1.6 billion in FX translations across international loans, including U.K. card. 
Note on this slide, there is a breakdown of the loans in our business segments and All Other. Again, on an average basis, year-over-year, loans in All Other were down $42 billion, driven by continued runoff of first- and second-lien mortgages while loans in our business segments were up $65 billion or 9%. 
In Consumer Banking, we continue to see strong growth in consumer real estate and vehicle lending, offset somewhat by runoff in home equity, outpacing originations. In Wealth Management, we saw growth in consumer real estate and structured lending. Global Banking loans were up $35 billion or 12% year-over-year and up 7% annualized from Q1. 
Deposits were stable with Q1 at $1.2 trillion but grew $67 billion or 6% from Q2 '15. Broad-based growth was led by consumer, increasing more than $44 billion or 8% year-over-year, while Wealth Management deposits grow 6% and deposits with corporate clients in Global Banking improved nearly 4%. 
Turning to asset quality on Slide 7. We saw improvement from Q1. Total net charge-offs improved $83 million from Q1 to less than $1 billion in Q2. Consumer losses declined modestly across a number of products, and while slight, commercial losses also declined from Q1 as a result of lower energy losses. Provision of $976 million in Q2 was down $21 million from Q1. Finally, we had a small overall net reserve release in the quarter as consumer releases were modestly offset by builds in commercial. 
On Slide 8, we provide credit quality data on our consumer portfolio. Net charge-offs declined $68 million from Q1. While driven by lower real estate losses, the improvement, as I mentioned, was broad-based. Over half of the losses in this book are U.S. credit card, with a loss rate improved 5 basis points from Q1 to 2.66%. Delinquency levels and NPLs improved, and reserve coverage remains strong. 
Moving to the commercial credit on Slide 9. Net charge-offs improved $15 million from Q1 as energy losses declined. Energy charge-offs decreased $23 million from Q1 to $79 million this quarter. There isn't a lot of new news on the commercial asset quality front other than the modest improvement in our energy-related exposure. 
As you all know, the price of oil and gas was more stable in Q2. Within this backdrop, we experienced some improvement in both energy losses and exposure. A few clients we've financed with equity issuances and other financing solutions, which also helped improve exposures. 
Overall, our committed energy exposure declined $3 billion from Q1, with utilized exposure declining more modestly. And exposure to exploration and production as well as oil field services, which we believe are the 2 higher-risk subsectors, declined 1% from Q1. Outside of energy, commercial asset quality continues to perform well. 
Let me share with you a few metrics that exhibit the quality of this book and its performance. The reservable criticized exposure ratio is 3.8%, and excluding energy and metals and mining, exposure is 2.4%, which is near prerecession levels. The commercial net charge-off ratio, excluding small business, has been below 15 basis points for 14 consecutive quarters even with the elevated levels of energy charge-offs we experienced over the past 3 quarters. The NPL ratio, which today is at 37 basis points, has been below 40 basis points for 11 consecutive quarters. 
Turning to Slide 10. Net interest income on a reported non-FTE basis was $9.2 billion. Included in NII this quarter was a negative $974 million market-related adjustments to true up bond premium amortization. This follows Q1's more negative adjustment of $1.2 billion, and it's important to note that the adjustment in Q2 '15 was a benefit of $669 million. 
NII on an FTE basis, excluding market-related adjustments, was $10.4 billion. This was lower than Q1 primarily due to the lower long-end rates and Q1's seasonal impacts. Compared to Q2 '15, results were up nearly $400 million or 4% as higher short-end rates, combined with loan growth funded by deposits, offset the negative impact of lower long-end rates. 
Looking forward to Q3. We will benefit from an extra day, which will be offset by the impact of declines in long-end rates over the past 2 quarters and put pressure on our NBS bond yields and reinvestment yields more generally. As we get into Q4 and the next year, we get more optimistic about NII, assuming both the current forward curve and the current pace of loan and deposit growth. With respect to asset sensitivity, as of 6/30, an instantaneous 100 basis point parallel increase in rates is estimated to increase NII by $7.5 billion over the subsequent 12 months, driven by the increase in long-end rates. 
Now we think it's also important to understand what we expect to happen to NII if rates don't rise.  Referring to the bottom left of the slide, the adjusted NII has been fairly stable, averaging between $10.3 billion and $10.4 billion over the past 5 quarters. If we have stability in long-end rates, we would expect to maintain that level in the near term, again assuming modest loan and deposit growth. Rates moving up or down from here would obviously impact that perspective slightly in the near term but building as we extend that scenario into future quarters and years. 
Turning to Slide 11. Noninterest expense was $13.5 billion in the quarter. That is $0.5 billion or 3% lower than Q2 '15, driven by good expense discipline across the company. As you can see, we are presenting expenses a little bit differently now that we have eliminated the LAS segment. Having said that, we made steady progress on reducing legacy loan servicing costs this quarter, and we still expect to achieve our original goal of lowering the former LAS segment costs ex-litigation to $500 million in Q4. 
Q2 litigation expense was $270 million, which was higher by $95 million in Q1 '15. So year-over-year, expense improvement ex-litigation was actually $600 million. Nearly every category of cost was lower year-over-year. It was led by personnel, including the expiration of the fully amortized advisory awards and the revenue-related incentive mostly in wealth management, while the rest of the improvement I would characterize as just good, hard work, grinding expenses lower through SIM and other initiatives. 
While the rate of decline has been slowing, our employee base is down 3% from Q2 '15. As the employee base continues to grind lower, we think it's important to point out that the reductions on a percentage basis now include more highly paid managerial associates. So while the rate of FTE reduction has slowed, the relationship to expense reductions is not linear. 
Also, we continue to increase the number of client-facing associates to drive growth while, at the same time, through SIM and other efforts, simplifying and streamlining activities and thereby reduce non-client-facing positions. Lastly, as I said last quarter, we expect our quarterly FDIC expense to increase approximately $100 million for a number of quarters starting in Q3 '16. 
Turning to the business segments and starting with Consumer Banking on Slide 12. Consumer earned $1.7 billion, continuing its trend of solid improvement and reporting a robust 20% return on allocated capital. Revenue and earnings were driven by deposits and loan growth, coupled with continued expense improvement driving operating leverage. As a result of this operating leverage, the efficiency [ph] ratio improved roughly 360 basis points year-over-year. Note that the lack of reserve releases this quarter versus a meaningful release last year mitigated some of the improvement in the operating leverage. So while earnings were up 3% year-over-year, pretax preprovision earnings rose 11%. 
On Slide 13, we focus on additional key Consumer Banking trends. First, in the upper left, the stats are a reminder of our strong competitive position. Revenue increased by $107 million as NII growth more than offset lower noninterest income. Net interest income continued to improve as we drove deposits and loans higher. Noninterest income was down due mostly to lower mortgage banking income. This decline is in part a result of selling fewer loans and instead holding more on our balance sheet, thereby shifting mortgage banking income to NII. 
Expense declined 5% from Q2 '15. The positive expense trend is a result of a number of initiatives. As an example, I would note that our growth in mobile banking continues to play an important role in helping us optimize our delivery network while improving customer satisfaction. Our cost of deposits as a percent of average deposits also continued to improve and now stands at 162 basis points. 
Focusing on client balances on the bottom of the page, Merrill Lynch brokerage assets at $132 billion are up 8% versus Q2 '15 on strong account flows, partially offset by lower market valuations. We increased the number of Merrill Lynch customers by 10% from Q2 '15. We now have more than 1.6 million households using our platform for self-directed trading. 
Moving across the bottom right of the page, note that loans are up 5% from Q2 '15 on strong mortgage and vehicle lending growth. Average vehicle loans are up 20% from Q2 '15, with average book FICO scores remaining well above the 770 level and net losses remaining below 30 basis points and improving on a linked-quarter basis. Mortgage loan growth was aided by solid mortgage production of $16 billion, up modestly from Q2 '15 as customers took advantage of historically low interest rates. 
On consumer card -- or I should say on U.S. consumer card, we issued more than 1.3 million cards in the quarter, which is the highest level since 2008.  Average balances were modestly down. However, adjusting for divestitures, average card balances grew $1.4 billion compared to Q2 '15. Scanning -- spending on credit cards, adjusted for divestitures, was up 7.5% compared to Q2 '15. As reviewed in previous quarters, we continue to focus on originating high-FICO loans, which generally produce low loss rates and strong risk-adjusted margins. 
Last quarter, we highlighted the quality of our underwriting in the consumer business. This quarter, we are highlighting our leading position in digital banking. This technology continues to reshape how our customers bank. Importantly, as adoption rises, particularly around transaction processing and self-service, we see improved efficiency and customer satisfaction. 
We added more than 2.5 million new mobile customers in the past 12 months. With more than 20 million active users, deposits from mobile devices now represent 17% of deposit transactions. Mobile customers on average process 280,000 deposits per day, an increase of 28% year-over-year and the equivalent volume of 800 financial centers. 
Mobile sales are up nearly 50% from last year. We are promoting mobile sales and electronic adoption by deploying digital ambassadors in our financial centers. We now have more than 3,500 digital ambassadors in our branches engaging with customers who come into the branch to transact. They educate these customers on alternatives to branch banking, which are not only more convenient for them but also more efficient for us. 
Digital sales, appointments and satisfaction all continue to achieve new highs. Also, as you know, we are a leader in person-to-person and person-to-business money movement through digital transfers and bill payment capabilities. The adoption and popularity of these capabilities continues to drive growth, with record volume of $246 billion this quarter, up nearly 5% year-over-year. 
Turning to Slide 15. Global Wealth and Investment Management produced earnings of $722 million, up 8% from Q2 '15. Year-over-year, revenue was down modestly but expenses were down even more, improving pretax margin to 26%, up meaningfully from Q2 '15. This quarter included a modest gain from the previously announced sale of Bank of America Global Capital Management. This reduced AUM comprised of short-term liquid assets by approximately $80 billion. 
Overall, revenue declined 2% from Q2 '15 as strong NII growth and the gain were more than offset by lower market-sensitive revenue. Asset management revenues declined from Q2 '15 on lower market values while improving modestly on a linked-quarter basis. Transactional revenue was down and continues to be impacted by market uncertainty as well as the migration of activity from brokerage to managed relationships. 
NII benefited from solid deposit and loan growth. Noninterest expense declined nearly $200 million or 6% from Q2 '15, with half of that benefit derived from the expiration of the amortization of advisory retention awards that were put in place at the time of the Merrill Lynch merger. The rest of the improvement was a result of lower revenue-related incentives and other support costs. 
Moving to Slide 16. Despite volatile markets, we continued to see overall solid client engagement. Client balances at $2.4 trillion were down from Q1, but excluding the sale I mentioned earlier, were up from Q1 as higher market valuation levels, $10 billion of long-term AUM flows and loan growth more than offset tax-related deposit outflows. 
Driven by the expected seasonality, average deposits were down from Q1 as clients paid income taxes. Importantly, average deposits are up 6% from Q2 '15, driven by growth in the second half of 2015. Average loans also grew this quarter. Growth was concentrated in consumer real estate and structured lending as well. 
Turning to Slide 17. Global Banking earned $1.5 billion, producing solid improvement over both Q1 and year-over-year. Returns on allocated capital was 16%, a 200 basis point improvement from Q2 '15 despite adding $2 billion in allocated capital. Double-digit percent revenue growth year-over-year offset a low single-digit expense growth, creating strong operating leverage that improved the efficiency ratio to 45%. Global Banking continues to drive solid loan growth within its risk and client frameworks, producing solid year-over-year improvement in NII. 
Revenue benefited this quarter from mark-to-market gains on our FPO loan portfolio due to recovery in certain energy and mining exposures. Higher treasury fees and leasing gains also aided the improvement from Q2 '15. While total investment banking fees for the firm were down from Q2 '15, Global Banking gained a little share supported by M&A fees, which were up on an absolute basis. A modest increase in noninterest expense compared to Q2 '15 reflects the cost of adding sales professionals over the past 12 months and a modest increase in incentive related due to the higher revenue. 
Looking at trends on Page 18 and comparing Q2 last year. Clients were comforted -- excuse me, clients were confronted with increased volatility once again this quarter with concerns around both global growth as well as the outcome of the U.K. referendum. However, despite concerns, companies still need to finance as well as to move their money, and this is when the strength and diversity of our franchise is most appreciated by our clients. 
Average loans on a year-over-year basis grew $35 billion or 12%. Growth was broad-based across large corporates as well as middle-market borrowers and spread across most products. Having said that, we slowed our construction-led commercial real estate lending a few quarters ago. Average deposits increased from Q2 '15, up $11 billion or 4% from both new and existing clients. 
Switching to Global Markets on Slide 19. The past couple of quarters are great examples of the importance of this segment to not only its clients around the world, but also to its -- to our customers and clients in all our business segments. Customers and clients were able to live their financial lives better in Q2 because Global Markets delivered for them under challenging market conditions, helping them raise capital, buy and sell securities as well as manage risks. 
We believe we increased our relevance with clients during Q2 and, more specifically, during the market volatility after the U.K. referendum. We did this by showing them that we will be there for them when they need us most, that we are there for them with consistent set of products and services at terms that makes sense for our clients and our shareholders and there for them with thoughtful advice as well as the capabilities, strength and confidence to make markets and execute. All of these resulted in Global Markets reporting earnings of $1.1 billion and a return on capital of 12%, 13% excluding net DVA impact. 
Revenue was up appreciably year-over-year as well as linked quarter. Total revenue, excluding DVA, was up 8% year-over-year on solid sales and trading results and up 18% over a Q1 that saw challenging market conditions. Strong expense management drove expenses 6% lower year-over-year even while revenue was higher. 
Moving to trends on the next slide and focusing on the components of our sales and trading performance. Sales and trading revenue of $3.7 billion, excluding net DVA, was up 12% from Q2 '15, driven by FICC. In terms of revenue, this was the best second quarter we have had in the past 5 years. 
Excluding DVA and versus Q2 '15, FICC sales and trading of $2.6 billion increased 22% as the improvement which began in late Q1 continue through Q2 as global concerns abated and central banks took further monetary policy actions. Improvement was across both macro and credit products, driven by stronger rates and currency, client activity as well as improved credit market conditions. Tighter spreads benefited mortgage trading, and municipal bonds outperformed treasuries with strong retail demand. Equity sales and trading was $1.1 billion, declining 8% versus Q2 '15, which saw significant client activity in Asia, driven by stock market rallies in the region. 
On Slide 21, we show All Other, which reported a loss of $815 billion (sic) [ $815 million ]. This loss was driven by the current quarter's $974 million market-related NII adjustment. The loss is lower than Q1 due to both a lower market-related NII adjustment as well as the absent (sic) [ absence] of retirement-eligible incentive costs. 
Compared to Q2 '15, the difference is driven by a number of factors: first, a negative NII market-related adjustment in this quarter versus a large positive adjustment in Q2 '15. Second, we had reps and warranty recoveries in Q2 '15 related to a court ruling and gains on the sale of consumer real estate loans. Third, provision expense declined from Q2 '15, driven by continued portfolio improvement. 
The effective tax rate for the quarter was about 29%, which is in line with what we expect for the remainder of the year, absent any unusual items. And as a reminder, we still expect to record a tax charge of about $350 million, most likely in 3Q, that reduces the carrying value of our U.K. DTAs as a result of U.K. tax reform announced last year. The vast majority of this charge will not impact regulatory capital. 
Okay. So let me offer a few takeaways as I finish. Q2 was another quarter of solid progress in a challenging global environment. While growth concerns persist in many countries, the U.S. economy continues to steadily improve, albeit at a less-than-optimum pace. The diversity and strength of our franchise makes us more relevant to clients and customers during times such as these, and you can see that in our results. 
Clearly, interest rates affected our financial performance this quarter. Still, while we cannot control interest rates, we are not waiting for them to rise. We grew in this environment by focusing on the things that we can control and drive. We grew deposits. We grew loans. We managed risk well, reflected in reduced charge-offs. We delivered for customer clients in another challenging quarter, especially around the U.K. referendum. We invested in our future by adding sales professionals and continuing to deploy technology that improves customer satisfaction. We returned capital to shareholders, and we announced plans to return increasing amounts. And we did all of this while we lowered expenses and drove operating leverage. 
Thank you. With that, let's open it up for questions."

I will definitely answer your question, but I want to emphasize again we're talking about LTM $56 billion going to $53 billion and absorbing in that merit, health care, inflation and other investment. And the first thing I would point out as you sort of think about the credibility of that, look at what we accomplished over the last 5 years. In Q2 '11 to Q2 '16, we've reduced quarterly expenses by $4.8 billion. That's a $19 billion annualized run rate, so -- and we did this by not only reducing legacy mortgage-related expenses, which were only -- make up about $2 billion of that $4.8 billion, but just through good expense management in every major category across the company. So from here, it's about a number of things. A lot of those things have been identified through our Simplify and Improve initiative. We're investing in technology and capabilities to improve efficiency. The most obvious example of that you can see is in the increasing adoption of customers for digital channels. But I do want to emphasize that it is about making progress across the entire company from our leaders and our teams. So if you look in consumer, there are examples, the digital adoption, we've got mobile users up 15% to over 20 million. When they make a deposit, that's 1/10 the cost. We've got digital sales up 12% year-over-year. We've got more customers using digital statements. A lot more work to do there with the transition from paper to electronic. We are optimizing the coverage model in both consumer and GWIM, and they all have goals. We all have goals and initiatives around controllable expenses, including travel, supply, support costs. If you look at Global Banking and Global Markets, we're simplifying our legal entity structure and business model. We're integrating wholesale credit origination and processing across the lines of businesses. We're centralizing data platforms. We're expanding electronic abilities. And we're optimizing the coverage model. So there's a lot going on. And we're going to need all of it to get to our goals."

You can see that even in markets, year-over-year we're down 7% in people, where revenue went up [ph]. So it's electronification of the fixed income platform and the equities platform continuing down that road. So every single area is moving here. And then you also have to think about the stability of the platform. This company has now been operating with a consistent strategy and a consistent ability to execute for many years. And what's gone with the legacy and stuff, that just allows us to keep operating on ourselves. And we always have performed best in history when we had that period of time of no acquisitions, no divestitures, no legacy asset servicing. So we're very confident that it'll happen. On revenue, I'd say look at it -- year-over-year, look at it linked quarter, so last 3 or 4 quarters, you're seeing revenue stable. And while it bounces around with market activity in a given quarter, the core revenue continues to go forward and the expenses keep coming down on a core basis. So we're comfortable that -- there's nothing -- we won't allow our people under our responsible growth to give us cost saves and not grow the business. So it has to be sustainable. It has to be actually taking out real work and yet still investing in more client-facing teammates, more salespeople and more technology capabilities for customers."

But the charge-offs were running tens of billions of dollars more a year than we have now. So a lot of that revenue was just going off the back end. So if you look at it from a risk-adjusted basis, I think we grew from the low 60s to the low 80s over the last 5 or 6 years. So that is actually the work that gets done. So we could -- going back to the point, we focus on very high credit quality, so we keep that credit cost moving in the right direction or stable when the world's gone a different way. We don't have a target efficiency ratio. You can calculate one -- off that out in '18 because as we talked about earlier, the NII differences will be driven by where rates go to some degree. But the idea is we're going to take expenses from $56 billion in the last 4 quarters to $53 billion. We think that's where we'll get them to. And if rates stay stable or go off a little bit, you'll see a lower efficiency ratio. Right now, we're running about 62% this quarter, fairly stated. And we think we can push it down from there."

I just want to walk -- [indiscernible] I'll just say I just want to walk to kind of why it's down, and then we could talk a little bit about going forward. So kind of 4 items. First, we sold an appraisal business last year. So there was revenue in last year's second quarter that isn't in this quarter. Second, we had some servicing sales in the second quarter of last year for a gain that we didn't have this quarter. Third and probably most significant from a revenue perspective is that we had the ACE decision in the second quarter last year. So we released last year some reps and warranties. And that was a significant amount of benefit last year. And then fourth and probably strategically most important and the point you're getting to is we are selling less mortgages, choosing instead to hold them on our balance sheet. And obviously, this decreases MBI but increases NII over time, so -- and plus you have to note that as we just talked about, servicing -- bad servicing is going to continue to run off. So if servicing is running off and not being replaced as fast, if we're holding more mortgages on the balance sheet as we transition from MBI to NII, you could see that line continue sort of trend lower. In terms of the mortgages, I think in the short term, it's going to be fairly stable and that trend is going to -- this is a good base this quarter. It's a good base to sort of start from. I think that trend lower is going to be in some quarters very slow because, as you point out, other items -- other line items a little bit messy and bounce around there, depending on what happens on interest rates. But that's the trend. In terms of what we're trying to accomplish, all of the loans we originate that are nonconforming, we would like to keep on our balance sheet. And even the conforming loans that have a certain characteristic, we're going to be holding on our balance sheet. So right now, that's around 75-ish percent of the loans we're originating are going on our balance sheet. Is that helpful?"

Any amount of deposit that doesn't go to our clients and customers, we're sticking in the securities portfolio and getting as much yield as we can get there within the constraints of liquidity and capital risk and interest rate risk.

In other words, there's these bubble charts which show what will happen to net interest income if interest rates go up 100 basis points. There's nothing which says what happens to earnings if you see a 5% increase in loans. In other words, what is more important? I mean, in the old days, people would show these charts if you hold interest rates flat and volume goes up. What happens to earnings if you get a 5% increase in lending as a result of interest rates staying so low?"

And good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us to review our second quarter results. I'm beginning on Slide 2 of the materials we sent to you. We reported solid earnings of $4.2 billion after tax or $0.36 per diluted share in w",2188,"Thank you, Lee. And good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us to review our second quarter results. I'm beginning on Slide 2 of the materials we sent to you. 
We reported solid earnings of $4.2 billion after tax or $0.36 per diluted share in what was certainly an eventful quarter for the markets from an overall macro perspective. This compares to $5.1 billion or $0.43 per share in the year-ago quarter. This quarter included negative market-related NII adjustments that cost $0.05 per share and negative DVA that cost us another $0.01 for a total of $0.06. That compares to a $0.03 benefit to EPS for both those items in the second quarter of 2015. 
Earnings neutralizing for the FAS 91 DVA for both periods improved from $0.40 per share to $0.42 per share on a year-over-year basis. Our results represent another quarter of solid progress in the strategies we have been executing. Those strategies are delivering more of the company's capabilities to each and every client we serve. 
At BAC, we focus on what we can control, and despite low rates and other macro events, we continue to focus on managing our risk, our costs and our delivery of quality products and customer service.  In Q2, we grew loans $22 billion or approximately 2.5% versus last year, even as we sold a few portfolios during the year. All this growth was organic and consistent with our risk appetite. 
We also grew deposits more than $66 billion or 6% over that same time period, and we did so while maintaining disciplined deposit pricing. 
We also continue to transform our company in a digital way in all things, in all businesses. For example, this quarter we crossed over 20 million active mobile users and continue to increase their use of digital channels for both transactions and buying more bank products. Active mobile banking customers logged into their accounts over 900 million times this quarter, depositing more than 25 million checks or more than $20 billion via mobile check deposits. They made over 25 million mobile bill payments, up 30% year-over-year, and made nearly 80 million transfers. 
Person-to-person or P2P payments continue to ramp up as well. While still a small component of the overall consumer payments this quarter, we had $6.7 billion in P2P payments this quarter. That is more than $13 billion year-to-date, and is up 28% from last year. This channel is a value channel for all our customers and made possible by the continued investment we make. 
As we move to Slide 3, we have talked to you -- a lot of you over the last several months, including many of you on the phone today. I thought I'd try to address some of the more common questions we get from those conversations by looking at our results, by looking at the income statement and the items therein. First, one of the core questions is: What if rates stay lower for longer? Well, for bank management and for you as investors, it would be easier if rates were to rise, but that hasn't happened. 
So the question is: Can we grow earnings without rates improving? We believe we surely can. We can do that by continuous success on things like expense management, by keeping NII stable to growing, stable and growing fees and continue to manage risk well and hold down our credit costs. 
As you can see, revenue this quarter was $20.6 billion on an FTE basis. Adjusted for the negative impacts of market-related NII adjustments and DVA, that number is $21.8 billion. Adjusted for the same items in the year-ago quarter, the total was comparable. 
Now as we focus in on NII, Paul will take you through some of the changes this quarter later in the presentation. However, in summary, adjusted for market-related changes in both last year's second quarter and this year's second quarter, we grew NII by $400 million or 4% year-over-year, and that took place while the 10-year treasury yield fell 86 basis points from last year on a spot basis. Going forward, in a stable interest rate environment, we believe we can maintain NII around the second quarter 2016 level based on the current loan and deposit growth we see. And if rates rise, we would expect NII to grow. 
Another question relates to the Global Markets business. That question is often asked how we need to change this business, especially the FICC area, as many of our customers have. I want to hit this head on. 
First of all, fixed income is a good business for us here at Bank of America. It is a business which benefits not only by its core activities but by coupled -- being coupled with our massive Global Banking franchise that has leadership positions across the globe. Combined together, they generate a pretty steady $1 billion-or-so quarterly investment banking fees. It's also an important part of our overall Global Markets platform, the platform which sits on top of the #1 global research team for the past 5 years. 
In the second quarter, this business did well. Global Markets generated $3.7 billion in sales and trading revenue, excluding DVA. Compared to the same period last year, that is up 12%. This year-over-year improvement is driven by FICC sales and trading, which is up 22%. Now think about that. Sales and trading revenue, including DVA, for this quarter was the highest second quarter we experienced in 5 years, and that led to one of the most profitable quarters for Global Markets we have seen in the past 5 years. 
Also, the team served clients well during a period of difficult volatility. So clearly, it remains a profitable, important business for us to serve clients. We're proud of how the team supported their clients through the Brexit vote and the periods of volatility related thereto. 
Another question is getting clarity on how we're transforming the business on the fee lines. Noninterest revenue was $11.2 billion this quarter. Although modestly down from second quarter '15, it was up nicely from the first quarter. There are a lot of items that run through the various lines of fees. 
First, with regard to consumer fees, we are largely done with the big card portfolio divestitures and branch divestitures. Both those impacted both card fees and banking service charges, and you can see them coming off the bottom as you look at the linked quarters. Fees now will grow with the volume of cards and accounts that are now net growing in our company. Our mortgage business is now sized appropriately for our franchise, and the fee line there Paul will talk about later, but will be -- is at near where it's going to be in the future. 
With regard to revenue more closely tied to markets businesses, the ups and downs in volumes of activity in sales and trading, investment banking and brokerage will move back and forth with the market. But the important thing is we have strong businesses, strong client-facing businesses in these areas, and we're getting our share of these revenue streams even while the markets ebbs and flows. 
So if we look about move from the fee line to the expense line, many of you give us credit for having managed expenses from $70 billion 5 years ago to the mid-$50 billion today. But the question is: Can we do more? And if you look at this quarter, we continue to manage expenses well. 
Noninterest expense this quarter was $13.5 billion, improving more than 3.5% -- or 3% from 2015 second quarter. This continues a trend of performance that is showing expense declining significantly on a quarterly basis quarter after quarter over the past several years. This is the lowest level that we have reported since the fourth quarter of 2008, and that's prior to the Merrill Lynch merger. 
If you look at our efficiency ratio and normalize it for the NII adjustment stated above, it would be about 62% this quarter. That's an improvement of 200 basis points from last year's second quarter. 
Cost control and cost effectiveness is a focus for our management team here at Bank of America. So the question is: How much more can we do on expenses? So if you think about this, let's start by looking at the cost over the most recent 4 quarters. 
In the trailing 4 quarters, the total expense base was $56.3 billion. As we look out from the second -- the third quarter of 2016 through the next 6 quarters into 2018, we believe that with our SIM efforts and the continued work we're doing across the board on expenses, we're targeting an annual expense number of around $53 billion in total expenses for the year 2018. So over 6 quarters, we continue to absorb investment, merit increases, rising health care costs and bringing expenses down a nominal amount. Our continued work in driving down costs to service delinquent loans will help with this, but the other reductions are generally coming from the core work in Simplify and Improve, look -- the work we continue to do to simplify those work processes but also the core work we do to allow us to self-fund our growth initiatives, our continuing investments in technology and salespeople. 
While I'm on the topic of expenses, I want to point out another important milestone for our company this quarter. This quarter, we changed our reporting to eliminate the legacy asset servicing segment. This completes the transformation. This segment was the last place where product orientation was reported, not customer orientation. And more importantly, it also reflects the last of the legacies really behind us from an operational basis. 
We have added a couple of slides in the appendix today to go along with our 8-K we filed a few days ago. They explain the methodology of the realignment of LAS and highlights the impact of the segment where those loans and associated P&L are recorded now. 
But what I want to get to you -- across to you is LAS was an -- as an operational segment successfully did what it was tasked to do: to clean up one of the largest mortgage servicing businesses in the U.S. Consider that progress. From 1.4 million delinquent mortgage loans, we're down to 80,000 today. At one point, we had 58,000 teammates and 20,000 contractors working on this task, and now we're down to 10,000 teammates. 
From one peak quarter of $3 billion-plus in expenses, we're down to $600 million this quarter. That phase of the work is complete, and we need to move that operating business in with the rest of the company to do the further consolidation and further work to improve our servicing costs. We are pleased with the accomplishments of this group, but there's still more to be done. 
And that brings us to our provision. Simply point -- put, the question we often get is: Is credit deteriorating? As you can see, we remain very pleased with both consumer and commercial credit performance. Not only have not -- net charge-offs not gotten worse, but they've improved in the most recent quarter, moving back below $1 billion.  Provision expense is and will remain roughly equivalent to net charge-offs. Even in our energy portfolio, we have seen lower exposures and improved losses. 
And that brings us to our returns. In this operating environment, can we get our returns above our cost of capital? Well, as you can see, we made solid progress on our returns this quarter. Our return on tangible common equity adjusted for the market-related and DVA impacts was 10.9%. On a similarly adjusted basis, our ROA has moved to 90 basis points. We still have work to do, but you can see the improvement coming through. 
As we move to Slide 4, you can see our business segment results. You see strong year-over-year results in every business, driven by the generation of operating leverage. Consumer Banking continued its momentum around client activity and operating leverage. Consumer satisfaction continues to improve as does adoption and use of digital capabilities and functionality. 
In our wealth management business, they grew earnings as costs declined more than revenue while we continue to invest in this business. Revenue is impacted by AUM valuations from market variability. 
Our Global Banking team drove results with continued solid loan growth, operating leverage of 9% and strong credit results. Global Markets executed well for its clients, as I stated earlier, in a very difficult period, and used operating leverage to grow its earnings year-over-year as well. So on a combined basis, those 4 business segments improved 16% from last year's second quarter, earning about $5 billion this quarter. 
Partially offsetting this was the loss at All Other, and that primarily reflects the market-related NII adjustments I spoke about earlier. You can also see the returns and efficiency ratios for each of these segments, and note that each segment is earning well above our cost of capital. 
With that, I'm going to turn it over to Paul to take you through the numbers."

Good morning, everyone. Since Brian covered the income statement, I will start with the balance sheet on Page 5. As you know, general deposit flows drive the size of our balance sheet, and they, on an ending basis, were relatively flat this",3634,"Thanks, Brian. Good morning, everyone. Since Brian covered the income statement, I will start with the balance sheet on Page 5. As you know, general deposit flows drive the size of our balance sheet, and they, on an ending basis, were relatively flat this quarter, as inflows were partially offset by outflows to fund tax -- seasonal tax payments. 
So total assets were stable compared to Q1, with loans increasing modestly, security balances rising and cash down a corresponding amount. Liquidity also saw a small decline. However, we remain well compliant with LCR requirements. 
Tangible common equity of $170 billion improved by $3.6 billion from Q1, driven by earnings and OCI. This was partially offset by $1.1 billion in share repurchases and roughly $500 million in common dividends. As a reminder, following the CCAR results, we announced an increase in both our share repurchase authorization as well as a planned increase of 50% in our quarterly dividend. On a per-share basis, tangible book value per share increased to $16.68, up 11% from Q2 '15. 
Turning to regulatory metrics. As a reminder, we report capital under the advanced approaches. Our CET1 transition ratio under Basel III ended the quarter at 10.6%. On a fully phased-in basis, CET1 capital improved $4.3 billion to $161.8 billion. Under the advanced approaches, compared to Q1 '16, the CET1 ratio increased 37 basis points to 10.5% and is above our current 2019 requirement. RWA declined roughly $13 billion, driven by reductions related to retail exposures, primarily from credit improvement. 
We also provide our capital metrics under the standardized approach. Here, our CET1 ratio improved to 11.4%. Supplementary leverage ratio for both parent and bank continued to exceed U.S. regulatory minimums that take effect in 2018. 
Turning to Slide 6. And on an average basis, total loans were up $7 billion from Q1 and $23 billion or 3% from Q2 '15. On an ending-period basis, loan growth this quarter was impacted by paydowns near the end of the quarter in the non-U.S. corporate loan facilities and about $1.6 billion in FX translations across international loans, including U.K. card. 
Note on this slide, there is a breakdown of the loans in our business segments and All Other. Again, on an average basis, year-over-year, loans in All Other were down $42 billion, driven by continued runoff of first- and second-lien mortgages while loans in our business segments were up $65 billion or 9%. 
In Consumer Banking, we continue to see strong growth in consumer real estate and vehicle lending, offset somewhat by runoff in home equity outpacing originations. In Wealth Management, we saw growth in consumer real estate and structured lending. Global Banking loans were up $35 billion or 12% year-over-year and up 7% annualized from Q1. 
Deposits were stable with Q1 at $1.2 trillion but grew $67 billion or 6% from Q2 '15. Broad-based growth was led by consumer, increasing more than $44 billion or 8% year-over-year, while Wealth Management deposits grow 6% and deposits with corporate clients in Global Banking improved nearly 4%. 
Turning to asset quality on Slide 7. We saw improvement from Q1. Total net charge-offs improved $83 million from Q1 to less than $1 billion in Q2. Consumer losses declined modestly across a number of products, and while slight, commercial losses also declined from Q1 as a result of lower energy losses. Provision of $976 million in Q2 was down $21 million from Q1. Finally, we had a small overall net reserve release in the quarter, as consumer releases were modestly offset by builds in commercial. 
On Slide 8, we provide credit quality data on our consumer portfolio. Net charge-offs declined $68 million from Q1. While driven by lower real estate losses, the improvement, as I mentioned, was broad based. Over half of the losses in this book are U.S. credit card, with a loss rate improved 5 basis points from Q1 to 2.66%. Delinquency levels and NPLs improved, and reserve coverage remains strong. 
Moving to the commercial credit on Slide 9. Net charge-offs improved $15 million from Q1 as energy losses declined. Energy charge-offs decreased $23 million from Q1 to $79 million this quarter. There isn't a lot of new news on the commercial asset quality front other than the modest improvement in our energy-related exposure. 
As you all know, the price of oil and gas was more stable in Q2. Within this backdrop, we experienced some improvement in both energy losses and exposure. A few clients we've financed with equity issuances and other financing solutions, which also helped improve exposures. 
Overall, our committed energy exposure declined $3 billion from Q1, with utilized exposure declining more modestly. And exposure to exploration and production as well as oil field services, which we believe are the 2 higher-risk subsectors, declined 1% from Q1. Outside of energy, commercial asset quality continues to perform well. 
Let me share with you a few metrics that exhibit the quality of this book and its performance. The reservable criticized exposure ratio is 3.8%, and excluding energy and metals and mining, exposure is 2.4%, which is near prerecession levels. The commercial net charge-off ratio, excluding small business, has been below 15 basis points for 14 consecutive quarters even with the elevated levels of energy charge-offs we experienced over the past 3 quarters. The NPL ratio, which today is at 37 basis points, has been below 40 basis points for 11 consecutive quarters. 
Turning to Slide 10. Net interest income on a reported non-FTE basis was $9.2 billion. Included in NII this quarter was a negative $974 million market-related adjustment to true-up bond premium amortization. This follows Q1's more negative adjustment of $1.2 billion, and it's important to note that the adjustment in Q2 '15 was a benefit of $669 million. 
NII on an FTE basis, excluding market-related adjustments, was $10.4 billion. This was lower than Q1 primarily due to the lower long-end rates and Q1's seasonal impacts. Compared to Q2 '15, results were up nearly $400 million or 4% as higher short-end rates, combined with loan growth funded by deposits, offset the negative impact of lower long-end rates. 
Looking forward to Q3. We will benefit from an extra day, which will be offset by the impact of declines in long-end rates over the past 2 quarters and put pressure on our NBS bond yields and reinvestment yields more generally. As we get into Q4 and the next year, we get more optimistic about NII, assuming both the current forward curve and the current pace of loan and deposit growth. With respect to asset sensitivity, as of 6/30, an instantaneous 100 basis point parallel increase in rates is estimated to increase NII by $7.5 billion over the subsequent 12 months, driven by the increase in long-end rates. 
Now we think it's also important to understand what we expect to happen to NII if rates don't rise.  Referring to the bottom left of the slide, the adjusted NII has been fairly stable, averaging between $10.3 billion and $10.4 billion over the past 5 quarters. If we have stability in long-end rates, we would expect to maintain that level in the near term, again assuming modest loan and deposit growth. Rates moving up or down from here would obviously impact that perspective slightly in the near term, but building as we extend that scenario into future quarters and years. 
Turning to Slide 11. Noninterest expense was $13.5 billion in the quarter. That is $0.5 billion or 3% lower than Q2 '15, driven by good expense discipline across the company. As you can see, we are presenting expenses a little bit differently now that we have eliminated the LAS segment. Having said that, we made steady progress on reducing legacy loan servicing costs this quarter, and we still expect to achieve our original goal of lowering the former LAS segment costs ex-litigation to $500 million in Q4. 
Q2 litigation expense was $270 million, which was higher by $95 million in Q1 '15. So year-over-year, expense improvement ex-litigation was actually $600 million. Nearly every category of cost was lower year-over-year. It was led by personnel, including the expiration of the fully amortized advisory awards and the revenue-related incentive, mostly in wealth management, while the rest of the improvement I would characterize as just good, hard work, grinding expenses lower through SIM and other initiatives. 
While the rate of decline has been slowing, our employee base is down 3% from Q2 '15. As the employee base continues to grind lower, we think it's important to point out that the reductions on a percentage basis now include more highly paid managerial associates. So while the rate of FTE reduction has slowed, the relationship to expense reductions is not linear. 
Also, we continue to increase the number of client-facing associates to drive growth while, at the same time, through SIM and other efforts, simplifying and streamlining activities and thereby reduce non-client-facing positions. Lastly, as I said last quarter, we expect our quarterly FDIC expense to increase approximately $100 million for a number of quarters, starting in Q3 '16. 
Turning to the business segments and starting with Consumer Banking on Slide 12. Consumer earned $1.7 billion, continuing its trend of solid improvement and reporting a robust 20% return on allocated capital. Revenue and earnings were driven by deposits and loan growth, coupled with continued expense improvement driving operating leverage. As a result of this operating leverage, the efficiency ratio improved roughly 360 basis points year-over-year. Note that the lack of reserve releases this quarter versus a meaningful release last year mitigated some of the improvement in the operating leverage. So while earnings were up 3% year-over-year, pretax preprovision earnings rose 11%. 
On Slide 13, we focus on additional key Consumer Banking trends. First, in the upper left, the stats are a reminder of our strong competitive position. Revenue increased by $107 million as NII growth more than offset lower noninterest income. Net interest income continued to improve as we drove deposits and loans higher. Noninterest income was down due mostly to lower mortgage banking income. This decline is in part a result of selling fewer loans and instead holding more on our balance sheet, thereby shifting mortgage banking income to NII. 
Expense declined 5% from Q2 '15. The positive expense trend is a result of a number of initiatives. As an example, I would note that our growth in mobile banking continues to play an important role in helping us optimize our delivery network while improving customer satisfaction. Our cost of deposits as a percent of average deposits also continued to improve and now stands at 162 basis points. 
Focusing on client balances on the bottom of the page, Merrill Lynch brokerage assets at $132 billion are up 8% versus Q2 '15 on strong account flows, partially offset by lower market valuations. We increased the number of Merrill Lynch customers by 10% from Q2 '15. We now have more than 1.6 million households using our platform for self-directed trading. 
Moving across the bottom right of the page, note that loans are up 5% from Q2 '15 on strong mortgage and vehicle lending growth. Average vehicle loans are up 20% from Q2 '15, with average book FICO scores remaining well above the 770 level and net losses remaining below 30 basis points and improving on a linked-quarter basis. Mortgage loan growth was aided by solid mortgage production of $16 billion, up modestly from Q2 '15 as customers took advantage of historically low interest rates. 
On consumer card -- or I should say on U.S. consumer card, we issued more than 1.3 million cards in the quarter, which is the highest level since 2008.  Average balances were modestly down. However, adjusting for divestitures, average card balances grew $1.4 billion compared to Q2 '15. Scanning -- spending on credit cards, adjusted for divestitures, was up 7.5% compared to Q2 '15. As reviewed in previous quarters, we continue to focus on originating high-FICO loans, which generally produce low loss rates and strong risk-adjusted margins. 
Last quarter, we highlighted the quality of our underwriting in the consumer business. This quarter, we are highlighting our leading position in digital banking. This technology continues to reshape how our customers bank. Importantly, as adoption rises, particularly around transaction processing and self-service, we see improved efficiency and customer satisfaction. 
We added more than 2.5 million new mobile customers in the past 12 months. With more than 20 million active users, deposits from mobile devices now represent 17% of deposit transactions. Mobile customers on average process 280,000 deposits per day, an increase of 28% year-over-year and the equivalent volume of 800 financial centers. 
Mobile sales are up nearly 50% from last year. We are promoting mobile sales and electronic adoption by deploying digital ambassadors in our financial centers. We now have more than 3,500 digital ambassadors in our branches, engaging with customers who come into the branch to transact. They educate these customers on alternatives to branch banking, which are not only more convenient for them but also more efficient for us. 
Digital sales, appointments and satisfaction all continue to achieve new highs. Also, as you know, we are a leader in person-to-person and person-to-business money movement through digital transfers and bill payment capabilities. The adoption and popularity of these capabilities continues to drive growth, with record volume of $246 billion this quarter, up nearly 5% year-over-year. 
Turning to Slide 15. Global Wealth and Investment Management produced earnings of $722 million, up 8% from Q2 '15. Year-over-year, revenue was down modestly but expenses were down even more, improving pretax margin to 26%, up meaningfully from Q2 '15. This quarter included a modest gain from the previously announced sale of Bank of America Global Capital Management. This reduced AUM comprised of short-term liquid assets by approximately $80 billion. 
Overall, revenue declined 2% from Q2 '15 as strong NII growth and the gain were more than offset by lower market-sensitive revenue. Asset management revenues declined from Q2 '15 on lower market values while improving modestly on a linked-quarter basis. Transactional revenue was down and continues to be impacted by market uncertainty as well as the migration of activity from brokerage to managed relationships. 
NII benefited from solid deposit and loan growth. Noninterest expense declined nearly $200 million or 6% from Q2 '15, with half of that benefit derived from the expiration of the amortization of adviser retention awards that were put in place at the time of the Merrill Lynch merger. The rest of the improvement was a result of lower revenue-related incentives and other support costs. 
Moving to Slide 16. Despite volatile markets, we continued to see overall solid client engagement. Client balances at $2.4 trillion were down from Q1, but excluding the sale I mentioned earlier, were up from Q1 as higher market valuation levels, $10 billion of long-term AUM flows and loan growth more than offset tax-related deposit outflows. 
Driven by the expected seasonality, average deposits were down from Q1 as clients paid income taxes. Importantly, average deposits are up 6% from Q2 '15, driven by growth in the second half of 2015. Average loans also grew this quarter. Growth was concentrated in consumer real estate and structured lending as well. 
Turning to Slide 17. Global Banking earned $1.5 billion, producing solid improvement over both Q1 and year-over-year. Returns on allocated capital was 16%, a 200 basis point improvement from Q2 '15 despite adding $2 billion in allocated capital. Double-digit percent revenue growth year-over-year offset a low single-digit expense growth, creating strong operating leverage that improved the efficiency ratio to 45%. Global Banking continues to drive solid loan growth within its risk and client frameworks, producing solid year-over-year improvement in NII. 
Revenue benefited this quarter from mark-to-market gains on our FVO loan portfolio due to recovery in certain energy and mining exposures. Higher treasury fees and leasing gains also aided the improvement from Q2 '15. While total investment banking fees for the firm were down from Q2 '15, Global Banking gained a little share, supported by M&A fees, which were up on an absolute basis. A modest increase in noninterest expense compared to Q2 '15 reflects the cost of adding sales professionals over the past 12 months and a modest increase in incentive related due to the higher revenue. 
Looking at trends on Page 18 and comparing Q2 last year. Clients were comforted -- excuse me, clients were confronted with increased volatility once again this quarter with concerns around both global growth as well as the outcome of the U.K. referendum. However, despite concerns, companies still need to finance as well as store and [ph] move their money, and this is when the strength and diversity of our franchise is most appreciated by our clients. 
Average loans on a year-over-year basis grew $35 billion or 12%. Growth was broad based across large corporates as well as middle-market borrowers and spread across most products. Having said that, we slowed our construction-led commercial real estate lending a few quarters ago. Average deposits increased from Q2 '15, up $11 billion or 4% from both new and existing clients. 
Switching to Global Markets on Slide 19. The past couple of quarters are great examples of the importance of this segment to not only its clients around the world, but also to its -- to our customers and clients in all our business segments. Customers and clients were able to live their financial lives better in Q2 because Global Markets delivered for them under challenging market conditions, helping them raise capital, buy and sell securities as well as manage risks. 
We believe we increased our relevance with clients during Q2 and, more specifically, during the market volatility after the U.K. referendum. We did this by showing them that we will be there for them when they need us most, that we are there for them with a consistent set of products and services at terms that makes sense for our clients and our shareholders, and there for them with thoughtful advice as well as the capabilities, strength and confidence to make markets and execute. All of this resulted in Global Markets reporting earnings of $1.1 billion and a return on capital of 12%, 13% excluding net DVA impact. 
Revenue was up appreciably year-over-year as well as linked quarter. Total revenue, excluding DVA, was up 8% year-over-year on solid sales and trading results, and up 18% over a Q1 that saw challenging market conditions. Strong expense management drove expenses 6% lower year-over-year even while revenue was higher. 
Moving to trends on the next slide and focusing on the components of our sales and trading performance. Sales and trading revenue of $3.7 billion, excluding net DVA, was up 12% from Q2 '15, driven by FICC. In terms of revenue, this was the best second quarter we have had in the past 5 years. 
Excluding DVA and versus Q2 '15, FICC sales and trading of $2.6 billion increased 22% as the improvement which began in late Q1 continued through Q2 as global concerns abated and central banks took further monetary policy actions. Improvement was across both macro and credit products, driven by stronger rates and currency, client activity as well as improved credit market conditions. Tighter spreads benefited mortgage trading, and municipal bonds outperformed treasuries with strong retail demand. Equity sales and trading was $1.1 billion, declining 8% versus Q2 '15, which saw significant client activity in Asia, driven by stock market rallies in the region. 
On Slide 21, we show All Other, which reported a loss of $815 billion (sic) [ $815 million ]. This loss was driven by the current quarter's $974 million market-related NII adjustment. The loss is lower than Q1 due to both a lower market-related NII adjustment as well as the absent (sic) [absence] of retirement-eligible incentive costs. 
Compared to Q2 '15, the difference is driven by a number of factors: first, a negative NII market-related adjustment in this quarter versus a large positive adjustment in Q2 '15. Second, we had reps and warranty recoveries in Q2 '15 related to a court ruling and gains on the sale of consumer real estate loans. Third, provision expense declined from Q2 '15, driven by continued portfolio improvement. 
The effective tax rate for the quarter was about 29%, which is in line with what we expect for the remainder of the year, absent any unusual items. And as a reminder, we still expect to record a tax charge of about $350 million, most likely in 3Q, that reduces the carrying value of our U.K. DTAs as a result of U.K. tax reform announced last year. The vast majority of this charge will not impact regulatory capital. 
Okay. So let me offer a few takeaways as I finish. Q2 was another quarter of solid progress in a challenging global environment. While growth concerns persist in many countries, the U.S. economy continues to steadily improve, albeit at a less-than-optimum pace. The diversity and strength of our franchise makes us more relevant to clients and customers during times such as these, and you can see that in our results. 
Clearly, interest rates affected our financial performance this quarter. Still, while we cannot control interest rates, we are not waiting for them to rise. We grew in this environment by focusing on the things that we can control and drive. We grew deposits. We grew loans. We managed risk well, reflected in reduced charge-offs. We delivered for customer clients in another challenging quarter, especially around the U.K. referendum. We invested in our future by adding sales professionals and continuing to deploy technology that improves customer satisfaction. We returned capital to shareholders, and we announced plans to return increasing amounts. And we did all of this while we lowered expenses and drove operating leverage. 
Thank you. With that, let's open it up for questions."

We're obviously experiencing good deposit growth. And we've got, as we talked about, a strong risk and client framework. So we'd like to put all of that deposit growth into loan growth, but we're going to only do so if it meets our criteria.

And most of the retention -- most of the attrition of experienced financial advisers have been more due to our change in our way we do the international business, which has been going on for about a year. But in terms of aggregate numbers, it's been relatively stable. In terms of -- and the attrition we see is actually in the lower production levels, mainly due to people not being able to kind of build a book of business. And we're trying to fix that through the integrated business system with our consumer and preferred teams. In terms of DoJ (sic) [DOL] and the fiduciary standard, we're busily implementing this. It's consistent with where we're going with the business. It's consistent with the move from an old view of what financial advisory was versus a managed money, fee-based loaded with a financial planning-driven business. Admittedly, it's a little tricky because the actual rules only apply to a few hundred-odd billion dollars of 401(k) in retirement assets we have. But it's consistent with where we're taking the business and the team's trying. We don't see meaningful revenue or changes due to that. And we'll see meaningful changes to implement it but not meaningful revenue changes."

I will definitely answer your question, but I want to emphasize again we're talking about LTM $56 billion going to $53 billion and absorbing in that merit, health care, inflation and other investment. And the first thing I would point out as you sort of think about the credibility of that, look at what we accomplished over the last 5 years. From Q2 '11 to Q2 '16, we've reduced quarterly expenses by $4.8 billion. That's a $19 billion annualized run rate, so -- and we did this by not only reducing legacy mortgage-related expenses, which were only -- make up about $2 billion of that $4.8 billion, but just through good expense management in every major category across the company. So from here, it's about a number of things. A lot of those things have been identified through our Simplify and Improve initiative. We're investing in technology and capabilities to improve efficiency. The most obvious example of that you can see is in the increasing adoption of customers for digital channels. But I do want to emphasize that it is about making progress across the entire company from our leaders and our teams. So if you look in consumer, there are examples, the digital adoption, we've got mobile users up 15% to over 20 million. When they make a deposit, that's 1/10 the cost. We've got digital sales up 12% year-over-year. We've got more customers using digital statements. A lot more work to do there with the transition from paper to electronic. We are optimizing the coverage model in both consumer and GWIM, and they all have goals. We all have goals and initiatives around controllable expenses, including travel, supply, support costs. If you look at Global Banking and Global Markets, we're simplifying our legal entity structure and business model. We're integrating wholesale credit origination and processing across the lines of businesses. We're centralizing data platforms. We're expanding electronic capabilities. And we're optimizing the coverage model. So there's a lot going on. And we're going to need all of it to get to our goals."

You can see that even in markets, year-over-year we're down 7% in people, where revenue went up. So it's electronification of the fixed income platform and the equities platform, continuing down that road. So every single area is moving here. And then you also have to think about the stability of the platform. This company has now been operating with a consistent strategy and a consistent ability to execute for many years. And what's gone with the legacy and stuff, that just allows us to keep operating on ourselves. And we always have performed best in history when we had that period of time of no acquisitions, no divestitures, no legacy asset servicing. So we're very confident that it'll happen. On revenue, I'd say look at it year-over-year, look at it linked quarter. So last 3 or 4 quarters, you're seeing revenue stable. And while it bounces around with market activity in a given quarter, the core revenue continues to go forward and the expenses keep coming down on a core basis. So we're comfortable that -- there's nothing -- we won't allow our people under our responsible growth to give us cost saves and not grow the business. So it has to be sustainable. It has to be actually taking out real work and yet still investing in more client-facing teammates, more salespeople and more technology capabilities for customers."

We don't have a target efficiency ratio. You can calculate one -- off that out in '18 because as we talked about earlier, the NII differences will be driven by where rates go to some degree.

MBI line was down year-over-year. That was planned for. We knew that was coming. I just want to walk -- [indiscernible] I just want to walk through kind of why it's down, and then we could talk a little bit about going forward. So kind of 4 items. First, we sold an appraisal business last year. So there was revenue in last year's second quarter that isn't in this quarter. Second, we had some servicing sales in the second quarter of last year for a gain that we didn't have this quarter. Third and probably most significant from a revenue perspective is that we had the ACE decision in the second quarter last year. So we released last year some reps and warranties. And that was a significant amount of benefit last year. And then fourth and probably strategically most important and the point you're getting to is we are selling less mortgages, choosing instead to hold them on our balance sheet. And obviously, this decreases MBI but increases NII over time, so -- and plus you have to note that, as we just talked about, servicing -- bad servicing is going to continue to run off. So if servicing is running off and not being replaced as fast, if we're holding more mortgages on the balance sheet as we transition from MBI to NII, you could see that line continue sort of trend lower. In terms of the mortgages, I think in the short term, it's going to be fairly stable and that trend is going to -- this is a good base this quarter. It's a good base to sort of start from. I think that trend lower is going to be in some quarters very slow because, as you point out, other items -- other line items are a little bit messy and bounce around there, depending on what happens on interest rates. But that's the trend. In terms of what we're trying to accomplish, all of the loans we originate that are nonconforming, we would like to keep on our balance sheet. And even the conforming loans that have a certain characteristic, we're going to be holding on our balance sheet. So right now, that's around 75-ish percent of the loans we're originating are going on our balance sheet. Is that helpful?"

And despite both of those circumstances, we think in the out-years, we can grow NII, or in the out-quarters, we can grow NII because we're growing deposits and we're putting them to work where we can within our risk and client frameworks to grow well-priced loans. Any amount of deposit that doesn't go to our clients and customers, we're sticking in the securities portfolio and getting as much yield as we can get there within the constraints of liquidity and capital risk and interest rate risk. So we think we can grow in even a flat interest rate environment, grow the NII line, not necessarily in the next quarter but as we again move out into the future. Brian has already pointed out all the work we're doing around expenses. So when you combine what we think we can do from a fee base, from an NII perspective, and then lowering expenses, we think we can grow earnings in the company even if interest rates are flat."

And good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us to review our second quarter results. I'm beginning on Slide 2 of the materials we sent to you. 
We reported solid earnings of $4.2 billion after tax or $0.36 per diluted share in what was certainly an eventful quarter for the markets from an overall macro perspective. This compares to $5.1 billion or $0.43 per share in the year-ago quarter. This quarter included negative market-related NII adjustments that cost $0.05 per share and negative DVA that cost us another $0.01 for a total of $0.06. That compares to a $0.03 benefit to EPS for both those items in the second quarter of 2015. 
Earnings neutralizing for the FAS 91 DVA for both periods improved from $0.40 per share to $0.42 per share on a year-over-year basis. Our results represent another quarter of solid progress in the strategies we have been executing. Those strategies are delivering more of the company's capabilities to each and every client we serve. 
At BAC, we focus on what we can control, and despite low rates and other macro events, we continue to focus on managing our risk, our costs and our delivery of quality products and customer service. In Q2, we grew loans $22 billion or approximately 2.5% versus last year, even as we sold a few portfolios during the year. All this growth was organic and consistent with our risk appetite. 
We also grew deposits more than $66 billion or 6% over that same time period, and we did so while maintaining disciplined deposit pricing. 
We also continue to transform our company in a digital way in all things, in all businesses. For example, this quarter we crossed over 20 million active mobile users and continue to increase their use of digital channels for both transactions and buying more bank products. Active mobile banking customers logged into their accounts over 900 million times this quarter, depositing more than 25 million checks or more than $20 billion via mobile check deposits. They made over 25 million mobile bill payments, up 30% year-over-year, and made nearly 80 million transfers. 
Person-to-person or P2P payments continue to ramp up as well. While still a small component of the overall consumer payments this quarter, we had $6.7 billion in P2P payments this quarter. That is more than $13 billion year-to-date, and is up 28% from last year. This channel is a value channel for all our customers and made possible by the continued investment we make. 
As we move to Slide 3, we have talked to you -- a lot of you over the last several months, including many of you on the phone today. I thought I'd try to address some of the more common questions we get from those conversations by looking at our results, by looking at the income statement and the items therein. First, one of the core questions is: What if rates stay lower for longer? Well, for bank management and for you as investors, it would be easier if rates were to rise, but that hasn't happened. 
So the question is: Can we grow earnings without rates improving? We believe we surely can. We can do that by continuous success on things like expense management, by keeping NII stable to growing, stable and growing fees and continue to manage risk well and hold down our credit costs. 
As you can see, revenue this quarter was $20.6 billion on an FTE basis. Adjusted for the negative impacts of market-related NII adjustments and DVA, that number is $21.8 billion. Adjusted for the same items in the year-ago quarter, the total was comparable. 
Now as we focus in on NII, Paul will take you through some of the changes this quarter later in the presentation. However, in summary, adjusted for market-related changes in both last year's second quarter and this year's second quarter, we grew NII by $400 million or 4% year-over-year, and that took place while the 10-year treasury yield fell 86 basis points from last year on a spot basis. Going forward, in a stable interest rate environment, we believe we can maintain NII around the second quarter 2016 level based on the current loan and deposit growth we see. And if rates rise, we would expect NII to grow. 
Another question relates to the Global Markets business. That question is often asked how we need to change this business, especially the FICC area, as many of our customers have. I want to hit this head on. 
First of all, fixed income is a good business for us here at Bank of America. It is a business which benefits not only by its core activities but by coupled -- being coupled with our massive Global Banking franchise that has leadership positions across the globe. Combined together, they generate a pretty steady $1 billion-or-so quarterly investment banking fees. It's also an important part of our overall Global Markets platform, the platform which sits on top of the #1 global research team for the past 5 years. 
In the second quarter, this business did well. Global Markets generated $3.7 billion in sales and trading revenue, excluding DVA. Compared to the same period last year, that is up 12%. This year-over-year improvement is driven by FICC sales and trading, which is up 22%. Now think about that. Sales and trading revenue, including DVA, for this quarter was the highest second quarter we experienced in 5 years, and that led to one of the most profitable quarters for Global Markets we have seen in the past 5 years. 
Also, the team served clients well during a period of difficult volatility. So clearly, it remains a profitable, important business for us to serve clients. We're proud of how the team supported their clients through the Brexit vote and the periods of volatility related thereto. 
Another question is getting clarity on how we're transforming the business on the fee lines. Noninterest revenue was $11.2 billion this quarter. Although modestly down from second quarter '15, it was up nicely from the first quarter. There are a lot of items that run through the various lines of fees. 
First, with regard to consumer fees, we are largely done with the big card portfolio divestitures and branch divestitures. Both those impacted both card fees and banking service charges, and you can see them coming off the bottom as you look at the linked quarters. Fees now will grow with the volume of cards and accounts that are now net growing in our company. Our mortgage business is now sized appropriately for our franchise, and the fee line there Paul will talk about later, but will be -- is at near where it's going to be in the future. 
With regard to revenue more closely tied to markets businesses, the ups and downs in volumes of activity in sales and trading, investment banking and brokerage will move back and forth with the market. But the important thing is we have strong businesses, strong client-facing businesses in these areas, and we're getting our share of these revenue streams even while the markets ebbs and flows. 
So if we look about move from the fee line to the expense line, many of you give us credit for having managed expenses from $70 billion 5 years ago to the mid-$50 billion today. But the question is: Can we do more? And if you look at this quarter, we continue to manage expenses well. 
Noninterest expense this quarter was $13.5 billion, improving more than 3.5% -- or 3% from 2015 second quarter. This continues a trend of performance that is showing expense declining significantly on a quarterly basis quarter after quarter over the past several years. This is the lowest level that we have reported since the fourth quarter of 2008, and that's prior to the Merrill Lynch merger. 
If you look at our efficiency ratio and normalize it for the NII adjustment stated above, it would be about 62% this quarter. That's an improvement of 200 basis points from last year's second quarter. 
Cost control and cost effectiveness is a focus for our management team here at Bank of America. So the question is: How much more can we do on expenses? So if you think about this, let's start by looking at the cost over the most recent 4 quarters. 
In the trailing 4 quarters, the total expense base was $56.3 billion. As we look out from the second -- the third quarter of 2016 through the next 6 quarters into 2018, we believe that with our SIM efforts and the continued work we're doing across the board on expenses, we're targeting an annual expense number of around $53 billion in total expenses for the year 2018. So over 6 quarters, we continue to absorb investment, merit increases, rising health care costs and bringing expenses down a nominal amount. Our continued work in driving down costs to service delinquent loans will help with this, but the other reductions are generally coming from the core work in Simplify and Improve, look -- the work we continue to do to simplify those work processes but also the core work we do to allow us to self-fund our growth initiatives, our continuing investments in technology and salespeople. 
While I'm on the topic of expenses, I want to point out another important milestone for our company this quarter. This quarter, we changed our reporting to eliminate the legacy asset servicing segment. This completes the transformation. This segment was the last place where product orientation was reported, not customer orientation. And more importantly, it also reflects the last of the legacies really behind us from an operational basis. 
We have added a couple of slides in the appendix today to go along with our 8-K we filed a few days ago. They explain the methodology of the realignment of LAS and highlights the impact of the segment where those loans and associated P&L are recorded now. 
But what I want to get to you -- across to you is LAS was an -- as an operational segment successfully did what it was tasked to do: to clean up one of the largest mortgage servicing businesses in the U.S. Consider that progress. From 1.4 million delinquent mortgage loans, we're down to 80,000 today. At one point, we had 58,000 teammates and 20,000 contractors working on this task, and now we're down to 10,000 teammates. 
From one peak quarter of $3 billion-plus in expenses, we're down to $600 million this quarter. That phase of the work is complete, and we need to move that operating business in with the rest of the company to do the further consolidation and further work to improve our servicing costs. We are pleased with the accomplishments of this group, but there's still more to be done. 
And that brings us to our provision. Simply point -- put, the question we often get is: Is credit deteriorating? As you can see, we remain very pleased with both consumer and commercial credit performance. Not only have not -- net charge-offs not gotten worse, but they've improved in the most recent quarter, moving back below $1 billion. Provision expense is and will remain roughly equivalent to net charge-offs. Even in our energy portfolio, we have seen lower exposures and improved losses. 
And that brings us to our returns. In this operating environment, can we get our returns above our cost of capital? Well, as you can see, we made solid progress on our returns this quarter. Our return on tangible common equity adjusted for the market-related and DVA impacts was 10.9%. On a similarly adjusted basis, our ROA has moved to 90 basis points. We still have work to do, but you can see the improvement coming through. 
As we move to Slide 4, you can see our business segment results. You see strong year-over-year results in every business, driven by the generation of operating leverage. Consumer Banking continued its momentum around client activity and operating leverage. Consumer satisfaction continues to improve as does adoption and use of digital capabilities and functionality. 
In our wealth management business, they grew earnings as costs declined more than revenue while we continue to invest in this business. Revenue is impacted by AUM valuations from market variability. 
Our Global Banking team drove results with continued solid loan growth, operating leverage of 9% and strong credit results. Global Markets executed well for its clients, as I stated earlier, in a very difficult period, and used operating leverage to grow its earnings year-over-year as well. So on a combined basis, those 4 business segments improved 16% from last year's second quarter, earning about $5 billion this quarter. 
Partially offsetting this was the loss at All Other, and that primarily reflects the market-related NII adjustments I spoke about earlier. You can also see the returns and efficiency ratios for each of these segments, and note that each segment is earning well above our cost of capital. 
With that, I'm going to turn it over to Paul to take you through the numbers."
19049,333737560,1007609,"Bank of America Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 18, 2016",2016-07-18,"Earnings Calls","Bank of America Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Brian. Good morning, everyone. Since Brian covered the income statement, I will start with the balance sheet on Page 5. As you know, general deposit flows drive the size of our balance sheet, and they, on an ending basis, were relatively flat this",3634,"Thanks, Brian. Good morning, everyone. Since Brian covered the income statement, I will start with the balance sheet on Page 5. As you know, general deposit flows drive the size of our balance sheet, and they, on an ending basis, were relatively flat this quarter, as inflows were partially offset by outflows to fund tax -- seasonal tax payments. 
So total assets were stable compared to Q1, with loans increasing modestly, security balances rising and cash down a corresponding amount. Liquidity also saw a small decline. However, we remain well compliant with LCR requirements. 
Tangible common equity of $170 billion improved by $3.6 billion from Q1, driven by earnings and OCI. This was partially offset by $1.1 billion in share repurchases and roughly $500 million in common dividends. As a reminder, following the CCAR results, we announced an increase in both our share repurchase authorization as well as a planned increase of 50% in our quarterly dividend. On a per-share basis, tangible book value per share increased to $16.68, up 11% from Q2 '15. 
Turning to regulatory metrics. As a reminder, we report capital under the advanced approaches. Our CET1 transition ratio under Basel III ended the quarter at 10.6%. On a fully phased-in basis, CET1 capital improved $4.3 billion to $161.8 billion. Under the advanced approaches, compared to Q1 '16, the CET1 ratio increased 37 basis points to 10.5% and is above our current 2019 requirement. RWA declined roughly $13 billion, driven by reductions related to retail exposures, primarily from credit improvement. 
We also provide our capital metrics under the standardized approach. Here, our CET1 ratio improved to 11.4%. Supplementary leverage ratio for both parent and bank continued to exceed U.S. regulatory minimums that take effect in 2018. 
Turning to Slide 6. And on an average basis, total loans were up $7 billion from Q1 and $23 billion or 3% from Q2 '15. On an ending-period basis, loan growth this quarter was impacted by paydowns near the end of the quarter in the non-U.S. corporate loan facilities and about $1.6 billion in FX translations across international loans, including U.K. card. 
Note on this slide, there is a breakdown of the loans in our business segments and All Other. Again, on an average basis, year-over-year, loans in All Other were down $42 billion, driven by continued runoff of first- and second-lien mortgages while loans in our business segments were up $65 billion or 9%. 
In Consumer Banking, we continue to see strong growth in consumer real estate and vehicle lending, offset somewhat by runoff in home equity outpacing originations. In Wealth Management, we saw growth in consumer real estate and structured lending. Global Banking loans were up $35 billion or 12% year-over-year and up 7% annualized from Q1. 
Deposits were stable with Q1 at $1.2 trillion but grew $67 billion or 6% from Q2 '15. Broad-based growth was led by consumer, increasing more than $44 billion or 8% year-over-year, while Wealth Management deposits grow 6% and deposits with corporate clients in Global Banking improved nearly 4%. 
Turning to asset quality on Slide 7. We saw improvement from Q1. Total net charge-offs improved $83 million from Q1 to less than $1 billion in Q2. Consumer losses declined modestly across a number of products, and while slight, commercial losses also declined from Q1 as a result of lower energy losses. Provision of $976 million in Q2 was down $21 million from Q1. Finally, we had a small overall net reserve release in the quarter, as consumer releases were modestly offset by builds in commercial. 
On Slide 8, we provide credit quality data on our consumer portfolio. Net charge-offs declined $68 million from Q1. While driven by lower real estate losses, the improvement, as I mentioned, was broad based. Over half of the losses in this book are U.S. credit card, with a loss rate improved 5 basis points from Q1 to 2.66%. Delinquency levels and NPLs improved, and reserve coverage remains strong. 
Moving to the commercial credit on Slide 9. Net charge-offs improved $15 million from Q1 as energy losses declined. Energy charge-offs decreased $23 million from Q1 to $79 million this quarter. There isn't a lot of new news on the commercial asset quality front other than the modest improvement in our energy-related exposure. 
As you all know, the price of oil and gas was more stable in Q2. Within this backdrop, we experienced some improvement in both energy losses and exposure. A few clients we've financed with equity issuances and other financing solutions, which also helped improve exposures. 
Overall, our committed energy exposure declined $3 billion from Q1, with utilized exposure declining more modestly. And exposure to exploration and production as well as oil field services, which we believe are the 2 higher-risk subsectors, declined 1% from Q1. Outside of energy, commercial asset quality continues to perform well. 
Let me share with you a few metrics that exhibit the quality of this book and its performance. The reservable criticized exposure ratio is 3.8%, and excluding energy and metals and mining, exposure is 2.4%, which is near prerecession levels. The commercial net charge-off ratio, excluding small business, has been below 15 basis points for 14 consecutive quarters even with the elevated levels of energy charge-offs we experienced over the past 3 quarters. The NPL ratio, which today is at 37 basis points, has been below 40 basis points for 11 consecutive quarters. 
Turning to Slide 10. Net interest income on a reported non-FTE basis was $9.2 billion. Included in NII this quarter was a negative $974 million market-related adjustment to true-up bond premium amortization. This follows Q1's more negative adjustment of $1.2 billion, and it's important to note that the adjustment in Q2 '15 was a benefit of $669 million. 
NII on an FTE basis, excluding market-related adjustments, was $10.4 billion. This was lower than Q1 primarily due to the lower long-end rates and Q1's seasonal impacts. Compared to Q2 '15, results were up nearly $400 million or 4% as higher short-end rates, combined with loan growth funded by deposits, offset the negative impact of lower long-end rates. 
Looking forward to Q3. We will benefit from an extra day, which will be offset by the impact of declines in long-end rates over the past 2 quarters and put pressure on our NBS bond yields and reinvestment yields more generally. As we get into Q4 and the next year, we get more optimistic about NII, assuming both the current forward curve and the current pace of loan and deposit growth. With respect to asset sensitivity, as of 6/30, an instantaneous 100 basis point parallel increase in rates is estimated to increase NII by $7.5 billion over the subsequent 12 months, driven by the increase in long-end rates. 
Now we think it's also important to understand what we expect to happen to NII if rates don't rise. Referring to the bottom left of the slide, the adjusted NII has been fairly stable, averaging between $10.3 billion and $10.4 billion over the past 5 quarters. If we have stability in long-end rates, we would expect to maintain that level in the near term, again assuming modest loan and deposit growth. Rates moving up or down from here would obviously impact that perspective slightly in the near term, but building as we extend that scenario into future quarters and years. 
Turning to Slide 11. Noninterest expense was $13.5 billion in the quarter. That is $0.5 billion or 3% lower than Q2 '15, driven by good expense discipline across the company. As you can see, we are presenting expenses a little bit differently now that we have eliminated the LAS segment. Having said that, we made steady progress on reducing legacy loan servicing costs this quarter, and we still expect to achieve our original goal of lowering the former LAS segment costs ex-litigation to $500 million in Q4. 
Q2 litigation expense was $270 million, which was higher by $95 million in Q1 '15. So year-over-year, expense improvement ex-litigation was actually $600 million. Nearly every category of cost was lower year-over-year. It was led by personnel, including the expiration of the fully amortized advisory awards and the revenue-related incentive, mostly in wealth management, while the rest of the improvement I would characterize as just good, hard work, grinding expenses lower through SIM and other initiatives. 
While the rate of decline has been slowing, our employee base is down 3% from Q2 '15. As the employee base continues to grind lower, we think it's important to point out that the reductions on a percentage basis now include more highly paid managerial associates. So while the rate of FTE reduction has slowed, the relationship to expense reductions is not linear. 
Also, we continue to increase the number of client-facing associates to drive growth while, at the same time, through SIM and other efforts, simplifying and streamlining activities and thereby reduce non-client-facing positions. Lastly, as I said last quarter, we expect our quarterly FDIC expense to increase approximately $100 million for a number of quarters, starting in Q3 '16. 
Turning to the business segments and starting with Consumer Banking on Slide 12. Consumer earned $1.7 billion, continuing its trend of solid improvement and reporting a robust 20% return on allocated capital. Revenue and earnings were driven by deposits and loan growth, coupled with continued expense improvement driving operating leverage. As a result of this operating leverage, the efficiency ratio improved roughly 360 basis points year-over-year. Note that the lack of reserve releases this quarter versus a meaningful release last year mitigated some of the improvement in the operating leverage. So while earnings were up 3% year-over-year, pretax preprovision earnings rose 11%. 
On Slide 13, we focus on additional key Consumer Banking trends. First, in the upper left, the stats are a reminder of our strong competitive position. Revenue increased by $107 million as NII growth more than offset lower noninterest income. Net interest income continued to improve as we drove deposits and loans higher. Noninterest income was down due mostly to lower mortgage banking income. This decline is in part a result of selling fewer loans and instead holding more on our balance sheet, thereby shifting mortgage banking income to NII. 
Expense declined 5% from Q2 '15. The positive expense trend is a result of a number of initiatives. As an example, I would note that our growth in mobile banking continues to play an important role in helping us optimize our delivery network while improving customer satisfaction. Our cost of deposits as a percent of average deposits also continued to improve and now stands at 162 basis points. 
Focusing on client balances on the bottom of the page, Merrill Lynch brokerage assets at $132 billion are up 8% versus Q2 '15 on strong account flows, partially offset by lower market valuations. We increased the number of Merrill Lynch customers by 10% from Q2 '15. We now have more than 1.6 million households using our platform for self-directed trading. 
Moving across the bottom right of the page, note that loans are up 5% from Q2 '15 on strong mortgage and vehicle lending growth. Average vehicle loans are up 20% from Q2 '15, with average book FICO scores remaining well above the 770 level and net losses remaining below 30 basis points and improving on a linked-quarter basis. Mortgage loan growth was aided by solid mortgage production of $16 billion, up modestly from Q2 '15 as customers took advantage of historically low interest rates. 
On consumer card -- or I should say on U.S. consumer card, we issued more than 1.3 million cards in the quarter, which is the highest level since 2008. Average balances were modestly down. However, adjusting for divestitures, average card balances grew $1.4 billion compared to Q2 '15. Scanning -- spending on credit cards, adjusted for divestitures, was up 7.5% compared to Q2 '15. As reviewed in previous quarters, we continue to focus on originating high-FICO loans, which generally produce low loss rates and strong risk-adjusted margins. 
Last quarter, we highlighted the quality of our underwriting in the consumer business. This quarter, we are highlighting our leading position in digital banking. This technology continues to reshape how our customers bank. Importantly, as adoption rises, particularly around transaction processing and self-service, we see improved efficiency and customer satisfaction. 
We added more than 2.5 million new mobile customers in the past 12 months. With more than 20 million active users, deposits from mobile devices now represent 17% of deposit transactions. Mobile customers on average process 280,000 deposits per day, an increase of 28% year-over-year and the equivalent volume of 800 financial centers. 
Mobile sales are up nearly 50% from last year. We are promoting mobile sales and electronic adoption by deploying digital ambassadors in our financial centers. We now have more than 3,500 digital ambassadors in our branches, engaging with customers who come into the branch to transact. They educate these customers on alternatives to branch banking, which are not only more convenient for them but also more efficient for us. 
Digital sales, appointments and satisfaction all continue to achieve new highs. Also, as you know, we are a leader in person-to-person and person-to-business money movement through digital transfers and bill payment capabilities. The adoption and popularity of these capabilities continues to drive growth, with record volume of $246 billion this quarter, up nearly 5% year-over-year. 
Turning to Slide 15. Global Wealth and Investment Management produced earnings of $722 million, up 8% from Q2 '15. Year-over-year, revenue was down modestly but expenses were down even more, improving pretax margin to 26%, up meaningfully from Q2 '15. This quarter included a modest gain from the previously announced sale of Bank of America Global Capital Management. This reduced AUM comprised of short-term liquid assets by approximately $80 billion. 
Overall, revenue declined 2% from Q2 '15 as strong NII growth and the gain were more than offset by lower market-sensitive revenue. Asset management revenues declined from Q2 '15 on lower market values while improving modestly on a linked-quarter basis. Transactional revenue was down and continues to be impacted by market uncertainty as well as the migration of activity from brokerage to managed relationships. 
NII benefited from solid deposit and loan growth. Noninterest expense declined nearly $200 million or 6% from Q2 '15, with half of that benefit derived from the expiration of the amortization of adviser retention awards that were put in place at the time of the Merrill Lynch merger. The rest of the improvement was a result of lower revenue-related incentives and other support costs. 
Moving to Slide 16. Despite volatile markets, we continued to see overall solid client engagement. Client balances at $2.4 trillion were down from Q1, but excluding the sale I mentioned earlier, were up from Q1 as higher market valuation levels, $10 billion of long-term AUM flows and loan growth more than offset tax-related deposit outflows. 
Driven by the expected seasonality, average deposits were down from Q1 as clients paid income taxes. Importantly, average deposits are up 6% from Q2 '15, driven by growth in the second half of 2015. Average loans also grew this quarter. Growth was concentrated in consumer real estate and structured lending as well. 
Turning to Slide 17. Global Banking earned $1.5 billion, producing solid improvement over both Q1 and year-over-year. Returns on allocated capital was 16%, a 200 basis point improvement from Q2 '15 despite adding $2 billion in allocated capital. Double-digit percent revenue growth year-over-year offset a low single-digit expense growth, creating strong operating leverage that improved the efficiency ratio to 45%. Global Banking continues to drive solid loan growth within its risk and client frameworks, producing solid year-over-year improvement in NII. 
Revenue benefited this quarter from mark-to-market gains on our FVO loan portfolio due to recovery in certain energy and mining exposures. Higher treasury fees and leasing gains also aided the improvement from Q2 '15. While total investment banking fees for the firm were down from Q2 '15, Global Banking gained a little share, supported by M&A fees, which were up on an absolute basis. A modest increase in noninterest expense compared to Q2 '15 reflects the cost of adding sales professionals over the past 12 months and a modest increase in incentive related due to the higher revenue. 
Looking at trends on Page 18 and comparing Q2 last year. Clients were comforted -- excuse me, clients were confronted with increased volatility once again this quarter with concerns around both global growth as well as the outcome of the U.K. referendum. However, despite concerns, companies still need to finance as well as store and [ph] move their money, and this is when the strength and diversity of our franchise is most appreciated by our clients. 
Average loans on a year-over-year basis grew $35 billion or 12%. Growth was broad based across large corporates as well as middle-market borrowers and spread across most products. Having said that, we slowed our construction-led commercial real estate lending a few quarters ago. Average deposits increased from Q2 '15, up $11 billion or 4% from both new and existing clients. 
Switching to Global Markets on Slide 19. The past couple of quarters are great examples of the importance of this segment to not only its clients around the world, but also to its -- to our customers and clients in all our business segments. Customers and clients were able to live their financial lives better in Q2 because Global Markets delivered for them under challenging market conditions, helping them raise capital, buy and sell securities as well as manage risks. 
We believe we increased our relevance with clients during Q2 and, more specifically, during the market volatility after the U.K. referendum. We did this by showing them that we will be there for them when they need us most, that we are there for them with a consistent set of products and services at terms that makes sense for our clients and our shareholders, and there for them with thoughtful advice as well as the capabilities, strength and confidence to make markets and execute. All of this resulted in Global Markets reporting earnings of $1.1 billion and a return on capital of 12%, 13% excluding net DVA impact. 
Revenue was up appreciably year-over-year as well as linked quarter. Total revenue, excluding DVA, was up 8% year-over-year on solid sales and trading results, and up 18% over a Q1 that saw challenging market conditions. Strong expense management drove expenses 6% lower year-over-year even while revenue was higher. 
Moving to trends on the next slide and focusing on the components of our sales and trading performance. Sales and trading revenue of $3.7 billion, excluding net DVA, was up 12% from Q2 '15, driven by FICC. In terms of revenue, this was the best second quarter we have had in the past 5 years. 
Excluding DVA and versus Q2 '15, FICC sales and trading of $2.6 billion increased 22% as the improvement which began in late Q1 continued through Q2 as global concerns abated and central banks took further monetary policy actions. Improvement was across both macro and credit products, driven by stronger rates and currency, client activity as well as improved credit market conditions. Tighter spreads benefited mortgage trading, and municipal bonds outperformed treasuries with strong retail demand. Equity sales and trading was $1.1 billion, declining 8% versus Q2 '15, which saw significant client activity in Asia, driven by stock market rallies in the region. 
On Slide 21, we show All Other, which reported a loss of $815 billion (sic) [ $815 million ]. This loss was driven by the current quarter's $974 million market-related NII adjustment. The loss is lower than Q1 due to both a lower market-related NII adjustment as well as the absent (sic) [absence] of retirement-eligible incentive costs. 
Compared to Q2 '15, the difference is driven by a number of factors: first, a negative NII market-related adjustment in this quarter versus a large positive adjustment in Q2 '15. Second, we had reps and warranty recoveries in Q2 '15 related to a court ruling and gains on the sale of consumer real estate loans. Third, provision expense declined from Q2 '15, driven by continued portfolio improvement. 
The effective tax rate for the quarter was about 29%, which is in line with what we expect for the remainder of the year, absent any unusual items. And as a reminder, we still expect to record a tax charge of about $350 million, most likely in 3Q, that reduces the carrying value of our U.K. DTAs as a result of U.K. tax reform announced last year. The vast majority of this charge will not impact regulatory capital. 
Okay. So let me offer a few takeaways as I finish. Q2 was another quarter of solid progress in a challenging global environment. While growth concerns persist in many countries, the U.S. economy continues to steadily improve, albeit at a less-than-optimum pace. The diversity and strength of our franchise makes us more relevant to clients and customers during times such as these, and you can see that in our results. 
Clearly, interest rates affected our financial performance this quarter. Still, while we cannot control interest rates, we are not waiting for them to rise. We grew in this environment by focusing on the things that we can control and drive. We grew deposits. We grew loans. We managed risk well, reflected in reduced charge-offs. We delivered for customer clients in another challenging quarter, especially around the U.K. referendum. We invested in our future by adding sales professionals and continuing to deploy technology that improves customer satisfaction. We returned capital to shareholders, and we announced plans to return increasing amounts. And we did all of this while we lowered expenses and drove operating leverage. 
Thank you. With that, let's open it up for questions."

I will definitely answer your question, but I want to emphasize again we're talking about LTM $56 billion going to $53 billion and absorbing in that merit, health care, inflation and other investment. And the first thing I would point out as you sort of think about the credibility of that, look at what we accomplished over the last 5 years. From Q2 '11 to Q2 '16, we've reduced quarterly expenses by $4.8 billion. That's a $19 billion annualized run rate, so -- and we did this by not only reducing legacy mortgage-related expenses, which were only -- make up about $2 billion of that $4.8 billion, but just through good expense management in every major category across the company. So from here, it's about a number of things. A lot of those things have been identified through our Simplify and Improve initiative. We're investing in technology and capabilities to improve efficiency. The most obvious example of that you can see is in the increasing adoption of customers for digital channels. But I do want to emphasize that it is about making progress across the entire company from our leaders and our teams. So if you look in consumer, there are examples, the digital adoption, we've got mobile users up 15% to over 20 million. When they make a deposit, that's 1/10 the cost. We've got digital sales up 12% year-over-year. We've got more customers using digital statements. A lot more work to do there with the transition from paper to electronic. We are optimizing the coverage model in both consumer and GWIM, and they all have goals. We all have goals and initiatives around controllable expenses, including travel, supply, support costs. If you look at Global Banking and Global Markets, we're simplifying our legal entity structure and business model. We're integrating wholesale credit origination and processing across the lines of businesses. We're centralizing data platforms. We're expanding electronic capabilities. And we're optimizing the coverage model. So there's a lot going on. And we're going to need all of it to get to our goals."

You can see that even in markets, year-over-year we're down 7% in people, where revenue went up. So it's electronification of the fixed income platform and the equities platform, continuing down that road. So every single area is moving here. And then you also have to think about the stability of the platform. This company has now been operating with a consistent strategy and a consistent ability to execute for many years. And what's gone with the legacy and stuff, that just allows us to keep operating on ourselves. And we always have performed best in history when we had that period of time of no acquisitions, no divestitures, no legacy asset servicing. So we're very confident that it'll happen. On revenue, I'd say look at it year-over-year, look at it linked quarter. So last 3 or 4 quarters, you're seeing revenue stable. And while it bounces around with market activity in a given quarter, the core revenue continues to go forward and the expenses keep coming down on a core basis. So we're comfortable that -- there's nothing -- we won't allow our people under our responsible growth to give us cost saves and not grow the business. So it has to be sustainable. It has to be actually taking out real work and yet still investing in more client-facing teammates, more salespeople and more technology capabilities for customers."

But the charge-offs were running tens of billions of dollars more a year than we have now. So a lot of that revenue was just going off the back end. So if you look at it from a risk-adjusted basis, I think we grew from the low 60s to the low 80s over the last 5 or 6 years. So that is actually the work that gets done. So we could -- going back to the point, we focus on very high credit quality, so we keep that credit cost moving in the right direction or stable when the world's gone a different way. We don't have a target efficiency ratio. You can calculate one -- off that out in '18 because as we talked about earlier, the NII differences will be driven by where rates go to some degree. But the idea is we're going to take expenses from $56 billion in the last 4 quarters to $53 billion. We think that's where we'll get them to. And if rates stay stable or go up a little bit, you'll see a lower efficiency ratio. Right now, we're running about 62% this quarter, fairly stated. And we think we can push it down from there."

MBI line was down year-over-year. That was planned for. We knew that was coming. I just want to walk -- [indiscernible] I just want to walk through kind of why it's down, and then we could talk a little bit about going forward. So kind of 4 items. First, we sold an appraisal business last year. So there was revenue in last year's second quarter that isn't in this quarter. Second, we had some servicing sales in the second quarter of last year for a gain that we didn't have this quarter. Third and probably most significant from a revenue perspective is that we had the ACE decision in the second quarter last year. So we released last year some reps and warranties. And that was a significant amount of benefit last year. And then fourth and probably strategically most important and the point you're getting to is we are selling less mortgages, choosing instead to hold them on our balance sheet. And obviously, this decreases MBI but increases NII over time, so -- and plus you have to note that, as we just talked about, servicing -- bad servicing is going to continue to run off. So if servicing is running off and not being replaced as fast, if we're holding more mortgages on the balance sheet as we transition from MBI to NII, you could see that line continue sort of trend lower. In terms of the mortgages, I think in the short term, it's going to be fairly stable and that trend is going to -- this is a good base this quarter. It's a good base to sort of start from. I think that trend lower is going to be in some quarters very slow because, as you point out, other items -- other line items are a little bit messy and bounce around there, depending on what happens on interest rates. But that's the trend. In terms of what we're trying to accomplish, all of the loans we originate that are nonconforming, we would like to keep on our balance sheet. And even the conforming loans that have a certain characteristic, we're going to be holding on our balance sheet. So right now, that's around 75-ish percent of the loans we're originating are going on our balance sheet. Is that helpful?"

And despite both of those circumstances, we think in the out-years, we can grow NII, or in the out-quarters, we can grow NII because we're growing deposits and we're putting them to work where we can within our risk and client frameworks to grow well-priced loans. Any amount of deposit that doesn't go to our clients and customers, we're sticking in the securities portfolio and getting as much yield as we can get there within the constraints of liquidity and capital risk and interest rate risk. So we think we can grow in even a flat interest rate environment, grow the NII line, not necessarily in the next quarter but as we again move out into the future.

In other words, there's these bubble charts which show what will happen to net interest income if interest rates go up 100 basis points. There's nothing which says what happens to earnings if you see a 5% increase in loans. In other words, what is more important? I mean, in the old days, people would show these charts if you hold interest rates flat and volume goes up. What happens to earnings if you get a 5% increase in lending as a result of interest rates staying so low?"

Before I turn the call over to Brian and Paul, let me remind you we may make some forward-looking statements. For further information on these, please refer to either our earnings release documents, our website or our SEC filings.
One thing before Brian and Paul get into the results, I just want to remind you we filed an 8-K on October 4, giving notification the company changed our method of accounting for the amortization of premium and accretion of discounts related to certain debt securities. It's known by the investment community as FAS 91. Our change to the contractual method, which is used by the majority of our peers, will provide better comparability of our results. As a result of that change, we restated our historical results and provided the historically restated information in the 8-K, and our earnings materials today naturally reflect those restatements. 
With that, let me turn it over to Brian Moynihan, our Chairman and CEO, for some opening comments; before Paul Donofrio, our CFO, goes through the details. Brian?"
19049,379148171,1055772,"Bank of America Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 17, 2016",2016-10-17,"Earnings Calls","Bank of America Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Lee. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to review our third quarter results. Our results this quarter continue our progress on our long-term strategy. We continue to drive responsible growth and deliver more of the com",1549,"Thank you, Lee. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to review our third quarter results. 
Our results this quarter continue our progress on our long-term strategy. We continue to drive responsible growth and deliver more of the company's capabilities to our clients and customers. This progress is becoming clear with each successive quarter, and you can see the highlights of that on Slide 2. 
We reported earnings of $5 billion or $0.41 per diluted share, an EPS improvement of 8% from the year-ago quarter. We improved operating leverage across the businesses, utilizing technology to lower costs and improve our processes. Our pretax earnings improved 17% compared to third quarter 2015. This pretax earnings comparison is important as it eliminates the unusual movements in the tax line like this quarter's tax charge for the U.K. corporate tax rate change. 
Like last quarter, I thought I'd address a few topics we're hearing from all of you. To do that, let's look at Slides 3 and 4 of the earnings material. A first question is: Are we making progress driving our responsible growth strategy? Yes, we continue to show progress throughout all the businesses. Our revenue growth has more clarity as we move past the periods of significant impacts from implementing regulations, running off noncore portfolios and divesting noncore businesses. 
Revenue grew 3% over the third quarter of last year. Behind that improvement is our continuing investment in this great franchise, in our sales teams, in our technology across the board. These sales teams and the buildup we've been doing there helps us to increase our capacity to serve our customers and clients. 
An example of that is in our consumer business. They are focused on being the core bank to all our households. This has resulted in fewer checking accounts than we had years ago. But the average balance of the checking accounts we has -- have has doubled, and they are now roughly at $6,500 per account. 
You can also see this in the growth of our Merrill Edge brokerage balances, which now total over -- at $138 billion, adding investment relationships to the mass market customer base. In general, consumers are deepening their relationships with us as they use our straightforward investing tools to get them started on the path to investing. 
For our affluent and wealthy customers, our customer progress also continues. Our Global Wealth and Investment Management teams, U.S. Trust and Merrill Lynch not only manage $2 trillion-plus in investment balances but also manage nearly $150 billion in loans and more than $250 billion in deposits, and we continue to see net flows of core asset in that business. 
On the commercial side, clients continue to respond to our universal banking model for a simplified staff for financing, investing and advisory services. We will continue to operate within our established risk framework and defined customer groups, and we are reaching for growth. This will drive more sustainable results over a period -- longer period of time for our shareholders. 
And then with our global peers restructuring, including in the markets business, I think this quarter is another great example of our global business -- Global Markets business' importance to our investing and issuing clients. We saw better client activity driving the best third quarter results we've had in 5 years in investment banking and in sales and trading, and we're doing that with a smaller balance sheet, fewer people and lower value at risk or VaR. So growth and deepening, all consistent with our responsible growth strategy, continues across all the customer bases. Paul will talk to you more about the statistics in these successes. 
Another question that we get asked is: Can credit remain this strong? Well, many of you asked that last quarter and the quarter before that and the quarter before that. In this quarter, it's still got better again, with our charge-off ratio declining to 40 basis points this quarter, at a historic low. This is driven by changes we made right after the crisis, thinking 2008 and 2009, and the long-term benefits of that effort continue to come through; and, by the way, sticking to our responsible growth strategy even as times have been relatively better. 
U.S. consumer health is generally good. Over the past few quarters, exposures in our oil and gas that were causing industry concerns for commercial losses have improved, and charge-offs have receded. Other commercial credit remains very strong, and Paul will touch on these topics later. 
Another question we get asked is: What can we do to drive earnings even if we stay in this low rate, low growth environment? We aren't waiting for interest rates to rise here at Bank of America. We're driving our earnings growth now. We work on the things that we can control: expenses, loan and deposit growth and fee growth. Long-term rates are down compared to last year yet earnings have grown. Despite that, net interest income is up 3% from third quarter '15 while net interest yield has been stable because we grew core loans and deposits. 
Paul will take you through a loan growth details later, but I wanted to pause a moment and talk about our deposit growth. Deposits are a core part of what drives our franchise earnings. We have $1.2 trillion of deposits. That's proof that customers entrust us to safeguard their money. We are heavily weighted in the mix of those deposits towards consumers, whether they're general consumers or wealthy consumers. This, in turn, provides a very stable base of funding for the company and allows us to be less reliant on the markets for funding. 
Nearly $450 billion or 36% of our deposits are noninterest-bearing, a very strong mix. Deposits on average grew $68 billion year-over-year or 6%. The teams have done tremendous work here, and this quarter wasn't an anomaly. This is the fourth consecutive quarter we have grown -- where we have grown deposits more than $50 billion over the previous year. 
But our commercial teams remain focused on growing deposits also. They're growing deposits that are LCR-friendly and doing great work with our industry-leading cash management capabilities. As a result, year-over-year, Global Banking grew their deposits 3% to $300 billion. Our consumer and wealth management teams combined have $860 billion in deposits. They grew this large base by 8% in the past 12 months. For the first time, consumer topped $600 billion in deposits. 
These deposits are growing because our capabilities in the business are the best in the industry and our customers and clients see that, whether it's our 21 million-plus mobile banking customers, our 34 million-plus online customers or the more than 5 million customers that come into our financial centers every week. These customers show that they appreciate the capabilities of integration of our networks. 
So when we look at what else we can do to control and drive earnings in a low growth environment, we get asked a lot about expenses. And can those expenses keep being driven down and go lower? Well, the answer is yes. Last quarter, we gave you a 2018 expense target, and we continue to make progress towards that. Our expenses declined 3% from third quarter 2015 to 2016. Our efficiency ratio improved 62% -- to 62% this quarter. That is a 400 basis point improvement from last year's third quarter. 
We continue to deliver on expense reductions while continuing to invest in technology, in sales teams and other matters that are important for the future of this franchise. After you take into account the additional large bank FDIC assessment that started this quarter, expense is also down on a linked-quarter basis even as we continue to invest and absorb all the severance, regulatory, resolution planning and other repositioning costs to continue to reduce our operating costs. We have been innovating in technology, and we'll continue to do so to improve processes and eliminate the need for paper and humans handling that paper. 
Our Simplify and Improve initiatives continue to help drive those costs down, and that leads to the question we also get asked: Can we deliver and sustain returns above our cost of capital? As Lee talked about earlier, we restated our results to change under FAS 91 and reduce the variability and make us more comparable to peers. As you can see, that makes a little easier to see the longer-term return on tangible common equity trends. This quarter, we reported 10.3% and is now stabilized above the cost of capital even given our larger and larger capital base. We still have work to do here to drive it to our ultimate goals, but this quarter is another strong step in that direction. 
And importantly, on Slide 4, you can see that each business has improved its leverage. It grew -- they grew their earnings, had strong efficiency and return far above the cost of capital, and all that continues to bode well as we look ahead. So as we look forward, we are driving responsible growth and maintaining discipline in costs. And this has allowed us to deliver more capital back to you, and we'll keep on doing that. 
Now let me turn it over to Paul for -- to cover the numbers. Paul?"
19049,379148171,1055772,"Bank of America Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 17, 2016",2016-10-17,"Earnings Calls","Bank of America Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Brian. Good morning, everybody. Since Brian covered the income statement highlights, I will start with the balance sheet on Page 5. Strong deposit growth drove a small increase in the size of our balance sheet versus Q2. Deposits rose $17 billio",3529,"Thanks, Brian. Good morning, everybody. Since Brian covered the income statement highlights, I will start with the balance sheet on Page 5. 
Strong deposit growth drove a small increase in the size of our balance sheet versus Q2. Deposits rose $17 billion or 6% on an annualized basis. During the quarter, long-term debt fell by $5 billion. We put cash to work, growing securities and our investment portfolio and, more modestly, through loan growth. Global liquidity sources rose, driven by deposit growth, and we remain well compliant with LCR requirements. 
Tangible common equity of $174 billion improved by $2.8 billion from Q2, driven by earnings. In the process, we returned $2.2 billion in common shareholders -- to common shareholders through a combination of dividends and $1.4 billion in share repurchases. On a per-share basis, tangible book value increased to $17.14, up $1.60 or 11% from Q3 '15. I would note that this increase was driven by both retained earnings as well as share repurchases below tangible book value as we reduced shares 3% from Q3 '15. 
Turning to regulatory metrics. As a reminder, we report capital under the advanced approaches. Our CET1 transition ratio under Basel III ended the quarter at 11%. On a fully phased-in basis, CET1 capital improved $4 billion to $166 billion. Under the advanced approaches, compared to Q2 '16, with -- our CET1 ratio increased 40 basis points to 10.9% and is well above our 10% 2019 requirement. RWA declined roughly $20 billion, driven by reductions in Global Markets exposures and improvements in credit quality driven by runoff of noncore legacy exposure. 
We also improved our capital metrics under the standardized approach. Here, our CET1 ratio improved to 11.8%. Supplementary leverage ratios for both parent and bank continue to exceed U.S. regulatory minimums that take effect in 2018. 
Turning to Slide 6. On an average basis, total loans were up $23 billion or 3% from Q3 '15. And while up from Q2 '16, growth was at a slower pace. Consistent with past periods, we break out loans in our business segments and in All Other. Year-over-year, loans in All Other were down $30 billion, driven by continued runoff of first and second-lien mortgages, while loans in our business segments were up $53 billion or 7%. 
In Consumer Banking, we continue to see growth in residential real estate and vehicle lending, offset somewhat by home equity paydowns, which continue to outpace originations. In wealth management, we saw growth in residential real estate and structured lending. Global Banking loans were up $26 billion or 8% year-over-year. On the bottom right of the chart, note the growth of $68 billion in average deposits that Brian mentioned. 
Turning to asset quality on Slide 7. We believe a number of factors, including our strategy of responsible growth, enhanced underwriting standards since 2008 and a healthier economy, have transformed the risk profile of Bank of America as we look forward to future economic cycles. Total net charge-offs of 100 -- of $888 million improved $97 million from Q2. 
Consumer losses declined across a number of products, and commercial losses also declined, driven by lower energy losses. Driven by these improvements, provision expense of $850 million declined $126 million from Q2. We had a small overall net reserve release in the quarter as Consumer Real Estate releases more than offset builds in other products. 
On Slide 8, we provide credit quality data on our consumer portfolio. We remain focused on originating consumer loans with borrowers with high FICO Scores, and our asset quality remains strong. Net charge-offs declined $71 million from Q2. This improvement was broad-based across Consumer Real Estate as well as credit card. 
Note that credit cards accounts for more than 2/3 of losses in our consumer portfolio. And within our U.S. credit card book, the loss rate improved to 2.45%, NPLs improved and reserve coverage remained strong. 
Moving to commercial credit on Slide 9. Net charge-offs of $110 million improved $26 million from Q2. With respect to energy, exposures were down, losses improved, oil prices have stabilized, and we have $1 billion of reserves. More specifically, energy charge-offs of $45 billion decreased $34 billion from Q2. While reservable criticized declined from Q2, we did experience an increase in NPLs this quarter, which was concentrated with 2 clients, one in metals and mining and one in energy. 
Overall, our commercial portfolio continues to perform well. As I shared with you last quarter, the metrics in the commercial portfolio speak for themselves in terms of quality and performance. The reservable criticized exposure declined and, as a percentage of loans, remains low. The commercial net charge-off ratio is 10 basis points. Excluding small business, it is 5 basis points and has been around 15 basis points or better for 15 consecutive quarters. And the NPL ratio remains low at 45 basis points. 
Turning to Slide 10. Net interest income on a GAAP non-FTE basis was $10.2 billion, $10.4 billion on an FTE basis. As we mentioned earlier, we changed our accounting method for the amortization of premium or discount paid on certain of our debt securities from the prepayment method to the contractual method. The contractual method is used by our peers and should make it easier for investors to make comparisons.  Compared to Q3 '15, NII is up $300 million or 3% as loan growth, higher short-end rates and higher security balances funded by deposits more than offset the negative impact of generally lower long-end rates over the past several quarters. 
Okay. With respect to asset sensitivity, as of 9/30, an instantaneous 100 basis point parallel increase in rates is estimated to increase NII by $5.3 billion over the subsequent 12 months. This is lower than the sensitivity we reported at June 30. The reduction was mostly on the long end, driven by the change to the contractual method and slower prepaid speeds based upon recent trends in customer behavior. Note that the sensitivity on the short end at $3.3 billion has not changed significantly. 
Turning to Slide 11. Noninterest expense was $13.5 billion. That's $0.5 billion lower or 3% lower than Q3 '15, driven by cost reductions across the company. This is the initial quarter of the increased FDIC assessment to shore up the deposit insurance fund. The increase in expense for us is roughly $100 million per quarter. Compared to Q2 '16, expenses were stable as good core expense control was offset by the higher FDIC costs and modestly higher incentives. Q3 litigation expense was $250 million, which is fairly consistent with both Q3 '15 as well as Q2 '16. 
Most expense categories were lower year-over-year. This trend was led by personnel expense, which includes the Q4 '15 expiration of the fully amortized advisory awards in Wealth Management. The rest of the improvement was driven by reduced costs of mortgage servicing, coupled with SIM efforts and other initiatives. Our employee base is down 3% from Q3 of '15. While the overall headcount is down, it's important to note that year-over-year, we added over 1,000 primary sales associates across Consumer, Wealth Management and Global Banking.
Turning to the business segments and starting with Consumer Banking on Slide 12. Consumer earned $1.8 billion, continuing its trend of solid results and reporting a robust 21% return on allocated capital. I would note that pretax, pre-provision earnings rose $377 million or 10%. Expense and NII improvement were both notable and, together, enough to more than offset higher provision expense and prior year divestiture gains. 
Revenue was relatively flat on a reported basis compared to Q3 '15 as 4% growth in NII was offset, as I said, by the absence of approximately $200 million of divestiture gains in Q3 '15. As a reminder, these gains in Q3 '15 resulted from divestitures of an ancillary appraisal business, a card portfolio and some financial centers. Excluding those prior period gains, revenue improved year-over-year, and growth in pretax, pre-provision earnings was even more substantial. Falling 400 basis points, Consumer Banking's efficiency ratio of 55% improved meaningfully year-over-year.
Okay. Turning to Slide 13 and key trends. First, on the upper left, the stats are a reminder of our strong competitive position. Looking a little closer at revenue drivers compared to Q3 '15. Net interest income continued to improve as we drove deposits higher. Average deposits continued their strong growth, up $50 billion or 9% year-over-year, outpacing the industry. 
With respect to noninterest income, service charges were up modestly while card income was down. Spending levels and issuance were strong, but revenue growth was muted by customer rewards. We are attracting relatively higher-quality card customers that, on the one hand, have higher spending habits but, on the other hand, receive more awards. This has 2 important benefits to note: first, rewards deepen relationships, helping to grow deposits and make them more sticky, for example. Second, in our experience, these customers have lower loss rates and a reduced need to interact with call centers, thereby allowing us to lower costs. 
Turning to expenses in the upper right. They climbed 7% from Q3 '15 despite -- excuse me, turning to expenses. They declined 7% from Q3 '15 despite the higher FDIC assessment charges in the quarter. Expense reductions are the result of a number of initiatives. For example, mobile banking penetration helps to optimize our delivery network while improving customer satisfaction. More chip cards help us lower fraud costs, and digitalization of processes and statements helps us eliminate paper and related handling costs. One can observe the impacts of these types of initiatives on the cost of deposits, which continued its march lower, dropping below 1.6% this quarter. 
Focusing on client balances on the left. In addition to deposit growth, Merrill Edge brokerage assets at $138 billion are up 18% versus Q3 '15 on strong account flows and market valuations. We also increased the number of Merrill Edge accounts by 11% from Q3 '15. We now have nearly 1.7 million households that leverage our financial solution advisers and self-directed investing platform. 
Moving across the bottom right of the page. Note that loans are up 7% from Q3 '15 on strong mortgage and vehicle lending growth. As reviewed in previous quarters, we continue to focus on originating high FICO Score loans, which have generally produced low loss rates and strong risk-adjusted returns. Loan growth included Consumer Real Estate production of $20.4 billion, up 21% from Q3 '15 and in line with Q2 '16 as customers continue to take advantage of historically low interest rates. 
We retained about 3/4 of first mortgage production on the balance sheet this quarter. Average vehicle loans were up 17% from Q3 '15, with average booked FICO Scores remaining well above 750 and net losses remaining below 30 basis points. With respect to U.S. card -- excuse me, U.S. consumer card, average balances grew 7% from Q2 on an annualized basis, aided by seasonal back-to-school lending. We issued more than 1.3 million cards in the quarter, and spending on credit cards, adjusted for divestitures, was up 8% compared to Q3 '15. 
Turning to Slide 14 and digital banking trends. As I mentioned earlier, we continue to see strong momentum in digital banking adoption with use across service, appointments and sales. Mobile banking is transforming how our customers bank and reshaping our consumer segment. Importantly, as adoption rises, particularly around transaction processing and self-service, we see improved efficiency and customer satisfaction. We continue to improve capabilities, with the latest example being the launch of our Spanish mobile app, which attracted over 800,000 active users in the first 10 weeks. We added roughly 1.1 million new mobile users in the quarter. 
The pace of user growth has increased despite an already impressive penetration rate of our checking account holders.  With more than 21.3 million active users, deposits from mobile devices now represent 18% of deposit transactions, and 26 million checks were deposited via mobile devices this quarter. That is an average of 280,000 deposits per day, an increase of 27% year-over-year and the equivalent to volume of 830 financial centers. Digital sales now represent 18% of total sales,  and we are now -- we now have more than 3,500 digital ambassadors in our financial centers driving further adoption. 
Also, as you know, we are a leader in person-to-person and person-to-business money movement through digital transfers and bill payment capabilities. Consumers moved $243 billion in Q3, up 6% from last year. And while all this is transformative, I would just remind you that we still have a little less than 1 million people per day walking into our centers across the U.S. This in-person interaction is important in terms of deepening and retaining personal relationships, providing more complex financial help and creating opportunities for further engagement. 
Turning to Slide 15. Global Wealth and Investment Management produced earnings of $697 million, up 10% from Q3 '15. Now it's no secret that this segment operates in an industry undergoing meaningful change as firms and clients adapt to the new fiduciary rules and other market dynamics. The good news is we start from a position of strength with $2.5 trillion in client balances. We have market-leading brands and a wide range of investment service offers, from self-service to fully managed. Plus we have the resources to continue to invest in market-leading capabilities that address the changing needs of our clients. 
Year-over-year, revenue was down modestly, but expenses were down even more, improving pretax margin to 25%, up meaningfully from Q3 '15. Overall, revenue declined 2% from Q3 '15 as NII growth was more than offset by lower transactional revenues. NII benefited from solid loan and deposit growth. Noninterest income declined from Q3 '15, driven by lower transactional revenue that continues to be impacted by market factors as well as migration of activity from brokerage to managed relationships. 
Noninterest expense declined nearly $313 million (sic) [ $213 million ] or 6% from Q3 '15, with half of that benefit derived from the expiration of the amortization of advisory retention awards that were put in place at the time of the Merrill Lynch merger. The rest of the improvement was the result of work across many categories of expense more than offsetting higher FDIC costs. 
Moving to Slide 16. We continue to see overall solid client engagement. Client balances approached $2.5 trillion and are up from Q2, including higher market valuations, $10 billion of long-term AUM flows and continued loan and deposit growth. Average deposits compared against Q3 '15 are up 4%, driven by growth in the second half of 2015. Compared to Q2, average deposits were impacted by seasonal tax payments. Average loans were up 7% year-over-year. Growth remain concentrated in Consumer Real Estate and structured lending. 
Lastly, earlier this month, we announced some innovations to our IRA products and services, which we believe positions us to better serve our clients given new fiduciary rules. These innovations are industry-leading and address not only the new fiduciary rules for retirement accounts but also client preference for more choice and new ways to invest. First, we announced the rollout of a new offering called Merrill Edge Guided Investing. This solution offers clients online investing, enhanced with professional portfolio management. With the addition of this solution, clients have 3 fundamental choices which they can mix and match to best meet their needs. Clients can invest online, completely self-directed through Merrill Edge; or if they are interested in enhanced portfolio -- enhanced professional portfolio management, they will be able to use Merrill Edge Guided Investing; or they can choose fully advised, working one on one with a financial adviser via brokerage or fee-based advisory platforms. 
We also announced that beginning in April 2017, for clients that choose to have a financial adviser provide advice with respect to their IRA accounts, we will provide this service to our fee-based advisory platform, Merrill Lynch One, as we believe this is the best way for us to deliver for IRA clients who choose to have this level of service and advice. Clients will also have the option to invest their retirement through Merrill Edge, either completely self-directed or through Merrill Edge Guided Investing. 
Turning to Slide 17. Global Banking earned $1.6 billion, which is up 22% year-over-year. Q3 reflects good revenue growth, solid cost control and solid client activity. The efficiency ratio improved to 45% in Q3. Compared to previous third quarters, investment banking fees this quarter were the highest since the merger with Merrill in 2009. Return on allocated capital was 17%, a 300 basis point improvement from Q3 '15, despite adding a couple of billion dollars of allocated capital this year. 
Global Banking continues to drive loan growth within its risk and client frameworks, producing solid year-over-year improvement in NII. Revenue growth also benefited from roughly $175 million from gains on FVO loans this quarter versus losses in Q3 '15. 
Higher treasury fees also added to revenue growth. The decrease in noninterest expense compared to Q3 '15 reflects good expense control that offset modestly higher revenue-related compensation and higher FDIC costs. 
Looking at the trends on Slide 18 and comparing Q3 -- and comparing to Q3 last year. Average loans on a year-over-year basis grew $26 billion or 8%. Growth was broad-based across large corporates as well as middle-market borrowers and diversified across most products. Having said that, as we noted last quarter, the pace of commercial loan growth has slowed over the past couple of quarters. Demand across the industry appears to have slowed as well. We remain diligent in certain sectors, such as commercial real estate and energy, and we are also closely monitoring certain international regions.  Average deposits increased from Q3 '15, up $10 billion or 3% from both new and existing clients. As we grow treasury services, we remain focused on quality deposits with respect to LCR. 
Switching to Global Markets on Slide 19. Let me start by reviewing what I said last quarter regarding this segment. The past few quarters are examples of the importance of this segment to not only its clients around the world, but also to the customers and clients of all our business segments. Again, this quarter, Global Markets delivered for clients by helping them raise capital, buy and sell securities as well as manage risk. We continue to invest in and enjoy leadership positions across a broad range of products. 
We believe this improves our sustainability -- we believe this improves the sustainability of our revenue and makes us more relevant to clients across the globe. We've been there for clients when they needed us across all these products. Our results this quarter reflect this strategy and continued commitment to clients. 
Global Markets earned $1.1 billion and returned 12% on allocated capital. Revenue was up appreciably year-over-year and even outpaced typical seasonality by posting modest improvement over Q2 '16. Total revenue, excluding DVA, was up 20% year-over-year on solid sales and trading results, which rose 18%. It's worth noting we achieved these results with slightly less balance sheet, lower VaR and 7% fewer people. Continued expense discipline drove costs 1% lower year-over-year as increases in revenue-related incentive were more than offset by reductions in operating and support costs. 
Moving to trends on Slide 20 and focusing on the components of our sales and trading performance. Sales and trading revenue of $3.7 billion, excluding DVA, was up 18% from Q3 '15, driven by FICC. In terms of revenue, this was the best third quarter in 5 years. 
Excluding DVA and versus Q3 '15, FICC sales and trading of $2.8 billion increased 39% as we built momentum as the quarter progressed across a host of credit products and continued gains in rates products. Mortgages showed particular strength among credit products as investors sought yield. Equity sales and trading was solid at $1 billion in revenue but declined 17% versus Q3 '15, which benefited from higher levels of market volatility and client activity. 
On Slide 21, we present All Other, which recorded a net loss of $182 million. This loss includes a previously disclosed tax charge of $350 million due to the third quarter U.K. enactment of a tax rate reduction, which reduced the value of our U.K. DTA. The loss in the current period compares to earnings of $152 million in Q3 '15 as lower security gains and higher expense litigation offset higher mortgage banking revenue. MBI revenue this quarter includes $280 million benefit from higher valuations on our MSR, driven by slower expected prepaid speeds based upon recent observed trends in customer behavior.
Okay. Let me offer a few takeaways as I finish. We reported solid results this quarter that were consistent with our strategy of responsible growth. We remain focused on delivering responsible growth as well as strengthening and simplifying Bank of America. Capital and liquidity strengthened. Asset quality remains strong. 
We grew revenue. We grew deposits. We grew loans. We delivered for clients and capital markets. We lowered costs. We invested in our future by adding sales professionals and deploying technology that helps customers better live their financial lives and improves satisfaction. And importantly, we returned more capital to our shareholders. 
With that, let's open it up to questions."

And I would also just point out, to remind everybody, that if you look at expenses over a longer term, we reduced quarterly expenses ex-litigation by $4.8 billion from Q3 '11. That's a $19 billion run rate. So if you think about what we will do between now and 2018, I think we talked about this before. Roughly 1/3 of that is going to come from continued progress on delinquent loan servicing. The other 2/3 is going to come from a lot of different initiatives across the company. We've talked about SIM, our Simplify and Improve initiative. We're going to be utilizing technology to digitize processes, eliminating handling costs. We're going to get technology efficiencies from our data centers consolidation and from more efficient servers. As I said, we're going to continue to make progress on delinquent loan servicing costs, hopefully see some modest improvement on litigation. A very important part of this is the shift to self-serve digital channels: mobile, online, ATM. So that's what the list sounds like, and it goes on and on. I would emphasize this shift to self-serve. We're seeing good momentum with more than 21 million mobile banking active users, and that's growing every week, every month. 18% of our deposit transactions are now completed through mobile devices. That's better for customers. It's also better for our shareholders. It's 1/10 the cost of walking into a branch. So it's all these things kind of put together. It's initiatives across the whole company. It's going to come a lot from support and operations, but there's a little bit in the front office as well as we get more efficient."

First of all, I think it's difficult to see share shifts in Global Markets in any given quarter. The fee pool is just not as transparent as they are in, let's say, investment banking fees or other areas. What we know is client activity was up in the third quarter, and that's what drives our short-term results. Over the longer term, one, it's easier just to assess what's going on with fee pools than share. So I just want to point out, from '14 to '15, on declining fee pools, we're pretty sure we improved our share. Third parties tell us that, and I think that share has come from a number of regions and a number of firms and a number of products as competitors adjust their strategies and capabilities. More specifically, we've been investing in rates for a number of years. I think we're making some progress there. We have a very strong credit platform. And as you know, I think we're making progress there relative to competitors around the world, and I think we're investing in equities. And I think you're -- equities revenue is down, but I think we're seeing improvement relative to the fee pool in equities as well. I do want to emphasize, very importantly, that our strategy is to have a diversified product portfolio across both FICC and equities and globally. That's what our clients need and want from us. And so you could see gains one quarter in one place and see something lower in another place, and that's okay with us. That's our strategy. It's about what the client needs in any given quarter. If we have -- if we're doing a little bit worse in one place, we're probably doing better in another place."

On the fee side, what you're seeing is the dynamic and especially consumer fee areas finally turn a little bit stable and then turning for us for the card revenue and things like that, which would hit the inflection point, where the run down in relative interchange due to selling some portfolios and getting out of noncore portfolios and putting on the core portfolios was rewards attached to it helps generate deposit things like that have stabilized and starting to see last few quarters card income start to move up a bit. And on service charges, it's been relatively stable. So the fee side will be driven more by Wealth Management markets and things like that and consumer stable, which is good because it had been a drag for a long time."

And that in part is because we are still getting the benefits of the changes made 6, 7, 8 years ago coming through the consumer business, i.e., that what we call back portfolios or legacy portfolios or whatever word you want to use continue to run off with higher credit risk in them, and we keep putting on and have put on and continue to put on higher credit quality. So I think if you think about overall charge-offs of 8 80 [ph] this quarter, that's driven by the consumer business and that's driven by the card and some of the legacy home equities. And so keeping the card business where we want it is critical, and you're seeing this continue even as we start to grow that portfolio both nominally and rate to charge off picture strong, and so when you go back and look at what happened during the crisis, the charge-offs came abnormally from the edges of credit, and we've keep ourselves out of that."

So they aren't going to reprice. The great debate is about what's the -- how sticky are those. And if you think about that, those are dominated by our consumer business, and our noninterest-bearing accounts in consumer have doubled in size over the last 5 or 6 years due to focusing on primary accounts. We're up to 90% primary accounts in the household where they run their household finances through our account, and therefore, the direct deposit are check and things like that. So the first thing to remember is of $1.2 trillion, $450 billion noninterest-bearing and a dominant part of that consumer and also in the Wealth Management and the core transactional account of both consumers and then on business side, similarly we had given our deposits to be really LCR friendly and core operating accounts. And so those aren't going to move, the noninterest-bearing not going to move much, and the big debate is how much balance will be in there, and we feel confident about the balance will stay because nature of the accounts. And then when you go to second dynamic remember that even with all those deposit growth, one thing is we continue to do the impact is less and less is we are, especially in consumer business running off CDs still at a fairly decent clip that were historically used to fund prior companies balance sheet that we don't need the funding of that cost. So we have some rollover, but that continues to decline, that weighted average cost drops off -- that cost drops off and drives down or hold steady the weighted average. And then if you look at money markets and other interest bearing, really haven't moved much. So we feel good about the consumer. We forget about the deposit base overall. We feel very good about the consumer deposit base just cross $600 billion for the first time in the company's history and consumer generally. And over that, I think we look if rates rise, we think that it's a substantial value for the company and Paul gave you way to think about that earlier with a quarter of $3.3 billion, 25% of $3.3 billion."

However, I think just focusing on the fee income, this is some really key benefits of our strategy, which is to attract relatively higher quality core customers or reward them for deepening their overall relationships with us. This strategy really drives deposit growth and mixed deposits stickier plus we believe these customers have lower loss rates. They used call center less, which help us lower costs. I think when you want to see the effect of this, you have to look at the overall consumer segment and what's going on there in terms of growth of profits and improvement in expenses, and this the last thing I'd point out is look, our risk adjusted margins on card are strong at over 9%.

The interesting question is are you give up something you'd never have in rewards bringing more customer relationships and get to something so incrementally interchange is actually there as opposed to what theoretically you get gross interchange with noncustomer in the affinity programs. So we focus on entire customer relationship. It is very valuable. It is profitable and believe me, if we could grow it faster responsibly, we would but the idea is just to grind out the slow, steady growth, and we're starting to see that come through and largely it was masked in '14, '15 and behind that '13, those areas because we are divesting a lot of noncore relationships and now we have a core energy, we have core card business."

So we run our consumer business consistent with responsible growth for the company, and that -- what that means is that you focus on deepening relationships what we call stairstep or it's the core deposit account, core credit card going to get used and the core mortgage and the core home equity and the core auto loans. That's what we've been driving and can do to drive that. That's the backbone of what we did and how we repositioned this company over many years. In terms of the branches, Mike, you off all those statistics, which Paul talked about earlier, but it is a complex optimization, but it all starts with the consumer. What is the consumer going to do? And so well, 18% of deposits are made by mobile deposits, 82% by their nature aren't. And where do they go? About 50 percentage points of that go through the ATM machines and about another 30-odd percent go through the teller lines still today. So you have to be ready and able to serve in all dynamics, and so what we continue to do is optimize the branch structure, the call structure, the ATM structure, the mobile structure and the online structure altogether, and a way to think about that optimization and why this extremely important business to this company is that we've gone from 300 basis points of the cost of all that to deposits to about 150 over the last 6, 7 years. And that's by continuing to optimize the physical plant as well as the other tool means. And so if you ask me the question is, is how far can go, you have to also then think about what we want to go on branch. So if you look back at some of the statistics that Paul had in the deck had for consumer, where you see things like appointments set up so or 340,000 in the third quarter. So just think about that 340,000 times a customer went on a mobile phone and asked to come to a branch, and so we need those branches to receive those mobile phone customers and why are they coming usually for a much more important financial transaction to them then handing us a check for deposit, and so it's a quality versus quantity and making sure we understand that. So we are optimizing all those and you can see on Page 14 on the lower right, you see the difference moves. I'd say we went from 7 million visits probably 4, 5 years ago to 6 million to 5 million. But those 5 million are of higher quality, and we think that's an important and there's certain transactions and certain capabilities you just had to have at your branch you just have to do face-to-face difficult things like how to get power of attorney for a parent that's sick or I want to do a mortgage, it's still difficult to do it through the phone and things like that. So we'll have all aspects. We'll drive it down, and you can see that we continue to make progress."

You're talking more revenue, but we look at profit, and so to get the profit we needed to have fixed income and equities business. We had to take the cost structure down, which we did in '10 and '11. Tom Montag and the team worked very hard at that and got sort of breakeven down over $1 billion a quarter, and then we run along a number years and the actually taken out year-over-year, you can see the cost continue to be managed well despite higher revenue. So I would say taking the discussion I'd say that the way our fixed income business generates revenue, a lot of it is around our capabilities in underwriting, our capabilities in all of the different variations from high grade to leverage to everything that goes on, and that's a relatively stable pool of revenue that you see repeated. And what goes up or down is really the activity around that based on the markets easing up in certain quarters in terms of issuance and things like that. When you think about the other thing that Tom and the team that we really go after which is to broaden our capabilities in the macro segment a little bit because that was something that traditionally the Bank of America Merrill Lynch teams came together, and he's done that. So that added some more volume to us. So we think we've been gaining share as Paul said earlier when you look at revenue comparison among the top 10 banks without [indiscernible] we charges just revenue we think that we did it's driven by our fixed income capabilities, and it's driven by our connectivity from the issuer of bonds and debt to the investor. And we'll continue to drive that. And so the teams did a good job in I'd say we're at a fundamental level. Well, this quarter feels better than last year's quarter. It's not a quarter that when you look across 4 or 5 years that we haven't come close to on many cases and have achieved, but have done better a few times."

Most people think about credit card hope fraud and fraud is a broad word. Arguments about whether the charge was valid, whether a merchant and things like that and so there's a long history of adjudicating that. So as we more and more sales go online by the consumer, the techniques for online continuing to develop. At face to face or point of sale, the chip cards when we're largely through all our customers having chip cards, merchant what we call chip on chip, our chip cards used with a merchants chip machine is rising sort of a percent or so a quarter and is now as best we judge it in the 30s, the high 20s or something like that, Nancy. So all that being said, we expect to get leverage in our fraud losses in the consumer business year-over-year, and we expect that to continue to come down, and so yes, that is a major initiative for us to continue to drive that down. Part of it's education consumers. Part of it's getting the chip cards enhanced and getting the machine merchants using the chip machine, part of it is wallets and things that go on in these Visa check out and all the variations in MasterCard and getting because that's a tokenized better execution and is more secure. And so our view as a provider has been to adopt all these wallets technologies that have this tokenization capabilities and that then drives down the cost of losses due to merchant complaints and other types of things. So you're absolutely right. Cybersecurity yes, that cards from other people sold in the Internet, all that stuff is important to us, and so we spend as we said $0.5 billion [ph] a year protecting ourselves, and so part of it is making sure we understand, where our consumers are in terms of lost cards and things like that."

Obviously, we went through this a year or so ago, and we asked the shareholders, they voted on it. But the key is how we run the company, how we govern ourselves. So again, Paul's view of what he talked about responsible growth, one of the tenets is to be sustainable and sustainable growth has to be sustainable and involves things like get invest in the future but also involves how we govern the company and our board and the independents of our board, the experience of our board, how they approach their responsibilities, and it is very strong. And I think our shareholders have understood that and agreed with that, and so I think we govern ourselves in a very tough fashion, i.e., the boards demanding on us and understands the strategy and has helped support this strategy through sometimes when people would challenge it. And I think it's strategy at this point. And so if you get to technicalities, our Lead Independent Director is as strong as anybody in the industry. If you look at all the new governance surveys that come out, all the words about proper governance, all the different things that you've seen recently, we meet or exceed everything anybody says go to.

It cannot take risk, and so we are earning all our money on the 7%, and so when you think about the weighted average of that, that comes out over 10%, that means that you're in a lot more in the 7% even across the whole company, and so that's one of the difficulties. So how do we optimize that? We make that 10% less dollar volume. If we can keep moving dollar volume down and keep increasing earnings you can get that, that's my all of the discussion Paul had in response to earlier questions about optimizing the balance sheet or where we get expenses down or grow less risky earnings that can generate income, but it's a cost optimization but the basic principle people that we sometimes forget is that when you think about 10% on a 30% of capital can take no risk, and so basically you're earned your cost of debt."

  Good morning. Thanks to everyone on the phone as well as the webcast for joining us this morning for the third quarter 2016 results. Hopefully, everybody's had a chance to review the earnings release documents that are available on the website.
Before I turn the call over to Brian and Paul, let me remind you we may make some forward-looking statements. For further information on these, please refer to either our earnings release documents, our website or our SEC filings.
One thing before Brian and Paul get into the results, I just want to remind you we filed an 8-K on October 4, giving notification the company changed our method of accounting for the amortization of premium and accretion of discounts related to certain debt securities. It's known by the investment community as FAS 91. Our change to the contractual method, which is used by the majority of our peers, will provide better comparability of our results. As a result of that change, we restated our historical results and provided the historically restated information in the 8-K, and our earnings materials today naturally reflect those restatements. 
With that, let me turn it over to Brian Moynihan, our Chairman and CEO, for some opening comments; before Paul Donofrio, our CFO, goes through the details. Brian?"

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to review our third quarter results. Our results this quarter continue our progress on our long-term strategy. We continue to drive responsible growth and deliver more of",1549,":  
  Thank you, Lee. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to review our third quarter results. 
Our results this quarter continue our progress on our long-term strategy. We continue to drive responsible growth and deliver more of the company's capabilities to our clients and customers. This progress is becoming clear with each successive quarter, and you can see the highlights of that on Slide 2. 
We reported earnings of $5 billion or $0.41 per diluted share, an EPS improvement of 8% from the year-ago quarter. We improved operating leverage across the businesses, utilizing technology to lower costs and improve our processes. Our pretax earnings improved 17% compared to third quarter 2015. This pretax earnings comparison is important as it eliminates the unusual movements in the tax line like this quarter's tax charge for the U.K. corporate tax rate change. 
Like last quarter, I thought I'd address a few topics we're hearing from all of you. To do that, let's look at Slides 3 and 4 of the earnings material. A first question is: Are we making progress driving our responsible growth strategy? Yes, we continue to show progress throughout all the businesses. Our revenue growth has more clarity as we move past the periods of significant impacts from implementing regulations, running off noncore portfolios and divesting noncore businesses. 
Revenue grew 3% over the third quarter of last year. Behind that improvement is our continuing investment in this great franchise, in our sales teams, in our technology across the board. These sales teams and the buildup we've been doing there helps us to increase our capacity to serve our customers and clients. 
An example of that is in our consumer business. They are focused on being the core bank to all our households. This has resulted in fewer checking accounts than we had years ago. But the average balance of the checking accounts we has -- have has doubled, and they are now roughly at $6,500 per account. 
You can also see this in the growth of our Merrill Edge brokerage balances, which now total over -- at $138 billion, adding investment relationships to the mass market customer base. In general, consumers are deepening their relationships with us as they use our straightforward investing tools to get them started on the path to investing. 
For our affluent and wealthy customers, our customer progress also continues. Our Global Wealth and Investment Management teams, U.S. Trust and Merrill Lynch not only manage $2 trillion-plus in investment balances but also manage nearly $150 billion in loans and more than $250 billion in deposits, and we continue to see net flows of core asset in that business. 
On the commercial side, clients continue to respond to our universal banking model for a simplified staff for financing, investing and advisory services. We will continue to operate within our established risk framework and defined customer groups, and we are reaching for growth. This will drive more sustainable results over a period -- longer period of time for our shareholders. 
And then with our global peers restructuring, including in the markets business, I think this quarter is another great example of our global business -- Global Markets business' importance to our investing and issuing clients. We saw better client activity driving the best third quarter results we've had in 5 years in investment banking and in sales and trading, and we're doing that with a smaller balance sheet, fewer people and lower value at risk or VaR. So growth and deepening, all consistent with our responsible growth strategy, continues across all the customer bases. Paul will talk to you more about the statistics in these successes. 
Another question that we get asked is: Can credit remain this strong? Well, many of you asked that last quarter and the quarter before that and the quarter before that. In this quarter, it's still got better again, with our charge-off ratio declining to 40 basis points this quarter, at a historic low. This is driven by changes we made right after the crisis, thinking 2008 and 2009, and the long-term benefits of that effort continue to come through; and, by the way, sticking to our responsible growth strategy even as times have been relatively better. 
U.S. consumer health is generally good. Over the past few quarters, exposures in our oil and gas that were causing industry concerns for commercial losses have improved, and charge-offs have receded. Other commercial credit remains very strong, and Paul will touch on these topics later. 
Another question we get asked is: What can we do to drive earnings even if we stay in this low rate, low growth environment? We aren't waiting for interest rates to rise here at Bank of America. We're driving our earnings growth now. We work on the things that we can control: expenses, loan and deposit growth and fee growth. Long-term rates are down compared to last year yet earnings have grown. Despite that, net interest income is up 3% from third quarter '15 while net interest yield has been stable because we grew core loans and deposits. 
Paul will take you through a loan growth details later, but I wanted to pause a moment and talk about our deposit growth. Deposits are a core part of what drives our franchise earnings. We have $1.2 trillion of deposits. That's proof that customers entrust us to safeguard their money. We are heavily weighted in the mix of those deposits towards consumers, whether they're general consumers or wealthy consumers. This, in turn, provides a very stable base of funding for the company and allows us to be less reliant on the markets for funding. 
Nearly $450 billion or 36% of our deposits are noninterest-bearing, a very strong mix. Deposits on average grew $68 billion year-over-year or 6%. The teams have done tremendous work here, and this quarter wasn't an anomaly. This is the fourth consecutive quarter we have grown -- where we have grown deposits more than $50 billion over the previous year. 
But our commercial teams remain focused on growing deposits also. They're growing deposits that are LCR-friendly and doing great work with our industry-leading cash management capabilities. As a result, year-over-year, Global Banking grew their deposits 3% to $300 billion. Our consumer and wealth management teams combined have $860 billion in deposits. They grew this large base by 8% in the past 12 months. For the first time, consumer topped $600 billion in deposits. 
These deposits are growing because our capabilities in the business are the best in the industry and our customers and clients see that, whether it's our 21 million-plus mobile banking customers, our 34 million-plus online customers or the more than 5 million customers that come into our financial centers every week. These customers show that they appreciate the capabilities of integration of our networks. 
So when we look at what else we can do to control and drive earnings in a low growth environment, we get asked a lot about expenses. And can those expenses keep being driven down and go lower? Well, the answer is yes. Last quarter, we gave you a 2018 expense target, and we continue to make progress towards that. Our expenses declined 3% from third quarter 2015 to 2016. Our efficiency ratio improved 62% -- to 62% this quarter. That is a 400 basis point improvement from last year's third quarter. 
We continue to deliver on expense reductions while continuing to invest in technology, in sales teams and other matters that are important for the future of this franchise. After you take into account the additional large bank FDIC assessment that started this quarter, expense is also down on a linked-quarter basis even as we continue to invest and absorb all the severance, regulatory, resolution planning and other repositioning costs to continue to reduce our operating costs. We have been innovating in technology, and we'll continue to do so to improve processes and eliminate the need for paper and humans handling that paper. 
Our Simplify and Improve initiatives continue to help drive those costs down, and that leads to the question we also get asked: Can we deliver and sustain returns above our cost of capital? As Lee talked about earlier, we restated our results to change under FAS 91 and reduce the variability and make us more comparable to peers. As you can see, that makes a little easier to see the longer-term return on tangible common equity trends. This quarter, we reported 10.3% and is now stabilized above the cost of capital even given our larger and larger capital base. We still have work to do here to drive it to our ultimate goals, but this quarter is another strong step in that direction. 
And importantly, on Slide 4, you can see that each business has improved its leverage. It grew -- they grew their earnings, had strong efficiency and return far above the cost of capital, and all that continues to bode well as we look ahead. So as we look forward, we are driving responsible growth and maintaining discipline in costs. And this has allowed us to deliver more capital back to you, and we'll keep on doing that. 
Now let me turn it over to Paul for -- to cover the numbers. Paul?"

Thanks, Brian. Good morning, everybody. Since Brian covered the income statement highlights, I will start with the balance sheet on Page 5. 
Strong deposit growth drove a small increase in the size of our balance sheet versus Q2. Deposits rose $17 billion or 6% on an annualized basis. During the quarter, long-term debt fell by $5 billion. We put cash to work, growing securities and our investment portfolio and, more modestly, through loan growth. Global liquidity sources rose, driven by deposit growth, and we remain well compliant with LCR requirements. 
Tangible common equity of $174 billion improved by $2.8 billion from Q2, driven by earnings. In the process, we returned $2.2 billion in common shareholders -- to common shareholders through a combination of dividends and $1.4 billion in share repurchases. On a per-share basis, tangible book value increased to $17.14, up $1.60 or 11% from Q3 '15. I would note that this increase was driven by both retained earnings as well as share repurchases below tangible book value as we reduced shares 3% from Q3 '15. 
Turning to regulatory metrics. As a reminder, we report capital under the advanced approaches. Our CET1 transition ratio under Basel III ended the quarter at 11%. On a fully phased-in basis, CET1 capital improved $4 billion to $166 billion. Under the advanced approaches, compared to Q2 '16, with -- our CET1 ratio increased 40 basis points to 10.9% and is well above our 10% 2019 requirement. RWA declined roughly $20 billion, driven by reductions in Global Markets exposures and improvements in credit quality driven by runoff of noncore legacy exposure. 
We also improved our capital metrics under the standardized approach. Here, our CET1 ratio improved to 11.8%. Supplementary leverage ratios for both parent and bank continue to exceed U.S. regulatory minimums that take effect in 2018. 
Turning to Slide 6. On an average basis, total loans were up $23 billion or 3% from Q3 '15. And while up from Q2 '16, growth was at a slower pace. Consistent with past periods, we break out loans in our business segments and in All Other. Year-over-year, loans in All Other were down $30 billion, driven by continued runoff of first and second-lien mortgages, while loans in our business segments were up $53 billion or 7%. 
In Consumer Banking, we continue to see growth in residential real estate and vehicle lending, offset somewhat by home equity paydowns, which continue to outpace originations. In wealth management, we saw growth in residential real estate and structured lending. Global Banking loans were up $26 billion or 8% year-over-year. On the bottom right of the chart, note the growth of $68 billion in average deposits that Brian mentioned. 
Turning to asset quality on Slide 7. We believe a number of factors, including our strategy of responsible growth, enhanced underwriting standards since 2008 and a healthier economy, have transformed the risk profile of Bank of America as we look forward to future economic cycles. Total net charge-offs of 100 -- of $888 million improved $97 million from Q2. 
Consumer losses declined across a number of products, and commercial losses also declined, driven by lower energy losses. Driven by these improvements, provision expense of $850 million declined $126 million from Q2. We had a small overall net reserve release in the quarter as Consumer Real Estate releases more than offset builds in other products. 
On Slide 8, we provide credit quality data on our consumer portfolio. We remain focused on originating consumer loans with borrowers with high FICO Scores, and our asset quality remains strong. Net charge-offs declined $71 million from Q2. This improvement was broad-based across Consumer Real Estate as well as credit card. 
Note that credit cards accounts for more than 2/3 of losses in our consumer portfolio. And within our U.S. credit card book, the loss rate improved to 2.45%, NPLs improved and reserve coverage remained strong. 
Moving to commercial credit on Slide 9. Net charge-offs of $110 million improved $26 million from Q2. With respect to energy, exposures were down, losses improved, oil prices have stabilized, and we have $1 billion of reserves. More specifically, energy charge-offs of $45 billion decreased $34 billion from Q2. While reservable criticized declined from Q2, we did experience an increase in NPLs this quarter, which was concentrated with 2 clients, one in metals and mining and one in energy. 
Overall, our commercial portfolio continues to perform well. As I shared with you last quarter, the metrics in the commercial portfolio speak for themselves in terms of quality and performance. The reservable criticized exposure declined and, as a percentage of loans, remains low. The commercial net charge-off ratio is 10 basis points. Excluding small business, it is 5 basis points and has been around 15 basis points or better for 15 consecutive quarters. And the NPL ratio remains low at 45 basis points. 
Turning to Slide 10. Net interest income on a GAAP non-FTE basis was $10.2 billion, $10.4 billion on an FTE basis. As we mentioned earlier, we changed our accounting method for the amortization of premium or discount paid on certain of our debt securities from the prepayment method to the contractual method. The contractual method is used by our peers and should make it easier for investors to make comparisons.  Compared to Q3 '15, NII is up $300 million or 3% as loan growth, higher short-end rates and higher security balances funded by deposits more than offset the negative impact of generally lower long-end rates over the past several quarters. 
Okay. With respect to asset sensitivity, as of 9/30, an instantaneous 100 basis point parallel increase in rates is estimated to increase NII by $5.3 billion over the subsequent 12 months. This is lower than the sensitivity we reported at June 30. The reduction was mostly on the long end, driven by the change to the contractual method and slower prepaid speeds based upon recent trends in customer behavior. Note that the sensitivity on the short end at $3.3 billion has not changed significantly. 
Turning to Slide 11. Noninterest expense was $13.5 billion. That's $0.5 billion lower or 3% lower than Q3 '15, driven by cost reductions across the company. This is the initial quarter of the increased FDIC assessment to shore up the deposit insurance fund. The increase in expense for us is roughly $100 million per quarter. Compared to Q2 '16, expenses were stable as good core expense control was offset by the higher FDIC costs and modestly higher incentives. Q3 litigation expense was $250 million, which is fairly consistent with both Q3 '15 as well as Q2 '16. 
Most expense categories were lower year-over-year. This trend was led by personnel expense, which includes the Q4 '15 expiration of the fully amortized advisory awards in Wealth Management. The rest of the improvement was driven by reduced costs of mortgage servicing, coupled with SIM efforts and other initiatives. Our employee base is down 3% from Q3 of '15. While the overall headcount is down, it's important to note that year-over-year, we added over 1,000 primary sales associates across Consumer, Wealth Management and Global Banking.
Turning to the business segments and starting with Consumer Banking on Slide 12. Consumer earned $1.8 billion, continuing its trend of solid results and reporting a robust 21% return on allocated capital. I would note that pretax, pre-provision earnings rose $377 million or 10%. Expense and NII improvement were both notable and, together, enough to more than offset higher provision expense and prior year divestiture gains. 
Revenue was relatively flat on a reported basis compared to Q3 '15 as 4% growth in NII was offset, as I said, by the absence of approximately $200 million of divestiture gains in Q3 '15. As a reminder, these gains in Q3 '15 resulted from divestitures of an ancillary appraisal business, a card portfolio and some financial centers. Excluding those prior period gains, revenue improved year-over-year, and growth in pretax, pre-provision earnings was even more substantial. Falling 400 basis points, Consumer Banking's efficiency ratio of 55% improved meaningfully year-over-year.
Okay. Turning to Slide 13 and key trends. First, on the upper left, the stats are a reminder of our strong competitive position. Looking a little closer at revenue drivers compared to Q3 '15. Net interest income continued to improve as we drove deposits higher. Average deposits continued their strong growth, up $50 billion or 9% year-over-year, outpacing the industry. 
With respect to noninterest income, service charges were up modestly while card income was down. Spending levels and issuance were strong, but revenue growth was muted by customer rewards. We are attracting relatively higher-quality card customers that, on the one hand, have higher spending habits but, on the other hand, receive more awards. This has 2 important benefits to note: first, rewards deepen relationships, helping to grow deposits and make them more sticky, for example. Second, in our experience, these customers have lower loss rates and a reduced need to interact with call centers, thereby allowing us to lower costs. 
Turning to expenses in the upper right. They climbed 7% from Q3 '15 despite -- excuse me, turning to expenses. They declined 7% from Q3 '15 despite the higher FDIC assessment charges in the quarter. Expense reductions are the result of a number of initiatives. For example, mobile banking penetration helps to optimize our delivery network while improving customer satisfaction. More chip cards help us lower fraud costs, and digitalization of processes and statements helps us eliminate paper and related handling costs. One can observe the impacts of these types of initiatives on the cost of deposits, which continued its march lower, dropping below 1.6% this quarter. 
Focusing on client balances on the left. In addition to deposit growth, Merrill Edge brokerage assets at $138 billion are up 18% versus Q3 '15 on strong account flows and market valuations. We also increased the number of Merrill Edge accounts by 11% from Q3 '15. We now have nearly 1.7 million households that leverage our financial solution advisers and self-directed investing platform. 
Moving across the bottom right of the page. Note that loans are up 7% from Q3 '15 on strong mortgage and vehicle lending growth. As reviewed in previous quarters, we continue to focus on originating high FICO Score loans, which have generally produced low loss rates and strong risk-adjusted returns. Loan growth included Consumer Real Estate production of $20.4 billion, up 21% from Q3 '15 and in line with Q2 '16 as customers continue to take advantage of historically low interest rates. 
We retained about 3/4 of first mortgage production on the balance sheet this quarter. Average vehicle loans were up 17% from Q3 '15, with average booked FICO Scores remaining well above 750 and net losses remaining below 30 basis points. With respect to U.S. card -- excuse me, U.S. consumer card, average balances grew 7% from Q2 on an annualized basis, aided by seasonal back-to-school lending. We issued more than 1.3 million cards in the quarter, and spending on credit cards, adjusted for divestitures, was up 8% compared to Q3 '15. 
Turning to Slide 14 and digital banking trends. As I mentioned earlier, we continue to see strong momentum in digital banking adoption with use across service, appointments and sales. Mobile banking is transforming how our customers bank and reshaping our consumer segment. Importantly, as adoption rises, particularly around transaction processing and self-service, we see improved efficiency and customer satisfaction. We continue to improve capabilities, with the latest example being the launch of our Spanish mobile app, which attracted over 800,000 active users in the first 10 weeks. We added roughly 1.1 million new mobile users in the quarter. 
The pace of user growth has increased despite an already impressive penetration rate of our checking account holders.  With more than 21.3 million active users, deposits from mobile devices now represent 18% of deposit transactions, and 26 million checks were deposited via mobile devices this quarter. That is an average of 280,000 deposits per day, an increase of 27% year-over-year and the equivalent to volume of 830 financial centers. Digital sales now represent 18% of total sales,  and we are now -- we now have more than 3,500 digital ambassadors in our financial centers driving further adoption. 
Also, as you know, we are a leader in person-to-person and person-to-business money movement through digital transfers and bill payment capabilities. Consumers moved $243 billion in Q3, up 6% from last year. And while all this is transformative, I would just remind you that we still have a little less than 1 million people per day walking into our centers across the U.S. This in-person interaction is important in terms of deepening and retaining personal relationships, providing more complex financial help and creating opportunities for further engagement. 
Turning to Slide 15. Global Wealth and Investment Management produced earnings of $697 million, up 10% from Q3 '15. Now it's no secret that this segment operates in an industry undergoing meaningful change as firms and clients adapt to the new fiduciary rules and other market dynamics. The good news is we start from a position of strength with $2.5 trillion in client balances. We have market-leading brands and a wide range of investment service offers, from self-service to fully managed. Plus we have the resources to continue to invest in market-leading capabilities that address the changing needs of our clients. 
Year-over-year, revenue was down modestly, but expenses were down even more, improving pretax margin to 25%, up meaningfully from Q3 '15. Overall, revenue declined 2% from Q3 '15 as NII growth was more than offset by lower transactional revenues. NII benefited from solid loan and deposit growth. Noninterest income declined from Q3 '15, driven by lower transactional revenue that continues to be impacted by market factors as well as migration of activity from brokerage to managed relationships. 
Noninterest expense declined nearly $313 million (sic) [ $213 million ] or 6% from Q3 '15, with half of that benefit derived from the expiration of the amortization of advisory retention awards that were put in place at the time of the Merrill Lynch merger. The rest of the improvement was the result of work across many categories of expense more than offsetting higher FDIC costs. 
Moving to Slide 16. We continue to see overall solid client engagement. Client balances approached $2.5 trillion and are up from Q2, including higher market valuations, $10 billion of long-term AUM flows and continued loan and deposit growth. Average deposits compared against Q3 '15 are up 4%, driven by growth in the second half of 2015. Compared to Q2, average deposits were impacted by seasonal tax payments. Average loans were up 7% year-over-year. Growth remain concentrated in Consumer Real Estate and structured lending. 
Lastly, earlier this month, we announced some innovations to our IRA products and services, which we believe positions us to better serve our clients given new fiduciary rules. These innovations are industry-leading and address not only the new fiduciary rules for retirement accounts but also client preference for more choice and new ways to invest. First, we announced the rollout of a new offering called Merrill Edge Guided Investing. This solution offers clients online investing, enhanced with professional portfolio management. With the addition of this solution, clients have 3 fundamental choices which they can mix and match to best meet their needs. Clients can invest online, completely self-directed through Merrill Edge; or if they are interested in enhanced portfolio -- enhanced professional portfolio management, they will be able to use Merrill Edge Guided Investing; or they can choose fully advised, working one on one with a financial adviser via brokerage or fee-based advisory platforms. 
We also announced that beginning in April 2017, for clients that choose to have a financial adviser provide advice with respect to their IRA accounts, we will provide this service to our fee-based advisory platform, Merrill Lynch One, as we believe this is the best way for us to deliver for IRA clients who choose to have this level of service and advice. Clients will also have the option to invest their retirement through Merrill Edge, either completely self-directed or through Merrill Edge Guided Investing. 
Turning to Slide 17. Global Banking earned $1.6 billion, which is up 22% year-over-year. Q3 reflects good revenue growth, solid cost control and solid client activity. The efficiency ratio improved to 45% in Q3. Compared to previous third quarters, investment banking fees this quarter were the highest since the merger with Merrill in 2009. Return on allocated capital was 17%, a 300 basis point improvement from Q3 '15, despite adding a couple of billion dollars of allocated capital this year. 
Global Banking continues to drive loan growth within its risk and client frameworks, producing solid year-over-year improvement in NII. Revenue growth also benefited from roughly $175 million from gains on FVO loans this quarter versus losses in Q3 '15. 
Higher treasury fees also added to revenue growth. The decrease in noninterest expense compared to Q3 '15 reflects good expense control that offset modestly higher revenue-related compensation and higher FDIC costs. 
Looking at the trends on Slide 18 and comparing Q3 -- and comparing to Q3 last year. Average loans on a year-over-year basis grew $26 billion or 8%. Growth was broad-based across large corporates as well as middle-market borrowers and diversified across most products. Having said that, as we noted last quarter, the pace of commercial loan growth has slowed over the past couple of quarters. Demand across the industry appears to have slowed as well. We remain diligent in certain sectors, such as commercial real estate and energy, and we are also closely monitoring certain international regions.  Average deposits increased from Q3 '15, up $10 billion or 3% from both new and existing clients. As we grow treasury services, we remain focused on quality deposits with respect to LCR. 
Switching to Global Markets on Slide 19. Let me start by reviewing what I said last quarter regarding this segment. The past few quarters are examples of the importance of this segment to not only its clients around the world, but also to the customers and clients of all our business segments. Again, this quarter, Global Markets delivered for clients by helping them raise capital, buy and sell securities as well as manage risk. We continue to invest in and enjoy leadership positions across a broad range of products. 
We believe this improves our sustainability -- we believe this improves the sustainability of our revenue and makes us more relevant to clients across the globe. We've been there for clients when they needed us across all these products. Our results this quarter reflect this strategy and continued commitment to clients. 
Global Markets earned $1.1 billion and returned 12% on allocated capital. Revenue was up appreciably year-over-year and even outpaced typical seasonality by posting modest improvement over Q2 '16. Total revenue, excluding DVA, was up 20% year-over-year on solid sales and trading results, which rose 18%. It's worth noting we achieved these results with slightly less balance sheet, lower VaR and 7% fewer people. Continued expense discipline drove costs 1% lower year-over-year as increases in revenue-related incentive were more than offset by reductions in operating and support costs. 
Moving to trends on Slide 20 and focusing on the components of our sales and trading performance. Sales and trading revenue of $3.7 billion, excluding DVA, was up 18% from Q3 '15, driven by FICC. In terms of revenue, this was the best third quarter in 5 years. 
Excluding DVA and versus Q3 '15, FICC sales and trading of $2.8 billion increased 39% as we built momentum as the quarter progressed across a host of credit products and continued gains in rates products. Mortgages showed particular strength among credit products as investors sought yield. Equity sales and trading was solid at $1 billion in revenue but declined 17% versus Q3 '15, which benefited from higher levels of market volatility and client activity. 
On Slide 21, we present All Other, which recorded a net loss of $182 million. This loss includes a previously disclosed tax charge of $350 million due to the third quarter U.K. enactment of a tax rate reduction, which reduced the value of our U.K. DTA. The loss in the current period compares to earnings of $152 million in Q3 '15 as lower security gains and higher expense litigation offset higher mortgage banking revenue. MBI revenue this quarter includes $280 million benefit from higher valuations on our MSR, driven by slower expected prepaid speeds based upon recent observed trends in customer behavior.
Okay. Let me offer a few takeaways as I finish. We reported solid results this quarter that were consistent with our strategy of responsible growth. We remain focused on delivering responsible growth as well as strengthening and simplifying Bank of America. Capital and liquidity strengthened. Asset quality remains strong. 
We grew revenue. We grew deposits. We grew loans. We delivered for clients and capital markets. We lowered costs. We invested in our future by adding sales professionals and deploying technology that helps customers better live their financial lives and improves satisfaction. And importantly, we returned more capital to our shareholders. 
With that, let's open it up to questions."

Well, let me start with the last part first. Nothing's changed at all to our thoughts regarding the 2018 target that we discussed in the second quarter call. I mean, again, I would note that year-over-year, we've reduced expenses by $0.5 billion. And I would also just point out, to remind everybody, that if you look at expenses over a longer term, we reduced quarterly expenses ex-litigation by $4.8 billion from Q3 '11. That's a $19 billion run rate. So if you think about what we will do between now and 2018, I think we talked about this before. Roughly 1/3 of that is going to come from continued progress on delinquent loan servicing. The other 2/3 is going to come from a lot of different initiatives across the company. We've talked about SIM, our Simplify and Improve initiative. We're going to be utilizing technology to digitize processes, eliminating handling costs. We're going to get technology efficiencies from our data centers consolidation and from more efficient servers. As I said, we're going to continue to make progress on delinquent loan servicing costs, hopefully see some modest improvement on litigation. A very important part of this is the shift to self-serve digital channels: mobile, online, ATM. So that's what the list sounds like, and it goes on and on. I would emphasize this shift to self-serve. We're seeing good momentum with more than 21 million mobile banking active users, and that's growing every week, every month. 18% of our deposit transactions are now completed through mobile devices. That's better for customers. It's also better for our shareholders. It's 1/10 the cost of walking into a branch. So it's all these things kind of put together. It's initiatives across the whole company. It's going to come a lot from support and operations, but there's a little bit in the front office as well as we get more efficient."

If you want to assume that 25 basis points increases the long end by 25 basis points, you kind of know the answer. You can roughly take 1/4 of it, perhaps even a little bit more because we're probably more asset-sensitive on the first 25 than the last 25 of that 100. But if you don't want to increase on the long end, just look at the short end. We've disclosed it's $3.3 billion. You can divide that by 4 and get a pretty good sense of what 25 basis points would do over the subsequent 12 months."

Yes, I'll try to do that. But let me just start with a couple of thoughts. First of all, I think it's difficult to see share shifts in Global Markets in any given quarter. The fee pool is just not as transparent as they are in, let's say, investment banking fees or other areas. What we know is client activity was up in the third quarter, and that's what drives our short-term results. Over the longer term, one, it's easier just to assess what's going on with fee pools than share. So I just want to point out, from '14 to '15, on declining fee pools, we're pretty sure we improved our share. Third parties tell us that, and I think that share has come from a number of regions and a number of firms and a number of products as competitors adjust their strategies and capabilities. More specifically, we've been investing in rates for a number of years. I think we're making some progress there. We have a very strong credit platform. And as you know, I think we're making progress there relative to competitors around the world, and I think we're investing in equities. And I think you're -- equities revenue is down, but I think we're seeing improvement relative to the fee pool in equities as well. I do want to emphasize, very importantly, that our strategy is to have a diversified product portfolio across both FICC and equities and globally. That's what our clients need and want from us. And so you could see gains one quarter in one place and see something lower in another place, and that's okay with us. That's our strategy. It's about what the client needs in any given quarter. If we have -- if we're doing a little bit worse in one place, we're probably doing better in another place."

Well, I think, if you think about the growth, you got the interest side and you got the fee side. And if you think about the interest side, it's going to be driven by balanced growth between loans and deposits. And I think we keep growing deposits year-over-year $60 billion. We're paying 4 basis points in consumer. And then thinking about that dynamic and putting that to work in anything we can is important. And we continue to grow loans at less rate than we grow deposits. That's going to drive our NIM. It's just a bigger and bigger, lower and lower cost deposit base. And on the loan side, I think consumer is growing better now than commercial in linked quarter, but overall, we expect commercial will get back in a little bit as the economy continues and some of the other uncertainty lifts in the political season here. So on loans and deposits, it will just be growing. And as you've seen year-over-year, core growth is 7% on loans and growth on deposits. On the fee side, what you're seeing is the dynamic in especially consumer fee areas finally turn a little bit stable and then turning for us in the card revenue and things like that, which would hit sort of the inflection point, where the rundown in relative interchange due to selling some portfolios and getting out of noncore portfolios and putting on the core portfolios with rewards attached to it, which helps us, generates deposits and things like that, had stabilized. And you're starting to see, in the last few quarters, card income start to move up a bit. And on service charges, it's been relatively stable. So the fee side will be driven more by wealth management and markets and things like that. And consumer is stable, which is good because it had been a drag for a long time."

I think I said earlier, this -- if you think about the last several quarters of earnings calls, it's been kind of getting better than this, and every quarter, it gets slightly better. And that, in part, is because we are still getting the benefits of the changes made 6, 7, 8 years ago coming through the consumer business, i.e., that what we call back book portfolios or legacy portfolios or whatever word you want to use continue to run off with higher credit risk in them. And we keep putting on and have put on and continue to put on higher credit quality. So I think if you think about overall charge-offs of $880 million this quarter, that's driven by the consumer business and that's driven by the card and some -- and legacy home equities. And so keeping the card business where we want it is critical, and you're seeing this continue. Even as we start to grow that portfolio, both nominally and rate, the charge-off picture is strong. And so when you go back and look at what happened during the crisis, the charge-offs came abnormally from the edges of credit, and we've kept ourselves out of that."

Sure. Just one step back. Obviously, what we're doing every day is managing earnings, capital, liquidity and interest rate risk when we think about that portfolio and where we want invest things.

So just on the -- remember that the reason why you don't see much repricing is really 2 or 3 dynamics. One is a full $450 billion of our deposits are noninterest-bearing, so they aren't going to reprice. The great debate is about what's the -- how sticky are those. And if you think about that, those are dominated by our consumer business, and our noninterest-bearing accounts in consumer have doubled in size over the last 5 or 6 years due to focusing on primary accounts. We're up to 90% primary accounts in the household, where they run their household finances through our account, and therefore, the direct deposits are check and things like that. So the first thing to remember is of $1.2 trillion, $450 billion noninterest-bearing; and the dominant part of that, consumer and also in the Wealth Management and the core transactional account of both consumers. And then on the business side, similarly, we have driven our deposits to be really LCR-friendly and core operating accounts. And so those aren't going to move. The noninterest-bearing, they aren't going to move much. And the big debate is how much balance would be in there, and we feel confident the balances will stay just because of the nature of the accounts. And then when you go to the second dynamic, remember that even with all those deposit growth, one of the things we continue to do and the impact is less and less is we are, especially in consumer business, running off CDs still at a fairly decent clip that were historically used to fund prior company's balance sheets that we don't need the funding at that cost. So we have some rollover, but that continues to decline. The weighted average cost drops off -- that cost drops off, and it drives down or holds steady the weighted average cost. And then if you look at money markets and other interest-bearing, they really haven't moved much. So we feel good about the consumer. We forget about the deposit base overall. We feel very good about the consumer deposit base. It just crossed $600 billion for the first time in the company's history in consumers generally. And with that, I think we look -- if rates rise, we think that it's a substantial value for the company, and Paul gave you a way to think about that earlier with 1/4 of $3.3 billion, 25% of $3.3 billion."

So -- yes. So look, I think you're noticing some modest card balance growth in the quarter, which we think will continue as we add new accounts, and again, we're very focused on adding high-quality accounts there. I think you probably also noticed that while combined debit and credit card spend was good in the quarter at 5%, 6% if you exclude fuel, I'm -- I'm adjusting for our divestitures last year, that the growth in the card income was impacted by, as you noted, customer reward programs. However, I think, just focusing on the fee income, this is some really key benefits of our strategy, which is to attract relatively higher-quality card customers and reward them for deepening their overall relationship with us. This strategy really drives deposit growth and makes deposits stickier, plus we believe these customers have lower loss rates. They use the call center less, which helps us lower costs. I think when you want to see the effect of this, you have to look at the overall consumer segment and what's going on there in terms of growth of profits and improvement in expenses. And just the last thing I'd just point out, look, our risk-adjusted margins on card are strong at over 9%. This is, in no way, a signaling that we're not going to be able to grow the card income line. I just want you to get a better sense of how we think about it."

I think if you think about that more broadly, we had -- the last divestitures of size we made in this card business were the fourth quarter of last year, and they're through the P&L. So you -- they're through the balances and through the things. So what you're starting to see if you look at the trend this year is you're starting to see core movement, positive movement both in card income and in balances as we move across the year, and we expect that to continue. It will be strong, responsible growth. And one of the great debates we have in the company is people say, ""Why can't you grow this faster? Or why can't -- we're giving up too much in the interchange for the preferred balance or Preferred Rewards. The interesting question is: Are you giving up something you'd never have in Preferred Rewards? I.e. we're bringing more customer relationships and depth, and that gets us something. So incrementally, the net interchange is actually there as opposed to what -- theoretically, you get gross interchange with a noncustomer in the Affinity programs. So we focus on entire customer relationship. It is very valuable. It is very profitable. And believe me, if we could grow it faster responsibly, we would. But the idea is just to grind out the slow, steady growth, and we're starting to see that come through. And largely, it was masked in '14, '15 and behind that, '13, for those areas because we were divesting a lot of noncore relationships. And now we have the core affinities we want, and we have the core card business we want."

But we've got room to go, and we're driving at it. But if we don't hit -- if the issue is that our capital continues to grow, that capital is also yours as an investor and continues to go into our book value. And so it's not going anywhere.

  Let's go to the how we run our consumer business. So we run our consumer business consistent with responsible growth for the company. And that -- what that means is that you focus on deepening relationships, what we call stairstep, or it's the core deposit account, the core credit card and getting it get used in the core mortgage and the core home equity and the core auto loans. That's what we've been driving at and continue to drive that. That's the backbone of what we did and how we repositioned this company over many years. In terms of the branches, Mike, you've rattled off all the statistics, which Paul talked about earlier. But it is a complex optimization, but it all starts with the consumer. What is the consumer going to do? And so while 18% of deposits are made by mobile deposits, 82% by their nature aren't. And where do they go? About 50 percentage points of that go through the ATM machines, and about another 30-odd percent go through the teller lines still today. And so you have to be ready and able to serve in all dynamics. And so what we continue to do is optimize the branch structure, the call structure, the ATM structure, the mobile structure and the online structure altogether. And a way to think about that optimization, and why -- this extremely important business to this company is that we've gone from 300 basis points of the cost of all that to deposits to about 150 over the last 6, 7 years. And that's by continuing to optimize the physical plant as well as all these other tool means. And so if you ask me, your question is, how far can you go, you have to also then think about what we want to go on in a branch. And so if you look back at some of the statistics that Paul had in the deck for consumer, where you see things like appointments set up are 340,000 in the third quarter. So just think about that, 340,000 times a customer went on a mobile phone and asked to come to a branch. And so we need those branches to receive those mobile phone customers. And why are they coming? Usually for a much more important financial transaction to them than handing us a check for deposit. And so it's a quality versus quantity and making sure we understand that. So we are optimizing all those. And you can see on Page 14 on the lower right, you can see the difference moves. I'd say we went from 7 million visits probably 4, 5 years ago to 6 million to 5 million. But those 5 million are of higher quality, and we think that's important. And there are certain transactions and certain capabilities that you just have to have at your branch, that you just have to do face-to-face, very difficult things like how to get a power of attorney for a parent that's sick, or I want to do a mortgage. It's very -- it's still difficult to do it through the phone and things like that. So we'll have all aspects. We'll drive it down, and you can see that we continue to make that progress."

Do you have the answer and you don't want to say for competitive reasons? Or you don't know, it's kind of a give and take based on the customer experience?

And the key is not to get ahead of them because that can cause you problems, and not to be behind them because there can be cost issues and empty branches. So even in the 112 we're down, we've added branches in places like Denver, the Denver branch that we added are in the top 10% of performing branches today on relationship building. We've added branches in Manhattan. We added branches in Minneapolis. And so we're in a sea change in terms of what the branches look like individually. The new branches are different. We're adding branches we didn't have, and we're closing branches where the utilization isn't there. The nature of how far a customer will travel is also different now than it was 10, 15 years ago. So I think you said, what are all the different reasons? The answer was -- I think you said, is we'll follow the customer.

  I guess, we've had a couple of good quarters in FICC, both for you and the industry, and I know volatile business not really looking for quarterly expectations.

  Well, I think the way I come out of that debate is to go back along many years ago and sort of think through the repositioning that was done in our company. And so the key was to make FICC work. You're talking more revenue, but we look at profit. And so to get the profit we needed to out of the fixed income and equities business, we had to take the cost structure down, which we did in '10 and '11. Tom Montag and the team worked very hard at that and got to sort of breakeven, down over $1 billion a quarter. And then we ran along a number of years, and then they've actually taken out year-over-year. You can see the cost continue to be managed well despite higher revenue. So I would say, taking the discussion, I'd say that the way our fixed income business generates revenue, a lot of it is around our capabilities in underwriting, our capabilities in all of the different variations from high-grade leverage to everything that goes on. And that's a relatively stable pool of revenue that you see repeated. And what goes up or down is really the activity around that based on the markets seizing up in certain quarters in terms of issuance and things like that. When you think about the other thing that Tom and the team had to really go after, which is to broaden our capabilities in the macro segment a little bit, because that was something that traditionally, the Bank of America Merrill Lynch teams came together. And he's done that. So that's added some more volume to us. So we think we've been gaining share, as Paul said earlier, when you look at revenue comparison among the top 10 banks without all the leak charge for just revenue. And we think -- but we think it's driven by our fixed income capabilities. And it's driven by our connectivity from the issuer of bonds and debt to the investor. And we'll continue to drive that. And so the team's done a good job. And I'd say that we're at a fundamental level. This quarter feels better than last year's quarter. It's not a quarter that when you look across 4 or 5 years that we haven't come close to on many cases and have done better than a few times."

  Look, we feel -- I think -- let me start with what we noticed in commercial in the quarter was lower industry growth this quarter. I think that really reflected a slowdown in closed -- actually booked closed acquisition financing for us, which is probably maybe could different for peers depending on the timing of transactions, and then uncertainty around the election and then I think some lingering concerns around certain countries or regions. That's what I think impacted the third quarter. We -- when you look at the U.S., when you look around the globe, when you kind of look at GDP growth, we're optimistic. We think the economy feels good. So in a good economy, we should be able to grow commercial loans. We'll have to stay focused on some sectors and some regions, but we think we can grow commercial loans. There's -- utilization rates and revolvers, they came off their highs, but they're at the higher end of the range, which also suggests or reflects good commercial activity. We're adding bankers in the U.S. in commercial banking and small business. We're adding them to regions, where we know we have some synergies or some capabilities, some big MSAs. So there's no reason why we can't grow within our responsible growth framework, assuming the economy continues to chug along here."

And that -- if you see that number, it was growing -- it's flattened out a little bit. And that -- relative to others, that was the difference. But I think -- but Paul's last point's the key point. There are creditworthy customers that we can do more with. And the only way to do that is because we have a talented, world-class commercial banking team, is to add more capacity. And so -- and that capacity is starting to build. And it takes a while because you hire a commercial banker, and we sometimes give them some of the undercovered names in our portfolio or else, and then they go after the prospects that we have. And it takes a while to build those up. People don't change their commercial banking relationships in an afternoon. So our business banking and our middle market, especially across America, we have been adding commercial bankers. And we expect that to redound our benefit given an environment which may be solid but okay. We'd expect to gain share in those markets as those bankers come on stream and become more productive. And Alastair Borthwick and Katy Knox, the team that's driving that, has proven that those bankers do get share. And you'll see that come through."

  I think when you think about fraud, most people think about in terms of the electronic side. Most think -- people think about credit card fraud. And fraud is a broad word, arguments about whether the charge was valid with a merchant or things like that. And so there's a long history of adjudicating that. So as more and more sales go online by the consumer, the techniques for online are continuing to develop. At face to face or point of sale, the chip card, when we're -- largely through all our customers having chip cards, merchant -- what we call chip on chip, our chip card used with a merchant chip machine is rising sort of a percent or so a quarter and is now, as best we judge it, in the 30s -- the high 20s or something like that, Nancy. So all that being said, we expect to get leverage in our fraud losses in the Consumer business year-over-year and we expect that to continue to come down. And so yes, that is a major initiative for us to continue to drive that down. Part of it's education of consumers. Part of it's getting the chip cards in the hands and getting the machine -- merchants using the chip machines. Part of it is the tokenization and the wallets and things that go on in Visa checkout and all the variations in Mastercard and getting because that's a tokenized better execution and is more secure. And so our view as a provider has been to adopt all these wallets technologies that have this tokenization capabilities and that then drives down the cost of losses due to merchant complaints and other types of things. So you're absolutely right. Cybersecurity, yes, the cards from other people and sold on the Internet, all that stuff is important to us and so we spend, as we said, $0.5 billion a year protecting ourselves, but also part of it is making sure we understand where our consumers are in terms of lost cards and things like that."

  Maybe I'll take that one. Look, I want to take just one step back because, to really answer that question, you just have to have a better appreciation for how we run Bank of America and it truly really does start with our purpose, which is to help customers better live their financial lives and from there you have to understand what we mean by responsible growth. So response -- if you ask anyone in the company responsible growth, it's about developing relationships so that we can grow with our customers over time based upon their needs and goals. It's not about the number of products that we open, it's whether customers want to need the products and services we're offering them and use them. That's how we measure ourselves. We've spent years building controls and governance and escalation around this. We're always monitoring them. It's just how we run the company. So that's probably the best answer I can give you in terms of how we think about this issue."

If we -- we have dialogue with all our shareholders often and Jack Bovender, our Lead Independent Director, obviously we went through this a year or so ago and we asked the shareholders, they voted on it. But the key is how we run the company, how we govern ourselves. So again, Paul's view of what he talked about responsible growth, one of the tenets is to be sustainable and sustainable -- all growth has to be sustainable and it involves things like you've got to invest in the future, but also involves how we govern the company. And our board, the independence of our board, the experience on our board, how they approach their responsibilities, I think, is very strong and I think our shareholders have understood that and agreed with that. And so I think we govern ourselves in a very tough fashion, i.e., the boards demanding on us and understands the strategy and has helped support this strategy through sometimes when people would challenge it. And I think it's proven to be the right strategy at this point. And so if you get to technicalities, our Lead Independent Director duty is as strong as anybody's in the industry. If you look at all the new governance surveys that have come out, all the words about proper governance and all the different things that you've seen recently, we meet or exceed everything anybody says they go to.

  Just wanted to follow up on the fiduciary rule questions before. So appreciate that retirement assets are less than 10% of your balances, as you've highlighted before, but I think what a lot of folks are thinking about here is that SEC has been pretty clear that they're working on their own version of this applying to taxable. And so when people watch what you're doing here on the fiduciary rule for retirement, people are sort of logical to assume you'd apply the same policy in the event we see a similar rule come out more broadly. And so isn't that the message that you're basically sending to FAs?

It cannot take risk and so we are earning all our money on the 7%. And so when you think about the weighted average of that, it comes out over 10%, that means you're in a lot more on the 7% even across the whole company and so that's one of the difficulties. So how do we optimize that? We make that 10% less dollar volume. If we can keep moving dollar volume down and keep increasing earnings you get that, that's by all the discussion Paul had in response to earlier questions about optimizing the balance sheet or where we get expenses down or we grow less risky earnings that can generate income. But it's a constant optimization, but the basic principle that people -- that we sometimes forget is that when you think about 10% on a 30% of capital can take no risk and so basically it earns your cost of debt."

We believe -- and one of the things Terry Laughlin and Keith Banks and Andy Sieg and John and others are working on is to increase our capabilities for both the adviser and the customer in the digital more or less stated in that -- in GWIM business and so we think there's upside for us. Again, less customers so that leverage is not quite the same and that's why we spend a lot of our time around the consumer and there's just less leverage. And the adviser, you have to think about that business because the adviser is the core strength that we have to the customer that we have to have an execution, which is universal between the adviser, the customers, they can all see the same thing. And so we've got some great capabilities now, My Merrill and things like that. I think -- but we plan to continue to enhance them and continue to integrate them so when they get the loans and deposits, things like that, they're much more integrated over time. You can still see it all, but it's not where we want it to be."

Hopefully, everybody's had a chance to review the earnings release documents that are available on the website.
Before I turn the call over to Brian and Paul, let me remind you we may make some forward-looking statements. For further information on these, please refer to either our earnings release documents, our website or our SEC filings.
One thing before Brian and Paul get into the results, I just want to remind you we filed an 8-K on October 4, giving notification the company changed our method of accounting for the amortization of premium and accretion of discounts related to certain debt securities. It's known by the investment community as FAS 91. Our change to the contractual method, which is used by the majority of our peers, will provide better comparability of our results. As a result of that change, we restated our historical results and provided the historically restated information in the 8-K, and our earnings materials today naturally reflect those restatements. 
With that, let me turn it over to Brian Moynihan, our Chairman and CEO, for some opening comments; before Paul Donofrio, our CFO, goes through the details. Brian?"
19049,379148171,1055997,"Bank of America Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 17, 2016",2016-10-17,"Earnings Calls","Bank of America Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Lee. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to review our third quarter results. Our results this quarter continue our progress on our long-term strategy. We continue to drive responsible growth and deliver more of the com",1550,"Thank you, Lee. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to review our third quarter results. 
Our results this quarter continue our progress on our long-term strategy. We continue to drive responsible growth and deliver more of the company's capabilities to our clients and customers. This progress is becoming clear with each successive quarter, and you can see the highlights of that on Slide 2. 
We reported earnings of $5 billion or $0.41 per diluted share, an EPS improvement of 8% from the year-ago quarter. We improved operating leverage across the businesses, utilizing technology to lower costs and improve our processes. Our pretax earnings improved 17% compared to third quarter 2015. This pretax earnings comparison is important as it eliminates the unusual movements in the tax line like this quarter's tax charge for the U.K. corporate tax rate change. 
Like last quarter, I thought I'd address a few topics we are hearing from all of you. To do that, let's look at Slides 3 and 4 of the earnings material. A first question is: Are we making progress driving our responsible growth strategy? Yes, we continue to show progress throughout all the businesses. Our revenue growth has more clarity as we move past the periods of significant impacts from implementing regulations, running off noncore portfolios and divesting noncore businesses. 
Revenue grew 3% over the third quarter of last year. Behind that improvement is our continuing investment in this great franchise, in our sales teams, in our technology across the board. These sales teams and the buildup we've been doing there helps us to increase our capacity to serve our customers and clients. 
An example of that is in our consumer business. They are focused on being the core bank to all our households. This has resulted in fewer checking accounts than we had years ago. But the average balance of the checking accounts we has -- have has doubled, and they are now roughly at $6,500 per account. 
You can also see this in the growth of our Merrill Edge brokerage balances, which now total over $138 billion, adding investment relationships to the mass market customer base. In general, consumers are deepening their relationships with us as they use our straightforward investing tools to get them started on the path to investing. 
For our affluent and wealthy customers, our customer progress also continues. Our Global Wealth and Investment Management teams, U.S. Trust and Merrill Lynch not only manage $2 trillion-plus in investment balances but also manage nearly $150 billion in loans and more than $250 billion in deposits, and we continue to see net flows of core assets in that business. 
On the commercial side, clients continue to respond to our universal banking model for a simplified stop for financing, investing and advisory services. We will continue to operate within our established risk framework and defined customer groups, and we aren't reaching for growth. This will drive more sustainable results over a period -- longer period of time for our shareholders. 
And then with our global peers restructuring, including in the markets business, I think this quarter is another great example of our global business -- Global Markets business' importance to our investing and issuing clients. We saw better client activity driving the best third quarter results we've had in 5 years in investment banking and in sales and trading, and we're doing that with a smaller balance sheet, fewer people and lower value at risk or VaR. So growth and deepening, all consistent with our responsible growth strategy, continues across all the customer bases. Paul will talk to you more about the statistics in these successes. 
Another question that we get asked is: Can credit remain this strong? Well, many of you asked that last quarter and the quarter before that and the quarter before that. In this quarter, it's still got better again, with our charge-off ratio declining to 40 basis points this quarter, at an historic low. This is driven by changes we made right after the crisis, think in 2008 and 2009, and the long-term benefits of that effort continue to come through; and, by the way, sticking to our responsible growth strategy even as times have been relatively better. 
U.S. consumer health is generally good. Over the past few quarters, exposures in our oil and gas that were causing industry concerns for commercial losses have improved, and charge-offs have receded. Other commercial credit remains very strong, and Paul will touch on these topics later. 
Another question we get asked is: What can we do to drive earnings even if we stay in this low rate, low growth environment? We aren't waiting for interest rates to rise here at Bank of America. We're driving our earnings growth now. We work on the things that we can control: expenses, loan and deposit growth and fee growth. Long-term rates are down compared to last year yet earnings have grown. Despite that, net interest income is up 3% from third quarter '15 while net interest yield has been stable because we grew core loans and deposits. 
Paul will take you through a loan growth details later, but I wanted to pause a moment and talk about our deposit growth. Deposits are a core part of what drives our franchise earnings. We have $1.2 trillion of deposits. That's proof that customers entrust us to safeguard their money. We are heavily weighted in the mix of those deposits towards consumers, whether they're general consumers or wealthy consumers. This, in turn, provides a very stable base of funding for the company and allows us to be less reliant on the markets for funding. 
Nearly $450 billion or 36% of our deposits are noninterest-bearing, a very strong mix. Deposits on average grew $68 billion year-over-year or 6%. The teams have done tremendous work here, and this quarter wasn't an anomaly. This is the fourth consecutive quarter we have grown -- where we have grown deposits more than $50 billion over the previous year. 
But our commercial teams remain focused on growing deposits also. They're growing deposits that are LCR-friendly and doing great work with our industry-leading cash management capabilities. As a result, year-over-year, Global Banking grew their deposits 3% to $300 billion. Our consumer and wealth management teams, combined, have $860 billion in deposits. They grew this large base by 8% in the past 12 months. For the first time, consumer topped $600 billion in deposits. 
These deposits are growing because our capabilities in the business are the best in the industry and our customers and clients see that, whether it's our 21 million-plus mobile banking customers, our 34 million-plus online customers or the more than 5 million customers that come into our financial centers every week. These customers show that they appreciate the capabilities of integration of our networks. 
So when we look at what else we can do to control and drive earnings in a low growth environment, we get asked a lot about expenses. And can those expenses keep being driven down and go lower? Well, the answer is yes. Last quarter, we gave you a 2018 expense target, and we continue to make progress towards that. Our expenses declined 3% from third quarter 2015 to 2016. Our efficiency ratio improved 62% -- to 62% this quarter. That is a 400 basis point improvement from last year's third quarter. 
We continue to deliver on expense reductions while continuing to invest in technology, in sales teams and other matters that are important for the future of this franchise. After you take into account the additional large bank FDIC assessment that started this quarter, expense is also down on a linked-quarter basis even as we continue to invest and absorb all the severance, regulatory, resolution planning and other repositioning costs to continue to reduce our operating costs. We have been innovating in technology, and we'll continue to do so to improve processes and eliminate the need for paper and humans handling that paper. 
Our Simplify and Improve initiatives continue to help drive those costs down, and that leads to the question we also get asked: Can we deliver and sustain returns above our cost of capital? As Lee talked about earlier, we restated our results to change under FAS 91 and reduce the variability and make us more comparable to peers. As you can see, that makes a little easier to see the longer-term return on tangible common equity trends. This quarter, we reported 10.3% and it is now stabilized above the cost of capital even given our larger and larger capital base. We still have work to do here to drive it to our ultimate goals, but this quarter is another strong step in that direction. 
And importantly, on Slide 4, you can see that each business has improved its leverage. It grew -- they grew their earnings, had strong efficiency and returned far above the cost of capital, and all that continues to bode well as we look ahead. So as we look forward, we are driving responsible growth and maintaining discipline on costs. And this has allowed us to deliver more capital back to you, and we'll keep on doing that. 
Now let me turn it over to Paul for -- to cover the numbers. Paul?"
19049,379148171,1055997,"Bank of America Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 17, 2016",2016-10-17,"Earnings Calls","Bank of America Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Brian. Good morning, everybody. Since Brian covered the income statement highlights, I will start with the balance sheet on Page 5. Strong deposit growth drove a small increase in the size of our balance sheet versus Q2. Deposits rose $17 billio",3530,"Thanks, Brian. Good morning, everybody. Since Brian covered the income statement highlights, I will start with the balance sheet on Page 5. 
Strong deposit growth drove a small increase in the size of our balance sheet versus Q2. Deposits rose $17 billion or 6% on an annualized basis. During the quarter, long-term debt fell by $5 billion. We put cash to work, growing securities and our investment portfolio and, more modestly, through loan growth. Global liquidity sources rose, driven by deposit growth, and we remain well compliant with LCR requirements. 
Tangible common equity of $174 billion improved by $2.8 billion from Q2, driven by earnings. In the process, we returned $2.2 billion in common shareholders -- to common shareholders through a combination of dividends and $1.4 billion in share repurchases. On a per-share basis, tangible book value increased to $17.14, up $1.60 or 11% from Q3 '15. I would note that this increase was driven by both retained earnings as well as share repurchases below tangible book value as we reduced shares 3% from Q3 '15. 
Turning to regulatory metrics. As a reminder, we report capital under the advanced approaches. Our CET1 transition ratio under Basel III ended the quarter at 11%. On a fully phased-in basis, CET1 capital improved $4 billion to $166 billion. Under the advanced approaches, compared to Q2 '16, with -- our CET1 ratio increased 40 basis points to 10.9% and is well above our 10% 2019 requirement. RWA declined roughly $20 billion, driven by reductions in Global Markets exposures and improvements in credit quality driven by runoff of noncore legacy exposure. 
We also improved our capital metrics under the standardized approach. Here, our CET1 ratio improved to 11.8%. Supplementary leverage ratios for both parent and bank continue to exceed U.S. regulatory minimums that take effect in 2018. 
Turning to Slide 6. On an average basis, total loans were up $23 billion or 3% from Q3 '15. And while up from Q2 '16, growth was at a slower pace. Consistent with past periods, we break out loans in our business segments and in All Other. Year-over-year, loans in All Other were down $30 billion, driven by continued runoff of first and second-lien mortgages, while loans in our business segments were up $53 billion or 7%. 
In Consumer Banking, we continue to see growth in residential real estate and vehicle lending, offset somewhat by home equity paydowns, which continue to outpace originations. In wealth management, we saw growth in residential real estate and structured lending. Global Banking loans were up $26 billion or 8% year-over-year. On the bottom right of the chart, note the growth of $68 billion in average deposits that Brian mentioned. 
Turning to asset quality on Slide 7. We believe a number of factors, including our strategy of responsible growth, enhanced underwriting standards since 2008 and a healthier economy, have transformed the risk profile of Bank of America as we look forward to future economic cycles. Total net charge-offs of 100 -- of $888 million improved $97 million from Q2. 
Consumer losses declined across a number of products, and commercial losses also declined, driven by lower energy losses. Driven by these improvements, provision expense of $850 million declined $126 million from Q2. We had a small overall net reserve release in the quarter as Consumer Real Estate releases more than offset builds in other products. 
On Slide 8, we provide credit quality data on our consumer portfolio. We remain focused on originating consumer loans with borrowers with high FICO Scores, and our asset quality remains strong. Net charge-offs declined $71 million from Q2. This improvement was broad-based across Consumer Real Estate as well as credit card. 
Note that credit cards accounts for more than 2/3 of losses in our consumer portfolio. And within our U.S. credit card book, the loss rate improved to 2.45%, NPLs improved and reserve coverage remained strong. 
Moving to commercial credit on Slide 9. Net charge-offs of $110 million improved $26 million from Q2. With respect to energy, exposures were down, losses improved, oil prices have stabilized, and we have $1 billion of reserves. More specifically, energy charge-offs of $45 billion decreased $34 billion from Q2. While reservable criticized declined from Q2, we did experience an increase in NPLs this quarter, which was concentrated with 2 clients, one in metals and mining and one in energy. 
Overall, our commercial portfolio continues to perform well. As I shared with you last quarter, the metrics in the commercial portfolio speak for themselves in terms of quality and performance. The reservable criticized exposure declined and, as a percentage of loans, remains low. The commercial net charge-off ratio is 10 basis points. Excluding small business, it is 5 basis points and has been around 15 basis points or better for 15 consecutive quarters. And the NPL ratio remains low at 45 basis points. 
Turning to Slide 10. Net interest income on a GAAP non-FTE basis was $10.2 billion, $10.4 billion on an FTE basis. As Lee mentioned earlier, we changed our accounting method for the amortization of premium or discount paid on certain of our debt securities from the prepayment method to the contractual method. The contractual method is used by our peers and should make it easier for investors to make comparisons.  Compared to Q3 '15, NII is up $300 million or 3% as loan growth, higher short-end rates and higher security balances funded by deposits more than offset the negative impact of generally lower long-end rates over the past several quarters. 
Okay. With respect to asset sensitivity, as of 9/30, an instantaneous 100 basis point parallel increase in rates is estimated to increase NII by $5.3 billion over the subsequent 12 months. This is lower than the sensitivity we reported at June 30. The reduction was mostly on the long end, driven by the change to the contractual method and slower prepaid speeds based upon recent trends in customer behavior. Note that the sensitivity on the short end at $3.3 billion has not changed significantly. 
Turning to Slide 11. Noninterest expense was $13.5 billion. That's $0.5 billion lower or 3% lower than Q3 '15, driven by cost reductions across the company. This is the initial quarter of the increased FDIC assessment to shore up the deposit insurance fund. The increase in expense for us is roughly $100 million per quarter. Compared to Q2 '16, expenses were stable as good core expense control was offset by the higher FDIC costs and modestly higher incentives. Q3 litigation expense was $250 million, which is fairly consistent with both Q3 '15 as well as Q2 '16. 
Most expense categories were lower year-over-year. This trend was led by personnel expense, which includes the Q4 '15 expiration of the fully amortized advisory awards in Wealth Management. The rest of the improvement was driven by reduced costs of mortgage servicing, coupled with SIM efforts and other initiatives. Our employee base is down 3% from Q3 of '15. While the overall headcount is down, it's important to note that year-over-year, we added over 1,000 primary sales associates across Consumer, Wealth Management and Global Banking.
Turning to the business segments and starting with Consumer Banking on Slide 12. Consumer earned $1.8 billion, continuing its trend of solid results and reporting a robust 21% return on allocated capital. I would note that pretax, pre-provision earnings rose $377 million or 10%. Expense and NII improvement were both notable and, together, enough to more than offset higher provision expense and prior year divestiture gains. 
Revenue was relatively flat on a reported basis compared to Q3 '15 as 4% growth in NII was offset, as I said, by the absence of approximately $200 million of divestiture gains in Q3 '15. As a reminder, these gains in Q3 '15 resulted from divestitures of an ancillary appraisal business, a card portfolio and some financial centers. Excluding those prior period gains, revenue improved year-over-year, and growth in pretax, pre-provision earnings was even more substantial. Falling 400 basis points, Consumer Banking's efficiency ratio of 55% improved meaningfully year-over-year.
Okay. Turning to Slide 13 and key trends. First, on the upper left, the stats are a reminder of our strong competitive position. Looking a little closer at revenue drivers compared to Q3 '15. Net interest income continued to improve as we drove deposits higher. Average deposits continued their strong growth, up $50 billion or 9% year-over-year, outpacing the industry. 
With respect to noninterest income, service charges were up modestly while card income was down. Spending levels and issuance were strong, but revenue growth was muted by customer rewards. We are attracting relatively higher-quality card customers that, on the one hand, have higher spending habits but, on the other hand, receive more awards. This has 2 important benefits to note: first, rewards deepen relationships, helping to grow deposits and make them more sticky, for example. Second, in our experience, these customers have lower loss rates and a reduced need to interact with call centers, thereby allowing us to lower costs. 
Turning to expenses in the upper right. They climbed 7% from Q3 '15 despite -- excuse me, turning to expenses, they declined 7% from Q3 '15 despite the higher FDIC assessment charges in the quarter. Expense reductions are the result of a number of initiatives. For example, mobile banking penetration helps to optimize our delivery network while improving customer satisfaction. More chip cards help us lower fraud costs, and digitalization of processes and statements helps us eliminate paper and related handling costs. One can observe the impacts of these types of initiatives on the cost of deposits, which continued its march lower, dropping below 1.6% this quarter. 
Focusing on client balances on the left. In addition to deposit growth, Merrill Edge brokerage assets, at $138 billion, are up 18% versus Q3 '15 on strong account flows and market valuations. We also increased the number of Merrill Edge accounts by 11% from Q3 '15. We now have nearly 1.7 million households that leverage our financial solution advisers and self-directed investing platform. 
Moving across the bottom right of the page. Note that loans are up 7% from Q3 '15 on strong mortgage and vehicle lending growth. As reviewed in previous quarters, we continue to focus on originating high FICO Score loans, which have generally produced low loss rates and strong risk-adjusted returns. Loan growth included Consumer Real Estate production of $20.4 billion, up 21% from Q3 '15 and in line with Q2 '16 as customers continue to take advantage of historically low interest rates. 
We retained about 3/4 of first mortgage production on the balance sheet this quarter. Average vehicle loans were up 17% from Q3 '15, with average booked FICO Scores remaining well above 750 and net losses remaining below 30 basis points. With respect to U.S. card -- excuse me, U.S. consumer card, average balances grew 7% from Q2 on an annualized basis, aided by seasonal back-to-school lending. We issued more than 1.3 million cards in the quarter, and spending on credit cards, adjusted for divestitures, was up 8% compared to Q3 '15. 
Turning to Slide 14 and digital banking trends. As I mentioned earlier, we continue to see strong momentum in digital banking adoption with use across service, appointments and sales. Mobile banking is transforming how our customers bank and reshaping our consumer segment. Importantly, as adoption rises, particularly around transaction processing and self-service, we see improved efficiency and customer satisfaction. We continue to improve capabilities, with the latest example being the launch of our Spanish mobile app, which attracted over 800,000 active users in the first 10 weeks. We added roughly 1.1 million new mobile users in the quarter. 
The pace of user growth has increased despite an already impressive penetration rate of our checking account holders.  With more than 21.3 million active users, deposits from mobile devices now represents 18% of deposit transactions, and 26 million checks were deposited via mobile devices this quarter. That is an average of 280,000 deposits per day, an increase of 27% year-over-year and the equivalent to a volume of 830 financial centers. Digital sales now represent 18% of total sales,  and we are now -- we now have more than 3,500 digital ambassadors in our financial centers driving further adoption. 
Also, as you know, we are a leader in person-to-person and person-to-business money movement through digital transfers and bill payment capabilities. Consumers moved $243 billion in Q3, up 6% from last year. And while all this is transformative, I would just remind you that we still have a little less than 1 million people per day walking into our centers across the U.S. This in-person interaction is important in terms of deepening and retaining personal relationships, providing more complex financial help and creating opportunities for further engagement. 
Turning to Slide 15. Global Wealth and Investment Management produced earnings of $697 million, up 10% from Q3 '15. Now it's no secret that this segment operates in an industry undergoing meaningful change as firms and clients adapt to the new fiduciary rules and other market dynamics. The good news is we start from a position of strength with $2.5 trillion in client balances. We have market-leading brands and a wide range of investment service offers, from self-service to fully managed. Plus we have the resources to continue to invest in market-leading capabilities that address the changing needs of our clients. 
Year-over-year, revenue was down modestly, but expenses were down even more, improving pretax margin to 25%, up meaningfully from Q3 '15. Overall, revenue declined 2% from Q3 '15 as NII growth was more than offset by lower transactional revenues. NII benefited from solid loan and deposit growth. Noninterest income declined from Q3 '15, driven by lower transactional revenue that continues to be impacted by market factors as well as migration of activity from brokerage to managed relationships. 
Noninterest expense declined nearly $313 million (sic) [ $213 million ] or 6% from Q3 '15, with half of that benefit derived from the expiration of the amortization of advisory retention awards that were put in place at the time of the Merrill Lynch merger. The rest of the improvement was the result of work across many categories of expense more than offsetting higher FDIC costs. 
Moving to Slide 16. We continued to see overall solid client engagement. Client balances approached $2.5 trillion and are up from Q2, including higher market valuations, $10 billion of long-term AUM flows and continued loan and deposit growth. Average deposits compared against Q3 '15 are up 4%, driven by growth in the second half of 2015. Compared to Q2, average deposits were impacted by seasonal tax payments. Average loans were up 7% year-over-year. Growth remained concentrated in Consumer Real Estate and structured lending. 
Lastly, earlier this month, we announced some innovations to our IRA products and services, which we believe positions us to better serve our clients given new fiduciary rules. These innovations are industry-leading and address not only the new fiduciary rules for retirement accounts but also client preference for more choice and new ways to invest. First, we announced the rollout of a new offering called Merrill Edge Guided Investing. This solution offers clients online investing, enhanced with professional portfolio management. With the addition of this solution, clients have 3 fundamental choices which they can mix and match to best meet their needs. Clients can invest online, completely self-directed through Merrill Edge; or if they are interested in enhanced portfolio -- enhanced professional portfolio management, they will be able to use Merrill Edge Guided Investing; or they can choose fully advised, working one on one with a financial adviser via brokerage or fee-based advisory platforms. 
We also announced that beginning in April 2017, for clients that choose to have a financial adviser provide advice with respect to their IRA accounts, we will provide this service to our fee-based advisory platform, Merrill Lynch One, as we believe this is the best way for us to deliver for IRA clients who choose to have this level of service and advice. Clients will also have the option to invest their retirement through Merrill Edge, either completely self-directed or through Merrill Edge Guided Investing. 
Turning to Slide 17. Global Banking earned $1.6 billion, which is up 22% year-over-year. Q3 reflects good revenue growth, solid cost control and solid client activity. The efficiency ratio improved to 45% in Q3. Compared to previous third quarters, investment banking fees this quarter were the highest since the merger with Merrill in 2009. Return on allocated capital was 17%, a 300 basis point improvement from Q3 '15, despite adding a couple of billion dollars of allocated capital this year. 
Global Banking continues to drive loan growth within its risk and client frameworks, producing solid year-over-year improvement in NII. Revenue growth also benefited from roughly $175 million from gains on FVO loans this quarter versus losses in Q3 '15. 
Higher treasury fees also added to revenue growth. The decrease in noninterest expense compared to Q3 '15 reflects good expense control that offset modestly higher revenue-related compensation and higher FDIC costs. 
Looking at the trends on Slide 18 and comparing Q3 -- and comparing to Q3 last year. Average loans on a year-over-year basis grew $26 billion or 8%. Growth was broad-based across large corporates as well as middle-market borrowers and diversified across most products. Having said that, as we noted last quarter, the pace of commercial loan growth has slowed over the past couple of quarters. Demand across the industry appears to have slowed as well. We remain diligent in certain sectors, such as commercial real estate and energy, and we are also closely monitoring certain international regions.  Average deposits increased from Q3 '15, up $10 billion or 3% from both new and existing clients. As we grow treasury services, we remain focused on quality deposits with respect to LCR. 
Switching to Global Markets on Slide 19. Let me start by reviewing what I said last quarter regarding this segment. The past few quarters are examples of the importance of this segment to not only its clients around the world, but also to the customers and clients of all our business segments. Again, this quarter, Global Markets delivered for clients by helping them raise capital, buy and sell securities as well as manage risk. We continue to invest in and enjoy leadership positions across a broad range of products. 
We believe this improves our sustainability -- we believe this improves the sustainability of our revenue and makes us more relevant to clients across the globe. We've been there for clients when they needed us across all these products. Our results this quarter reflect this strategy and continued commitment to clients. 
Global Markets earned $1.1 billion and returned 12% on allocated capital. Revenue was up appreciably year-over-year and even outpaced typical seasonality by posting modest improvement over Q2 '16. Total revenue, excluding DVA, was up 20% year-over-year on solid sales and trading results, which rose 18%. It's worth noting we achieved these results with slightly less balance sheet, lower VaR and 7% fewer people. Continued expense discipline drove costs 1% lower year-over-year as increases in revenue-related incentive were more than offset by reductions in operating and support costs. 
Moving to trends on Slide 20 and focusing on the components of our sales and trading performance. Sales and trading revenue of $3.7 billion, excluding DVA, was up 18% from Q3 '15, driven by FICC. In terms of revenue, this was the best third quarter in 5 years. 
Excluding DVA and versus Q3 '15, FICC sales and trading of $2.8 billion increased 39% as we built momentum as the quarter progressed across a host of credit products and continued gains in rates products. Mortgages showed particular strength among credit products as investors sought yield. Equity sales and trading was solid at $1 billion in revenue but declined 17% versus Q3 '15, which benefited from higher levels of market volatility and client activity. 
On Slide 21, we present All Other, which recorded a net loss of $182 million. This loss includes a previously disclosed tax charge of $350 million due to the third quarter U.K. enactment of a tax rate reduction, which reduced the value of our U.K. DTA. The loss in the current period compares to earnings of $152 million in Q3 '15 as lower security gains and higher expense litigation offset higher mortgage banking revenue. MBI revenue this quarter includes $280 million benefit from higher valuations on our MSR, driven by slower expected prepaid speeds based upon recent observed trends in customer behavior.
Okay. Let me offer a few takeaways as I finish. We reported solid results this quarter that were consistent with our strategy of responsible growth. We remain focused on delivering responsible growth as well as strengthening and simplifying Bank of America. Capital and liquidity strengthened. Asset quality remains strong. 
We grew revenue. We grew deposits. We grew loans. We delivered for clients and capital markets. We lowered costs. We invested in our future by adding sales professionals and deploying technology that helps customers better live their financial lives and improves satisfaction. And importantly, we returned more capital to our shareholders. 
With that, let's open it up to questions."

Nothing's changed at all to our thoughts regarding the 2018 target that we discussed in the second quarter call. I mean, again, I would note that year-over-year, we've reduced expenses by $0.5 billion. And I would also just point out, to remind everybody, that if you look at expenses over a longer term, we reduced quarterly expenses ex-litigation by $4.8 billion from Q3 '11. That's a $19 billion run rate. So if you think about what we will do between now and 2018, I think we talked about this before. Roughly 1/3 of that is going to come from continued progress on delinquent loan servicing. The other 2/3 is going to come from a lot of different initiatives across the company. We've talked about SIM, our Simplify and Improve initiative. We're going to be utilizing technology to digitize processes, eliminating handling costs. We're going to get technology efficiencies from our data centers consolidation and from more efficient servers. As I said, we're going to continue to make progress on delinquent loan servicing costs, hopefully see some modest improvement on litigation. A very important part of this is the shift to self-serve digital channels: mobile, online, ATM. So that's what the list sounds like, and it goes on and on. I would emphasize this shift to self-serve. We're seeing good momentum with more than 21 million mobile banking active users, and that's growing every week, every month. 18% of our deposit transactions are now completed through mobile devices. That's better for customers. It's also better for our shareholders. It's 1/10 the cost of walking into a branch. So it's all these things kind of put together. It's initiatives across the whole company. It's going to come a lot from support and operations, but there's a little bit in the front office as well as we get more efficient."

First of all, I think it's difficult to see share shifts in Global Markets in any given quarter. The fee pools are just not as transparent as they are in, let's say, investment banking fees or other areas. What we know is client activity was up in the third quarter, and that's what drives our short-term results. Over the longer term, one, it's easier just to assess what's going on with fee pools than share. So I just want to point out, from '14 to '15, on declining fee pools, we're pretty sure we improved our share. Third parties tell us that, and I think that share has come from a number of regions and a number of firms and a number of products as competitors adjust their strategies and capabilities. More specifically, we've been investing in rates for a number of years. I think we're making some progress there. We have a very strong credit platform. And as you know, I think we're making progress there relative to competitors around the world, and I think we're investing in equities. And I think you're -- equities revenue is down, but I think we're seeing improvement relative to the fee pool in equities as well. I do want to emphasize, very importantly, that our strategy is to have a diversified product portfolio across both FICC and equities and globally. That's what our clients need and want from us. And so you could see gains one quarter in one place and see something lower in another place, and that's okay with us. That's our strategy. It's about what the client needs in any given quarter. If we have -- if we're doing a little bit worse in one place, we're probably doing better in another place."

And we continue to grow loans at less rate than we grow deposits. That's going to drive our NIM. It's just a bigger and bigger, lower and lower cost deposit base. And on the loan side, I think consumer is growing better now than commercial in linked quarter, but overall, we expect commercial will get back in a little bit as the economy continues and some of the other uncertainty lifts in the political season here. So on loans and deposits, it will just be growing. And now as you've seen year-over-year, core growth is 7% on loans and growth on deposits. 
On the fee side, what you're seeing is the dynamic, in especially consumer fee areas, finally turn a little bit stable and then turning for us in the card revenue and things like that, which we've hit sort of the inflection point, where the rundown in relative interchange due to selling some portfolios and getting out of noncore portfolios and putting on the core portfolios with rewards attached to it, which helps us, generates deposits and things like that, had stabilized. And you're starting to see, in the last few quarters, card income start to move up a bit. And on service charges, it's been relatively stable. So the fee side will be driven more by wealth management and markets and things like that. And consumer is stable, which is good because it had been a drag for a long time."

And that, in part, is because we are still getting the benefits of the changes made 6, 7, 8 years ago coming through the consumer business, i.e., that what we call back book portfolios or legacy portfolios or whatever word you want to use continue to run off with higher credit risk in them. And we keep putting on, and have put on and continue to put on higher credit quality. So I think if you think about overall charge-offs of $880 million this quarter, that's driven by the consumer business and that's driven by the card and some -- and the legacy home equities. And so keeping the card business where we want it is critical, and you're seeing this continue. Even as we start to grow that portfolio, both nominally and rate, the charge-off picture is strong. And so when you go back and look at what happened during the crisis, the charge-offs came abnormally from the edges of credit, and we've kept ourselves out of that."

One is a full $450 billion of our deposits are noninterest-bearing, so they aren't going to reprice. The great debate is about what's the -- how sticky are those. And if you think about that, those are dominated by our consumer business, and our noninterest-bearing accounts in consumer have doubled in size over the last 5 or 6 years due to focusing on primary accounts. We're up to 90% primary accounts in the household, where they run their household finances through our account, and therefore, they're direct deposit their check and things like that. So the first thing to remember is of $1.2 trillion, $450 billion noninterest-bearing, and the dominant part of that consumer and also in the Wealth Management and the core transactional account of both consumers. And then on the business side, similarly, we have driven our deposits to be really LCR-friendly and core operating accounts. And so those aren't going to move. The noninterest-bearing aren't going to move much. And the big debate is how much balance would be in there, and we feel confident the balances will stay just because of the nature of the accounts. 
And then when you go to the second dynamic, remember that even with all those deposit growth, one of the things we continue to do and the impact is less and less is we are, especially in consumer business, running off CDs still at a fairly decent clip that were historically used to fund prior company's balance sheets that we don't need the funding at that cost. So we have some rollover, but that continues to decline. The weighted average cost drops off -- that cost drops off, and it drives down or holds steady the weighted average cost. And then if you look at money markets and other interest-bearing, they really haven't moved much. So we feel good about the consumer. We forget about the deposit base overall. We feel very good about the consumer deposit base. It just crossed $600 billion for the first time in the company's history in consumers generally. And with that, I think we look -- if rates rise, we think that it's a substantial value for the company, and Paul gave you a way to think about that earlier with 1/4 of $3.3 billion, 25% of $3.3 billion."

I think you probably also noticed that while combined debit and credit card spend was good in the quarter at 5%, 6% if you exclude fuel, I'm -- I'm adjusting for our divestitures last year, that the growth in the card income was impacted by, as you noted, customer reward programs. However, I think, just focusing on the fee income, this is some really key benefits of our strategy, which is to attract relatively higher-quality card customers and reward them for deepening their overall relationship with us. This strategy really drives deposit growth and makes deposits stickier, plus we believe these customers have lower loss rates. They use the call center less, which helps us lower costs. I think when you want to see the effect of this, you have to look at the overall consumer segment and what's going on there in terms of growth of profits and improvement in expenses. And just the last thing I'd just point out, look, our risk-adjusted margins on card are strong at over 9%.

So what you're starting to see if you look at the trend this year is you're starting to see core movement, positive movement both in card income and in balances as we move across the year, and we expect that to continue. It will be strong, responsible growth. And one of the great debates we have in the company is people say, ""Why can't you grow this faster?"" Or why can't -- we're giving up too much in the interchange for the preferred balance or Preferred Rewards. The interesting question is, ""Are you giving up something you'd never have in Preferred Rewards?"" I.e. we're bringing more customer relationships and depth, and that gets us something. So incrementally, the net interchange is actually there as opposed to what -- theoretically, you get gross interchange with a noncustomer in our Affinity program. So we focus on entire customer relationship. It is very valuable. It is very profitable. And believe me, if we could grow it faster responsibly, we would. But the idea is just to grind out the slow, steady growth, and we're starting to see that come through. And largely, it was masked in '14, '15 and behind that, '13, for those areas because we were divesting a lot of noncore relationships. And now we have the core affinities we want, and we have the core card business we want."

So we run our consumer business consistent with responsible growth for the company. And that -- what that means is that you focus on deepening relationships, what we call a stair-step, where it's the core deposit account, the core credit card and getting it get used, and the core mortgage, and the core home equity and the core auto loans. That's what we've been driving at and continue to drive that. That's the backbone of what we did and how we repositioned this company over many years. 
In terms of the branches, Mike, you've rattled off all the statistics, which Paul talked about earlier. But it is a complex optimization, but it all starts with the consumer. What is the consumer going to do? And so while 18% of deposits are made by mobile deposits, 82% by their nature aren't. And where do they go? About 50 percentage points of that go through the ATM machines, and about another 30-odd percent go through the teller lines still today. And so you have to be ready and able to serve in all dynamics. And so what we continue to do is optimize the branch structure, the call structure, the ATM structure, the mobile structure and the online structure altogether. And a way to think about that optimization, and why it's this extremely important business to this company is that we've gone from 300 basis points of the cost of all that to deposits to about 150 over the last 6, 7 years. And that's by continuing to optimize the physical plant as well as all these other tool -- means. And so if you ask me, your question is, how far can you go, you have to also then think about what we want to go on in a branch. And so if you look back at some of the statistics that Paul had in the deck for consumer, where you see things like appointments set up are 340,000 in the third quarter. So just think about that, 340,000 times a customer went on a mobile phone and asked to come to a branch. And so we need those branches to receive those mobile phone customers. And why are they coming? Usually for a much more important financial transaction to them than handing us a check for deposit. And so it's a quality versus quantity and making sure we understand that. So we are optimizing all those. And you can see on Page 14 on the lower right, you can see the difference moves. I'd say we went from 7 million visits probably 4, 5 years ago to 6 million to 5 million. But those 5 million are of higher quality, and we think that's important. And there are certain transactions and certain capabilities that you just have to have at your branch, that you just have to do face-to-face, very difficult things like how to get a power of attorney for a parent that's sick, or I want to do a mortgage. It's very -- it's still difficult to do it through the phone and things like that. So we'll have all aspects. We'll drive it down, and you can see that we continue to make that progress."

Do you have the answer and you don't want to say for competitive reasons? Or you don't know, it's kind of a give and take based on the customer experience? I mean, some of your competitors talk about closing 100 to 200 branches per year. You reduced 112 over the last year, but it seems to be slowing. So I'm trying to get a sense of that."

And the key is not to get ahead of them because that can cause you problems, and not to be behind them because there can be cost issues and empty branches. So even in the 112 we're down, we've added branches in places like Denver, the Denver branch that we added are in the top 10% of performing branches today on relationship building. We've added branches in Manhattan. We've added branches in Minneapolis. And so we're in a sea change in terms of what the branches look like individually. The new branches are different. We're adding branches we didn't have, and we're closing branches where the utilization isn't there. The nature of how far a customer will travel is also different now than it was 10, 15 years ago. So I think you said, what are all the different reasons? The answer was -- I think you said, is we'll follow the customer.

And so the key was to make FICC work. You're talking more revenue, but we look at profit. And so to get the profit we needed to out of the fixed income and equities business, we had to take the cost structure down, which we did in '10 and '11. Tom Montag and the team worked very hard at that and got to sort of breakeven, down over $1 billion a quarter. And then we ran along a number of years, and then they've actually taken out year-over-year. You can see the cost continue to be managed well despite higher revenue. So I would say, taking the discussion, I'd say that the way our fixed income business generates revenue, a lot of it is around our capabilities in underwriting, our capabilities in all of the different variations from high-grade leverage to everything that goes on. And that's a relatively stable pool of revenue that you see repeated. And what goes up or down is really the activity around that based on the market seizing up in certain quarters in terms of issuance and things like that. 
When you think about the other thing that Tom and the team had to really go after, which is to broaden our capabilities in the macro segment a little bit, because that was something that traditionally, the Bank of America and Merrill Lynch teams came together. And he's done that. So that's added some more volume to us. So we think we've been gaining share, as Paul said earlier, when you look at revenue comparison among the top 10 banks without all the leak charge, for just revenue. And we think -- but we think it's driven by our fixed income capabilities. And it's driven by our connectivity from the issuer of bonds and debt to the investor. And we'll continue to drive that. And so the team's done a good job. And I'd say that we're -- at a fundamental level this -- well, this quarter feels better than last year's quarter. It's not a quarter that when you look across 4 or 5 years that we haven't come close to on many cases and have done better than a few times."

We think the economy feels good. So in a good economy, we should be able to grow commercial loans. We'll have to stay focused on some sectors and some regions, but we think we can grow commercial loans. There's -- utilization rates and revolvers, they came off their highs, but they're at the higher end of the range, which also suggests or reflects good commercial activity. We're adding bankers in the U.S. in commercial banking and small business. We're adding them to regions, where we know we have some synergies or some capabilities, some big MSAs.

There are creditworthy customers that we can do more with. And the only way to do that is because we have a talented, world-class commercial banking team, is to add more capacity. And so -- and that capacity is starting to build. And it takes a while because you hire a commercial banker, and we sometimes give them some of the undercovered names in our portfolio or else, and then they go after the prospects that we have. And it takes a while to build those up. People don't change their commercial banking relationships in an afternoon. So our business banking and our middle market, especially across America, we have been adding commercial bankers. And we expect that to redound to our benefit. Given an environment which may be solid but okay we'd expect to gain share in those markets as those bankers come on stream and become more productive.

At face-to-face or point of sale, the chip card, when we're -- largely through all our customers having chip cards, merchant -- what we call chip-on-chip, i.e., our chip card used with a merchant chip machine is rising sort of a percent or so a quarter and is now, as best we judge it, in the 30s -- the high 20s or something like that, Nancy. So all that being said, we expect to get leverage in our fraud losses in the Consumer business year-over-year and we expect that to continue to come down. And so yes, that is a major initiative for us to continue to drive that down. Part of it is education of consumers. Part of it's getting the chip cards in the hands and getting the machine -- merchants using the chip machines. Part of it is the tokenization and the wallets and things that go on in Visa checkout and all the variations in MasterCard and getting -- because that's a tokenized better execution and is more secure. And so our view as a provider has been to adopt all these wallets and technologies that have this tokenization capabilities and that then drives down the cost of losses due to merchant complaints and other types of things. So you're absolutely right. Cybersecurity, yes, theft of cards from other people and sold on the Internet, all that stuff is important to us and so we spend, as we said, $0.5 billion a year protecting ourselves, but also part of it is making sure we understand where our consumers are in terms of lost cards and things like that."

So response -- if you ask anyone in the company responsible growth, it's about developing relationships so that we can grow with our customers over time based upon their needs and goals. It's not about the number of products that we open, it's whether customers want and need the products and services we're offering them and use them. That's how we measure ourselves. We've spent years building controls and governance and escalation around this. We're always monitoring them. It's just how we run the company. So that's probably the best answer I can give you in terms of how we think about this issue."

And our board, the independence of our board, the experience on our board, how they approach their responsibilities, I think, is very strong and I think our shareholders have understood that and agreed with that. And so I think we govern ourselves in a very tough fashion, i.e., the board's demanding on us and understands the strategy and has helped support this strategy through sometimes when people would challenge it. And I think it's proven to be the right strategy at this point. And so if you get to technicalities, our Lead Independent Director duties are as strong as anybody's in the industry.

But we always have to remember that there's basically, leave aside how the allocation works to the businesses works differently, but when you think about the 10% capital requirements for us, 300 basis points or 3 percentage points of that cannot be put to use. It cannot take risk and so we are earning all our money on the 7%. And so when you think about the weighted average of that, it comes out over 10%, that means you earn a lot more on the 7% even across the whole company and so that's one of the difficulties. So how do we optimize that? We make that 10% less dollar volume. If we can keep moving dollar volume down and keep increasing earnings you get that, that's by all the discussion Paul had in response to earlier questions about optimizing the balance sheet or we get expenses down or we grow less risky earnings that can generate income. But it's a constant optimization, but the basic principle that people -- that we sometimes forget is that when you think about 10%,  only 30% of capital can take no risk and so basically it earns your cost of debt."

Before I turn the call over to Brian and Paul, let me remind you we may make some forward-looking statements. For further information on these, please refer to either our earnings release documents, our website or our SEC filings.
One thing before Brian and Paul get into the results, I just want to remind you we filed an 8-K on October 4, giving notification the company changed our method of accounting for the amortization of premium and accretion of discounts related to certain debt securities. It's known by the investment community as FAS 91. Our change to the contractual method, which is used by the majority of our peers, will provide better comparability of our results. As a result of that change, we restated our historical results and provided the historically restated information in the 8-K, and our earnings materials today naturally reflect those restatements. 
With that, let me turn it over to Brian Moynihan, our Chairman and CEO, for some opening comments; before Paul Donofrio, our CFO, goes through the details. Brian?"
19049,379148171,1056106,"Bank of America Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 17, 2016",2016-10-17,"Earnings Calls","Bank of America Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Lee. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to review our third quarter results. Our results this quarter continue our progress on our long-term strategy. We continue to drive responsible growth and deliver more of the com",1550,"Thank you, Lee. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to review our third quarter results. 
Our results this quarter continue our progress on our long-term strategy. We continue to drive responsible growth and deliver more of the company's capabilities to our clients and customers. This progress is becoming clear with each successive quarter, and you can see the highlights of that on Slide 2. 
We reported earnings of $5 billion or $0.41 per diluted share, an EPS improvement of 8% from the year-ago quarter. We improved operating leverage across the businesses, utilizing technology to lower costs and improve our processes. Our pretax earnings improved 17% compared to third quarter 2015. This pretax earnings comparison is important as it eliminates the unusual movements in the tax line like this quarter's tax charge for the U.K. corporate tax rate change. 
Like last quarter, I thought I'd address a few topics we are hearing from all of you. To do that, let's look at Slides 3 and 4 of the earnings material. A first question is: Are we making progress driving our responsible growth strategy? Yes, we continue to show progress throughout all the businesses. Our revenue growth has more clarity as we move past the periods of significant impacts from implementing regulations, running off noncore portfolios and divesting noncore businesses. 
Revenue grew 3% over the third quarter of last year. Behind that improvement is our continuing investment in this great franchise, in our sales teams, in our technology across the board. These sales teams and the buildup we've been doing there helps us to increase our capacity to serve our customers and clients. 
An example of that is in our consumer business. They are focused on being the core bank to all our households. This has resulted in fewer checking accounts than we had years ago. But the average balance of the checking accounts we has -- have has doubled, and they are now roughly at $6,500 per account. 
You can also see this in the growth of our Merrill Edge brokerage balances, which now total over $138 billion, adding investment relationships to the mass market customer base. In general, consumers are deepening their relationships with us as they use our straightforward investing tools to get them started on the path to investing. 
For our affluent and wealthy customers, our customer progress also continues. Our Global Wealth and Investment Management teams, U.S. Trust and Merrill Lynch not only manage $2 trillion-plus in investment balances but also manage nearly $150 billion in loans and more than $250 billion in deposits, and we continue to see net flows of core assets in that business. 
On the commercial side, clients continue to respond to our universal banking model for a simplified stop for financing, investing and advisory services. We will continue to operate within our established risk framework and defined customer groups, and we aren't reaching for growth. This will drive more sustainable results over a period -- longer period of time for our shareholders. 
And then with our global peers restructuring, including in the markets business, I think this quarter is another great example of our global business -- Global Markets business' importance to our investing and issuing clients. We saw better client activity driving the best third quarter results we've had in 5 years in investment banking and in sales and trading, and we're doing that with a smaller balance sheet, fewer people and lower value at risk or VaR. So growth and deepening, all consistent with our responsible growth strategy, continues across all the customer bases. Paul will talk to you more about the statistics in these successes. 
Another question that we get asked is: Can credit remain this strong? Well, many of you asked that last quarter and the quarter before that and the quarter before that. In this quarter, it's still got better again, with our charge-off ratio declining to 40 basis points this quarter, at an historic low. This is driven by changes we made right after the crisis, think in 2008 and 2009, and the long-term benefits of that effort continue to come through; and, by the way, sticking to our responsible growth strategy even as times have been relatively better. 
U.S. consumer health is generally good. Over the past few quarters, exposures in our oil and gas that were causing industry concerns for commercial losses have improved, and charge-offs have receded. Other commercial credit remains very strong, and Paul will touch on these topics later. 
Another question we get asked is: What can we do to drive earnings even if we stay in this low rate, low growth environment? We aren't waiting for interest rates to rise here at Bank of America. We're driving our earnings growth now. We work on the things that we can control: expenses, loan and deposit growth and fee growth. Long-term rates are down compared to last year yet earnings have grown. Despite that, net interest income is up 3% from third quarter '15 while net interest yield has been stable because we grew core loans and deposits. 
Paul will take you through a loan growth details later, but I wanted to pause a moment and talk about our deposit growth. Deposits are a core part of what drives our franchise earnings. We have $1.2 trillion of deposits. That's proof that customers entrust us to safeguard their money. We are heavily weighted in the mix of those deposits towards consumers, whether they're general consumers or wealthy consumers. This, in turn, provides a very stable base of funding for the company and allows us to be less reliant on the markets for funding. 
Nearly $450 billion or 36% of our deposits are noninterest-bearing, a very strong mix. Deposits on average grew $68 billion year-over-year or 6%. The teams have done tremendous work here, and this quarter wasn't an anomaly. This is the fourth consecutive quarter we have grown -- where we have grown deposits more than $50 billion over the previous year. 
But our commercial teams remain focused on growing deposits also. They're growing deposits that are LCR-friendly and doing great work with our industry-leading cash management capabilities. As a result, year-over-year, Global Banking grew their deposits 3% to $300 billion. Our consumer and wealth management teams, combined, have $860 billion in deposits. They grew this large base by 8% in the past 12 months. For the first time, consumer topped $600 billion in deposits. 
These deposits are growing because our capabilities in the business are the best in the industry and our customers and clients see that, whether it's our 21 million-plus mobile banking customers, our 34 million-plus online customers or the more than 5 million customers that come into our financial centers every week. These customers show that they appreciate the capabilities of integration of our networks. 
So when we look at what else we can do to control and drive earnings in a low growth environment, we get asked a lot about expenses. And can those expenses keep being driven down and go lower? Well, the answer is yes. Last quarter, we gave you a 2018 expense target, and we continue to make progress towards that. Our expenses declined 3% from third quarter 2015 to 2016. Our efficiency ratio improved 62% -- to 62% this quarter. That is a 400 basis point improvement from last year's third quarter. 
We continue to deliver on expense reductions while continuing to invest in technology, in sales teams and other matters that are important for the future of this franchise. After you take into account the additional large bank FDIC assessment that started this quarter, expense is also down on a linked-quarter basis even as we continue to invest and absorb all the severance, regulatory, resolution planning and other repositioning costs to continue to reduce our operating costs. We have been innovating in technology, and we'll continue to do so to improve processes and eliminate the need for paper and humans handling that paper. 
Our Simplify and Improve initiatives continue to help drive those costs down, and that leads to the question we also get asked: Can we deliver and sustain returns above our cost of capital? As Lee talked about earlier, we restated our results to change under FAS 91 and reduce the variability and make us more comparable to peers. As you can see, that makes a little easier to see the longer-term return on tangible common equity trends. This quarter, we reported 10.3% and it is now stabilized above the cost of capital even given our larger and larger capital base. We still have work to do here to drive it to our ultimate goals, but this quarter is another strong step in that direction. 
And importantly, on Slide 4, you can see that each business has improved its leverage. It grew -- they grew their earnings, had strong efficiency and returned far above the cost of capital, and all that continues to bode well as we look ahead. So as we look forward, we are driving responsible growth and maintaining discipline on costs. And this has allowed us to deliver more capital back to you, and we'll keep on doing that. 
Now let me turn it over to Paul for -- to cover the numbers. Paul?"
19049,379148171,1056106,"Bank of America Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 17, 2016",2016-10-17,"Earnings Calls","Bank of America Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Brian. Good morning, everybody. Since Brian covered the income statement highlights, I will start with the balance sheet on Page 5. Strong deposit growth drove a small increase in the size of our balance sheet versus Q2. Deposits rose $17 billio",3530,"Thanks, Brian. Good morning, everybody. Since Brian covered the income statement highlights, I will start with the balance sheet on Page 5. 
Strong deposit growth drove a small increase in the size of our balance sheet versus Q2. Deposits rose $17 billion or 6% on an annualized basis. During the quarter, long-term debt fell by $5 billion. We put cash to work, growing securities and our investment portfolio and, more modestly, through loan growth. Global liquidity sources rose, driven by deposit growth, and we remain well compliant with LCR requirements. 
Tangible common equity of $174 billion improved by $2.8 billion from Q2, driven by earnings. In the process, we returned $2.2 billion in common shareholders -- to common shareholders through a combination of dividends and $1.4 billion in share repurchases. On a per-share basis, tangible book value increased to $17.14, up $1.60 or 11% from Q3 '15. I would note that this increase was driven by both retained earnings as well as share repurchases below tangible book value as we reduced shares 3% from Q3 '15. 
Turning to regulatory metrics. As a reminder, we report capital under the advanced approaches. Our CET1 transition ratio under Basel III ended the quarter at 11%. On a fully phased-in basis, CET1 capital improved $4 billion to $166 billion. Under the advanced approaches, compared to Q2 '16, with -- our CET1 ratio increased 40 basis points to 10.9% and is well above our 10% 2019 requirement. RWA declined roughly $20 billion, driven by reductions in Global Markets exposures and improvements in credit quality driven by runoff of noncore legacy exposure. 
We also improved our capital metrics under the standardized approach. Here, our CET1 ratio improved to 11.8%. Supplementary leverage ratios for both parent and bank continue to exceed U.S. regulatory minimums that take effect in 2018. 
Turning to Slide 6. On an average basis, total loans were up $23 billion or 3% from Q3 '15. And while up from Q2 '16, growth was at a slower pace. Consistent with past periods, we break out loans in our business segments and in All Other. Year-over-year, loans in All Other were down $30 billion, driven by continued runoff of first and second-lien mortgages, while loans in our business segments were up $53 billion or 7%. 
In Consumer Banking, we continue to see growth in residential real estate and vehicle lending, offset somewhat by home equity paydowns, which continue to outpace originations. In wealth management, we saw growth in residential real estate and structured lending. Global Banking loans were up $26 billion or 8% year-over-year. On the bottom right of the chart, note the growth of $68 billion in average deposits that Brian mentioned. 
Turning to asset quality on Slide 7. We believe a number of factors, including our strategy of responsible growth, enhanced underwriting standards since 2008 and a healthier economy, have transformed the risk profile of Bank of America as we look forward to future economic cycles. Total net charge-offs of 100 -- of $888 million improved $97 million from Q2. 
Consumer losses declined across a number of products, and commercial losses also declined, driven by lower energy losses. Driven by these improvements, provision expense of $850 million declined $126 million from Q2. We had a small overall net reserve release in the quarter as Consumer Real Estate releases more than offset builds in other products. 
On Slide 8, we provide credit quality data on our consumer portfolio. We remain focused on originating consumer loans with borrowers with high FICO Scores, and our asset quality remains strong. Net charge-offs declined $71 million from Q2. This improvement was broad-based across Consumer Real Estate as well as credit card. 
Note that credit cards accounts for more than 2/3 of losses in our consumer portfolio. And within our U.S. credit card book, the loss rate improved to 2.45%, NPLs improved and reserve coverage remained strong. 
Moving to commercial credit on Slide 9. Net charge-offs of $110 million improved $26 million from Q2. With respect to energy, exposures were down, losses improved, oil prices have stabilized, and we have $1 billion of reserves. More specifically, energy charge-offs of $45 billion decreased $34 billion from Q2. While reservable criticized declined from Q2, we did experience an increase in NPLs this quarter, which was concentrated with 2 clients, one in metals and mining and one in energy. 
Overall, our commercial portfolio continues to perform well. As I shared with you last quarter, the metrics in the commercial portfolio speak for themselves in terms of quality and performance. The reservable criticized exposure declined and, as a percentage of loans, remains low. The commercial net charge-off ratio is 10 basis points. Excluding small business, it is 5 basis points and has been around 15 basis points or better for 15 consecutive quarters. And the NPL ratio remains low at 45 basis points. 
Turning to Slide 10. Net interest income on a GAAP non-FTE basis was $10.2 billion, $10.4 billion on an FTE basis. As Lee mentioned earlier, we changed our accounting method for the amortization of premium or discount paid on certain of our debt securities from the prepayment method to the contractual method. The contractual method is used by our peers and should make it easier for investors to make comparisons.  Compared to Q3 '15, NII is up $300 million or 3% as loan growth, higher short-end rates and higher security balances funded by deposits more than offset the negative impact of generally lower long-end rates over the past several quarters. 
Okay. With respect to asset sensitivity, as of 9/30, an instantaneous 100 basis point parallel increase in rates is estimated to increase NII by $5.3 billion over the subsequent 12 months. This is lower than the sensitivity we reported at June 30. The reduction was mostly on the long end, driven by the change to the contractual method and slower prepaid speeds based upon recent trends in customer behavior. Note that the sensitivity on the short end at $3.3 billion has not changed significantly. 
Turning to Slide 11. Noninterest expense was $13.5 billion. That's $0.5 billion lower or 3% lower than Q3 '15, driven by cost reductions across the company. This is the initial quarter of the increased FDIC assessment to shore up the deposit insurance fund. The increase in expense for us is roughly $100 million per quarter. Compared to Q2 '16, expenses were stable as good core expense control was offset by the higher FDIC costs and modestly higher incentives. Q3 litigation expense was $250 million, which is fairly consistent with both Q3 '15 as well as Q2 '16. 
Most expense categories were lower year-over-year. This trend was led by personnel expense, which includes the Q4 '15 expiration of the fully amortized advisory awards in Wealth Management. The rest of the improvement was driven by reduced costs of mortgage servicing, coupled with SIM efforts and other initiatives. Our employee base is down 3% from Q3 of '15. While the overall headcount is down, it's important to note that year-over-year, we added over 1,000 primary sales associates across Consumer, Wealth Management and Global Banking.
Turning to the business segments and starting with Consumer Banking on Slide 12. Consumer earned $1.8 billion, continuing its trend of solid results and reporting a robust 21% return on allocated capital. I would note that pretax, pre-provision earnings rose $377 million or 10%. Expense and NII improvement were both notable and, together, enough to more than offset higher provision expense and prior year divestiture gains. 
Revenue was relatively flat on a reported basis compared to Q3 '15 as 4% growth in NII was offset, as I said, by the absence of approximately $200 million of divestiture gains in Q3 '15. As a reminder, these gains in Q3 '15 resulted from divestitures of an ancillary appraisal business, a card portfolio and some financial centers. Excluding those prior period gains, revenue improved year-over-year, and growth in pretax, pre-provision earnings was even more substantial. Falling 400 basis points, Consumer Banking's efficiency ratio of 55% improved meaningfully year-over-year.
Okay. Turning to Slide 13 and key trends. First, on the upper left, the stats are a reminder of our strong competitive position. Looking a little closer at revenue drivers compared to Q3 '15. Net interest income continued to improve as we drove deposits higher. Average deposits continued their strong growth, up $50 billion or 9% year-over-year, outpacing the industry. 
With respect to noninterest income, service charges were up modestly while card income was down. Spending levels and issuance were strong, but revenue growth was muted by customer rewards. We are attracting relatively higher-quality card customers that, on the one hand, have higher spending habits but, on the other hand, receive more awards. This has 2 important benefits to note: first, rewards deepen relationships, helping to grow deposits and make them more sticky, for example. Second, in our experience, these customers have lower loss rates and a reduced need to interact with call centers, thereby allowing us to lower costs. 
Turning to expenses in the upper right. They climbed 7% from Q3 '15 despite -- excuse me, turning to expenses, they declined 7% from Q3 '15 despite the higher FDIC assessment charges in the quarter. Expense reductions are the result of a number of initiatives. For example, mobile banking penetration helps to optimize our delivery network while improving customer satisfaction. More chip cards help us lower fraud costs, and digitalization of processes and statements helps us eliminate paper and related handling costs. One can observe the impacts of these types of initiatives on the cost of deposits, which continued its march lower, dropping below 1.6% this quarter. 
Focusing on client balances on the left. In addition to deposit growth, Merrill Edge brokerage assets, at $138 billion, are up 18% versus Q3 '15 on strong account flows and market valuations. We also increased the number of Merrill Edge accounts by 11% from Q3 '15. We now have nearly 1.7 million households that leverage our financial solution advisers and self-directed investing platform. 
Moving across the bottom right of the page. Note that loans are up 7% from Q3 '15 on strong mortgage and vehicle lending growth. As reviewed in previous quarters, we continue to focus on originating high FICO Score loans, which have generally produced low loss rates and strong risk-adjusted returns. Loan growth included Consumer Real Estate production of $20.4 billion, up 21% from Q3 '15 and in line with Q2 '16 as customers continue to take advantage of historically low interest rates. 
We retained about 3/4 of first mortgage production on the balance sheet this quarter. Average vehicle loans were up 17% from Q3 '15, with average booked FICO Scores remaining well above 750 and net losses remaining below 30 basis points. With respect to U.S. card -- excuse me, U.S. consumer card, average balances grew 7% from Q2 on an annualized basis, aided by seasonal back-to-school lending. We issued more than 1.3 million cards in the quarter, and spending on credit cards, adjusted for divestitures, was up 8% compared to Q3 '15. 
Turning to Slide 14 and digital banking trends. As I mentioned earlier, we continue to see strong momentum in digital banking adoption with use across service, appointments and sales. Mobile banking is transforming how our customers bank and reshaping our consumer segment. Importantly, as adoption rises, particularly around transaction processing and self-service, we see improved efficiency and customer satisfaction. We continue to improve capabilities, with the latest example being the launch of our Spanish mobile app, which attracted over 800,000 active users in the first 10 weeks. We added roughly 1.1 million new mobile users in the quarter. 
The pace of user growth has increased despite an already impressive penetration rate of our checking account holders.  With more than 21.3 million active users, deposits from mobile devices now represents 18% of deposit transactions, and 26 million checks were deposited via mobile devices this quarter. That is an average of 280,000 deposits per day, an increase of 27% year-over-year and the equivalent to a volume of 830 financial centers. Digital sales now represent 18% of total sales,  and we are now -- we now have more than 3,500 digital ambassadors in our financial centers driving further adoption. 
Also, as you know, we are a leader in person-to-person and person-to-business money movement through digital transfers and bill payment capabilities. Consumers moved $243 billion in Q3, up 6% from last year. And while all this is transformative, I would just remind you that we still have a little less than 1 million people per day walking into our centers across the U.S. This in-person interaction is important in terms of deepening and retaining personal relationships, providing more complex financial help and creating opportunities for further engagement. 
Turning to Slide 15. Global Wealth and Investment Management produced earnings of $697 million, up 10% from Q3 '15. Now it's no secret that this segment operates in an industry undergoing meaningful change as firms and clients adapt to the new fiduciary rules and other market dynamics. The good news is we start from a position of strength with $2.5 trillion in client balances. We have market-leading brands and a wide range of investment service offers, from self-service to fully managed. Plus we have the resources to continue to invest in market-leading capabilities that address the changing needs of our clients. 
Year-over-year, revenue was down modestly, but expenses were down even more, improving pretax margin to 25%, up meaningfully from Q3 '15. Overall, revenue declined 2% from Q3 '15 as NII growth was more than offset by lower transactional revenues. NII benefited from solid loan and deposit growth. Noninterest income declined from Q3 '15, driven by lower transactional revenue that continues to be impacted by market factors as well as migration of activity from brokerage to managed relationships. 
Noninterest expense declined nearly $313 million (sic) [ $213 million ] or 6% from Q3 '15, with half of that benefit derived from the expiration of the amortization of advisory retention awards that were put in place at the time of the Merrill Lynch merger. The rest of the improvement was the result of work across many categories of expense more than offsetting higher FDIC costs. 
Moving to Slide 16. We continued to see overall solid client engagement. Client balances approached $2.5 trillion and are up from Q2, including higher market valuations, $10 billion of long-term AUM flows and continued loan and deposit growth. Average deposits compared against Q3 '15 are up 4%, driven by growth in the second half of 2015. Compared to Q2, average deposits were impacted by seasonal tax payments. Average loans were up 7% year-over-year. Growth remained concentrated in Consumer Real Estate and structured lending. 
Lastly, earlier this month, we announced some innovations to our IRA products and services, which we believe positions us to better serve our clients given new fiduciary rules. These innovations are industry-leading and address not only the new fiduciary rules for retirement accounts but also client preference for more choice and new ways to invest. First, we announced the rollout of a new offering called Merrill Edge Guided Investing. This solution offers clients online investing, enhanced with professional portfolio management. With the addition of this solution, clients have 3 fundamental choices which they can mix and match to best meet their needs. Clients can invest online, completely self-directed through Merrill Edge; or if they are interested in enhanced portfolio -- enhanced professional portfolio management, they will be able to use Merrill Edge Guided Investing; or they can choose fully advised, working one on one with a financial adviser via brokerage or fee-based advisory platforms. 
We also announced that beginning in April 2017, for clients that choose to have a financial adviser provide advice with respect to their IRA accounts, we will provide this service to our fee-based advisory platform, Merrill Lynch One, as we believe this is the best way for us to deliver for IRA clients who choose to have this level of service and advice. Clients will also have the option to invest their retirement through Merrill Edge, either completely self-directed or through Merrill Edge Guided Investing. 
Turning to Slide 17. Global Banking earned $1.6 billion, which is up 22% year-over-year. Q3 reflects good revenue growth, solid cost control and solid client activity. The efficiency ratio improved to 45% in Q3. Compared to previous third quarters, investment banking fees this quarter were the highest since the merger with Merrill in 2009. Return on allocated capital was 17%, a 300 basis point improvement from Q3 '15, despite adding a couple of billion dollars of allocated capital this year. 
Global Banking continues to drive loan growth within its risk and client frameworks, producing solid year-over-year improvement in NII. Revenue growth also benefited from roughly $175 million from gains on FVO loans this quarter versus losses in Q3 '15. 
Higher treasury fees also added to revenue growth. The decrease in noninterest expense compared to Q3 '15 reflects good expense control that offset modestly higher revenue-related compensation and higher FDIC costs. 
Looking at the trends on Slide 18 and comparing Q3 -- and comparing to Q3 last year. Average loans on a year-over-year basis grew $26 billion or 8%. Growth was broad-based across large corporates as well as middle-market borrowers and diversified across most products. Having said that, as we noted last quarter, the pace of commercial loan growth has slowed over the past couple of quarters. Demand across the industry appears to have slowed as well. We remain diligent in certain sectors, such as commercial real estate and energy, and we are also closely monitoring certain international regions.  Average deposits increased from Q3 '15, up $10 billion or 3% from both new and existing clients. As we grow treasury services, we remain focused on quality deposits with respect to LCR. 
Switching to Global Markets on Slide 19. Let me start by reviewing what I said last quarter regarding this segment. The past few quarters are examples of the importance of this segment to not only its clients around the world, but also to the customers and clients of all our business segments. Again, this quarter, Global Markets delivered for clients by helping them raise capital, buy and sell securities as well as manage risk. We continue to invest in and enjoy leadership positions across a broad range of products. 
We believe this improves our sustainability -- we believe this improves the sustainability of our revenue and makes us more relevant to clients across the globe. We've been there for clients when they needed us across all these products. Our results this quarter reflect this strategy and continued commitment to clients. 
Global Markets earned $1.1 billion and returned 12% on allocated capital. Revenue was up appreciably year-over-year and even outpaced typical seasonality by posting modest improvement over Q2 '16. Total revenue, excluding DVA, was up 20% year-over-year on solid sales and trading results, which rose 18%. It's worth noting we achieved these results with slightly less balance sheet, lower VaR and 7% fewer people. Continued expense discipline drove costs 1% lower year-over-year as increases in revenue-related incentive were more than offset by reductions in operating and support costs. 
Moving to trends on Slide 20 and focusing on the components of our sales and trading performance. Sales and trading revenue of $3.7 billion, excluding DVA, was up 18% from Q3 '15, driven by FICC. In terms of revenue, this was the best third quarter in 5 years. 
Excluding DVA and versus Q3 '15, FICC sales and trading of $2.8 billion increased 39% as we built momentum as the quarter progressed across a host of credit products and continued gains in rates products. Mortgages showed particular strength among credit products as investors sought yield. Equity sales and trading was solid at $1 billion in revenue but declined 17% versus Q3 '15, which benefited from higher levels of market volatility and client activity. 
On Slide 21, we present All Other, which recorded a net loss of $182 million. This loss includes a previously disclosed tax charge of $350 million due to the third quarter U.K. enactment of a tax rate reduction, which reduced the value of our U.K. DTA. The loss in the current period compares to earnings of $152 million in Q3 '15 as lower security gains and higher expense litigation offset higher mortgage banking revenue. MBI revenue this quarter includes $280 million benefit from higher valuations on our MSR, driven by slower expected prepaid speeds based upon recent observed trends in customer behavior.
Okay. Let me offer a few takeaways as I finish. We reported solid results this quarter that were consistent with our strategy of responsible growth. We remain focused on delivering responsible growth as well as strengthening and simplifying Bank of America. Capital and liquidity strengthened. Asset quality remains strong. 
We grew revenue. We grew deposits. We grew loans. We delivered for clients and capital markets. We lowered costs. We invested in our future by adding sales professionals and deploying technology that helps customers better live their financial lives and improves satisfaction. And importantly, we returned more capital to our shareholders. 
With that, let's open it up to questions."

Nothing's changed at all to our thoughts regarding the 2018 target that we discussed in the second quarter call.

And I would also just point out, to remind everybody, that if you look at expenses over a longer term, we reduced quarterly expenses ex-litigation by $4.8 billion from Q3 '11. That's a $19 billion run rate. So if you think about what we will do between now and 2018, I think we talked about this before. Roughly 1/3 of that is going to come from continued progress on delinquent loan servicing. The other 2/3 is going to come from a lot of different initiatives across the company. We've talked about SIM, our Simplify and Improve initiative. We're going to be utilizing technology to digitize processes, eliminating handling costs. We're going to get technology efficiencies from our data centers consolidation and from more efficient servers. As I said, we're going to continue to make progress on delinquent loan servicing costs, hopefully see some modest improvement on litigation. A very important part of this is the shift to self-serve digital channels: mobile, online, ATM. So that's what the list sounds like, and it goes on and on. I would emphasize this shift to self-serve. We're seeing good momentum with more than 21 million mobile banking active users, and that's growing every week, every month. 18% of our deposit transactions are now completed through mobile devices. That's better for customers. It's also better for our shareholders. It's 1/10 the cost of walking into a branch. So it's all these things kind of put together. It's initiatives across the whole company. It's going to come a lot from support and operations, but there's a little bit in the front office as well as we get more efficient."

First of all, I think it's difficult to see share shifts in Global Markets in any given quarter. The fee pools are just not as transparent as they are in, let's say, investment banking fees or other areas. What we know is client activity was up in the third quarter, and that's what drives our short-term results. Over the longer term, one, it's easier just to assess what's going on with fee pools than share. So I just want to point out, from '14 to '15, on declining fee pools, we're pretty sure we improved our share. Third parties tell us that, and I think that share has come from a number of regions and a number of firms and a number of products as competitors adjust their strategies and capabilities. More specifically, we've been investing in rates for a number of years. I think we're making some progress there. We have a very strong credit platform. And as you know, I think we're making progress there relative to competitors around the world, and I think we're investing in equities. And I think you're -- equities revenue is down, but I think we're seeing improvement relative to the fee pool in equities as well. I do want to emphasize, very importantly, that our strategy is to have a diversified product portfolio across both FICC and equities and globally. That's what our clients need and want from us. And so you could see gains one quarter in one place and see something lower in another place, and that's okay with us. That's our strategy. It's about what the client needs in any given quarter. If we have -- if we're doing a little bit worse in one place, we're probably doing better in another place."

And if you think about the interest side, it's going to be driven by balanced growth between loans and deposits. And I think we keep growing deposits year-over-year $60 billion. We're paying 4 basis points in consumer. And then thinking about that dynamic and putting that to work in anything we can is important. And we continue to grow loans at less rate than we grow deposits. That's going to drive our NIM. It's just a bigger and bigger, lower and lower cost deposit base. And on the loan side, I think consumer is growing better now than commercial in linked quarter, but overall, we expect commercial will get back in a little bit as the economy continues and some of the other uncertainty lifts in the political season here. So on loans and deposits, it will just be growing. And now as you've seen year-over-year, core growth is 7% on loans and growth on deposits. 
On the fee side, what you're seeing is the dynamic, in especially consumer fee areas, finally turn a little bit stable and then turning for us in the card revenue and things like that, which we've hit sort of the inflection point, where the rundown in relative interchange due to selling some portfolios and getting out of noncore portfolios and putting on the core portfolios with rewards attached to it, which helps us, generates deposits and things like that, had stabilized. And you're starting to see, in the last few quarters, card income start to move up a bit. And on service charges, it's been relatively stable. So the fee side will be driven more by wealth management and markets and things like that. And consumer is stable, which is good because it had been a drag for a long time."

And that, in part, is because we are still getting the benefits of the changes made 6, 7, 8 years ago coming through the consumer business, i.e., that what we call back book portfolios or legacy portfolios or whatever word you want to use continue to run off with higher credit risk in them. And we keep putting on, and have put on and continue to put on higher credit quality. So I think if you think about overall charge-offs of $880 million this quarter, that's driven by the consumer business and that's driven by the card and some -- and the legacy home equities. And so keeping the card business where we want it is critical, and you're seeing this continue. Even as we start to grow that portfolio, both nominally and rate, the charge-off picture is strong. And so when you go back and look at what happened during the crisis, the charge-offs came abnormally from the edges of credit, and we've kept ourselves out of that."

The great debate is about what's the -- how sticky",406,"So just on the -- remember that the reason why you don't see much repricing is really 2 or 3 dynamics. One is a full $450 billion of our deposits are noninterest-bearing, so they aren't going to reprice. The great debate is about what's the -- how sticky are those. And if you think about that, those are dominated by our consumer business, and our noninterest-bearing accounts in consumer have doubled in size over the last 5 or 6 years due to focusing on primary accounts. We're up to 90% primary accounts in the household, where they run their household finances through our account, and therefore, they're direct deposit their check and things like that. So the first thing to remember is of $1.2 trillion, $450 billion noninterest-bearing, and the dominant part of that consumer and also in the Wealth Management and the core transactional account of both consumers. And then on the business side, similarly, we have driven our deposits to be really LCR-friendly and core operating accounts. And so those aren't going to move. The noninterest-bearing aren't going to move much. And the big debate is how much balance would be in there, and we feel confident the balances will stay just because of the nature of the accounts. 
And then when you go to the second dynamic, remember that even with all those deposit growth, one of the things we continue to do and the impact is less and less is we are, especially in consumer business, running off CDs still at a fairly decent clip that were historically used to fund prior company's balance sheets that we don't need the funding at that cost. So we have some rollover, but that continues to decline. The weighted average cost drops off -- that cost drops off, and it drives down or holds steady the weighted average cost. And then if you look at money markets and other interest-bearing, they really haven't moved much. So we feel good about the consumer. We forget about the deposit base overall. We feel very good about the consumer deposit base. It just crossed $600 billion for the first time in the company's history in consumers generally. And with that, I think we look -- if rates rise, we think that it's a substantial value for the company, and Paul gave you a way to think about that earlier with 1/4 of $3.3 billion, 25% of $3.3 billion."

So look, I think you're noticing some modest card balance growth in the quarter, which we think will continue as we add new accounts, and again, we're very focused on adding high-quality accounts there. I think you probably also noticed that while combined debit and credit card spend was good in the quarter at 5%, 6% if you exclude fuel, I'm -- I'm adjusting for our divestitures last year, that the growth in the card income was impacted by, as you noted, customer reward programs. However, I think, just focusing on the fee income, this is some really key benefits of our strategy, which is to attract relatively higher-quality card customers and reward them for deepening their overall relationship with us. This strategy really drives deposit growth and makes deposits stickier, plus we believe these customers have lower loss rates. They use the call center less, which helps us lower costs. I think when you want to see the effect of this, you have to look at the overall consumer segment and what's going on there in terms of growth of profits and improvement in expenses. And just the last thing I'd just point out, look, our risk-adjusted margins on card are strong at over 9%.

So what you're starting to see if you look at the trend this year is you're starting to see core movement, positive movement both in card income and in balances as we move across the year, and we expect that to continue. It will be strong, responsible growth. And one of the great debates we have in the company is people say, ""Why can't you grow this faster?"" Or why can't -- we're giving up too much in the interchange for the preferred balance or Preferred Rewards. The interesting question is, ""Are you giving up something you'd never have in Preferred Rewards?"" I.e. we're bringing more customer relationships and depth, and that gets us something. So incrementally, the net interchange is actually there as opposed to what -- theoretically, you get gross interchange with a noncustomer in our Affinity program. So we focus on entire customer relationship. It is very valuable. It is very profitable. And believe me, if we could grow it faster responsibly, we would. But the idea is just to grind out the slow, steady growth, and we're starting to see that come through. And largely, it was masked in '14, '15 and behind that, '13, for those areas because we were divesting a lot of noncore relationships. And now we have the core affinities we want, and we have the core card business we want."

So we run our consumer business consistent with responsible growth for the company. And that -- what that means is that you focus on deepening relationships, what we call a stair-step, where it's the core deposit account, the core credit card and getting it get used, and the core mortgage, and the core home equity and the core auto loans. That's what we've been driving at and continue to drive that. That's the backbone of what we did and how we repositioned this company over many years. 
In terms of the branches, Mike, you've rattled off all the statistics, which Paul talked about earlier. But it is a complex optimization, but it all starts with the consumer. What is the consumer going to do? And so while 18% of deposits are made by mobile deposits, 82% by their nature aren't. And where do they go? About 50 percentage points of that go through the ATM machines, and about another 30-odd percent go through the teller lines still today. And so you have to be ready and able to serve in all dynamics. And so what we continue to do is optimize the branch structure, the call structure, the ATM structure, the mobile structure and the online structure altogether. And a way to think about that optimization, and why it's this extremely important business to this company is that we've gone from 300 basis points of the cost of all that to deposits to about 150 over the last 6, 7 years. And that's by continuing to optimize the physical plant as well as all these other tool -- means. And so if you ask me, your question is, how far can you go, you have to also then think about what we want to go on in a branch. And so if you look back at some of the statistics that Paul had in the deck for consumer, where you see things like appointments set up are 340,000 in the third quarter. So just think about that, 340,000 times a customer went on a mobile phone and asked to come to a branch. And so we need those branches to receive those mobile phone customers. And why are they coming? Usually for a much more important financial transaction to them than handing us a check for deposit. And so it's a quality versus quantity and making sure we understand that. So we are optimizing all those. And you can see on Page 14 on the lower right, you can see the difference moves. I'd say we went from 7 million visits probably 4, 5 years ago to 6 million to 5 million. But those 5 million are of higher quality, and we think that's important. And there are certain transactions and certain capabilities that you just have to have at your branch, that you just have to do face-to-face, very difficult things like how to get a power of attorney for a parent that's sick, or I want to do a mortgage. It's very -- it's still difficult to do it through the phone and things like that. So we'll have all aspects. We'll drive it down, and you can see that we continue to make that progress."

And the key is not to get ahead of them because that can cause you problems, and not to be behind them because there can be cost issues and empty branches. So even in the 112 we're down, we've added branches in places like Denver, the Denver branch that we added are in the top 10% of performing branches today on relationship building. We've added branches in Manhattan. We've added branches in Minneapolis. And so we're in a sea change in terms of what the branches look like individually. The new branches are different. We're adding branches we didn't have, and we're closing branches where the utilization isn't there. The nature of how far a customer will travel is also different now than it was 10, 15 years ago. So I think you said, what are all the different reasons? The answer was -- I think you said, is we'll follow the customer. And I don't know the exact number because I can tell you 8 years ago, when we had 6,100, there were people who said, there was never going to be less branches in our system, and that we should add more.

And so the key was to make FICC work. You're talking more revenue, but we look at profit. And so to get the profit we needed to out of the fixed income and equities business, we had to take the cost structure down, which we did in '10 and '11. Tom Montag and the team worked very hard at that and got to sort of breakeven, down over $1 billion a quarter. And then we ran along a number of years, and then they've actually taken out year-over-year. You can see the cost continue to be managed well despite higher revenue. So I would say, taking the discussion, I'd say that the way our fixed income business generates revenue, a lot of it is around our capabilities in underwriting, our capabilities in all of the different variations from high-grade leverage to everything that goes on. And that's a relatively stable pool of revenue that you see repeated. And what goes up or down is really the activity around that based on the market seizing up in certain quarters in terms of issuance and things like that. 
When you think about the other thing that Tom and the team had to really go after, which is to broaden our capabilities in the macro segment a little bit, because that was something that traditionally, the Bank of America and Merrill Lynch teams came together. And he's done that. So that's added some more volume to us. So we think we've been gaining share, as Paul said earlier, when you look at revenue comparison among the top 10 banks without all the leak charge, for just revenue. And we think -- but we think it's driven by our fixed income capabilities. And it's driven by our connectivity from the issuer of bonds and debt to the investor. And we'll continue to drive that. And so the team's done a good job. And I'd say that we're -- at a fundamental level this -- well, this quarter feels better than last year's quarter. It's not a quarter that when you look across 4 or 5 years that we haven't come close to on many cases and have done better than a few times."

That's what I think impacted the third quarter. We -- when you look at the U.S., when you look around the globe, when you kind of look at GDP growth, we're optimistic. We think the economy feels good. So in a good economy, we should be able to grow commercial loans. We'll have to stay focused on some sectors and some regions, but we think we can grow commercial loans. There's -- utilization rates and revolvers, they came off their highs, but they're at the higher end of the range, which also suggests or reflects good commercial activity. We're adding bankers in the U.S. in commercial banking and small business. We're adding them to regions, where we know we have some synergies or some capabilities, some big MSAs.

There are creditworthy customers that we can do more with. And the only way to do that is because we have a talented, world-class commercial banking team, is to add more capacity. And so -- and that capacity is starting to build. And it takes a while because you hire a commercial banker, and we sometimes give them some of the undercovered names in our portfolio or else, and then they go after the prospects that we have. And it takes a while to build those up. People don't change their commercial banking relationships in an afternoon. So our business banking and our middle market, especially across America, we have been adding commercial bankers. And we expect that to redound to our benefit. Given an environment which may be solid but okay we'd expect to gain share in those markets as those bankers come on stream and become more productive.

Most think -- people think about credit card ""fraud"". And fraud is a broad word, arguments about whether the charge was valid with a merchant and things like that",346,"I think when you think about fraud, most people think about in terms of the electronic side. Most think -- people think about credit card ""fraud"". And fraud is a broad word, arguments about whether the charge was valid with a merchant and things like that. And so there's a long history of adjudicating that. So as more and more sales go online by the consumer, the techniques for online are continuing to develop. At face-to-face or point of sale, the chip card, when we're -- largely through all our customers having chip cards, merchant -- what we call chip-on-chip, i.e., our chip card used with a merchant chip machine is rising sort of a percent or so a quarter and is now, as best we judge it, in the 30s -- the high 20s or something like that, Nancy. So all that being said, we expect to get leverage in our fraud losses in the Consumer business year-over-year and we expect that to continue to come down. And so yes, that is a major initiative for us to continue to drive that down. Part of it is education of consumers. Part of it's getting the chip cards in the hands and getting the machine -- merchants using the chip machines. Part of it is the tokenization and the wallets and things that go on in Visa checkout and all the variations in MasterCard and getting -- because that's a tokenized better execution and is more secure. And so our view as a provider has been to adopt all these wallets and technologies that have this tokenization capabilities and that then drives down the cost of losses due to merchant complaints and other types of things. So you're absolutely right. Cybersecurity, yes, theft of cards from other people and sold on the Internet, all that stuff is important to us and so we spend, as we said, $0.5 billion a year protecting ourselves, but also part of it is making sure we understand where our consumers are in terms of lost cards and things like that."

So response -- if you ask anyone in the company responsible growth, it's about developing relationships so that we can grow with our customers over time based upon their needs and goals. It's not about the number of products that we open, it's whether customers want and need the products and services we're offering them and use them. That's how we measure ourselves. We've spent years building controls and governance and escalation around this. We're always monitoring them. It's just how we run the company. So that's probably the best answer I can give you in terms of how we think about this issue."

And our board, the independence of our board, the experience on our board, how they approach their responsibilities, I think, is very strong and I think our shareholders have understood that and agreed with that. And so I think we govern ourselves in a very tough fashion, i.e., the board's demanding on us and understands the strategy and has helped support this strategy through sometimes when people would challenge it. And I think it's proven to be the right strategy at this point. And so if you get to technicalities, our Lead Independent Director duties are as strong as anybody's in the industry. If you look at all the new governance surveys that have come out, all the words about proper governance and all the different things that you've seen recently, we meet or exceed everything anybody says to go to.

And so we'll see what happens. But so far, those of us that take the side, this will be less sensitive of one. Let's just say that."

If you look at your allocation of capital and returns by business segment, if you kind of do a weighted average, you come up with close to an 18% return. As profitability is getting higher, that's getting further away from the overall return, which is still around 10%. How do you envision trying to clean up either the capital positions or the overhang from overhead expenses that then brings those 2 numbers maybe a little bit closer together?"

But we always have to remember that there's basically, leave aside how the allocation works to the businesses works differently, but when you think about the 10% capital requirements for us, 300 basis points or 3 percentage points of that cannot be put to use. It cannot take risk and so we are earning all our money on the 7%. And so when you think about the weighted average of that, it comes out over 10%, that means you earn a lot more on the 7% even across the whole company and so that's one of the difficulties. So how do we optimize that? We make that 10% less dollar volume. If we can keep moving dollar volume down and keep increasing earnings you get that, that's by all the discussion Paul had in response to earlier questions about optimizing the balance sheet or we get expenses down or we grow less risky earnings that can generate income. But it's a constant optimization, but the basic principle that people -- that we sometimes forget is that when you think about 10%,  only 30% of capital can take no risk and so basically it earns your cost of debt."

Again, less customers so that leverage is not quite the same and that's why we spend a lot of our time around the consumer and there's just less leverage. And the adviser, you have to think about in that business because the adviser is the core strength that we have to the customer that we have to have an execution, which is universal between the adviser, the customers, they can all see the same thing. And so we've got some great capabilities now, My Merrill and things like that. I think -- but we plan to continue to enhance them and continue to integrate them so when they get the loans and deposits, things like that, they're much more integrated over time. You can still see it all, but it's not where we want it to be."
