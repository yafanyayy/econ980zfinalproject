I'll begin tonight with Slide 3. Capital One earned 921 -- $920 million or $1.58 per share in the fourth quarter. Net of adjusting items, we earned $1.67 per share.

Capital One earned 921 -- $920 million or $1.58 per share in the fourth quarter. Net of adjusting items, we earned $1.67 per share. Preprovision earnings were down from the third quarter as higher revenues were more than offset by higher marketing and operating expenses, driven by seasonal and growth-related costs. Provision for credit losses increased as we recognized higher charge-offs and a larger allowance build. 
On December 1, we closed on the acquisition of the GE Healthcare business, including $8.3 billion of loans and $500 million of goodwill. In addition to 1 month of operating earnings, there were 2 adjusting items related to the close of the deal. We had a $49 million allowance build related to pass rated loans and $20 million of deal-related costs.
As a reminder, for the acquired GE loans, we are required to account for term loans with credit deterioration under SOP 03-3, and current and revolving loans on to our traditional loan accounting processes. Of the acquired loans, $835 million are accounted for as 03-3 loans.
Turning to full year results 2015, preprovision earnings of $10.4 billion were up 3% year-over-year as higher revenue was partially offset by higher noninterest expense. Net income for 2015 was down 11% as higher preprovision earnings were more than offset by additional provisions from credit losses. Full year efficiency ratio was 54.3% excluding adjusting items.
As you can see on Slide 4, reported net interest margin increased 6 basis points in the fourth quarter to 6.79%, in line with the prior year increases.
Turning to Slide 5. As of the end of 2015, our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio on a Basel III standardized basis was 11.1%, which reflects current basis. On a standard fully phased in basis, they were 10.7%. We reduced our net share count by 7.6 million shares in the quarter. We expect to complete our previously announced buyback program in the second quarter of 2016.
As we continue our parallel run for Basel III advancement purchase, we estimate that our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio is above our target of 8%. We declared $158 million in preferred dividends in 2015, which increased $91 million over the prior year. Assuming no new issuance, we would expect to pay out approximately $205 million in preferred dividends in 2016. Specific quarterly payout schedules can be found in our regulatory filings. 
With that, let me turn it over to Rich."

Compared to the fourth quarter of last year, ending loans and average loans were both up 13% and purchase volume was up about 18%. We continue to",1564,"Thanks, Steve. I'll begin on Slide 7 with our Domestic Card business. Strong growth continued in the quarter. Compared to the fourth quarter of last year, ending loans and average loans were both up 13% and purchase volume was up about 18%. We continue to like the earnings profile and the resilience of the business we're booking.
Fourth quarter revenue increased 11% from the prior year quarter, slightly lagging average loan growth as revenue margin declined modestly. Revenue margin for the full year was 16.9%.
As a reminder, we're on track to fully exit our back book of Payment Protection products in the first quarter. Payment Protection revenue contributed about 25 basis points to full year 2015 revenue margin, and we expect this contribution to go to 0 by the second quarter of 2016.
Fourth quarter noninterest expenses increased 7% compared to the prior year quarter with higher marketing and growth-related operating expenses as well as continuing digital investments.
Credit continues to perform in line with our expectations in both our existing portfolio and our new originations. As we discussed for several quarters, 2 factors are driving our current credit trends and expectations. The first is Growth Math, which is the upward pressure on delinquencies in charge-offs as new loan balances season and become a larger proportion of our overall portfolio. The second is seasonality. All else equal, seasonality results in an increasing charge-off rate in the fourth quarter, rising to peak charge-off rate in the first quarter. As we've said for the last 3 quarters, we expected Growth Math and seasonality would drive charge-off rate to the mid- to high 3s in the fourth quarter. The fourth quarter charge-off rate came in at 3.75%, in the middle of our expected range.
We expect the upward pressure from Growth Math will continue through 2016 and begin to moderate in 2017. We still expect the full year 2016 charge-off rate to be around 4% with quarterly seasonal variability. We don't normally discuss our charge-off outlook 2 years in advance but given the sustained rapid growth rate, we want to give investors a sense of the Growth Math impact in 2017. I want to know that our 2017 charge-off outlook is our best estimate today for things that are fairly far in the future, particularly given recent volatility and financial market. All that said, based on what we see today and assuming relative stability and consumer behavior, the domestic economy and competitive conditions, we expect full year 2017 charge-off rate in the low 4s with quarterly seasonal variability.
Loan growth coupled with our expectations for rising charge-off rate drove an allowance build in the quarter and we expect allowance additions going forward primarily driven by growth.
Slide 8 summarizes third quarter results for our Consumer Banking business. Ending loans were down about $1 billion compared to the prior year. Growth in auto loans was offset by expected mortgage runoff. Consumer Banking revenue for the fourth quarter was down 2% from the fourth quarter of last year. Higher revenue from growth in auto loans was offset by margin compression in auto and declining mortgage balances. Fourth quarter noninterest expense was up 1% from the prior year quarter, driven by infrastructure and technology expenses in retail banking and growth in auto loans. Provision for credit losses was up from the linked quarter, primarily as a result of auto seasonality.
Fourth quarter auto originations declined about 8% compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. For the full year, auto originations were up 1% to $21.2 billion. Prime originations continue to grow. Subprime auto originations have been essentially flat for several quarters before declining in the fourth quarter. We discussed the effects of increased competition on pricing and underwriting particularly in subprime. We will continue to pursue opportunities in auto lending that are consistent with our long-standing focus on resilience, including adding new relationships with well-qualified dealers and gaining greater share of prime originations with existing dealers.
Our Consumer Banking businesses face headwinds in 2016. Planned mortgage runoff continues and auto margins are compressing from exceptional levels due to the mix shift toward prime and competitive pressure. We expect these trends will negatively affect revenues and efficiency ratio in 2016 even as we continue to manage costs tightly.
Moving to Slide 9, I'll discuss our Commercial Banking business. Ending loan balances increased 24% year-over-year, including the acquisition of the GE Healthcare finance business. Fourth quarter ending loan balances also include about $900 million from a short-term agency warehousing transaction that is already paid down, which also will affect loan growth optics when we report first quarter results.
Excluding the GE loans and the agency warehousing transactions, loans grew about 6% year-over-year. As we've been signaling, our organic growth has slowed compared to prior years because of choices we're making in response to market conditions. While increasing competition is pressuring loan terms and pricing in both CRE and C&I, we continue to see good growth opportunities in select specialty industry verticals.
Full year revenue increased 7%. Revenue growth was below average loan growth driven by continuing spread compression. Credit performance remains strong for the majority of our commercial businesses but credit pressures continue in the oil and gas and taxi medallion portfolios. While the charge-off rate for the quarter remained very low at 3 basis points, provision for credit losses increased $86 million from the prior year quarter to $118 million driven by allowance build.
We built allowance over the last 5 quarters in anticipation of increasing risk in oil and gas and taxi medallion loans and the addition of the GE Healthcare loans drove a $49 million allowance addition in the fourth quarter. Compared to the linked quarter, criticized performing loans were up $290 million to $2 billion and nonperforming loans were up $97 million to $550 million driven by downgrades of oil and gas loans.
The credit quality of a GE Healthcare portfolio is in line with our expectations. The GE Healthcare loans we acquired run at a higher criticized rates than our legacy commercial business but that effect doesn't show up in the fourth quarter criticized loan metrics because of purchase accounting. We provided visibility into that impact by disclosing the managed criticized rate, which excludes the purchase accounting impact.
In the fourth quarter, the managed criticized rate was 5.4%, 130 basis points higher than the reported criticized rate of 4.1%.
As we book new health care loans and the marked loans pay down, this will create upward pressure on our reported criticized loans metrics over time all else equal.
We like the GE Healthcare business and we're thrilled to welcome the new teams to Capital One.
We remain highly focused on managing credit risk and working with our oil and gas customers. Of our approximately $3.1 billion portfolio of oil and gas loans, around half is in exploration and production and around 1/3 is in oilfield services. We expect that energy loans will continue to present challenges and we've been building reserves to reflect that concern. At year end, approximately $190 million of our $604 million in total commercial allowance for loan losses was specifically allocated to our oil and gas portfolio. This is about 6.1% of total energy loans.
Given that oil prices have fallen since quarter end, unless they rebound, it is likely that energy loans will drive increase in criticized and nonperforming loans, further reserve build and possibly increasing charge-offs in 2016.
I'll close tonight with some thoughts on Capital One's full year 2015 results and our outlook for 2016. Two factors shaped our 2015 results, growth and investments. Growth in Domestic Card loan balances and purchase volumes led the industry, driving strong year-over-year growth in revenue as well as increases in operating expense, marketing and allowance for loan losses. The cost of growth are frontloaded but in our experience of more than 2 decades, revenue growth surpasses frontloaded costs over time and growth pays off on the bottom line.
Provision for credit losses increased in 2015. Most of the increase came from higher allowance for loan losses primarily driven by Domestic Card loan growth and the expectation of higher Domestic Card charge-off rate because of Growth Math.
Full year efficiency ratio was 54.3% net of adjustments, better than our estimated range of around 55%. Three factors drove the favorability. Revenues for the quarter were strong. We benefited from a handful of miscellaneous fourth quarter expense items coming in favorable to expectations and we're getting traction on efficiency efforts across the company.
Even from the lower 2015 starting point of 54.3%, we still expect some improvement in our full year 2016 efficiency ratio with the continuing improvement in 2017 excluding adjusting items. We are managing cost tightly across our businesses. We expect our card growth will create positive operating leverage over time. And while not solely motivated by cost savings, our digital investments are already delivering tangible savings and productivity gains in servicing, core infrastructure and our legacy operations and we expect these benefits to grow over time.
Following up our 2015 results and the choices that drove them have put us in a strong position to deliver attractive shareholder returns driven by growth and sustainable returns at the higher end of banks as well as significant capital distribution subject to regulatory approval.
Now Steve and I will be happy to answer your questions."

There's really the auto story is the same story we've been saying for quite some time. So for at least a year now, we have been flagging that in the subprime marketplace. We see practices that are inconsistent with where we want to go from an underwriting point of view. And we raised the flag about that in our calls. And we have said and continue to say today that within the context of maintaining, doing credit the way we want to do it, we're going to still go for as much origination as we can do in the subprime space. And -- but they kind of the net effect of this going on for a number of quarters as we have signaled is just this is the first quarter that actually subprime originations are down. And -- but it's again, the same marketplace. But I think this is the effect that we have been signaling for some time. And so this is in -- what I want to stress is, we still very much like the business. We do it on our own terms. And we have a great history and a real -- and I think great opportunities to create value in this space. But we, as always, number one, put credit and our underwriting choice as #1. And the net effect of that, at the moment, is some reduced opportunity in the subprime space relative to what would otherwise be there. In the prime space, the opportunity continues. There are some competitive and marketplace and issues on a smaller scale going on there but we still really like the auto business. I think this is a continuing manifestation of coming off what I've kind of called the sort of once in a lifetime unique set of opportunities and confluence of marketplace conditions that existed in the wake of the recession. And so over time, we're going to see a more normalized auto business."

Pricing, APRs, things like that, generally stable. And it's certainly in the places we play. We feel the pricing is resilient. Rewards are very competitive. There have been some increases in early spend bonuses but overall, it's pretty stable. And with respect to the subprime marketplace, there's been a lot of folks who have issued secured cards over time. And I think now there's another player in that space, I think, so we'll continue to monitor the competitive environment there but we continue to pursue the same strategy pretty much we've been doing for many, many years. An area also, when you talk about competition, we tend to -- I tend to focus the conversation just on our own direct competitors. Of course, a very relevant thing in the competitive environment is interchange as well. And so we also -- as we talked about, I want to keep an eye on interchange risk. A few of the larger merchants have negotiated lower interchange. That will have an effect that we keep an eye on. And also we're watching the evolving digital marketplace for payment alternatives and any impact there on interchange or disintermediation or tools or anything that happens along those lines. So that's another dimension. We shouldn't probably always add to our conversation about competition. Finally, in partnerships, that's the place that I have most pointed to as the intensity of the auction-based marketplace there at times. And in fact, very often recently, has led to market clearing prices that have been pretty breathtaking. And as a result, we have not had as much growth as we might otherwise have had in that particular space. The other thing about the card industry, I think, is worth pointing out is what's happening with just sort of industry growth. So industry revolving debt, for most of 2012 and 2013, it held steady at about 1% year-over-year growth, and then it maintained sort of a little over at 3% growth since July of 2014. And in recent months, has been over 4%. So that's certainly getting a little bit more octane there. And bank card outstands are up 4.6% year-over-year. I think overall if I pull way up about the credit card marketplace, I think it's a generally rational marketplace. I think we see opportunity for growth and very attractive returns. We monitor the marketplace obsessively. And when we see windows of opportunity, which we do at the moment, we certainly go very hard to see those opportunities."

The first is the potential of sustained low energy prices to cause economic stress in geographies that are heavily dependent on that industry. And keep in mind on that, that our consumer lending business or mostly national businesses, so we don't really have any outside concentrations in those geographies. We have about 5% of our Card portfolios in parts of the country with high energy employment concentration. That said, when you look at these geographies, please like Houston, parts of North Dakota, Alberta province in Canada, we do see slight upticks in card delinquencies. And where appropriate, we've taken steps to surgically tighten our underwriting in these geographies, although we want to be careful not to overreact to these very modest effects. But of course, the flip side of falling energy prices is the direct benefit to consumers. And while the benefits are hard to disentangle from other economic effects, it's clear that falling gas price is translated into the equivalent of a pretty sizable wage increase for most households. So it's tough to gauge the net effect of these 2 factors, if I - my hunch is that it's a net positive on consumer credit."

And one of the most profound things that's happened on the liability side is the shift in mix with much of it going in non-interest-bearing. You haven't seen nearly as much of that at Capital One. So we would, in general, expect to have higher betas than the peers just as a result of the higher contribution of our direct and online business.

I would not get overly focused on any 1 quarter. I mean, when our interchange growth number was very low, I said this when it's at this level, I'd say it again, there's a lot of factors that affect that quarterly number. If you look at full year 2015 compared to 2014, our net interchange grew 11% compared to purchase volume growth of 21%. Removing the quarterly noise, net interchange growth has generally lagged, general-purpose credit card interchange growth and we expect this trend will continue. Our rewards programs have been and continue to be very successful with strong growth of our flagship products. We're also building a long-term franchise by upgrading rewards products for our existing rewards customers and consistent with the industry, extending rewards products to some existing customers who don't have rewards. And as you can imagine, there is -- that entails some near-term cannibalization, but it's all part of building a stronger, deeper customer franchise. And we're committed to doing that. And also as I mentioned earlier, there are a few merchants out there driving interchange through their individualized negotiations and things like that. That's also another factor that we have to keep an eye on. So I wouldn't get carried away with any 1 quarter but we very much like the growth we're having in our spender business and it's part of a long-term franchise strategy."

But let me say this about the health of the consumer. First of all, there's obviously turmoil in the markets recently, including concerns about the global economy, especially China, and closer to home, concerns about the potentially disruptive consequences of falling oil prices. Having said that, most indicators of the ""real economy"", at least in the U.S., continue to look pretty strong. We've seen sustained improvement in labor markets in recent months and steady home price growth. Consumer confidence remains solid. And as we talked about earlier, falling energy prices, while they will stress certain sectors and certain geographies, they will also directly benefit consumers. And if anything, I feel may probably be a net positive for the overall health of the consumer. Of course, our most reliable view, Brian, of consumers comes from our own portfolio. From the right indicators of consumer behavior like payment rates and purchase volume and from leading edge credit indicators like delinquency flow rates. These indicators, although consistent with our views of seasonality and Growth Math, and they are not giving us cause for concern. Obviously, the economy is something of a wildcard and if the turmoil we're seeing in financial markets spills over into the real economy, we would expect that to show up in our credit metrics eventually but we are not seeing any indications of that now."

As you know, we've invested for years and I think we're in a good position there to get a bunch of traction and enjoy the financial benefits of that. The -- it is also the case, and you are correct, that the rewards business has now extended farther across the credit spectrum deeper into the revolver business in a number of things and a higher proportion of Americans are ending up with rewards cards, including a bunch who are regular holder of revolvers. Now on the face of it, it's not that big a deal economically in the sense that someone is a revolver they once they start revolving on the card, the reward economics aren't that relevant anymore.

Since our founding days, we've been very focused on building a company that can generate superior, sustainable financial performance. And to do this, we need 3 things. Core earnings power that has the octane to deliver attractive current returns and fund investments in the future. There are a bunch of businesses in banking that, in our opinion, don't sort of have enough earnings power to do that. That's 1 reason we tried to focus on the places that do. Secondly, we need a strategic positioning in the marketplace that allows us to capitalize on opportunities. And third, we need the credit discipline to be able to respond to the windows that open and close in the marketplace. And we focus on these 3 things throughout our 2 decades as a public company. Right now is a critical time in the marketplace. We're generating above hurdle returns, but are also investing to capitalize on 2 very significant opportunities. The card growth window, which is itself the reward of years of investment and a sweeping digital transformation of our industry. Both investments are growing incredibly well at Capital One, and we expect the benefits will increasingly show over time in our financial performance through growth, operating leverage, bottom line return and capital return."

I'll begin tonight with Slide 3. Capital One earned 921 -- $920 million or $1.58 per share in the fourth quarter. Net of adjusting items, we earned $1.67 per share.

Capital One earned 921 -- $920 million or $1.58 per share in the fourth quarter. Net of adjusting items, we earned $1.67 per share. Pre-provision earnings were down from the third quarter as higher revenues were more than offset by higher marketing and operating expenses driven by seasonal- and growth-related costs. Provision for credit losses increased as we recognized higher charge-offs and a larger allowance build. 
On December 1, we closed on the acquisition of the GE Healthcare business, including $8.3 billion of loans and $500 million of goodwill. In addition to 1 month of operating earnings, there were 2 adjusting items related to the close of the deal. We had a $49 million allowance build related to past rated loans and $20 million of deal-related costs.
As a reminder, for the acquired GE loans, we are required to account for term loans with credit deterioration under SOP 03-3 and current and revolving loans under our traditional loan accounting processes. Of the acquired loans, $835 million are accounted for as 03-3 loans.
Turning to full year results 2015. Pre-provision earnings of $10.4 billion were up 3% year-over-year as higher revenue was partially offset by higher noninterest expense. Net income for 2015 was down 11% as higher pre-provision earnings were more than offset by additional provision from credit losses. Full year efficiency ratio was 54.3% excluding adjusting items.
As you can see on Slide 4, reported net interest margin increased 6 basis points in the fourth quarter to 6.79%, in line with the prior year increase.
Turning to Slide 5. As of the end of 2015, our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio on a Basel III standardized basis was 11.1%, which reflects current phased-ins. On a standard fully phased-in basis, it was 10.7%. We reduced our net share count by 7.6 million shares in the quarter. We expect to complete our previously announced buyback program in the second quarter of 2016.
As we continue our parallel run for Basel III advanced approaches, we estimate that our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio is above our target of 8%. We declared $158 million in preferred dividends in 2015, which increased $91 million over the prior year. Assuming no new issuance, we would expect to pay out approximately $205 million in preferred dividends in 2016. Specific quarterly payout schedules can be found in our regulatory filings. 
With that, let me turn it over to Rich."

I'll begin on Slide 7 with our Domestic Card business. Strong growth continued in the quarter. Compared to the fourth quarter of last year, ending loans and average loans were both up 13% and purchase volume was up about 18%. We continue to like the earnings profile and the resilience of the business we're booking.
Fourth quarter revenue increased 11% from the prior year quarter, slightly lagging average loan growth as revenue margin declined modestly. Revenue margin for the full year was 16.9%.
As a reminder, we're on track to fully exit our back book of Payment Protection products in the first quarter. Payment Protection revenue contributed about 25 basis points to full year 2015 revenue margin, and we expect this contribution to go to 0 by the second quarter of 2016.
Fourth quarter noninterest expenses increased 7% compared to the prior year quarter with higher marketing and growth-related operating expenses as well as continuing digital investments.
Credit continues to perform in line with our expectations in both our existing portfolio and our new originations. As we discussed for several quarters, 2 factors are driving our current credit trends and expectations. The first is Growth Math, which is the upward pressure on delinquencies and charge-offs as new loan balances season and become a larger proportion of our overall portfolio. The second is seasonality. All else equal, seasonality results in an increasing charge-off rate in the fourth quarter, rising to peak charge-off rate in the first quarter. As we've said for the last 3 quarters, we expected Growth Math and seasonality would drive charge-off rate to the mid- to high 3s in the fourth quarter. The fourth quarter charge-off rate came in at 3.75%, in the middle of our expected range.
We expect the upward pressure from Growth Math will continue through 2016 and begin to moderate in 2017. We still expect the full year 2016 charge-off rate to be around 4%, with quarterly seasonal variability. We don't normally discuss our charge-off outlook 2 years in advance but, given the sustained rapid growth rate, we want to give investors a sense of the Growth Math impact in 2017. I want to note that our 2017 charge-off outlook is our best estimate today for things that are fairly far in the future, particularly given recent volatility in financial markets. All that said, based on what we see today and assuming relative stability in consumer behavior, the domestic economy and competitive conditions, we expect full year 2017 charge-off rate in the low 4s, with quarterly seasonal variability.
Loan growth coupled with our expectations for rising charge-off rate drove an allowance build in the quarter, and we expect allowance additions going forward primarily driven by growth.
Slide 8 summarizes third quarter results for our Consumer Banking business. Ending loans were down about $1 billion compared to the prior year. Growth in auto loans was offset by expected mortgage runoff. Consumer Banking revenue for the fourth quarter was down 2% from the fourth quarter of last year. Higher revenue from growth in auto loans was offset by margin compression in auto and declining mortgage balances. Fourth quarter noninterest expense was up 1% from the prior year quarter driven by infrastructure and technology expenses in retail banking and growth in auto loans. Provision for credit losses was up from the linked quarter, primarily as a result of auto seasonality.
Fourth quarter auto originations declined about 8% compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. For the full year, auto originations were up 1% to $21.2 billion. Prime originations continued to grow. Subprime auto originations have been essentially flat for several quarters before declining in the fourth quarter. We discussed the effects of increased competition on pricing and underwriting, particularly in subprime. We will continue to pursue opportunities in auto lending that are consistent with our long-standing focus on resilience, including adding new relationships with well-qualified dealers and gaining greater share of prime originations with existing dealers.
Our Consumer Banking businesses face headwinds in 2016. Planned mortgage runoff continues and auto margins are compressing from exceptional levels due to the mix shift toward prime and competitive pressure. We expect these trends will negatively affect revenues and efficiency ratio in 2016 even as we continue to manage costs tightly.
Moving to Slide 9, I'll discuss our Commercial Banking business. Ending loan balances increased 24% year-over-year, including the acquisition of the GE Healthcare finance business. Fourth quarter ending loan balances also include about $900 million from a short-term agency warehousing transaction that is already paid down, which also will affect loan growth optics when we report first quarter results.
Excluding the GE loans and the agency warehousing transactions, loans grew about 6% year-over-year. As we've been signaling, our organic growth has slowed compared to prior years because of choices we're making in response to market conditions. While increasing competition is pressuring loan terms and pricing in both CRE and C&I, we continue to see good growth opportunities in select specialty industry verticals.
Full year revenue increased 7%. Revenue growth was below average loan growth driven by continuing spread compression. Credit performance remains strong for the majority of our commercial businesses but credit pressures continue in the oil and gas and Taxi Medallion portfolios. While the charge-off rate for the quarter remained very low at 3 basis points, provision for credit losses increased $86 million from the prior year quarter to $118 million driven by allowance builds.
We built allowance over the last 5 quarters in anticipation of increasing risk in oil and gas and taxi medallion loans, and the addition of the GE Healthcare loans drove a $49 million allowance addition in the fourth quarter. Compared to the linked quarter, criticized performing loans were up $290 million to $2 billion and nonperforming loans were up $97 million to $550 million driven by downgrades of oil and gas loans.
The credit quality of the GE Healthcare portfolio is in line with our expectations. The GE Healthcare loans we acquired run at a higher criticized rate than our legacy commercial business but that effect doesn't show up in the fourth quarter criticized loan metrics because of purchase accounting. We provided visibility into that impact by disclosing the managed criticized rate, which excludes the purchase accounting impact.
In the fourth quarter, the managed criticized rate was 5.4%, 130 basis points higher than the reported criticized rate of 4.1%.
As we book new health care loans and the marked loans paid down, this will create upward pressure on our reported criticized loan metrics over time, all else equal.
We like the GE Healthcare business and we're thrilled to welcome the new team to Capital One.
We remain highly focused on managing credit risk and working with our oil and gas customers. Of our approximately $3.1 billion portfolio of oil and gas loans, around half is in exploration and production and around 1/3 is in oilfield services. We expect that energy loans will continue to present challenges, and we've been building reserves to reflect that concern. At year-end, approximately $190 million of our $604 million in total commercial allowance for loan losses was specifically allocated to our oil and gas portfolio. This is about 6.1% of total energy loans.
Given that oil prices have fallen since quarter-end, unless they rebound, it is likely that energy loans will drive increase in criticized and nonperforming loans, further reserve builds and, possibly, increasing charge-offs in 2016.
I'll close tonight with some thoughts on Capital One's full year 2015 results and our outlook for 2016. Two factors shaped our 2015 results, growth and investments. Growth in Domestic Card loan balances and purchase volumes led the industry, driving strong year-over-year growth in revenue as well as increases in operating expense, marketing and allowance for loan losses. The cost of growth are front-loaded. But in our experience of more than 2 decades, revenue growth surpasses front-loaded costs over time and growth pays off on the bottom line.
Provision for credit losses increased in 2015. Most of the increase came from higher allowance for loan losses primarily driven by Domestic Card loan growth and the expectation of higher Domestic Card charge-off rate because of Growth Math.
Full year efficiency ratio was 54.3% net of adjustments, better than our estimated range of around 55%. Three factors drove the favorability. Revenues for the quarter were strong. We benefited from a handful of miscellaneous fourth quarter expense items coming in favorable to expectations and we're getting traction on efficiency efforts across the company.
Even from the lower 2015 starting point of 54.3%, we still expect some improvement in our full year 2016 efficiency ratio with continuing improvement in 2017, excluding adjusting items. We are managing cost tightly across our businesses. We expect our card growth will create positive operating leverage over time. And while not solely motivated by cost savings, our digital investments are already delivering tangible savings and productivity gains in servicing, core infrastructure and our legacy operations, and we expect these benefits to grow over time.
Pulling up, our 2015 results and the choices that drove them have put us in a strong position to deliver attractive shareholder returns driven by growth and sustainable returns at the higher end of banks as well as significant capital distribution subject to regulatory approval.
Now Steve and I will be happy to answer your questions."

There's really -- the auto story is the same story we've been saying for quite some time. So for at least a year now, we have been flagging that in the subprime marketplace. We see practices that are inconsistent with where we want to go from an underwriting point of view, and we raised the flag about that in our calls. And we have said and continue to say today that within the context of maintaining doing credit the way we want to do it, we're going to still go for as much origination as we can do in the subprime auto space. And -- but kind of the net effect of this going on for a number of quarters, as we have signaled, is just this is the first quarter that actually subprime originations are down. And -- but it's again the same marketplace, but I think this is the effect that we have been signaling for some time. And so this is in -- what I want to stress is, we still very much like the business, we do it on our own terms and we have a great history and a real and I think great opportunities to create value in this space. But we, as always, number one, put credit and our underwriting choice as #1. And the net effect of that, at the moment, is some reduced opportunity in the subprime space relative to what would otherwise be there. In the prime space, the opportunity continues. There are some competitive marketplace and issues on a smaller scale going on there but we still really like the auto business. I think this is a continuing manifestation of coming off what I've kind of called the sort of once-in-a-lifetime unique set of opportunities and confluence of marketplace conditions that existed in the wake of the recession. And so over time, we're going to see a more normalized auto business."

Pricing, teaser lengths, APRs, things like that, generally stable. And it's certainly in the places we play. We feel that the pricing is resilient. Rewards are very competitive. There have been some increases in early spend bonuses but, overall, it's pretty stable. And with respect to the subprime marketplace, there have been a lot of folks who have issued secured cards over time. And I think now there's another player in that space, I think, so we'll continue to monitor the competitive environment there, but we continue to pursue the same strategy pretty much we've been doing for many, many years. An area also, when you talk about competition, we tend to -- I tend to focus the conversation just on our own direct competitors. Of course, a very relevant thing in the competitive environment is interchange as well. And so we also, as we talked about, want to keep an eye on interchange risk. A few of the larger merchants have negotiated lower interchange. That will have an effect that we keep an eye on. And also we're watching the evolving digital marketplace for payment alternatives and any impact there on interchange or disintermediation or tolls or anything that happens along those lines. So that's another dimension we should probably always add to our conversation about competition. Finally, in partnerships, that's the place that I have most pointed to as the intensity of the auction-based marketplace there at times and, in fact, very often recently, has led to market clearing prices that have been pretty breathtaking. And as a result, we have not had as much growth as we might otherwise have had in that particular space. The other thing about the card industry, I think, is worth pointing out is what's happening with just sort of industry growth. So industry revolving debt. For most of 2012 and 2013, it held steady at about 1% year-over-year growth and then it maintained sort of a little over at 3% growth since July of 2014 and, in recent months, has been over 4%. So that's certainly getting a little bit more octane there. And bank card outstandings are up 4.6% year-over-year. I think, overall, if I pull way up about the credit card marketplace, I think it's a generally rational marketplace. I think we see opportunity for growth and very attractive returns. We monitor the marketplace obsessively. And when we see windows of opportunity, which we do at the moment, we certainly go very hard to seize those opportunities."

The first is the potential of sustained low energy prices to cause economic stress in geographies that are heavily dependent on that industry. And keep in mind on that, that our consumer lending business are mostly national businesses, so we don't really have any outsized concentrations in those geographies. We have about 5% of our Card portfolios in parts of the country with high energy employment concentration. That said, when we look at these geographies, places like Houston, parts of North Dakota, Alberta province in Canada, we do see slight upticks in card delinquencies. And where appropriate, we've taken steps to surgically tighten our underwriting in these geographies, although we want to be careful not to overreact to these very modest effects. But of course, the flip side of falling energy prices is the direct benefit to consumers. And while the benefits are hard to disentangle from other economic effects, it's clear that falling gas price translate into the equivalent of a pretty sizable wage increase for most households. So it's tough to gauge the net effect of these 2 factors. If I - my hunch is that it's a net positive on consumer credit."

And one of the most profound things that's happened on the liability side is the shift in mix, with much of it going in non-interest-bearing. You haven't seen nearly as much of that at Capital One. So we would, in general, expect to have higher betas than the peers just as a result of the higher contribution of our direct and online business.

If you look at full year 2015 compared to 2014, our net interchange grew 11% compared to purchase volume growth of 21%. Removing the quarterly noise, net interchange growth has generally lagged, general-purpose credit card interchange growth, and we expect this trend will continue. Our rewards programs have been and continue to be very successful with strong growth of our flagship products. We're also building a long-term franchise by upgrading rewards products for our existing rewards customers and, consistent with the industry, extending rewards products to some existing customers who don't have rewards. And as you can imagine, there is -- that entails some near-term cannibalization, but it's all part of building a stronger, deeper customer franchise. And we're committed to doing that. And also, as I mentioned earlier, there are a few merchants out there driving interchange through their individualized negotiations and things like that.

First of all, there's obviously been turmoil in the markets recently, including concerns about the global economy, especially China and, closer to home, concerns about the potentially disruptive consequences of falling oil prices. Having said that, most indicators of the ""real economy"" at least in the U.S., continue to look pretty strong. We've seen sustained improvement in labor markets in recent months and steady home price growth. Consumer confidence remains solid. And as we talked about earlier, falling energy prices, while they will stress certain sectors and certain geographies, they will also directly benefit consumers. And if anything, I feel, may probably be a net positive for the overall health of the consumer. Of course, our most reliable view, Brian, of consumers comes from our own portfolio, from direct indicators of consumer behavior like payment rates and purchase volume and from leading-edge credit indicators like delinquency flow rates. These indicators, all look consistent with our views of seasonality and Growth Math, and they are not giving us cause for concern. Obviously, the economy is something of a wildcard. And if the turmoil we're seeing in financial markets spills over into the real economy, we would expect that to show up in our credit metrics eventually, but we are not seeing any indications of that now."

I think -- I feel like the rewards business -- look, you're absolutely right that the rewards business is intensely competitive. And one thing I've said about the rewards business, it's really hard to be a casual player in the business, really ramping it up this quarter, putting it on TV this quarter, pulling back the next quarter. This is about very sustained investment, building a brand and being willing to do what it takes on the timing of cost versus payback and things that make it difficult for companies to sustain their investment in this particular space. As you know, we've invested for years, and I think we're in a good position there to get a bunch of traction and enjoy the financial benefits of that. The -- it is also the case, and you are correct, that the rewards business has now extended farther across the credit spectrum deeper into the revolver business in a number of things. And a higher proportion of Americans are ending up with rewards cards, including a bunch who are regular holder of revolvers. Now on the face of it, it's not that big a deal economically in the sense that if someone is a revolver, they -- once they start revolving on the card, the reward economics aren't that relevant anymore. So I -- your thesis is an interesting one. My own belief is this will continue to be as far out as we can see and a pretty intensely competitive business. I do not describe it as a business where you just give everything away and make your money on the rest of the business. We work very hard to have our spender business be an economically strong business in its own right, but this is certainly intensely competitive, and I think some players will invest heavily to compete there and others will be a little bit more -- not as intensely investing in that space."

There are a bunch of businesses in banking that, in our opinion, don't sort of have enough earnings power to do that. It's one reason we've tried to focus on the places that do. Secondly, we need a strategic positioning in the marketplace that allows us to capitalize on opportunities. And third, we need the credit discipline to be able to respond to the windows that open and close in the marketplace. And we focus on these 3 things throughout our 2 decades as a public company. Right now is a critical time in the marketplace. We're generating above-hurdle returns, but are also investing to capitalize on 2 very significant opportunities.

Capital One earned 921 -- $920 million or $1.58 per share in the fourth quarter. Net of adjusting items, we earned $1.67 per share. Pre-provision earnings were down from the third quarter as higher revenues were more than offset by higher marketing and operating expenses driven by seasonal- and growth-related costs. Provision for credit losses increased as we recognized higher charge-offs and a larger allowance build. 
On December 1, we closed on the acquisition of the GE Healthcare business, including $8.3 billion of loans and $500 million of goodwill. In addition to 1 month of operating earnings, there were 2 adjusting items related to the close of the deal. We had a $49 million allowance build related to past rated loans and $20 million of deal-related costs.
As a reminder, for the acquired GE loans, we are required to account for term loans with credit deterioration under SOP 03-3 and current and revolving loans under our traditional loan accounting processes. Of the acquired loans, $835 million are accounted for as 03-3 loans.
Turning to full year results 2015. Pre-provision earnings of $10.4 billion were up 3% year-over-year as higher revenue was partially offset by higher noninterest expense. Net income for 2015 was down 11% as higher pre-provision earnings were more than offset by additional provision from credit losses. Full year efficiency ratio was 54.3% excluding adjusting items.
As you can see on Slide 4, reported net interest margin increased 6 basis points in the fourth quarter to 6.79%, in line with the prior year increase.
Turning to Slide 5. As of the end of 2015, our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio on a Basel III standardized basis was 11.1%, which reflects current phased-ins. On a standard fully phased-in basis, it was 10.7%. We reduced our net share count by 7.6 million shares in the quarter. We expect to complete our previously announced buyback program in the second quarter of 2016.
As we continue our parallel run for Basel III advanced approaches, we estimate that our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio is above our target of 8%. We declared $158 million in preferred dividends in 2015, which increased $91 million over the prior year. Assuming no new issuance, we would expect to pay out approximately $205 million in preferred dividends in 2016. Specific quarterly payout schedules can be found in our regulatory filings. 
With that, let me turn it over to Rich."

Compared to the fourth quarter of last year, ending loans and average loans were both up 13% and purchase volume was up about 18%. We continue to",1559,"Thanks, Steve. I'll begin on Slide 7 with our Domestic Card business. Strong growth continued in the quarter. Compared to the fourth quarter of last year, ending loans and average loans were both up 13% and purchase volume was up about 18%. We continue to like the earnings profile and the resilience of the business we're booking.
Fourth quarter revenue increased 11% from the prior year quarter, slightly lagging average loan growth as revenue margin declined modestly. Revenue margin for the full year was 16.9%.
As a reminder, we're on track to fully exit our back book of Payment Protection products in the first quarter. Payment Protection revenue contributed about 25 basis points to full year 2015 revenue margin, and we expect this contribution to go to 0 by the second quarter of 2016.
Fourth quarter noninterest expenses increased 7% compared to the prior year quarter with higher marketing and growth-related operating expenses as well as continuing digital investments.
Credit continues to perform in line with our expectations in both our existing portfolio and our new originations. As we discussed for several quarters, 2 factors are driving our current credit trends and expectations. The first is Growth Math, which is the upward pressure on delinquencies and charge-offs as new loan balances season and become a larger proportion of our overall portfolio. The second is seasonality. All else equal, seasonality results in an increasing charge-off rate in the fourth quarter, rising to peak charge-off rate in the first quarter. As we've said for the last 3 quarters, we expected Growth Math and seasonality would drive charge-off rate to the mid- to high 3s in the fourth quarter. The fourth quarter charge-off rate came in at 3.75%, in the middle of our expected range.
We expect the upward pressure from Growth Math will continue through 2016 and begin to moderate in 2017. We still expect the full year 2016 charge-off rate to be around 4%, with quarterly seasonal variability. We don't normally discuss our charge-off outlook 2 years in advance but, given the sustained rapid growth rate, we want to give investors a sense of the Growth Math impact in 2017. I want to note that our 2017 charge-off outlook is our best estimate today for things that are fairly far in the future, particularly given recent volatility in financial markets. All that said, based on what we see today and assuming relative stability in consumer behavior, the domestic economy and competitive conditions, we expect full year 2017 charge-off rate in the low 4s, with quarterly seasonal variability.
Loan growth coupled with our expectations for rising charge-off rate drove an allowance build in the quarter, and we expect allowance additions going forward primarily driven by growth.
Slide 8 summarizes third quarter results for our Consumer Banking business. Ending loans were down about $1 billion compared to the prior year. Growth in auto loans was offset by expected mortgage runoff. Consumer Banking revenue for the fourth quarter was down 2% from the fourth quarter of last year. Higher revenue from growth in auto loans was offset by margin compression in auto and declining mortgage balances. Fourth quarter noninterest expense was up 1% from the prior year quarter driven by infrastructure and technology expenses in retail banking and growth in auto loans. Provision for credit losses was up from the linked quarter, primarily as a result of auto seasonality.
Fourth quarter auto originations declined about 8% compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. For the full year, auto originations were up 1% to $21.2 billion. Prime originations continued to grow. Subprime originations have been essentially flat for several quarters before declining in the fourth quarter. We've discussed the effects of increased competition on pricing and underwriting, particularly in subprime. We will continue to pursue opportunities in auto lending that are consistent with our long-standing focus on resilience, including adding new relationships with well-qualified dealers and gaining greater share of prime originations with existing dealers.
Our Consumer Banking businesses face headwinds in 2016. Planned mortgage runoff continues and auto margins are compressing from exceptional levels due to the mix shift toward prime and competitive pressure. We expect these trends will negatively affect revenues and efficiency ratio in 2016 even as we continue to manage costs tightly.
Moving to Slide 9, I'll discuss our Commercial Banking business. Ending loan balances increased 24% year-over-year, including the acquisition of the GE Healthcare finance business. Fourth quarter ending loan balances also include about $900 million from a short-term agency warehousing transaction that is already paid down, which also will affect loan growth optics when we report first quarter results.
Excluding the GE loans and the agency warehousing transactions, loans grew about 6% year-over-year. As we've been signaling, our organic growth has slowed compared to prior years because of choices we're making in response to market conditions. While increasing competition is pressuring loan terms and pricing in both CRE and C&I, we continue to see good growth opportunities in select specialty industry verticals.
Full year revenue increased 7%. Revenue growth was below average loan growth driven by continuing spread compression. Credit performance remains strong for the majority of our commercial businesses but credit pressures continue in the oil and gas and Taxi Medallion portfolios. While the charge-off rate for the quarter remained very low at 3 basis points, provision for credit losses increased $86 million from the prior year quarter to $118 million driven by allowance builds.
We've built allowance over the last 5 quarters in anticipation of increasing risk in oil and gas and taxi medallion loans, and the addition of the GE Healthcare loans drove a $49 million allowance addition in the fourth quarter. Compared to the linked quarter, criticized performing loans were up $290 million to $2 billion and nonperforming loans were up $97 million to $550 million driven by downgrades of oil and gas loans.
The credit quality of the GE Healthcare portfolio is in line with our expectations. The GE Healthcare loans we acquired run at a higher criticized rate than our legacy commercial business but that effect doesn't show up in the fourth quarter criticized loan metrics because of purchase accounting. We've provided visibility into that impact by disclosing the managed criticized rate, which excludes the purchase accounting impact.
In the fourth quarter, the managed criticized rate was 5.4%, 130 basis points higher than the reported criticized rate of 4.1%.
As we book new health care loans and the marked loans pay down, this will create upward pressure on our reported criticized loan metrics over time, all else equal.
We like the GE Healthcare business and we're thrilled to welcome the new team to Capital One.
We remain highly focused on managing credit risk and working with our oil and gas customers. Of our approximately $3.1 billion portfolio of oil and gas loans, around half is in exploration and production and around 1/3 is in oilfield services. We expect that energy loans will continue to present challenges, and we've been building reserves to reflect that concern. At year-end, approximately $190 million of our $604 million in total commercial allowance for loan losses was specifically allocated to our oil and gas portfolio. This is about 6.1% of total energy loans.
Given that oil prices have fallen since quarter-end, unless they rebound, it is likely that energy loans will drive increasing criticized and nonperforming loans, further reserve builds and possibly increasing charge-offs in 2016.
I'll close tonight with some thoughts on Capital One's full year 2015 results and our outlook for 2016. Two factors shaped our 2015 results, growth and investments. Growth in Domestic Card loan balances and purchase volumes led the industry, driving strong year-over-year growth in revenue as well as increases in operating expense, marketing and allowance for loan losses. The cost of growth are front-loaded. But in our experience of more than 2 decades, revenue growth surpasses front-loaded costs over time and growth pays off on the bottom line.
Provision for credit losses increased in 2015. Most of the increase came from higher allowance for loan losses primarily driven by Domestic Card loan growth and the expectation of higher Domestic Card charge-off rates because of Growth Math.
Full year efficiency ratio was 54.3% net of adjustments, better than our estimated range of around 55%. Three factors drove the favorability. Revenues for the quarter were strong. We benefited from a handful of miscellaneous fourth quarter expense items coming in favorable to expectations and we're getting traction on efficiency efforts across the company.
Even from the lower 2015 starting point of 54.3%, we still expect some improvement in our full year 2016 efficiency ratio with continuing improvement in 2017, excluding adjusting items. We are managing cost tightly across our businesses. We expect our card growth will create positive operating leverage over time. And while not solely motivated by cost savings, our digital investments are already delivering tangible savings and productivity gains in servicing, core infrastructure and our legacy operations, and we expect these benefits to grow over time.
Pulling up, our 2015 results and the choices that drove them have put us in a strong position to deliver attractive shareholder returns driven by growth and sustainable returns at the higher end of banks as well as significant capital distribution subject to regulatory approval.
Now Steve and I will be happy to answer your questions."

There's really -- the auto story is the same story we've been saying for quite some time. So for at least a year now, we have been flagging that in the subprime marketplace. We see practices that are inconsistent with where we want to go from an underwriting point of view, and we raised the flag about that in our calls. And we have said and continue to say today that within the context of maintaining doing credit the way we want to do it, we're going to still go for as much origination as we can do in the subprime auto space. And -- but kind of the net effect of this going on for a number of quarters, as we have signaled, is just this is the first quarter that actually subprime originations are down. And -- but it's again the same marketplace, but I think this is the effect that we have been signaling for some time. And so this is in -- what I want to stress is, we still very much like the business, we do it on our own terms and we have a great history and a real -- and I think great opportunities to create value in this space. But we, as always, number one, put credit and our underwriting choice as #1. And the net effect of that, at the moment, is some reduced opportunity in the subprime space relative to what would otherwise be there. In the prime space, the opportunity continues. There are some competitive marketplace and issues on a smaller scale going on there but we still really like the auto business. I think this is a continuing manifestation of coming off what I've kind of called the sort of once-in-a-lifetime unique set of opportunities and confluence of marketplace conditions that existed in the wake of the recession. And so over time, we're going to see a more normalized auto business."

Pricing, teaser lengths, APRs, things like that, generally stable. And it's certainly in the places we play. We feel that the pricing is resilient. Rewards are very competitive. There have been some increases in early spend bonuses but, overall, it's pretty stable. And with respect to the subprime marketplace, there have been a lot of folks who have issued secured cards over time. And I think now there's another player in that space, I think, so we'll continue to monitor the competitive environment there, but we continue to pursue the same strategy pretty much we've been doing for many, many years. An area also, when you talk about competition, we tend to -- I tend to focus the conversation just on our own direct competitors. Of course, a very relevant thing in the competitive environment is interchange as well. And so we also, as we talked about, want to keep an eye on interchange risk. A few of the larger merchants have negotiated lower interchange. That will have an effect that we keep an eye on. And also, we're watching the evolving digital marketplace for payment alternatives and any impact there on interchange or disintermediation or tolls or anything that happens along those lines. So that's another dimension we should probably always add to our conversation about competition. Finally, in partnerships, that's the place that I have most pointed to as the intensity of the auction-based marketplace there at times and, in fact, very often recently, has led to market clearing prices that have been pretty breathtaking. And as a result, we have not had as much growth as we might otherwise have had in that particular space. The other thing about the card industry, I think, is worth pointing out is what's happening with just sort of industry growth. So industry revolving debt. For most of 2012 and 2013, it held steady at about 1% year-over-year growth and then it maintained sort of a little over a 3% growth since July of 2014 and, in recent months, has been over 4%. So that's certainly getting a little bit more octane there. And bank card outstandings are up 4.6% year-over-year. I think, overall, if I pull way up about the credit card marketplace, I think it's a generally rational marketplace. I think we see opportunity for growth and very attractive returns. We monitor the marketplace obsessively. And when we see windows of opportunity, which we do at the moment, we certainly go very hard to seize those opportunities."

The first is the potential of sustained low energy prices to cause economic stress in geographies that are heavily dependent on that industry. And keep in mind on that, that our consumer lending businesses are mostly national businesses, so we don't really have any outsized concentrations in those geographies. We have about 5% of our Card portfolios in parts of the country with high energy employment concentration. That said, when we look at these geographies, places like Houston, parts of North Dakota, Alberta province in Canada, we do see slight upticks in card delinquencies. And where appropriate, we've taken steps to surgically tighten our underwriting in these geographies, although we want to be careful not to overreact to these very modest effects. But of course, the flip side of falling energy prices is the direct benefit to consumers. And while the benefits are hard to disentangle from other economic effects, it's clear that falling gas prices translate into the equivalent of a pretty sizable wage increase for most households. So it's tough to gauge the net effect of these 2 factors. If I - my hunch is that it's a net positive on consumer credit."

And one of the most profound things that's happened on the liability side is the shift in mix, with much of it going into non-interest-bearing. You haven't seen nearly as much of that at Capital One. So we would, in general, expect to have higher betas than the peers just as a result of the higher contribution of our direct and online business.

I would not get overly focused on any 1 quarter. I mean, when our interchange growth number was very low, I said this when it's at this level, I say it again, there's a lot of factors that affect that quarterly number. If you look at full year 2015 compared to 2014, our net interchange grew 11% compared to purchase volume growth of 21%. Removing the quarterly noise, net interchange growth has generally lagged, general-purpose credit card interchange growth, and we expect this trend will continue. Our rewards programs have been and continue to be very successful with strong growth of our flagship products. We're also building a long-term franchise by upgrading rewards products for our existing rewards customers and, consistent with the industry, extending rewards products to some existing customers who don't have rewards. And as you can imagine, there is -- that entails some near-term cannibalization, but it's all part of building a stronger, deeper customer franchise. And we're committed to doing that. And also, as I mentioned earlier, there are a few merchants out there driving interchange through their individualized negotiations and things like that. That's also another factor that we have to keep an eye on. So I wouldn't get carried away with any 1 quarter but we very much like the growth we're having in our spender business, and it's part of a long-term franchise strategy."

First of all, there's obviously been turmoil in the markets recently, including concerns about the global economy, especially China and, closer to home, concerns about the potentially disruptive consequences of falling oil prices. Having said that, most indicators of the ""real economy"" at least in the U.S., continue to look pretty strong. We've seen sustained improvement in labor markets in recent months and steady home price growth. Consumer confidence remains solid. And as we talked about earlier, falling energy prices, while they will stress certain sectors and certain geographies, they will also directly benefit consumers. And if anything, I feel, may probably be a net positive for the overall health of the consumer. Of course, our most reliable view, Brian, of consumers comes from our own portfolio, from direct indicators of consumer behavior like payment rates and purchase volume and from leading-edge credit indicators like delinquency flow rates. These indicators all look consistent with our views of seasonality and Growth Math, and they are not giving us cause for concern. Obviously, the economy is something of a wildcard. And if the turmoil we're seeing in financial markets spills over into the real economy, we would expect that to show up in our credit metrics eventually, but we are not seeing any indications of that now."

And one thing I've said about the rewards business, it's really hard to be a casual player in the business, really ramping it up this quarter, putting it on TV this quarter, pulling back the next quarter. This is about very sustained investment, building a brand and being willing to do what it takes on the timing of cost versus payback and things that make it difficult for companies to sustain their investment in this particular space. As you know, we've invested for years, and I think we're in a good position there to get a bunch of traction and enjoy the financial benefits of that. The -- it is also the case, and you are correct, that the rewards business has now extended farther across the credit spectrum, deeper into the revolver business and a number of things. And a higher proportion of Americans are ending up with rewards cards, including a bunch who are regular old revolvers. Now on the face of it, it's not that big a deal economically in the sense that if someone is a revolver, they -- once they start revolving on the card, the reward economics aren't that relevant anymore. So I -- your thesis is an interesting one. My own belief is this will continue to be as far out as we can see and a pretty intensely competitive business. I do not describe it as a business where you just give everything away and make your money on the rest of the business.

There are a bunch of businesses in banking that, in our opinion, don't sort of have enough earnings power to do that. It's one reason we've tried to focus on the places that do. Secondly, we need a strategic positioning in the marketplace that allows us to capitalize on opportunities. And third, we need the credit discipline to be able to respond to the windows that open and close in the marketplace. And we focus on these 3 things throughout our 2 decades as a public company. Right now is a critical time in the marketplace. We're generating above-hurdle returns, but are also investing to capitalize on 2 very significant opportunities. A card growth window, which is itself the reward of years of investment and a sweeping digital transformation of our industry. Both investments are going incredibly well at Capital One. And we expect the benefits will increasingly show over time in our financial performance through growth, operating leverage, bottom line return and capital return."

Capital One earned $1 billion or $1.84 per share in the first quarter. Pre-provision earnings increased 10% in the fourth quarter to $3 billion, as we had higher revenues and lower marketing and operating expenses. Provision for credit losses increased linked quarter driven by higher charge-offs and $286 million allowance bills, including $73 million of our allowance build in our oil and gas portfolio.
As you can see on Slide 4, reported NIM decreased 12 basis points from fourth quarter to 6.75%, driven by 1 last date recognized income in a full quarter of lower yield GE commercial assets, partially offset by higher interest rates. NIM increased 18 basis points year-over-year, fueled by strong growth in our domestic card business. Turning to Slide 5, our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio on a Basel III standardized basis was 11.1%, which reflects current phase-ins. On a standardized fully phased in basis, it was 10.9%. We reduced our net share count by 12.8 million shares in the quarter, as we completed our previously announced incremental $300 million in repurchases in the first quarter.
We are on track to complete our remaining CCAR authorization by the end of the second quarter 2016. As we continue our parallel run for Basel III advised purchase, we estimate that our common equity tier one capital ratio was above our target of 8%.

I'll begin on Slide 7 with our Domestic Card business. Strong growth continued in the quarter. Compared to the first quarter of last year, our ending loans and average loans were both up 14%.

I'll begin on Slide 7 with our Domestic Card business. Strong growth continued in the quarter. Compared to the first quarter of last year, our ending loans and average loans were both up 14%. We continue to like the earnings profile and the resilience of the business for booking. First quarter revenue increased 12% from prior year quarter, slightly lagging average loan growth, as revenue margin declined modestly. Revenue margin for the quarter was 16.6%. As a reminder, payment protection revenue contributed about 25 basis points to full year 2015 revenue margin. Because we completed the exit of our back book of payment protection products at the first end of quarter, we expect this contribution to go to 0 in the second quarter revenue margin.
Purchase volume in the first quarter increased about 20% from the prior year. Net interchanged revenue for the total company also increased 20%. Although the 2 growth rates were the same this quarter, we've consistently emphasized the need to look at longer-term trends to understand net interchanged growth, without the quarterly volatility. For the past several years, on an annual basis, net interchange growth has been well below domestic card purchase volume growth. We'd expect this divergence to continue, as we continue to expand and strengthen our rewards franchise, by originating new rewards customers and extending rewards to existing customers. Also a few of the largest merchants have negotiated custom deals with the card networks that will make their way into interchange revenue overtime.
First quarter noninterest expenses increased compared to the prior-year quarter, with the higher marketing and growth related operating expenses as well as continuing digital investments. As we've discussed for several quarters, 2 factors are driving our current credit trends and expectation. The first is Growth Math, which is the upward pressure on delinquencies and charge-offs, as new loan balances season and become a larger proportion of our overall portfolio. The second is seasonality, all else equal, the first quarter is the seasonal peak for charge off rate. Our guidance for Domestic Card charge-off rate remains unchanged. We expect the upward pressure from Growth Math will continue through 2016 and begin to moderate in 2017. We still expect the full year 2016 charge-off rate to be around 4%, with quarterly seasonal variability.
Based on what we see today and assuming relative stability in consumer behavior, the domestic economy and competitive conditions, we still expect full year 2017 charge-off rate in the low 4s, with quarterly seasonal variability. Loan growth, coupled with our expectations for rising charge-off rate, drove allowance build in the quarter. We expect allowance additions going forward, primarily driven by growth. Slide 8 summarizes first quarter results for our Consumer Banking business. Ending loans were down a little less than $1 billion compared to the prior year. Growth in auto loans was offset by planned mortgage runoff, ending deposits were up $5.3 billion versus the prior year. Auto originations in the first quarter were $5.8 billion, about 13% higher compared to the first quarter of last year. In the fourth quarter of 2015, originations shrank, particularly is subprime. This quarter originations growth was stronger, including in subprime. We had good success with our originations program and it appears that competitive intensity may have softened a bit in the quarter. But we wouldn't take much from any one quarter of results. We still feel the same way about this business, as we have for several quarters. We remained very vigilant about competitor practices. In our underwriting, we assume use card prices decline further.
We continue to focus on resilient originations and we continue to expect gradual normalization of margins and credit. Consumer Banking revenue for the quarter increased modestly from the first quarter of last year. Higher revenue from growth in auto loans and higher deposit volumes was offset by margin compression in auto and declining mortgage balances. First quarter revenues were also aided by a rewards liability release associated with discontinuing certain checking products. Noninterest expense increased compared to the prior year quarter, driven by growth in auto loans and an increase in retail deposit marketing. First quarter provision for credit losses was up from the prior year, mostly as the result of growth in auto loans and a modestly higher auto charge-off rate.
We also added to the Consumer Banking allowance for loan losses in the quarter. As we previously discussed, we expect auto charge-offs to increase gradually. And in the first quarter, we observed a decline in used vehicle values. These two factors drove the allowance addition. In our retail deposit businesses, customer needs and preferences are changing, driving changes to the function, format and number of our branches. Like all banks, we've been optimizing both the format and number of branches to better meet the evolving needs of our customers, as banking goes digital. In 2015, branch optimization costs were about $50 million. We're planning to accelerate these efforts and we expect branch optimization cost to be elevated in 2016.
We're still formulating specific plans and timing. But based on what we see today, we expect to recognize branch optimization expenses of about $160 million in 2016. In the first quarter, actual charges were $11 million. This category, rather than the consumer bank P&L. We expect fair several factors to put pressure on our Consumer Banking financial results in 2016. In the home loans business, planned mortgage runoff continues. In Auto Finance, margins are compressing and charge-offs are rising modestly. And our deposit businesses continue to face a prolonged period of low interest rates. We expect these factors will negatively affect Consumer Banking revenues, efficiency ratio and net income in 2016, even as we continue to tightly manage cost.
Moving to Slide 9. I'll discuss our Commercial Banking business. Ending loan balances in the quarter increased 27% year-over-year and average loans increased 24%, including the acquisition of the GE Healthcare finance business. Excluding the $8.3 billion of loans acquired from GE, ending loans grew about 10% year-over-year. While competition is pressuring loan terms and pricing in both CRE and C&I, we continue to see good growth opportunities in select specialty industry verticals. Revenue in the first quarter increased 14% compared to the first quarter of 2015. Revenue growth was below average loan growth, because of continuing spread compression. Credit pressures continue to be focused in the oil and gas and taxi medallion portfolios. Provision for credit losses increased to $168 million from the prior year quarter to $228 million, as we continued to build reserves. We've been building reserves over the last 6 quarters in anticipation of increasing risk in oil and gas and taxi medallion loans.
Downgrades of oil and gas loans drove first quarter increases in criticized and nonperforming loans. The commercial bank criticized loan rates was 5.6% in the first quarter, comprised of the criticized performing loan rate of 4%, and the criticized nonperforming loan rate of 1.6%. We continue to focus on managing credit risk and working with our oil and gas customers. As you can see on Slide 10, our total oil and gas loans ended the first quarter at $3.2 billion or about 1.5% of total company loans, as some exploration and production customers drew on their lines in the quarter. Unfunded exposure decreased to $2.7 billion. Total exposure, including both loans and unfunded exposure declined to $5.9 billion. We expect that oil and gas loans will continue to present challenges and we've been building results to reflect that concern. At quarter end, approximately $262 million of our total commercial allowance for loan losses was specifically allocated to our oil and gas portfolio. This allowance is about 8% of total oil and gas loans. Including unfunded reserves plus allowance, we hold $359 million in total reserves allocated to the oil and gas portfolio. While our current reserves fully reflect all the information we have today, as the turmoil in the energy industry continues, future development could lead to for the reserve builds and possibly increasing charge-offs.
I'll close tonight with some thoughts on the first quarter results and our outlook for 2016. We posted another strong quarter of growth in Domestic Card loan balances and purchase volume, driving strong year-over-year growth in revenue as well as related increases in operating expense, marketing and allowance for loan losses. Noninterest expense decreased 6% from the linked quarter, driven by seasonal declines in marketing and operating expense. First quarter noninterest expense does not represent a run rate for the remaining quarters of 2016 for several reasons. The first quarter is typically a low point for noninterest expense. Our businesses continue to grow. We expect about $100 million in elevated branch optimization cost to impact the remainder of 2016. And we expect the net impact of FDIC surcharges and premium changes to add about $20 million to quarterly operating expense, beginning in the third quarter of 2016.
Provision for credit losses increased in the quarter. We added to the allowance for loan losses, primarily because of Domestic Card loan growth and the expectation of higher Domestic Card charge-off rates, because of Growth Math. We expect these factors to drive further allowance builds in 2016. We also build Commercial Banking reserves in the quarter to reflect increasing risk in energy loans. Our efficiency ratio guidance is not changing. Compared to 2015, we still expect some improvement in our full year 2016 efficiency ratio with continuing improvement in 2017, excluding adjusting items. To be clear, there were no adjusting items in the first quarter. We plan to deliver efficiency improvement, despite the additional pressure from elevated branch optimization cost, higher FDIC expenses and a deterioration in market expectations for interest rate.
We expect our card growth will create positive operating leverage overtime. And we continue to tightly manage cost across our businesses. Pulling up, we continue to be in a strong position to deliver attractive shareholder returns, driven by growth and sustainable returns at the higher end of banks as well as significant capital distribution, subject to regulatory approval. 
Now Steve and I will be happy to answer your questions."

So the most important point is to just reflect on the volatility of this number. And particularly, as we turn in the second consecutive quarter of where this -- the number remaining the net interchange growth number, where it is as high as it",558,"Okay, Moshe. So the most important point is to just reflect on the volatility of this number. And particularly, as we turn in the second consecutive quarter of where this -- the number remaining the net interchange growth number, where it is as high as it is, we go out of our way to remind folks that there is a lot that goes into this particular calculation and these contribute to its volatility. So let me start Moshe with just the volatility side of this thing. The net interest interchange metric includes partnership, contractual payments and international card and consumer bank net interchange. And also, we update our rewards liability every quarter, based on points earned and redeemed. The redemption mix and redemption rates. And so any one quarter, we probably spend more calories explaining that volatility than we do to reporting it, just to make sure that focus on the longer-term trends.
If you look at the full year 2015 compared to 2014, our net interchange grew 11% compared to purchase volume growth of 21%. So if we get past the quarterly noise, part of the conversation, let's talk about why net interchange growth has generally lagged domestic card purchase volume growth and why we also expect that to continue. Our rewards programs have been and continue to be very successful, with -- yes, of course strong growth in flagship products like Quicksilver and Venture and our Spark card, but we're also building a long-term franchise, very consciously and consistently by upgrading Rewards products for our existing rewards customers. And extending rewards products to some existing customers, who don't have rewards. And as you can imagine, this entails some near-term cannibalization, when we do this. But it's all part of building stronger, deeper customer franchise. And those trends, I mean, we're well on our way with respect to those trends, but they will continue. And also -- and this is something that will be a newer effect in numbers, that's not in our prior numbers. A few of the larger merchants have negotiated custom interchange deals with the networks and those economics on negotiations that have now happened, will make their way into the interchange metrics for card players. So -- and you asked a question about Rewards competition. This is a very competitive space. I think the competition is has intensified a bit over the past years. Over the past year really, issuers are continue to introduce new offers, upfront bonuses, have been gradually increasing overtime. I still look at this at the players, is generally rational, intensely competitive, and our strategy is designed to go right into a marketplace like that. So we'll keep an eye obviously on interchange risk. And I mean, that's a different orthogonal factor. But I think we still feel pretty optimistic about that variable overall in the marketplace. And all-in-all, as we post another quarter of pretty strong performance, we -- it's really more of the same story that we've seen in the past. And despite intense competitive pressure, we still see a window of opportunity to grow. And beyond the sort of the notion of window here, I think this is just part of sustaining strategy of Capital One to invest in going at the top end of the marketplace.

So let me do a little cross calibration relative to those two. We see growth opportunities in both businesses. In fact, you saw in auto actually growth stepped up a little bit, although we went out of our way to say don't get carried away with that. I think our message is really the same as before. Frankly, in both businesses, our message is really the same as we had last quarter. On a cross calibration, I think the auto business is a little bit farther along in the sort of natural evolution of a market and the competitive dynamics associated with that. And I think we see less growth opportunity there, even though at the margin, we're both vigilant and very much working to capture the opportunities that are consistent with our underwriting. On the card side, I think that the marketplaces is despite very competitive is still I'd still say it's very rational. The competitors have staked out different positions in the marketplace with different strategies and several are succeeding all at the same time. Where we're finding growth is in opportunities that are the result of investment for years and strategic focus and testing and a lot of things that give rise to a more sustainable growth opportunity, again I still would flag, nothing last forever, and we'll take this one quarter at a time. But we feel the same way about the card business, as we do -- did a quarter ago. I think there is still legs on the growth opportunity here. And again, it will all be done with an abundance of caution and knowing that window is always open and closed. But I think we still are quite bullish about this opportunity. then you said, so what about Growth Math. The Growth Math -- because we have -- the key thing about Growth Math that is so -- that's so central to our explanation about credit at the moment, it's not just that we're doing a lot of growth right now. And as you know, Rick, our growth entails sort of peak losses on a vintage in the first couple of years before things settle out. So you have that component. But the fact that it is on top of a almost we've never quite seen before the extent of such a seasoned resilient backbook that adjust the position of high growth, on top of a highly seasoned back book creates particularly more dramatic Growth Math effect. All of that said, it's also the case that if you overlaying a bunch of vintages that have the same credit growth dynamics, there's just a natural seasoning effect that occurs. Frankly, whether growth continues or whether growth slows down, that becomes a pretty strong effect in causing the credit effects of Growth Math to settle out in the latter part of the time horizon that we have provided guidance for."

And all that happened is our own provision was different -- loan book, external scenario was different, and our own allowance build, reserve and everything else ended up being unique. So I think what I would say is that, it's may be useful to pull back and just talk about the provision of the quarter for a minute and then I come back and comment on your question.
But if we look at our -- we had $157 million -- $157 million of the $228 million commercial provision expense was related to energy. And $18 million was due to charge-offs, mainly in the oilfield services segment. We built reserves by $139 million. And of that, our unfunded bid was $54 million, as we used higher utilization assumptions for some borrowers, given the somewhat defensive behavior that we saw during the quarter. And then lower oil and gas prices, runoff and hedges and declining collateral values also impacted our borrowers and contributed to the reserve build. And there were some odds ends be the build in provision.
So I think that what we have done in terms of allowance and unfunded reserve build, reflect what we see with our customers and in the marketplace at this time. But I think it is also the nature of markets that sometimes feed on each other that I think that there is still need to the deleveraging of the oil and gas industry still needs to happen. I think we've deserve for that which we see. And I think it's our expectation that it will take a while and have continuing credit impacts, as this thing fully plays out."

So that would be your answer on that. The Domestic Card revenue margin, it's interesting how stable that has been over the years, that has been -- that have been lot of factors that worked in opposite directions on that margin. There has certainly been a macro effect that has -- that we've been flagging over time in terms of things that we called franchise enhancements, where we continue to make choices in the customers' favor that have a bit of impact on revenue. The most dramatic of these in recent years has been this cross sell effect and it is now fully playing out.
I think the biggest impact on revenue margin going forward will not be so much the franchise enhancements, although here and there that will always go on. I think -- whatever happens in the competitive marketplace, which is very intense. And we will continue to monitor that.

We're seeing it across various segments in our business that are growing nicely. And obviously the Spender and rewards business is growing in our revolver business, where we focus on revolvers other than high balance revolvers. We see it in small business. But the growth results from success of our rewards programs. It results from new account origination, but also credit line increases. And there is an element of this, as you're familiar with the fact that we, over the last couple of years, increased credit lines quite significantly, making up for kind of a brownout that preceded that period of time. Now we're in equilibrium with respect to credit line increases. But as people utilize extra line, as you have new originations, just the utilization of the card. All of these things help grow purchase volume. So the purchase volume numbers are the result of direct success in spend-oriented programs as well as it's a byproduct of all the growth that's going on at Capital One. Can we sustained this? I think that we're in a good competitive position. But obviously a lot of other competitors are investing heavily and have a lot of very successful things that they're doing. So we will continue to take this opportunity as far as it will take us. But we're cognizant of the intense competition there.
Private label with respect to growth rate is in a different place, because that's a relatively modest growth rate, because we have not been adding a lot of big partnerships. Some of our existing partnerships are having nice growth, but that business is in an intense competitive period around auction prices. And we've gone to a bunch of auctions. We intended to come up empty-handed lately, because of -- we've not been willing to go to some of the extreme levels that we have seen, where the market clearing price grows. And all that said, we like the partnership business, and I think it has continued opportunity. But in that business, that is so auctioned driven, think we have to be very respectful about the nature of the auction pricing cycle within that business and make sure that we don't do unnatural things for the sake of growth."

And for Capital One, if you peel the way effects of Growth Math, that's still very much the case. And when we look at our back book for example, credit is strikingly stable with some pockets of even continuing improvement. And this very strong credit environment has been the result for ourselves in the industry highly, highly seasoned backbook just made up largely of customers, who were at the Great Recession. A more disciplined consumer, who is less likely to be overstretched or overindebted and an economy that has slow, though it has been on a long sustained kind of recovery here. But from where we sit today, my biggest worry. And it kind of gets to your question, is the potential impact of growing competition and actually the growth itself that we see of credit around us. We've seen a growth of revolving debt creep up to about 6% recently. That's pretty high relative to the low and sometimes negative levels, since the recession. And both consumers and creditors have been very cautious. Beyond card growth, we've seen growth in other nonmortgage debt. We've seen it in student lending, auto lending and installment lending. And we're watching that closely as well. And installment lending, which I think the banks have gradually returned to, has been the primary asset class for the alternative lenders. And you may remember, we had an installment lending book that into the Great Recession was probably our worst performing portfolio. So my point probably is, not lending point, but the broader point is all of this -- the math if amount of growth that we see in the credit market place is not lost on us. Now, it is in the context of particularly on the card side, growth being flattish for a long period of time. So we are not overly alarmed by just a surge of growth, but we certainly have to keep an eye on this. And we know that in the end, things that we see in the marketplace with respect to growth, not only affect our growth opportunity, they can effect credit with the selection quality of new originations and can impact existing customers to take on more debt from other players. So all of that is stuff that we look at. At this point, Don, we have not seen these effects in our performance. We've reaffirmed our guidance. But it's just a reminder why we focus so much on resilience. We don't set growth targets in the company. We focus on capturing highly resilient opportunities when we have them. And in the end, know always that we're in the risk management business. But right now, net-net, we still feel very good about our opportunity here. And we feel very good about the credit outlook."

But I don't think that, that is where that -- as our growth, I think is going to be more driven, unless there is dramatic kind of change in the economy. I think it's going to be much more driven by the competitive environment and the related impacts of that competitive environment on the credit environment. And we just learned long ago, one of the things that makes this business what it is in terms of the opportunity to make money and get growth opportunities. But on the same time, it's always something we have to remind ourselves, is the relationship between competitive practices, that's both how intensive the marketing is, the underwriting practices, the pricing and those things, how much they impact, not only growth, but ultimately make their way into the credit side of the business as well. And this is one business, where our own customers, in a lot of credit businesses customers have a lending product from one bank. In this case, people can have credit cards with a lot of players. And of course, they hold lending products from others as well. So as I have said and I still actually would describe the credit card marketplace this way, on a cross calibration with the rest of the industries that we're in, I think this is the most rational of the marketplaces.
But certainly, the thing that we're watching the most is the level of supply out there. And I think the underwriting competition has been very rational, which is a good thing. But we will continue to watch that competition and then look for impacts that can come with that, that would signal to us that it would be appropriate to slowdown or whatever. But again, you always know us. We're always in the go out and look out and that things to worry about. But I think that we continue to like the opportunity in the card space."

There is a number of major competitors are actually growing in that space. And also, what impacts that business a lot is the what spills downstream from the prime business, as consumers migrate. And so when you -- you can look at the overall disclosures on how much the various banks have of 650 and below. And you can see that there is a pretty sizable amount of business that each of the players have. I think they have different strategies with respect to them. In Capital One's case, we explicitly actually target certain pockets within that business. Other players, it's more of a byproduct of more generalized marketing that they do. In some of the retail bank players, I think they are going to their space with their own customers that they know well. So I think that it's a more competitive space than I think sometimes urban legend would have it. But that Capital One I think just as more unique approach to the business. And one of the striking things I mentioned again about the card business is, the major card players have staked out unique strategies for how they play in this business. And relative to most businesses that we're in, I'm struck by the differences into strategies and frankly look around and see what of successful players doing smart things, given where they are and the bone structure of assets that they have. And it leads to the simultaneous success, I think of a number of players."

Capital One earned $1 billion or $1.84 per share in the first quarter. Pre-provision earnings increased 10% from the fourth quarter to $3 billion, as we had higher revenues and lower marketing and operating expenses. Provision for credit losses increased linked quarter driven by higher charge-offs and a $286 million allowance build, including $73 million of allowance build in our oil and gas portfolio.
As you can see on Slide 4, reported NIM decreased 4 basis points from fourth quarter to 6.75%, driven by 1 less day to recognize income and a full quarter of lower-yielding GE commercial assets, partially offset by higher interest rates. NIM increased 18 basis points year-over-year, fueled by strong growth in our Domestic Card business. 
Turning to Slide 5, our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio on a Basel III standardized basis was 11.1%, which reflects current phase-ins. On a standardized fully phased-in basis, it was 10.9%. 
We reduced our net share count by 12.8 million shares in the quarter, as we completed our previously announced incremental 300 million in repurchases in the first quarter.  We are on track to complete our remaining CCAR authorization by the end of the second quarter 2016. As we continue our parallel run for Basel III Advanced Approaches, we estimate that our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio is above our target of 8%.

Strong growth continued in the quarter. Compared to the first quarter of last year, our ending loans and average loans were both up 14%. We continue to like the earnings profile and the resilience of the business we're booking. First quarter revenue increased 12% from prior-year quarter, slightly lagging average loan growth as revenue margin declined modestly. Revenue margin for the quarter was 16.6%. As a reminder, Payment Protection revenue contributed about 25 basis points to full year 2015 revenue margin. Because we completed the exit of our back book of payment protection products at the end of the first quarter, we expect this contribution to go to 0 in the second quarter revenue margin.
Purchase volume in the first quarter increased about 20% from the prior year. Net interchange revenue for the total company also increased 20%. Although the 2 growth rates were the same this quarter, we've consistently emphasized the need to look at longer-term trends to understand net interchange growth without the quarterly volatility. For the past several years, on an annual basis, net interchange growth has been well below Domestic Card purchase volume growth. We'd expect this divergence to continue as we continue to expand and strengthen our rewards franchise by originating new rewards customers and extending rewards to existing customers. Also a few of the largest merchants have negotiated custom deals with the card networks that will make their way into interchange revenue over time.
First quarter noninterest expenses increased compared to the prior-year quarter, with higher marketing and growth-related operating expenses, as well as continuing digital investments. As we've discussed for several quarters, 2 factors are driving our current credit trends and expectations. The first is Growth Math, which is the upward pressure on delinquencies and charge-offs as new loan balances season and become a larger proportion of our overall portfolio. The second is seasonality. All else equal, the first quarter is the seasonal peak for charge-off rate. Our guidance for Domestic Card charge-off rate remains unchanged. We expect the upward pressure from Growth Math will continue through 2016 and begin to moderate in 2017. We still expect the full year 2016 charge-off rate to be around 4%, with quarterly seasonal variability.
Based on what we see today and assuming relative stability in consumer behavior, the domestic economy and competitive conditions, we still expect full year 2017 charge-off rate in the low 4s, with quarterly seasonal variability. 
Loan growth, coupled with our expectations for rising charge-off rate, drove an allowance build in the quarter. We expect allowance additions going forward, primarily driven by growth. 
Slide 8 summarizes first quarter results for our Consumer Banking business. Ending loans were down a little less than $1 billion compared to the prior year. Growth in auto loans was offset by planned mortgage runoff, ending deposits were up about $5.3 billion versus the prior year. Auto originations in the first quarter were $5.8 billion, about 13% higher compared to the first quarter of last year. In the fourth quarter of 2015, originations shrank, particularly in subprime. This quarter, originations growth was stronger, including in subprime. We had good success with our originations programs and it appears that competitive intensity may have softened a bit in the quarter. But we wouldn't take much from any one quarter of results. We still feel the same way about this business, as we have for several quarters. We remain very vigilant about competitor practices. In our underwriting, we assume used car prices decline further.  We continue to focus on resilient originations, and we continue to expect gradual normalization of margins and credit. 
Consumer Banking revenue for the quarter increased modestly from the first quarter of last year. Higher revenue from auto -- from growth in auto loans and higher deposit volumes was offset by margin compression in auto and declining mortgage balances. First quarter revenues were also aided by a rewards liability release associated with discontinuing certain checking products. Noninterest expense increased compared to the prior year quarter, driven by growth in auto loans and an increase in retail deposit marketing. First quarter provision for credit losses was up from the prior year, mostly as the result of growth in auto loans and a modestly higher auto charge-off rate.
We also added to the Consumer Banking allowance for loan losses in the quarter. As we previously discussed, we expect auto charge-offs to increase gradually, and in the first quarter, we observed a decline in used vehicle values. These 2 two factors drove the allowance addition. 
In our retail deposit businesses, customer needs and preferences are changing, driving changes to the function, format and number of our branches. Like all banks, we've been optimizing both the format and number of branches to better meet the evolving needs of our customers as banking goes digital. In 2015, branch optimization costs were about $50 million. We're planning to accelerate these efforts and we expect branch optimization cost to be elevated in 2016.  We're still formulating specific plans and timing, but based on what we see today, we expect to recognize branch optimization expenses of about $160 million in 2016.  In the first quarter, actual charges were $11 million. [indiscernible] category, rather than the consumer bank P&L. 
We expect several factors to put pressure on our Consumer Banking financial results in 2016. In the Home Loans business, planned mortgage runoff continues. In Auto Finance, margins are compressing and charge-offs are rising modestly. And our deposit businesses continue to face a prolonged period of low interest rates. We expect these factors will negatively affect Consumer Banking revenues, efficiency ratio and net income in 2016, even as we continue to tightly manage cost.
Moving to Slide 9, I'll discuss our Commercial Banking business. Ending loan balances in the quarter increased 27% year-over-year and average loans increased 24%, including the acquisition of the GE Healthcare finance business. Excluding the $8.3 billion of loans acquired from GE, ending loans grew about 10% year-over-year. While competition is pressuring loan terms and pricing in both CRE and C&I, we continue to see good growth opportunities in select specialty industry verticals. Revenue in the first quarter increased 14% compared to the first quarter of 2015. Revenue growth was below average loan growth because of continuing spread compression. Credit pressures continue to be focused in the oil and gas and Taxi Medallion portfolios. Provision for credit losses increased to $168 million from the prior year quarter to $228 million as we continued to build reserves. We've been building reserves over the last 6 quarters in anticipation of increasing risk in oil and gas and Taxi Medallion loans.  Downgrades of oil and gas loans drove first quarter increases in criticized and nonperforming loans.  The Commercial Bank criticized loan rate was 5.6% in the first quarter, comprised of the criticized performing loan rate of 4% and the criticized nonperforming loan rate of 1.6%. 
We continue to focus on managing credit risk and working with our oil and gas customers. As you can see on Slide 10, our total oil and gas loans ended the first quarter at $3.2 billion or about 1.5% of total company loans, as some exploration and production customers drew on their lines in the quarter. Unfunded exposure decreased to $2.7 billion. Total exposure, including both loans and unfunded exposure, declined to $5.9 billion. 
We expect that oil and gas loans will continue to present challenges and we've been building reserves to reflect that concern. At quarter end, approximately $262 million of our total commercial allowance for loan losses was specifically allocated to our oil and gas portfolio. This allowance is about 8% of total oil and gas loans. Including unfunded reserves plus allowance, we hold $359 million in total reserves allocated to the oil and gas portfolio. While our current reserves fully reflect all the information we have today, as the turmoil in the energy industry continues, future developments could lead to for the reserve builds and possibly increasing charge-offs.
I'll close tonight with some thoughts on the first quarter results and our outlook for 2016. We posted another strong quarter of growth in Domestic Card loan balances and purchase volumes, driving strong year-over-year growth in revenue, as well as related increases in operating expense, marketing and allowance for loan losses. Noninterest expense decreased 6% from the linked quarter, driven by seasonal declines in marketing and operating expense. First quarter noninterest expense does not represent a run rate for the remaining quarters of 2016 for several reasons: The first quarter is typically a low point for noninterest expense; our businesses continue to grow; we expect about $100 million in elevated branch optimization cost to impact the remainder of 2016; and we expect the net impact of FDIC surcharges and premium changes to add about $20 million to quarterly operating expense beginning in the third quarter of 2016.
Provision for credit losses increased in the quarter. We added to the allowance for loan losses, primarily because of Domestic Card loan growth and the expectation of higher Domestic Card charge-off rates because of Growth Math. We expect these factors to drive further allowance builds in 2016. We also build Commercial Banking reserves in the quarter to reflect increasing risk in energy loans. Our efficiency ratio guidance is not changing. Compared to 2015, we still expect some improvement in our full year 2016 efficiency ratio with continuing improvement in 2017, excluding adjusting items. To be clear, there were no adjusting items in the first quarter. We plan to deliver efficiency improvement, despite the additional pressure from elevated branch optimization cost, higher FDIC expenses and a deterioration in market expectations for interest rate.  We expect our card growth will create positive operating leverage over time, and we continue to tightly manage cost across our businesses. 
Poling up, we continue to be in a strong position to deliver attractive shareholder returns, driven by growth and sustainable returns at the higher end of banks, as well as significant capital distribution subject to regulatory approval. 
Now, Steve and I will be happy to answer your questions."

And so any one quarter, we probably spend more calories explaining that volatility than we do just reporting it just to make sure that folks focus on the longer-term trends.  If you look at the full year 2015 compared to 2014, our net interchange grew 11% compared to purchase volume growth of 21%. So if we get past the quarterly noise part of the conversation, let's talk about why net interchange growth has generally lagged Domestic Card purchase volume growth and why we also expect that to continue. Our rewards programs have been and continue to be very successful, with -- yes, of course, strong growth in flagship products like Quicksilver and Venture and our Spark card, but we're also building a long-term franchise very consciously and consistently by upgrading rewards products for our existing rewards customers and extending rewards products to some existing customers who don't have rewards. And as you can imagine, this entails some near-term cannibalization when we do this, but it's all part of building a stronger, deeper customer franchise. And those trends, I mean, we're well on our way with respect to those trends, but they will continue. And also -- and this is something that will be a newer effect in the numbers that's not in our prior numbers. A few of the larger merchants have negotiated custom interchange deals with the networks, and those economics on negotiations that have now happened, will make their way into the interchange metrics for card players. So the -- and you asked a question about rewards competition. This is a very competitive space. I think the competition has intensified a bit over the past years. Over the past year, really, issuers are continuing to introduce new offers, upfront bonuses, have been gradually increasing over time. I still look at this at the players. It's generally rational, intensely competitive, and our strategy is designed to go right into the -- into a marketplace like that. So we'll keep an eye, obviously, on interchange risk, and I mean, that's a different orthogonal factor. But I think we still feel pretty optimistic about that variable overall in the marketplace. And all-in-all, as we post another quarter of pretty strong performance, we -- it's really more of the same story that we've seen in the past. And despite intense competitive pressure, we still see a window of opportunity to grow. And beyond sort of the notion of window here, I think it's just part of a sustained strategy of Capital One to invest in going at the top end of the marketplace, and I think we're very pleased with our success."

First of all, you mentioned auto and card, so let me do a little cross-calibration relative to those 2. We see growth opportunities in both businesses. In fact, you saw in auto, actually, growth stepped up a little bit. Although we went out of our way to say don't get carried away with that. I think our message is really the same as before. Frankly, in both businesses, our message is really the same as we had last quarter. On a cross-calibration, I think the auto business is a little bit farther along in the sort of the natural evolution of a market and the competitive dynamics associated with that. And I think we see less growth opportunity there, even though at the margin, we're both vigilant and very much working to capture the opportunities that are consistent with our underwriting. On the card side, I think that the marketplaces is, despite very competitive, is still -- I'd still say it's very rational. The competitors have staked out different positions in the marketplace with different strategies, and several are succeeding all at the same time. Where we are finding growth is in opportunities that are the result of investment for years and strategic focus and testing and a lot of things that give rise to a more sustainable growth opportunity. Again, I still would flag nothing lasts forever, and we'll take this one quarter at a time. But we feel the same way about the card business as we do a quarter -- did a quarter ago. I think there are still lags on the growth opportunity here. And again, it will all be done with an abundance of caution and knowing that windows always open and close. But I think we still are quite bullish about this opportunity. Now then you said, so what about Growth Math? The Growth Math -- because we have -- the key thing about Growth Math that is so -- that's so central to our explanation about credit at the moment is not just that we're doing a lot of growth right now. And as you know, Rick, our growth entails sort of peak losses on a vintage in the first couple of years before things settle out. So you have that component. But the fact that it is on top of a almost we've never quite seen before the extent of such a seasoned resilient back book that the juxtaposition of high growth on top of a highly seasoned back book creates particularly more dramatic Growth Math effect. All of that said, it's also the case that if you -- overlaying a bunch of vintages that have the same credit growth dynamics, there's just a natural seasoning effect that occurs. Frankly, whether growth continues or whether growth slows down, that becomes a pretty strong effect in causing the credit effects of Growth Math to settle out in the latter part of the time horizon that we have provided guidance for."

I think we did a scenario last time that went through sort of the mathematical impact of a one unique set of assumptions about prices. And all that happened is our own provision was different -- both the external scenario was different and our own allowance build, the reserve and everything else ended up being unique. So I think what I would say is this. It may be useful just to pull back and just talk about the provision in the quarter for a minute and then I come back and comment on your question.  But if we look at our -- we had $157 million -- 170 -- $157 million of the $228 million commercial provision expense was related to energy. And $18 million was due to charge-offs, mainly in the oilfield services segment. We built reserves by $139 million. And of that, our unfunded build was $54 million, as we use higher utilization assumptions for some borrowers given the somewhat defensive behavior that we saw during the quarter. And then lower oil and gas prices, runoff on hedges and declining collateral values also impacted our borrowers and contributed to the reserve build. And then there were some odds and ends to round out the build in provision.  So I think that what we have done in terms of allowance and unfunded reserve build reflects what we see with our customers and in the marketplace at this time. But I think it is also the nature of markets that sometimes feed on each other that I think that this still needs to -- the deleveraging of the oil and gas industry still needs to happen. I think we've reserved for that, which we see. And I think it's our expectation that it will take a while and have continuing credit impacts, as this thing fully plays out."

So that would be your answer on that. The Domestic Card revenue margin, it's interesting how stable that has been over the years, that has been -- there've been a lot of factors that have worked in opposite directions on that margin. There has certainly been a macro effect that has -- that we have been flagging over time in terms of the things that we call franchise enhancements, where we continue to make choices in the customers' favor that have a bit of impact on revenue. The most dramatic of these in recent years has been this cross-sell effect and it is now fully playing out.  I think the biggest impacts on revenue margin going forward will not be so much the franchise -- further franchise enhancements. Although here and there, those always go on. I think it's the -- it's whatever happens in the competitive marketplace, which is very intense. And we will continue to monitor that.

We're seeing it across various segments in our business that are growing nicely. And the -- obviously, the spender and rewards business is growing in our revolver business, where we focus on revolvers other than high balance revolvers. We see it in small business. But the growth results from success of our rewards programs. It results from new account origination, but also credit line increases. And there is an element of this, as you're familiar with the fact that we, over the last couple of years, increased credit lines quite significantly, making up for kind of a brownout that preceded that period of time. Now, we're in equilibrium with respect to credit line increases. But as people utilize extra line, as you have new originations, just the utilization of the card. All of these things help grow purchase volume. So the purchase volume numbers are the result of direct success in spend-oriented programs, as well as it's a byproduct of all the growth that's going on at Capital One. Can we sustain this? Well, I think that we're in a good, competitive position. But obviously, a lot of other competitors are investing heavily and have a lot of very successful things that they're doing. So we will continue to take this opportunity as far as it will take us. But we're cognizant of the intense competition there.
Private label, with respect to growth rate is in a different place, because that's a relatively modest growth rate, because we have not been adding a lot of big partnerships. Some of our existing partnerships are having nice growth. But that business is in an intense competitive period around auction prices. And we've gone to a bunch of auctions. We've tended to come up empty-handed lately because of -- we've not been willing to go to some of the extreme levels that we have seen, where the market clearing price goes. All that said, we like the partnership business and I think it has continued opportunity. But in that business that is so auction-driven, I  think we have to be very respectful about the nature of the auction pricing cycle within that business and make sure that we don't do unnatural things for the sake of growth."

And whe",498,"First of all, I want to start with your opening point. Consumer credit and especially card credit have been exceptionally strong for some years now. And for Capital One, if you peel away the effects of Growth Math, that's still very much the case. And when we look at our back book for example, credit is strikingly stable with some pockets of even continuing improvement. And this very strong credit environment has been the result of -- for ourselves in the industry, highly, highly seasoned back book which made up largely of customers who weathered the Great Recession. A more disciplined consumer who's less likely to be overstretched or over-indebted and an economy that has slowed, though it's been, has been sort of on a long-sustained kind of recovery here. But from where we sit today, my biggest worry, and it kind of gets to your question, is the potential impact of growing competition and actually the growth itself that we see of credit around us. We've seen a growth of revolving debt creep up to about 6% recently. That's pretty high relative to the low and sometimes negative levels since the recession. And both consumers and creditors have been very cautious. Beyond card growth, we've seen growth in other non-mortgage debt. We've seen it in student lending, auto lending and installment lending. And we're watching that closely as well. And installment lending, which I think the banks have gradually returned to, has been the primary asset class for the alternative lenders. And you may remember, we had an installment lending book that into the Great Recession, was probably our worst performing portfolio. So we -- my point probably is an installment lending point. But the broader point is all of this -- the math of the amount of growth that we see in a credit marketplace is not lost on us. Now, it is in the context of a, particularly on the card side, growth being flattish for a long period of time. So we're not overly alarmed by just a surge of growth, but we'll certainly have to keep an eye on this. And we know that in the end, growth -- things that we see in the marketplace with respect to growth not only affect our growth opportunity, they can affect credit with the selection quality of new originations and can impact existing customers to take on more debt from other players. So all of that is stuff that we look at. At this point, Don, we have not seen these effects in our performance. We've reaffirmed our guidance. But it's just a reminder why we focus so much on resilience. We don't set growth targets in the company. We focus on capturing highly resilient opportunities when we have them. And in the end, know always that we're in the risk management business. But right now, net-net, we still feel very good about our opportunity here and we feel very good about the credit outlook."

Look, the economy is always a wildcard there. But I don't think that, that is where that -- as our growth, I think, is going to be more driven, unless there's a dramatic kind of change in the economy. I think it's going to be much more driven",341,"So I think. Look, the economy is always a wildcard there. But I don't think that, that is where that -- as our growth, I think, is going to be more driven, unless there's a dramatic kind of change in the economy. I think it's going to be much more driven by the competitive environment and the related impacts of that competitive environment on the credit environment. And we just learned long ago, one of the things that makes this business what it is in terms of the opportunity to make money and get growth opportunities, but on the same time, is always something that we have to remind ourselves, is the relationship between competitive practices that's both how intensive the marketing is, the underwriting practices, the pricing and those things, how much they impact, not only growth, but ultimately, make their way into the credit side of the business as well. And this is one business, where our own customers -- in a lot of credit businesses, customers have a lending product from one bank. In this case, people can have credit cards with a lot of players. And of course, they hold lending products from others as well. So as I have said and I still actually would describe the credit card marketplace this way, on a cross calibration with the rest of the industries that we are in, I think this is the most rational of the marketplaces.
But certainly, the thing that we are watching the most is the level of supply out there. And I think the underwriting competition has been very rational, which is a good thing. But we will continue to watch that competition and then look for impacts that can come with that, that would signal to us that it would be appropriate to slowdown or whatever. But again, you always know us. We're always in the go out and look out and obsess at things to worry about. But I think that we continue to like the opportunity in the card space."

There is a number of major competitors that are actually growing in that space. And also, what impacts that business a lot is the what spills downstream from the prime business as consumers migrate. And so when you -- and you can look at the overall disclosures on how much the various banks have of 660 [ph] and below, and you can see that there's a pretty sizable amount of business that each of the players have. I think they have different strategies with respect to them. In Capital One's case, we explicitly actually target certain pockets within that business. Other players, it's more of a byproduct of more generalized marketing that they do. In some of the retail bank players, I think they go into this space with their own customers that they know well. So I think that it's a more competitive space than I think sometimes urban legend would have it. But that -- Capital One, I think, just has a more unique approach to the business. And one of the striking things I'll mention again about the card business is, the major card players have staked out unique strategies for how they play in this business. And relative to most businesses that we're in, I'm struck by the differences in those strategies and, frankly, look around and see a lot of successful players doing smart things given where they are and the bone structure of assets that they have. And it leads to the simultaneous success, I think, of a number of players."

Capital One earned $1 billion or $1.84 per share in the first quarter. Pre-provision earnings increased 10% from the fourth quarter to $3 billion, as we had higher revenues and lower marketing and operating expenses. Provision for credit losses increased linked quarter driven by higher charge-offs and a $286 million allowance build, including $73 million of allowance build in our oil and gas portfolio.
As you can see on Slide 4, reported NIM decreased 4 basis points from the fourth quarter to 6.75%, driven by 1 less day to recognize income and a full quarter of lower-yielding GE commercial assets, partially offset by higher interest rates. NIM increased 18 basis points year-over-year, fueled by strong growth in our Domestic Card business. 
Turning to Slide 5, our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio on a Basel III standardized basis was 11.1%, which reflects current phase-ins. On a standardized fully phased-in basis, it was 10.9%. 
We reduced our net share count by 12.8 million shares in the quarter, as we completed our previously announced incremental $300 million in repurchases in the first quarter. We are on track to complete our remaining CCAR authorization by the end of the second quarter of 2016. As we continue our parallel run for Basel III advanced approaches, we estimate that our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio is above our target of 8%.

I'll begin on Slide 7 with our Domestic Card business. Strong growth continued in the quarter. Compared to the first quarter of last year, our ending loans and average loans were both up 14%.

Strong growth continued in the quarter. Compared to the first quarter of last year, our ending loans and average loans were both up 14%. We continue to like the earnings profile and the resilience of the business we're booking. First quarter revenue increased 12% from prior-year quarter, slightly lagging average loan growth as revenue margin declined modestly. Revenue margin for the quarter was 16.6%. As a reminder, Payment Protection revenue contributed about 25 basis points to full year 2015 revenue margin. Because we completed the exit of our back book of Payment Protection products at the end of the first quarter, we expect this contribution to go to 0 in the second quarter revenue margin.
Purchase volume in the first quarter increased about 20% from the prior year. Net interchange revenue for the total company also increased 20%. Although the 2 growth rates were the same this quarter, we've consistently emphasized the need to look at longer-term trends to understand net interchange growth without the quarterly volatility. For the past several years, on an annual basis, net interchange growth has been well below Domestic Card purchase volume growth. We'd expect this divergence to continue as we continue to expand and strengthen our rewards franchise by originating new rewards customers and extending rewards to existing customers. Also, a few of the largest merchants have negotiated custom deals with the card networks that will make their way into interchange revenue over time.
First quarter noninterest expenses increased compared to the prior-year quarter, with higher marketing and growth-related operating expenses, as well as continuing digital investments. As we've discussed for several quarters, 2 factors are driving our current credit trends and expectations. The first is Growth Math, which is the upward pressure on delinquencies and charge-offs as new loan balances season and become a larger proportion of our overall portfolio. The second is seasonality. All else equal, the first quarter is the seasonal peak for charge-off rate. Our guidance for Domestic Card charge-off rate remains unchanged. We expect the upward pressure from Growth Math will continue through 2016 and begin to moderate in 2017. We still expect the full year 2016 charge-off rate to be around 4%, with quarterly seasonal variability.
Based on what we see today and assuming relative stability in consumer behavior, the domestic economy and competitive conditions, we still expect full year 2017 charge-off rate in the low 4s, with quarterly seasonal variability. 
Loan growth, coupled with our expectations for rising charge-off rate, drove an allowance build in the quarter. We expect allowance additions going forward, primarily driven by growth. 
Slide 8 summarizes first quarter results for our Consumer Banking business. Ending loans were down a little less than $1 billion compared to the prior year. Growth in auto loans was offset by planned mortgage runoff. Ending deposits were up about $5.3 billion versus the prior year. Auto originations in the first quarter were $5.8 billion, about 13% higher compared to the first quarter of last year. In the fourth quarter of 2015, originations shrank, particularly in subprime. This quarter, originations growth was stronger, including in subprime. We had good success with our originations programs and it appears that competitive intensity may have softened a bit in the quarter. But we wouldn't take much from any one quarter of results. We still feel the same way about this business, as we have for several quarters. We remain very vigilant about competitor practices. In our underwriting, we assume used car prices decline further. We continue to focus on resilient originations, and we continue to expect gradual normalization of margins and credit. 
Consumer Banking revenue for the quarter increased modestly from the first quarter of last year. Higher revenue from auto -- from growth in auto loans and higher deposit volumes was offset by margin compression in auto and declining mortgage balances. First quarter revenues were also aided by a rewards liability release associated with discontinuing certain checking products. Noninterest expense increased compared to the prior year quarter, driven by growth in auto loans and an increase in retail deposit marketing. First quarter provision for credit losses was up from the prior year, mostly as the result of growth in auto loans and a modestly higher auto charge-off rate.
We also added to the Consumer Banking allowance for loan losses in the quarter. As we previously discussed, we expect auto charge-offs to increase gradually, and in the first quarter, we observed a decline in used vehicle values. These 2 factors drove the allowance addition. 
In our retail deposit businesses, customer needs and preferences are changing, driving changes to the function, format and number of our branches. Like all banks, we've been optimizing both the format and number of branches to better meet the evolving needs of our customers as banking goes digital. In 2015, branch optimization costs were about $50 million. We're planning to accelerate these efforts and we expect branch optimization cost to be elevated in 2016. We're still formulating specific plans and timing, but based on what we see today, we expect to recognize branch optimization expenses of about $160 million in 2016. In the first quarter, actual charges were $11 million. These costs show up in the Other category, rather than the consumer bank P&L. 
We expect several factors to put pressure on our Consumer Banking financial results in 2016. In the Home Loans business, planned mortgage runoff continues. In Auto Finance, margins are compressing and charge-offs are rising modestly. And our deposit businesses continue to face a prolonged period of low interest rates. We expect these factors will negatively affect Consumer Banking revenues, efficiency ratio and net income in 2016, even as we continue to tightly manage cost.
Moving to Slide 9, I'll discuss our Commercial Banking business. Ending loan balances in the quarter increased 27% year-over-year and average loans increased 24%, including the acquisition of the GE Healthcare finance business. Excluding the $8.3 billion of loans acquired from GE, ending loans grew about 10% year-over-year. While competition is pressuring loan terms and pricing in both CRE and C&I, we continue to see good growth opportunities in select specialty industry verticals. Revenue in the first quarter increased 14% compared to the first quarter of 2015. Revenue growth was below average loan growth because of continuing spread compression. Credit pressures continue to be focused in the oil and gas and Taxi Medallion portfolios. Provision for credit losses increased $168 million from the prior year quarter to $228 million, as we continued to build reserves. We've been building reserves over the last 6 quarters in anticipation of increasing risk in oil and gas and Taxi Medallion loans. Downgrades of oil and gas loans drove first quarter increases in criticized and nonperforming loans. The Commercial Bank criticized loan rate was 5.6% in the first quarter, comprised of the criticized performing loan rate of 4% and the criticized nonperforming loan rate of 1.6%. 
We continue to focus on managing credit risk and working with our oil and gas customers. As you can see on Slide 10, our total oil and gas loans ended the first quarter at $3.2 billion or about 1.5% of total company loans, as some exploration and production customers drew on their lines in the quarter. Unfunded exposure decreased to $2.7 billion. Total exposure, including both loans and unfunded exposure, declined to $5.9 billion. 
We expect that oil and gas loans will continue to present challenges and we've been building reserves to reflect that concern. At quarter end, approximately $262 million of our total commercial allowance for loan losses was specifically allocated to our oil and gas portfolio. This allowance is about 8% of total oil and gas loans. Including unfunded reserves plus allowance, we hold $359 million in total reserves allocated to the oil and gas portfolio. While our current reserves fully reflect all the information we have today, as the turmoil in the energy industry continues, future developments could lead to further reserve builds and possibly increasing charge-offs.
I'll close tonight with some thoughts on the first quarter results and our outlook for 2016. We posted another strong quarter of growth in Domestic Card loan balances and purchase volumes, driving strong year-over-year growth in revenue, as well as related increases in operating expense, marketing and allowance for loan losses. Noninterest expense decreased 6% from the linked quarter, driven by seasonal declines in marketing and operating expense. First quarter noninterest expense does not represent a run rate for the remaining quarters of 2016 for several reasons: The first quarter is typically a low point for noninterest expense; our businesses continue to grow; we expect about $100 million in elevated branch optimization cost to impact the remainder of 2016; and we expect the net impact of FDIC surcharges and premium changes to add about $20 million to quarterly operating expense beginning in the third quarter of 2016.
Provision for credit losses increased in the quarter. We added to the allowance for loan losses, primarily because of Domestic Card loan growth and the expectation of higher Domestic Card charge-off rates because of Growth Math. We expect these factors to drive further allowance builds in 2016. We also built Commercial Banking reserves in the quarter to reflect increasing risk in energy loans. Our efficiency ratio guidance is not changing. Compared to 2015, we still expect some improvement in our full year 2016 efficiency ratio, with continuing improvement in 2017, excluding adjusting items. To be clear, there were no adjusting items in the first quarter. We plan to deliver efficiency improvement despite the additional pressure from elevated branch optimization cost, higher FDIC expenses and a deterioration in market expectations for interest rate. We expect our card growth will create positive operating leverage over time, and we continue to tightly manage cost across our businesses. 
Pulling up, we continue to be in a strong position to deliver attractive shareholder returns, driven by growth and sustainable returns at the higher end of banks, as well as significant capital distribution subject to regulatory approval. 
Now, Steve and I will be happy to answer your questions."

Could you just talk a little bit about what will cause it? I mean, if you're saying that it will diverge and go lower, like what is the cause in the future?

And particularly, as we turn in the second consecutive quarter of where this -- the number, meaning the net interchange growth number, where it is. As high as it",566,"Okay, Moshe, so the most important point is to just reflect on the volatility of this number. And particularly, as we turn in the second consecutive quarter of where this -- the number, meaning the net interchange growth number, where it is. As high as it is, we go out of our way to remind folks that there's a lot that goes into this particular calculation and these contribute to its volatility. So let me start, Moshe, with just the volatility side of this thing. The net interest interchange metric includes partnership contractual payments and international card and consumer bank net interchange. And also, we update our rewards liability every quarter based on points earned and redeemed, the redemption mix and redemption rates. And so any one quarter, we probably spend more calories explaining that volatility than we do just reporting it, just to make sure that folks focus on the longer-term trends. If you look at the full year 2015 compared to 2014, our net interchange grew 11% compared to purchase volume growth of 21%. So if we get past the quarterly noise part of the conversation, let's talk about why net interchange growth has generally lagged Domestic Card purchase volume growth and why we also expect that to continue. Our rewards programs have been and continue to be very successful, with -- yes, of course, strong growth in flagship products like Quicksilver and Venture and our Spark card, but we're also building a long-term franchise very consciously and consistently by upgrading rewards products for our existing rewards customers and extending rewards products to some existing customers who don't have rewards. And as you can imagine, this entails some near-term cannibalization when we do this, but it's all part of building a stronger, deeper customer franchise. And those trends, I mean, we're well on our way with respect to those trends, but they will continue. And also -- and this is something that will be a newer effect in the numbers that's not in our prior numbers, a few of the larger merchants have negotiated custom interchange deals with the networks, and those economics on negotiations that have now happened, will make their way into the interchange metrics for card players. So the -- and you asked a question about rewards competition. This is a very competitive space. I think the competition has intensified a bit over the past years. Over the past year, really, issuers are continuing to introduce new offers, upfront bonuses have been gradually increasing over time. I still look at this, at the players as generally rational, intensely competitive, and our strategy is designed to go right into the -- into a marketplace like that. So we'll keep an eye, obviously, on interchange risk, and I mean, that's a different orthogonal factor. But I think that we still feel pretty optimistic about that variable overall in the marketplace. And all in all, as we post another quarter of pretty strong performance, we -- it's really more of the same story that we've seen in the past. And despite intense competitive pressure, we still see a window of opportunity to grow. And beyond sort of the notion of window here, I think it's just part of a sustained strategy of Capital One to invest in going at the top end of the marketplace, and I think we're very pleased with our success."

First of all, you mentioned auto and card, so let me do a little cross-calibration relative to those two. We see growth opportunities in both businesses. In fact, you saw in auto, actually, growth step up a little bit. Although we went out of our way to say don't get carried away with that. I think our message is really the same as before. Frankly, in both businesses, our message is really the same as we had last quarter. On a cross-calibration, I think the auto business is a little bit farther along in the sort of the natural evolution of a market and the competitive dynamics associated with that. And I think we see less growth opportunity there, even though at the margin, we're both vigilant and very much working to capture the opportunities that are consistent with our underwriting. On the card side, I think that the marketplaces is, despite very competitive, is still, I'd still say it's very rational. The competitors have staked out different positions in the marketplace with different strategies, and several are succeeding, not all at the same time. Where we are finding growth is in opportunities that are the result of investment for years and strategic focus and testing and a lot of things that give rise to a more sustainable growth opportunity. Again, I still would flag nothing lasts forever, and we'll take this one quarter at a time. But we feel the same way about the card business as we do a quarter -- did a quarter ago. I think there are still lags on the growth opportunity here. And again, it will all be done with an abundance of caution and knowing that windows always open and close, but I think we still are quite bullish about this opportunity. Now then you said, so what about Growth Math? The Growth Math -- because we have -- the key thing about Growth Math that is so, that's so central to our explanation about credit at the moment is not just that we're doing a lot of growth right now. And as you know, Rick, growth entails sort of peak losses on a vintage in the first couple of years before things settle out. So you have that component. But the fact that it is on top of a almost we've never quite seen before the extent of such a seasoned resilient back book, that the juxtaposition of high growth on top of a highly seasoned back book creates particularly more dramatic Growth Math effect. All of that said, it's also the case that if you -- overlaying a bunch of vintages that have the same credit growth dynamics, there's just a natural seasoning effect that occurs. Frankly, whether growth continues or whether growth slows down, that becomes a pretty strong effect in causing the credit effects of Growth Math to settle out in the latter part of the time horizon that we have provided guidance for."

I think we did a scenario last time that went through sort of the mathematical impact of a one unique set of assumptions about prices. And all that happened is our own provision was different -- both the external scenario was different and our own allowance build, reserve and everything else ended up being unique. So I think what I would say is this. It may be useful just to pull back and just talk about the provision in the quarter for a minute and then I come back and comment on your question. But if we look at our -- we had $157 million -- 170 -- $157 million of the $228 million commercial provision expense was related to energy. And $18 million was due to charge-offs, mainly in the oilfield services segment. We built reserves by $139 million. And of that, our unfunded build was $54 million, as we use higher utilization assumptions for some borrowers given the somewhat defensive behavior that we saw during the quarter. And then lower oil and gas prices, runoff on hedges and declining collateral values also impacted our borrowers and contributed to the reserve build. And then there were some odds and ends to round out the build in provision. So I think that what we have done in terms of allowance and unfunded reserve build reflects what we see with our customers and in the marketplace at this time. But I think it is also the nature of markets that sometimes feed on each other that I think that this still needs to -- the deleveraging of the oil and gas industry still needs to happen. I think we've reserved for that, which we see. And I think it's our expectation that it will take a while and have continuing credit impacts, as this thing fully plays out."

So that would be your answer on that. The Domestic Card revenue margin, it's interesting how stable that has been over the years, that has been -- there've been a lot of factors that have worked in opposite directions on that margin. There has certainly been a macro effect that has -- that we have been flagging over time in terms of things that we call franchise enhancements, where we continue to make choices in the customers' favor that have a bit of impact on revenue. The most dramatic of these in recent years has been this cross-sell effect and it is now fully playing out. I think the biggest impacts on revenue margin going forward will not be so much the franchise, further franchise enhancements. Although here and there, those always go on, I think it's the -- it's whatever happens in the competitive marketplace, which is very intense. And we will continue to monitor that.

We're seeing it across various segments in our business that are growing nicely. And the -- obviously, the spender and rewards business is growing, and our revolver business, where we focus on revolvers other than high balance revolvers. We see it in small business. But the growth results from success of our rewards programs. It results from new account origination, but also credit line increases. And there is an element of this, as you're familiar with the fact that we, over the last couple of years, increased credit lines quite significantly, making up for kind of a brownout that preceded that period of time. Now we're in equilibrium with respect to credit line increases. But as people utilize extra line, as you have new originations, just the utilization of the card, all of these things help grow purchase volume. So the purchase volume numbers are the result of direct success in spend-oriented programs, as well as it's a byproduct of all the growth that's going on at Capital One. Can we sustain this? Well, I think that we're in a good, competitive position. But obviously, a lot of other competitors are investing heavily and have a lot of very successful things that they're doing. So we will continue to take this opportunity as far as it will take us. But we're cognizant of the intense competition there.
Private label, with respect to growth rate, is in a different place, because that's a relatively modest growth rate, because we have not been adding a lot of big partnerships. Some of our existing partnerships are having nice growth. But that business is in an intense competitive period around auction prices. And we've gone to a bunch of auctions. We've tended to come up empty-handed lately because of -- we've not been willing to go to some of the extreme levels that we have seen where the market clearing price goes. All that said, we like the partnership business and I think it has continued opportunity. But in that business that is so auction-driven, I think we have to be very respectful about the nature of the auction pricing cycle within that business and make sure that we don't do unnatural things for the sake of growth."

And I was just curious if you thought that could be a canary in a coal mine, or if you think that's just more of a reflection of aggressive growth and maybe not having good credit underwriting in their DNA?"

Consumer credit and especially card credit have been exceptionally strong for some years now. And for Capital One, if you peel away the effects of Growth Math, that's still very much the case. And whe",501,"First of all, I want to start with your opening point. Consumer credit and especially card credit have been exceptionally strong for some years now. And for Capital One, if you peel away the effects of Growth Math, that's still very much the case. And when we look at our back book, for example, credit is strikingly stable with some pockets of even continuing improvement. And this very strong credit environment has been the result of -- for ourselves and the industry, highly, highly seasoned back book which is made up largely of customers who weathered the Great Recession, a more disciplined consumer who's less likely to be overstretched or over-indebted and an economy that has, slow though it's been, has been sort of on a long, sustained kind of recovery here. But from where we sit today, my biggest worry, and it kind of gets to your question, is the potential impact of growing competition and actually, the growth itself that we see of credit around us. We've seen a growth of revolving debt creep up to about 6% recently. That's pretty high relative to the low and sometimes negative levels since the recession. And both consumers and creditors have been very cautious. Beyond card growth, we've seen growth in other non-mortgage debt. We've seen it in student lending, auto lending and installment lending. And we're watching that closely as well. And installment lending, which I think the banks have gradually returned to, has been the primary asset class for the alternative lenders. And you may remember, we had an installment lending book that into the Great Recession, was probably our worst performing portfolio. So we -- my point partly is still on the lending point, but the broader point is all of this -- the math of the amount of growth that we see in the credit marketplace is not lost on us. Now it is in the context of a, particularly on the card side, growth being flattish for a long period of time. So we're not overly alarmed by just a surge of growth, but we'll certainly have to keep an eye on this. And we know that in the end, growth -- things that we see in the marketplace with respect to growth not only affect our growth opportunity, they can affect credit, with the selection quality of new originations and can impact existing customers who take on more debt from other players. So all of that is stuff that we look at. At this point, Don, we have not seen these effects in our performance. We've reaffirmed our guidance. But it's just a reminder why we focus so much on resilience. We don't set growth targets in the company. We focus on capturing highly resilient opportunities when we have them. And in the end, know always that we're in the risk management business. But right now, net-net, we still feel very good about our opportunity here and we feel very good about the credit outlook."

But I don't think that, that is where that -- as our growth, I think, is going to be more driven, unless there's a dramatic kind of change in the economy, I think it's going to be much more driven by the competitive environment and the related impacts of that competitive environment on the credit environment. And we just learned long ago, one of the things that makes this business what it is in terms of the opportunity to make money and get growth opportunities, but on the same time, it's always something that we have to remind ourselves, is the relationship between competitive practices, that's both how intensive the marketing is, the underwriting practices, the pricing and those things, how much they impact not only growth, but ultimately, make their way into the credit side of the business as well. And this is one business where our own customers -- in a lot of credit businesses, customers have a lending product from one bank. In this case, people can have credit cards with a lot of players. And of course, they hold lending products from others as well. So as I have said and I still actually would describe the credit card marketplace this way, on a cross-calibration with the rest of the industries that we are in, I think this is the most rational of the marketplaces.
But certainly, the thing that we are watching the most is the level of supply out there. And I think the underwriting competition has been very rational, which is a good thing. But we will continue to watch that competition and then look for impacts that can come with that, that would signal to us that it would be appropriate to slow down or whatever. But again, you always know us. We're always in the go out and look out and obsess at things to worry about. But I think that we continue to like the opportunity in the card space."

And so when you -- and you can look at the overall disclosures on how much the various banks have of 660 [ph] and below, and you can see that there's a pretty sizable amount of business that each of the players have. I think they have different strategies with respect to them. In Capital One's case, we explicitly actually target certain pockets within that business. Other players, it's more of a byproduct of more generalized marketing that they do. In some of the retail bank players, I think they go into this space with their own customers that they know well. So I think that it's a more competitive space than I think sometimes urban legend would have it. But that -- Capital One, I think, just has a more unique approach to the business. And one of the striking things I'll mention again about the card business is the major card players have staked out unique strategies for how they play in this business. And relative to most businesses that we're in, I'm struck by the differences in those strategies, and frankly, look around and see a lot of successful players doing smart things given where they are and the bone structure of assets that they have. And it leads to the simultaneous success, I think, of a number of players."

Capital One earned $942 million or $1.69 per share in the second quarter. Excluding adjusting items, earnings per share were $1.76.
Adjusting items in the quarter included a $54 million build in our U.K. Payment Protection insurance customer refund reserve, which was partially offset by a gain on sale of our interest in Visa Europe of $24 million. A slide outlining adjusting items can be found on Page 11 of the slide deck.
Pre-provision earnings decreased 1% on a linked-quarter basis, as higher revenues were offset by higher non-interest expenses. Provision for credit losses increased 4% on a linked-quarter basis, as modestly lower charge-offs were more than offset by a higher linked-quarter allowance build. We have a provided an allowance roll forward by segment, which you can see on Table 8 of our earning supplement.
Let me take a moment to explain the movements in our allowance across our businesses. In our Domestic Card business, we built [ph] $290 million of allowance in the quarter. Two factors drove that increase: Balance growth in the quarter and our expectation of a rising charge-offs associated with Growth Math. Our allowance covers 12 months of losses so as we continue to move through 2016, we are picking up more of the loss increases that we are projecting into 2017. And as we have been saying, based on the credit guidance we have today, we expect allowance builds to continue.
Allowance in our Consumer Banking segment increased $58 million in the quarter. This increase was attributable to our auto business, where we rebuild allowance for new origination that included a higher portion of subprime, and we expect that auto auction prices will decline from current levels.
Lastly, we had a net $50 million build in reserves in our Commercial Banking segment. We built allowance in the quarter to address increased risks in our Taxi Medallion lending business, particularly in Chicago where we have around a $100 million portfolio and Taxi Medallion trading values decreased by about 60% in the quarter.
In our oil and gas portfolio, our allowance for the quarter was essentially flat, but we released $57 million of reserves for unfunded commitments coming out of the spring redetermination process.
Turning to Slide 4, you can see that reported NIM decreased 2 basis points from the first quarter to 6.7%, primarily driven by lower yields on investment securities. Net interest margin increased 17 basis points year-over-year, fueled by strong growth in our Domestic Card business.
Turning to Slide 5, I will discuss capital. Our 2016 CCAR results demonstrate our continued commitment to return capital to shareholders. As previously announced, following the approval of our 2016 CCAR capital plan, our board authorized repurchases of up to 2.5 billion of common stock through the end of the second quarter of 2017. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio on a Basel III standardized basis was 10.9%, which reflects current phase-ins. On a standardized fully phased-in basis, it was 10.8%, and we reduced our net share count by 8.6 million shares in the quarter.
As we continue our parallel run for Basel III advanced approaches, we estimate our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio remains above our 8% target. Given existing and likely changes coming in capital regulations, we no longer believe that advanced approaches will be our long-term constraint. Accordingly, until we exit parallel run for advanced approaches, we plan to only report our standardized approach common equity Tier 1 capital ratio.
Before I turn the call over to Rich, I want to call out that in the third quarter, we expect a onetime rewards expense that will reduce net interchange income by approximately $45 million to $55 million. Our rewards liability has been measured on a slight lag to quarter end. In the third quarter, we expect to complete some system enhancements that will move the rewards liability cut-off to the last day of the quarter, resulting in a onetime increase in rewards costs in the third quarter.
With that, I will turn the call over to Rich."
336241,370625075,1010094,"Capital One Financial Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 21, 2016",2016-07-21,"Earnings Calls","Capital One Financial Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Scott. I'll begin tonight on Slide 7 with our Domestic Card business. Growth of loans and purchase volume remain strong, although growth decelerated modestly. Compared to the second quarter of last year, our ending loans grew $9.6 billion or about",1627,"Thanks, Scott. I'll begin tonight on Slide 7 with our Domestic Card business. Growth of loans and purchase volume remain strong, although growth decelerated modestly. Compared to the second quarter of last year, our ending loans grew $9.6 billion or about 12%. Average loans were up $10.1 billion or about 13%. Second quarter purchase volume increased about 14% from the prior year.
Competition is picking up across the domestic credit card market from the rewards space to subprime. Over time, this can have impact on the growth opportunity and even credit quality in the business. While we always watch vigilantly for these effects, we continue to find attractive growth opportunities in the parts of the market we've been focusing on for some time.
Revenue for the quarter increased 12% from the prior year quarter, slightly lagging average loan growth as revenue margin declined modestly with our exit of the back book of Payment Protection products at the end of the first quarter. Revenue margin for the quarter was 16.6%.
Non-interest expense increased 3% compared to the prior year quarter with higher marketing and growth-related operating expenses as well as continuing digital investments.
Net interchange revenue for the total company increased 9% from the prior year quarter versus the 14% growth in Domestic Card purchase volume. As we've discussed, there is considerable quarterly volatility in the relationship between these 2 metrics. For the past several years, on an annual basis, net interchange growth has been well below Domestic Card purchase volume growth. We'd expect this difference to continue as we originate new rewards customers in our flagship products and extend rewards to existing customers. Additionally, a few of the largest merchants have negotiated custom deals with the card networks. These deals are putting pressure on interchange revenue, and we expect the pressure to continue.
As we've discussed for several quarters, 2 factors are driving our current credit trends and expectations. The first is Growth Math, which is the upward pressure on delinquencies and charge-offs as new loan balances season and become a larger proportion of our overall portfolio. The second is seasonality. Growth Math drove the increase in charge-off rate compared to the second quarter of last year and seasonality drove the improvement in charge-off rate compared to the linked quarter.
Our guidance for Domestic Card charge-off rate remains unchanged. We expect the upward pressure from Growth Math will continue through 2016 and begin to moderate in 2017. We still expect the full year 2016 charge-off rate to be around 4% with quarterly seasonal variability. And while it's still 18 months in the future, based on what we see today and assuming relative stability in consumer behavior, the domestic economy and competitive conditions, we still expect full year 2017 charge-off rate in the low 4s with quarterly seasonal variability.
Our Domestic Card business delivered strong growth in returns in the second quarter, and we really like the business we're booking. While we continue to closely watch the marketplace, we still see attractive growth opportunities in our Domestic Card business.
Slide 8 summarizes second quarter results for the Consumer Banking business. Ending loans were essentially flat compared to the prior year. Growth in auto loans was offset by planned mortgage runoff. Ending deposits were up about $6 billion versus the prior year. Second quarter auto originations were $6.5 billion, about 20% higher compared to the second quarter of last year. Similar to our Domestic Card growth, we like the earnings profile and resilience of the auto business we're booking and continue to believe that true-to-recycle economics of our auto business are attractive. Sustained success in the auto business requires active management of competitive cycles rather than aiming for arbitrary growth or market share targets. Immediately after the Great Recession, we had a unique opportunity in auto that we vigorously pursued. Gradually, it's competition intensified. Some subprime players adopted more aggressive underwriting practices that we chose not to follow. As a result, our subprime originations stayed essentially flat for a few years before shrinking in 2015 despite growth in the subprime market. Our prime originations continued to grow during this period.
In the first half of 2016, these competitive practices seem to have subsided somewhat, which enabled us to grow our subprime originations.
Even though we've had 2 quarters of stronger growth, the auto market and competitive practices remain dynamic. While we see opportunities for growth, we remain very vigilant about our competitor -- about competitor practices. Our underwriting assumes a decline in used car prices. We continue to focus on resilient originations, and we continue to expect a gradual decrease in margins and a gradual increase in charge-offs as the cycle plays out.
Consumer Banking revenue for the quarter decreased modestly from the second quarter of last year. Higher revenue from growth in auto loans and higher deposit volumes was offset by margin compression in auto and planned runoff of mortgage balances. Non-interest expense for the quarter increased 1% compared to the prior year quarter, driven by growth in auto loans and an increase in retail deposit marketing.
As we mentioned last quarter, we've been optimizing both the format and number of branches to better meet the evolving needs of our customers as banking goes digital. In the second quarter, actual charges related to branch moves were about $35 million. Year-to-date, we recognized about $45 million of the $160 million in expected costs for 2016. These costs show up in the other category rather than in the consumer bank segment.
Second quarter provision for credit losses was up from the prior year, primarily driven by additions to the allowance for loan losses for the auto portfolio, which Scott described.
For several quarters, we've said that we expect pressure on our Consumer Banking financial results. We expect the pressure to become more visible in Consumer Banking quarterly results in the second half of the year. In the Home Loans business, planned mortgage runoff continues. In Auto Finance, margins are decreasing and charge-offs are rising modestly, and our deposit business continues to face a prolonged period of low interest rates. We expect that these factors will negatively affect Consumer Banking revenues, efficiency ratio and net income, even as we continue to tightly manage costs.
Moving to Slide 9, I'll discuss our Commercial Banking business. Second quarter ending loan balances increased 29% year-over-year, including the acquisition of the GE Healthcare finance business. Excluding the $8.3 billion of loans acquired from GE, ending loans grew about 13% over the same time period. Average loans increased 27% year-over-year while average deposits increased 3%. Revenue was up 17% from the second quarter of 2015.
Credit pressures continue to be focused in the oil and gas and Taxi Medallion portfolios. Provision for credit losses increased $79 million from the prior year quarter to $128 million as we continued to build reserves. We've been building reserves over the last 6 quarters to reflect increasing risks in oil and gas and Taxi Medallion loans. Criticized and nonperforming loan rates were relatively stable in the quarter. The Commercial Bank criticized loan rate was 5.3% in the second quarter, comprised of the criticized performing loan rate of 3.7% and the criticized nonperforming loan rate of 1.6%.
We continue to focus on managing credit risks and working with our oil and gas customers. As you can see on Slide 10, our total oil and gas loans ended the second quarter at $3.0 billion or about 1.3% of total company loans. Unfunded exposure decreased to $2.7 billion.
We had a net release from the reserves allocated to the oil and gas portfolio, driven by reductions in our unfunded exposures following the spring redetermination process, but we still expect that oil and gas loans will continue to present challenges. At quarter end, approximately $265 million of our total commercial allowance for loan losses was specifically allocated to our oil and gas portfolio. This allowance is about 8.9% of total oil and gas loans. Including unfunded reserves plus allowance, we held $310 million in total reserves allocated to the oil and gas portfolio.
I'll close this evening with some thoughts on second quarter results and our outlook for 2016. We posted another quarter of strong growth in Domestic Card loan balances and purchase volumes as well as growth in auto and commercial loans, driving strong year-over-year growth in revenue and related increases in operating expense, marketing and allowance for loan losses. Non-interest expense increased modestly from the linked quarter, but second quarter non-interest expense remains below our expected run rate for the remaining quarters of 2016 for several reasons. Our businesses continue to grow. We expect about $115 million in branch optimization costs to impact the remainder of 2016, and we expect higher FDIC expenses in the second half of 2016.
Our efficiency ratio guidance is not changing. Compared to 2015, we still expect some improvement in our full year 2016 efficiency ratio with continuing improvement in 2017, excluding adjusting items. We plan to deliver efficiency improvement despite pressure from elevated branch optimization costs, higher FDIC expenses and recent deterioration in market expectations for interest rates. We expect our card growth will create positive operating leverage over time, and we continue to tightly manage costs across our businesses.
The 2016 CCAR process concluded in the quarter. The Federal Reserve did not object to our capital plan, so we expect to maintain our dividend and repurchase $2.5 billion of stock over the next 4 quarters. Bowling up, we continue to be in a strong position to deliver attractive shareholder returns, driven by growth and sustainable returns at the higher end of banks as well as significant capital distribution subject to regulatory approval.
And now Scott, Steve and I will be happy to answer your questions."

We like to explain very much the mechanics of how things work. Growth Math, which on the way up and as growth is increasing, Growth Math works one way and then slowing growth in some ways works the other way. That would impact provisions -- provision expenses directly by reducing the allowance build driven by loan growth. And over time, slower growth could also reduce the pace of Growth Math related to cards overall loss rate by accelerating the point at which the natural seasoning of older growth offsets the Growth Math effects of newer growth. But a lot depends really on the magnitude and mix of the remaining growth. So we are growing at a pretty rapid pace now. So even if growth -- loan growth slows a bit from here, it is still quite a bit of book -- of growth relative to the highly seasoned back book. So you're right about the math. I'm reluctant to pick a peak here because there are a lot of factors involved, but I think that everyone should understand the way Growth Math works and the way it works on as growth accelerates and as growth is big and then it tends to be a good guy as it works through on the other side. But those effects can -- the Growth Math of a particular vintage has most of its impact over the 2 years following that. And then there's really a seasoning from there, and so this is really just the net seasoning math of all the different vintages and the size of those."

So -- look, we always -- as credit people, we are always worriers, right? So we have -- the auto business is a classic business that -- I mean, we really like the business but we need to have our eyes very wide open about where we are in the credit cycle, which may or may not be the very same thing as in the economic cycle and we have to act accordingly. So at the top of our worry list is underwriting practices because that not only affects volumes as we pulled back, but it also can so quickly make its way into credit quality. And not only for those doing those practices, but it can have ripple effects on the industry. So at the top of our list, the concern has been competitive practices, and we have flagged, particularly in the subprime area, some concern about that. That, as I mentioned, is actually -- looks like it's mitigating somewhat. I don't want to declare victory on that but that's a positive here. We'll keep an eye on that. The next thing is just the amount of supply out there. And from the amazingly low levels of supply a few years ago, this has been a very natural return to more and more supply in the industry. And you can see every year, there is a little bit more out there and more competition, and that's why over time, margins have gone down. And so far we feel good that some of the most critical things like LTV have stayed -- haven't gotten affected yet. A lot of the pricing -- a lot of the impact has been more on the pricing that affects margins. And then -- so that's kind of the competitive side. And then as we've mentioned for quite a long time, we've got to remember the collateral value side of this thing. And the fact that used car prices have been at record levels for a long time is certainly a matter of concern. And we said pretty much there's only one way for them to go from here. Interesting, if you look at the Manheim index, that is pretty flat. May be ticking down a little bit. We have our own recovery index on our own business and that has been actually declining for really for the last couple of years, which an interesting point, well, why would our recovery index be disconnected a little bit from the Manheim index? I think that is -- that's a little more about our mix is a little different from Manheim's mix, the Manheim mix. It has -- the Manheim mix has a higher proportion of larger vehicles. They have been increasing in price. Lately, prices for smaller vehicles have been declining. And on a relative basis, we have more of a mix of smaller cars and fewer trucks basically than the Manheim index overall. So I think we see more of that effect than the industry does. But the main point is I think the only way from here is down. We underwrite to an assumption that this thing is coming down right away. How it actually plays out, we'll have to see. I don't think we've got any like scenario, modeling quantitative to share with you, but I think you're focusing on the right concerns in the business."

And that's why -- and along the way, too, explain to you how Growth Math works. But I want to pull up on this. I found over the many years in building Capital One that just about anything that's really value creating involves digging a hole before the benefits come. If it weren't that way, everybody would rush in and do it and actually would kill the opportunity. And we have many, many, many years of experience in studying credit and understanding how value gets created over time by origination. And -- but the key is very solid underwriting, incredibly rigorous, what I call horizontal accounting so one understands the full vintage economics and how those -- how they perform over time. And then finally, helping our investors along the way to understand what comes with that journey. And we -- but if we pull way up at this very time when there's credit losses are going up, allowance is being built, we feel great about the business that we are booking. We're incredibly happy that we've had the growth opportunity for the period of time that we have. We know competition is increasing, but we're still pretty bullish that we can get some continuing growth opportunities. And I think this is -- can be a real value creator for our investors."

So I start with we are very bullish with our growth opportunity. It is a factual matter that the growth rate is down over some of the highs over the last couple of quarters on a year-over-year basis, but we're continuing to have pretty significant, and to us, very attractive growth. But we are very obsessive about how competition works. So many -- so often people always talk about, well, what's the economy doing and how big is the opportunity? Number  one in our list is how does the -- what is the nature of the competitive environment? And that, of course, in its most of first order effect affects growth itself. So it is noteworthy that competition from reward, all the way down to subprime despite sometimes protestation of folks that they don't do subprime, there is an increase. And in fact, the actual growth rate in subprime by our tally industry is actually higher than in prime. So there is -- and you can see in the overall revolving debt numbers, growth is up. So all of the things being equal, that increases the challenge with respect to our own growth rate. So again, we've created some, I think, pretty unique opportunities, and we like the value that we're offering customers, the customer experience and we feel good about that opportunity. The second thing, and I made the same point last quarter and I make it so often, is when there's a very natural -- what we're seeing here is a very natural part of how the competitive cycle works. But increased growth over time tends to make its way into credit metrics in the industry as well. All of us -- this is an industry where all of us share a lot of the same customers. So it is a natural part of the cycle that when you have sustained competition, typically we tend to see on a delayed basis that, that makes its way into industry credit metrics. And then the thing even more worrisome that we look for and we have not seen this is sort of at the next stage in cycles do people actually start really compromising their underwriting standards, and that becomes something that is kind of at the next level in how these cycles evolve. So we feel great about the opportunity. It's not lost on us That the competition has increased and industry growth is up. And we will watch incredibly vigilantly. We will continue to pursue this growth window because we're very focused on windows of opportunity as a company. We believe in this window. We will continue to pursue it with our eyes wide open, and that's kind of how we operate at Capital One."

This is a creeping increase in competition. It is -- it's primarily by the biggest players in the business who, in fact, definitionally [ph] dominate the business. So you've seen some increased competition in the rewards space. You've seen some competitors strengthened some of their rewards proposition, value propositions, just volume. There's actually been people stepping up and announcing they're going to step up some of their marketing. And finally, we can see it in just in the -- in some of the growth numbers across the segment. I would also point out in the -- that there is sort of pulling back beyond sort of credit cards or auto for that matter. There continues to be growth in other forms of consumer credit like installment loans and student loans. So that's part of the supply equation as well. But this is something that we just give -- where you give a continuing description about this phenomenon because over time, that -- these things affect the business.

And that means that the rate of allowance growth in those periods is going to be more than the loan growth all else being equal. And as Rich mentioned, there is going to be a point where you start to see the Growth Math effects moderate. And at that point, we would expect that relationship to change, but we do expect that we're going to continue to see fluctuations in the allowance quarter-to-quarter. I really do appreciate that modeling that thing is tough. I'm going to give you a very blunt hypothetical example that a 10 basis point move in loss rate, which can easily happen not be anything more than noise, can trigger a $90 million allowance change.

So you're not trying to be difficult, totally understand the genesis of the question but over the last 18 months, as we knew this was going to be a real consideration, we really deliberately try to talk about the 3 or 4 factors that drive our allowance.

And then if you have lower new originations, then you have a higher percentage of the back book relative to the front book compared to what you otherwise would have.

A bigger and bigger percentage of our book has actually been recently originated. So Growth Math will be with us in terms of the how losses go up. That's going to be with us through the -- I mean, that's not going to suddenly turn around. But I think that what I like so much about this is that the coiled spring of economic value for which we are paying upfront through higher -- through allowance build and a loss curve that is frontloaded, that, that coils the spring of value creation in the business and in an industry that doesn't have that many of those kind of opportunities. And this is in many ways really the payoff for the information-based strategy that we invested for years. And I'd also point out to that we're a company that -- well, a lot of companies look around and say, ""What's the next thing we can buy."" We are a company that is designed to, has an origination-based company, where can we really massively test and find growth opportunities that really pay off in the long term and work with our investors to understand the journey of how the performance actually plays out. But the payoff is not going to come in the near term by credit losses turning around and going down. This is, over the longer term, each vintage will peak and actually go down, and there's a continuing dividend that will be paid over time. But right now this is the period of rising losses and Growth Math on the way up."

This is Scott's first earnings call as a CFO, and he'll continue to be a key leader in our investor communications.
Scott brings tremendous experience, expertise and insight to Capital One. He has been our Controller since March 2011 and our Principal Accounting Officer since July 2011. Prior to joining Capital One, Scott held various executive positions at Fannie Mae, and he has more than 20 years of experience in consulting and public accounting, including an appointment to the SEC as a professional accounting fellow and as a partner with KPMG.
And now I'll turn the call over to Scott."

I'll begin tonight with Slide 3. Capital One earned $942 million or $1.69 per share in the second quarter. Excluding Adjusting items, earnings per share were $1.76.Adjusting items in the quarter included a $54 million build in our U.K. Pay",678,"Thanks, Rich. I'll begin tonight with Slide 3. Capital One earned $942 million or $1.69 per share in the second quarter. Excluding Adjusting items, earnings per share were $1.76.
Adjusting items in the quarter included a $54 million build in our U.K. Payment Protection Insurance customer refund reserve, which was partially offset by a gain on sale of our interest in Visa Europe of $24 million. A slide outlining Adjusting items can be found on Page 11 of the slide deck.
Pre-provision earnings decreased 1% on a linked-quarter basis as higher revenues were offset by higher non-interest expenses. Provision for credit losses increased 4% on a linked-quarter basis as modestly lower charge-offs were more than offset by a higher linked-quarter allowance build. We have provided an allowance roll forward by segment, which you can see on Table 8 of our earnings supplement.
Let me take a moment to explain the movements in our allowance across our businesses. In our Domestic Card business, we built $290 million of allowance in the quarter. Two factors drove that increase: balanced growth in the quarter and our expectation of rising charge-offs associated with Growth Math. Our allowance covers 12 months of losses. So as we continue to move through 2016, we are picking up more of the loss increases that we are projecting into 2017. And as we have been saying, based on the credit guidance we have today, we expect allowance builds to continue.
Allowance in our Consumer Banking segment increased $58 million in the quarter. This increase was attributable to our auto business, where we build allowance for new originations that included a higher portion of subprime, and we expect that auto auction prices will decline from current levels.
Lastly, we had a net $50 million build in reserves in our Commercial Banking segment. We built allowance in the quarter to address increased risks in our Taxi Medallion lending business, particularly in Chicago where we have around a $100 million portfolio and Taxi Medallion trading values decreased by about 60% in the quarter.
In our oil and gas portfolio, our allowance for the quarter was essentially flat, but we released $57 million of reserves for unfunded commitments coming out of the spring redetermination process.
Turning to Slide 4. You can see that reported NIM decreased 2 basis points from the first quarter to 6.7%, primarily driven by lower yields on investment securities. Net interest margin increased 17 basis points year-over-year, fueled by strong growth in our Domestic Card business.
Turning to Slide 5. I will discuss capital. Our 2016 CCAR results demonstrate our continued commitment to return capital to shareholders. As previously announced, following the approval of our 2016 CCAR capital plan, our board authorized repurchases of up to 2.5 billion of common stock through the end of the second quarter of 2017. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio on a Basel III Standardized basis was 10.9%, which reflects current phase-ins. On a standardized fully phased-in basis, it was 10.8%. And we reduced our net share count by 8.6 million shares in the quarter.
As we continue our parallel run for Basel III Advanced Approaches, we estimate our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio remains above our 8% target. Given existing and likely changes coming in capital regulations, we no longer believe that Advanced Approaches will be our long-term constraint. Accordingly, until we exit parallel run for Advanced Approaches, we plan to only report our Standardized Approach common equity Tier 1 capital ratio.
Before I turn the call over to Rich, I want to call out that in the third quarter, we expect a onetime rewards expense that will reduce net interchange income by approximately $45 million to $55 million. Our rewards liability has been measured on a slight lag to quarter-end. In the third quarter, we expect to complete some system enhancements that will move the rewards liability cut-off to the last day of the quarter, resulting in a onetime increase in rewards costs in the third quarter.
With that, I will turn the call over to Rich."
336241,370625075,1010208,"Capital One Financial Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 21, 2016",2016-07-21,"Earnings Calls","Capital One Financial Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Scott. I'll begin tonight on Slide 7 with our Domestic Card business. Growth of loans and purchase volume remained strong, although growth decelerated modestly. Compared to the second quarter of last year, our ending loans grew $9.6 billion or abo",1626,"Thanks, Scott. I'll begin tonight on Slide 7 with our Domestic Card business. Growth of loans and purchase volume remained strong, although growth decelerated modestly. Compared to the second quarter of last year, our ending loans grew $9.6 billion or about 12%. Average loans were up $10.1 billion or about 13%. Second quarter purchase volume increased about 14% from the prior year.
Competition is picking up across the domestic credit card market from the rewards space to subprime. Over time, this can have impact on the growth opportunity and even credit quality in the business. While we always watch vigilantly for these effects, we continue to find attractive growth opportunities in the parts of the market we've been focusing on for some time.
Revenue for the quarter increased 12% from the prior year quarter, slightly lagging average loan growth as revenue margin declined modestly with our exit of the back book of Payment Protection products at the end of the first quarter. Revenue margin for the quarter was 16.6%.
Non-interest expense increased 3% compared to the prior year quarter with higher marketing and growth-related operating expenses as well as continuing digital investments.
Net interchange revenue for the total company increased 9% from the prior year quarter versus the 14% growth in Domestic Card purchase volume. As we've discussed, there is considerable quarterly volatility in the relationship between these 2 metrics. For the past several years, on an annual basis, net interchange growth has been well below Domestic Card purchase volume growth. We'd expect this difference to continue as we originate new rewards customers in our flagship products and extend rewards to existing customers. Additionally, a few of the largest merchants have negotiated custom deals with the card networks. These deals are putting pressure on interchange revenue, and we expect the pressure to continue.
As we've discussed for several quarters, 2 factors are driving our current credit trends and expectations. The first is Growth Math, which is the upward pressure on delinquencies and charge-offs as new loan balances season and become a larger proportion of our overall portfolio. The second is seasonality. Growth Math drove the increase in charge-off rate compared to the second quarter of last year, and seasonality drove the improvement in charge-off rate compared to the linked quarter.
Our guidance for Domestic Card charge-off rate remains unchanged. We expect the upward pressure from Growth Math will continue through 2016 and begin to moderate in 2017. We still expect the full year 2016 charge-off rate to be around 4% with quarterly seasonal variability. And while it's still 18 months in the future, based on what we see today and assuming relative stability in consumer behavior, the domestic economy and competitive conditions, we still expect full year 2017 charge-off rate in the low 4s with quarterly seasonal variability.
Our Domestic Card business delivered strong growth in returns in the second quarter, and we really like the business we're booking. While we continue to closely watch the marketplace, we still see attractive growth opportunities in our Domestic Card business.
Slide 8 summarizes second quarter results for the Consumer Banking business. Ending loans were essentially flat compared to the prior year. Growth in auto loans was offset by planned mortgage runoff. Ending deposits were up about $6 billion versus the prior year. Second quarter auto originations were $6.5 billion, about 20% higher compared to the second quarter of last year. Similar to our Domestic Card growth, we like the earnings profile and resilience of the auto business we're booking and continue to believe that through-the-cycle economics of our auto business are attractive.
Sustained success in the auto business requires active management of competitive cycles rather than aiming for arbitrary growth or market share targets. Immediately after the Great Recession, we had a unique opportunity in auto that we've vigorously pursued. Gradually, as competition intensified, some subprime players adopted more aggressive underwriting practices that we chose not to follow. As a result, our subprime originations stayed essentially flat for a few years before shrinking in 2015 despite growth in the subprime market. Our prime originations continued to grow during this period. In the first half of 2016, these competitive practices seem to have subsided somewhat, which enabled us to grow our subprime originations.
Even though we've had 2 quarters of stronger growth, the auto market and competitive practices remained dynamic. While we see opportunities for growth, we remained very vigilant about our competitor -- about competitor practices. Our underwriting assumes a decline in used car prices. We continue to focus on resilient originations, and we continue to expect a gradual decrease in margins and a gradual increase in charge-offs as the cycle plays out.
Consumer Banking revenue for the quarter decreased modestly from the second quarter of last year. Higher revenue from growth in auto loans and higher deposit volumes was offset by margin compression in auto and planned runoff of mortgage balances. Non-interest expense for the quarter increased 1% compared to the prior year quarter, driven by growth in auto loans and an increase in retail deposit marketing.
As we mentioned last quarter, we've been optimizing both the format and number of branches to better meet the evolving needs of our customers as banking goes digital. In the second quarter, actual charges related to branch moves were about $35 million. Year-to-date, we recognized about $45 million of the $160 million in expected costs for 2016. These costs show up in the other category rather than in the Consumer Bank segment.
Second quarter provision for credit losses was up from the prior year, primarily driven by additions to the allowance for loan losses for the auto portfolio, which Scott described.
For several quarters, we've said that we expect pressure on our Consumer Banking financial results. We expect the pressure to become more visible in Consumer Banking quarterly results in the second half of the year. In the Home Loans business, planned mortgage runoff continues. In Auto Finance, margins are decreasing and charge-offs are rising modestly. And our deposit business continues to face a prolonged period of low interest rates. We expect that these factors will negatively affect Consumer Banking revenues, efficiency ratio and net income, even as we continue to tightly manage costs.
Moving to Slide 9. I'll discuss our Commercial Banking business. Second quarter ending loan balances increased 29% year-over-year, including the acquisition of the GE Healthcare finance business. Excluding the $8.3 billion of loans acquired from GE, ending loans grew about 13% over the same time period. Average loans increased 27% year-over-year, while average deposits increased 3%. Revenue was up 17% from the second quarter of 2015.
Credit pressures continue to be focused in the oil and gas and Taxi Medallion portfolios. Provision for credit losses increased $79 million from the prior year quarter to $128 million as we continued to build reserves. We've been building reserves over the last 6 quarters to reflect increasing risks in oil and gas and Taxi Medallion loans. Criticized and nonperforming loan rates were relatively stable in the quarter. The Commercial Bank criticized loan rate was 5.3% in the second quarter, comprised of the criticized performing loan rate of 3.7% and the criticized nonperforming loan rate of 1.6%.
We continue to focus on managing credit risk and working with our oil and gas customers. As you can see on Slide 10, our total oil and gas loans ended the second quarter at $3.0 billion or about 1.3% of total company loans. Unfunded exposure decreased to $2.7 billion.
We had a net release from the reserves allocated to the oil and gas portfolio, driven by reductions in our unfunded exposures following the spring redetermination process, but we still expect that oil and gas loans will continue to present challenges. At quarter-end, approximately $265 million of our total commercial allowance for loan losses was specifically allocated to our oil and gas portfolio. This allowance is about 8.9% of total oil and gas loans. Including unfunded reserves plus allowance, we held $310 million in total reserves allocated to the oil and gas portfolio.
I'll close this evening with some thoughts on second quarter results and our outlook for 2016. We posted another quarter of strong growth in Domestic Card loan balances and purchase volumes as well as growth in auto and commercial loans, driving strong year-over-year growth in revenue and related increases in operating expense, marketing and allowance for loan losses. Non-interest expense increased modestly from the linked quarter, but second quarter non-interest expense remains below our expected run rate for the remaining quarters of 2016 for several reasons. Our businesses continue to grow. We expect about $115 million in branch optimization costs to impact the remainder of 2016, and we expect higher FDIC expenses in the second half of 2016.
Our efficiency ratio guidance is not changing. Compared to 2015, we still expect some improvement in our full year 2016 efficiency ratio with continuing improvement in 2017, excluding Adjusting items. We plan to deliver efficiency improvement despite pressure from elevated branch optimization costs, higher FDIC expenses and recent deterioration in market expectations for interest rates. We expect our card growth will create positive operating leverage over time, and we continue to tightly manage costs across our businesses.
The 2016 CCAR process concluded in the quarter. The Federal Reserve did not object to our capital plan, so we expect to maintain our dividend and repurchase $2.5 billion of stock over the next 4 quarters. Bowling up, we continue to be in a strong position to deliver attractive shareholder returns, driven by growth and sustainable returns at the higher end of banks as well as significant capital distribution subject to regulatory approval.
And now Scott, Steve and I will be happy to answer your questions."

So I'm just trying to understand. If let's just say loan growth would remain steady or even decelerate from here, given the way that the book seasons, how far out is it going to take for charge-offs to peak? And then related to that, when would you actually expect provisions from Growth Math to actually peak?"

We like to explain very much the mechanics of how things work. Growth Math, which -- on the way up and as growth is increasing, Growth Math works one way and then slowing growth in some ways works the other way. That would impact provisions -- provision expenses directly by reducing the allowance build driven by loan growth. And over time, slower growth could also reduce the pace of Growth Math related to cards overall loss rate by accelerating the point at which the natural seasoning of older growth offsets the Growth Math effects of newer growth. But a lot depends really on the magnitude and mix of the remaining growth. So we are growing at a pretty rapid pace now. So even if growth -- loan growth slows a bit from here, it is still quite a bit of book -- of growth relative to the highly seasoned back book. So you're right about the math. I'm reluctant to pick a peak here because there are a lot of factors involved, but I think that everyone should understand the way Growth Math works and the way it works on the -- as growth accelerates and as growth is big, and then it tends to be a good guy as it works through on the other side. But those effects can -- the Growth Math of a particular vintage has most of its impact over the 2 years following that. And then there's really a seasoning from there. And so this is really just the net seasoning math of all the different vintages and the size of those."

So look, we always -- as credit people, we are always worriers, right? And so we have -- and the auto business is a classic business that -- I mean, we really like the business, but we need to have our eyes very wide open about where we are in the credit cycle, which may or may not be the very same thing as in the economic cycle, and we have to act accordingly. So at the top of our worry list is underwriting practices because that not only affects volumes as we pull back, but it also can so quickly make its way into credit quality. And not only for those doing those practices, but it can have ripple effects on the industry. So at the top of our list, the concern has been competitor practices. And we have flagged, particularly in the subprime area, some concern about that. That, as I mentioned, is actually -- looks like it's mitigating somewhat. I don't want to declare victory on that, but that's a positive here. We'll keep an eye on that. The next thing is just the amount of supply out there. And from the amazingly low levels of supply a few years ago, this has been a very natural return to more and more supply in the industry. And you can see every year, there is a little bit more out there and more competition, and that's why over time, margins have gone down. And so far, we feel good that some of the most critical things like LTV have stayed -- haven't gotten affected yet. A lot of the pricing -- a lot of the impact has been more on the pricing that affects margins. And then -- so that's kind of the competitive side of it. And then as we mentioned for quite a long time, we've got to remember the collateral value side of this thing. And the fact that used car prices have been at record levels for a long time is certainly a matter of concern. And we said pretty much there's only one way for them to go from here. Interestingly, if you look at the Manheim Index, that is pretty flat, maybe ticking down a little bit. We have our own recovery index on our own business, and that has been actually declining for really for the last couple of years, which -- interesting point, well, why would our recovery index be disconnected a little bit from the Manheim Index? I think that is -- that's a little bit more about our mix is a little different from Manheim's mix. The Manheim mix has -- the Manheim mix has a higher proportion of larger vehicles. They have been increasing in price. Lately, prices for smaller vehicles have been declining. And on a relative basis, we have more of a mix of smaller cars and fewer trucks basically than the Manheim Index overall. So I think we see more of that effect than the industry does. But the main point is I think the only way from here is down. We underwrite to an assumption that this thing is coming down right away. How it actually plays out, we'll have to see. I don't think we've got any, like, scenario modeling quantitatively to share with you, but I think you're focusing on the right concerns in the business."

And the way we looked at it is that -- and why we stepped out of character a little bit to provide guidance farther out into future is that we were moving into a period where 2 things were true. One is that we were growing at a pretty rapid rate and expected to continue to do that, which has, in fact, turned out to be the case. And it comes off of just a -- you probably won't see it again in your years of following this industry in terms of how seasoned and recession sort of survived the existing back book is. And so the impact of all of that led us to feel it was important to give a sense of where, with lots of other things being equal, Growth Math would take our credit. And that's why -- and along the way, too, explain to you how Growth Math works. But I want to pull up on this. I found over the many years in building Capital One that just about anything that's really value creating involves digging a hole before the benefits come. If it weren't that way, everybody would rush in and do it and they actually would kill the opportunity. And we have many, many, many years of experience in studying credit and understanding how value gets created over time by origination. And -- but the key is very solid underwriting, incredibly rigorous, what I call horizontal accounting, so one understands the full vintage economics and how those -- how they perform over time, and then finally, helping our investors along the way to understand what comes with that journey. And we -- but if we pull way up at this very time when there's -- credit losses are going up, allowance is being built, we feel great about the business that we are booking. We're incredibly happy that we've had the growth opportunity for the period of time that we have. We know competition is increasing, but we're still pretty bullish that we can get some continuing growth opportunities. And I think this is -- can be a real value creator for our investors."

So I start with we are very bullish about our growth opportunity. It is a factual matter that the growth rate is down over some of the highs of the last couple of quarters on a year-over-year basis, but we're continuing to have pretty significant, and to us, very attractive growth. But we are very obsessive about how competition works. So many -- so often people always talk about, well, what's the economy doing and how big is the opportunity? Number  one in our list is how does the -- what is the nature of the competitive environment? And that, of course, in its most of first order effect, affects growth itself. And so it is noteworthy that competition from reward, all the way down to subprime despite sometimes protestations of folks that they don't do subprime, there is an increase. And in fact, the actual growth rate in subprime by our tally industry is actually higher than in prime. So there is -- and you can see in the overall revolving debt numbers, growth is up. So all other things being equal, that increases the challenge with respect to our own growth rate. But again, we've created some, I think, pretty unique opportunities. And we like the value that we're offering customers, the customer experience, and we feel good about that opportunity. The second thing, and I made the same point last quarter and I make it so often, is when there's a very natural -- what we're seeing here is a very natural part of how the competitive cycle works. But increased growth over time tends to make its way into credit metrics in the industry as well. All of us -- this is an industry where all of us share a lot of the same customers. So it is a natural part of the cycle that when you have sustained competition typically, we tend to see on a delayed basis that, that makes its way into industry credit metrics. And then the thing even more worrisome that we look for, and we have not seen this, is sort of at the next stage in cycles do people actually start really compromising their underwriting standards. And that becomes something that is kind of at the next level in how these cycles evolve. So we feel great about the opportunity. It's not lost on us that the competition has increased and industry growth is up. And we will watch incredibly vigilantly. We will continue to pursue this growth window because we're very focused on windows of opportunity as a company. We believe in this window. We will continue to pursue it with our eyes wide open, and that's kind of how we operate at Capital One."

So you've seen some increased competition in the rewards space. You've seen some competitors strengthened some of their rewards proposition, value propositions, just volume. There's actually been people stepping up and announcing they're going to step up some of their marketing. And finally, we can see it in -- just in the -- in some of the growth numbers across the segment. I would also point out in the -- that there is sort of pulling back beyond sort of credit cards or auto for that matter. There continues to be growth in other forms of consumer credit like installment loans and student loans. So that's part of the supply equation as well.

A bigger and bigger percentage of our book has actually been recently originated. So Growth Math will be with us in terms of the -- how losses go up. That's going to be with us through the -- I mean, that's not going to suddenly turn around. But I think that what I like so much about this is the coiled spring of economic value for which we are paying upfront through higher -- through allowance build and a loss curve that is front-loaded that, that coils the spring of value creation in a business and in an industry that doesn't have that many of those kind of opportunities. And this is, in many ways, really the payoff for the information-based strategy where we invested for years. And I'd also point out, too, that we're a company that -- while a lot of companies look around and say, ""What's the next thing we can buy,"" we are a company that is designed to -- has an origination-based company, where can we really massively test and find growth opportunities that really pay off in the long term and work with our investors to understand the journey of how the performance actually plays out. But the payoff is not going to come in the near term by credit losses turning around and going down. This is -- over the longer term, each vintage will peak and actually go down, and there's a continuing dividend that will be paid over time. But right now, this is the period of rising losses and Growth Math on the way up."

I'll begin tonight with Slide 3. Capital One earned $942 million or $1.69 per share in the second quarter. Excluding Adjusting items, earnings per share were $1.76.Adjusting items in the quarter included a $54 million build in our U.K. Pay",679,"Thanks, Rich. I'll begin tonight with Slide 3. Capital One earned $942 million or $1.69 per share in the second quarter. Excluding Adjusting items, earnings per share were $1.76.
Adjusting items in the quarter included a $54 million build in our U.K. Payment Protection Insurance customer refund reserve, which was partially offset by a gain on sale of our interest in Visa Europe of $24 million. A slide outlining Adjusting items can be found on Page 11 of the slide deck.
Pre-provision earnings decreased 1% on a linked-quarter basis as higher revenues were offset by higher non-interest expenses. Provision for credit losses increased 4% on a linked-quarter basis as modestly lower charge-offs were more than offset by a higher linked-quarter allowance build. We have provided an allowance roll forward by segment, which you can see on Table 8 of our earnings supplement.
Let me take a moment to explain the movements in our allowance across our businesses. In our Domestic Card business, we built $290 million of allowance in the quarter. Two factors drove that increase: balanced growth in the quarter and our expectation of rising charge-offs associated with Growth Math. Our allowance covers 12 months of losses. So as we continue to move through 2016, we are picking up more of the loss increases that we are projecting into 2017. And as we have been saying, based on the credit guidance we have today, we expect allowance builds to continue.
Allowance in our Consumer Banking segment increased $58 million in the quarter. This increase was attributable to our auto business, where we built allowance for new originations that included a higher portion of subprime, and we expect that auto auction prices will decline from current levels.
Lastly, we had a net $50 million build in reserves in our Commercial Banking segment. We built allowance in the quarter to address increased risks in our Taxi Medallion lending business, particularly in Chicago where we have around a $100 million portfolio and Taxi Medallion trading values decreased by about 60% in the quarter.
In our oil and gas portfolio, our allowance for the quarter was essentially flat, but we released $57 million of reserves for unfunded commitments coming out of the spring redetermination process.
Turning to Slide 4. You can see that reported NIM decreased 2 basis points from the first quarter to 6.7%, primarily driven by lower yields on investment securities. Net interest margin increased 17 basis points year-over-year, fueled by strong growth in our Domestic Card business.
Turning to Slide 5. I will discuss capital. Our 2016 CCAR results demonstrate our continued commitment to return capital to shareholders. As previously announced, following the approval of our 2016 CCAR capital plan, our board authorized repurchases of up to 2.5 billion of common stock through the end of the second quarter of 2017. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio on a Basel III Standardized basis was 10.9%, which reflects current phase-ins. On a standardized fully phased-in basis, it was 10.8%. And we reduced our net share count by 8.6 million shares in the quarter.
As we continue our parallel run for Basel III Advanced Approaches, we estimate our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio remains above our 8% target. Given existing and likely changes coming in capital regulations, we no longer believe that Advanced Approaches will be our long-term constraint. Accordingly, until we exit parallel run for [ph] Advanced Approaches, we plan to only report our Standardized Approach common equity Tier 1 capital ratio.
Before I turn the call over to Rich, I want to call out that in the third quarter, we expect a onetime rewards expense that will reduce net interchange income by approximately $45 million to $55 million. Our rewards liability has been measured on a slight lag to quarter-end. In the third quarter, we expect to complete some system enhancements that will move the rewards liability cut-off to the last day of the quarter, resulting in a onetime increase in rewards costs in the third quarter.
With that, I will turn the call over to Rich."
336241,370625075,1010353,"Capital One Financial Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 21, 2016",2016-07-21,"Earnings Calls","Capital One Financial Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Scott. I'll begin tonight on Slide 7 with our Domestic Card business. Growth of loans and purchase volume remained strong, although growth decelerated modestly. Compared to the second quarter of last year, our ending loans grew $9.6 billion or abo",1627,"Thanks, Scott. I'll begin tonight on Slide 7 with our Domestic Card business. Growth of loans and purchase volume remained strong, although growth decelerated modestly. Compared to the second quarter of last year, our ending loans grew $9.6 billion or about 12%. Average loans were up $10.1 billion or about 13%. Second quarter purchase volume increased about 14% from the prior year.
Competition is picking up across the domestic credit card market from the rewards space to subprime. Over time, this can have impact on the growth opportunity and even credit quality in the business. While we always watch vigilantly for these effects, we continue to find attractive growth opportunities in the parts of the market we've been focusing on for some time.
Revenue for the quarter increased 12% from the prior year quarter, slightly lagging average loan growth as revenue margin declined modestly with our exit of the back book of Payment Protection products at the end of the first quarter. Revenue margin for the quarter was 16.6%.
Non-interest expense increased 3% compared to the prior year quarter with higher marketing and growth-related operating expenses as well as continuing digital investments.
Net interchange revenue for the total company increased 9% from the prior year quarter versus the 14% growth in Domestic Card purchase volume. As we've discussed, there is considerable quarterly volatility in the relationship between these 2 metrics. For the past several years, on an annual basis, net interchange growth has been well below Domestic Card purchase volume growth. We'd expect this difference to continue as we originate new rewards customers in our flagship products and extend rewards to existing customers. Additionally, a few of the largest merchants have negotiated custom deals with the card networks. These deals are putting pressure on interchange revenue, and we expect the pressure to continue.
As we've discussed for several quarters, 2 factors are driving our current credit trends and expectations. The first is Growth Math, which is the upward pressure on delinquencies and charge-offs as new loan balances season and become a larger proportion of our overall portfolio. The second is seasonality. Growth Math drove the increase in charge-off rate compared to the second quarter of last year, and seasonality drove the improvement in charge-off rate compared to the linked quarter.
Our guidance for Domestic Card charge-off rate remains unchanged. We expect the upward pressure from Growth Math will continue through 2016 and begin to moderate in 2017. We still expect the full year 2016 charge-off rate to be around 4% with quarterly seasonal variability. And while it's still 18 months in the future, based on what we see today and assuming relative stability in consumer behavior, the domestic economy and competitive conditions, we still expect full year 2017 charge-off rate in the low 4s with quarterly seasonal variability.
Our Domestic Card business delivered strong growth in returns in the second quarter, and we really like the business we're booking. While we continue to closely watch the marketplace, we still see attractive growth opportunities in our Domestic Card business.
Slide 8 summarizes second quarter results for the Consumer Banking business. Ending loans were essentially flat compared to the prior year. Growth in auto loans was offset by planned mortgage runoff. Ending deposits were up about $6 billion versus the prior year. Second quarter auto originations were $6.5 billion, about 20% higher compared to the second quarter of last year. Similar to our Domestic Card growth, we like the earnings profile and resilience of the auto business we're booking and continue to believe that through-the-cycle economics of our auto business are attractive.
Sustained success in the auto business requires active management of competitive cycles rather than aiming for arbitrary growth or market share targets. Immediately after the Great Recession, we had a unique opportunity in auto that we've vigorously pursued. Gradually, as competition intensified, some subprime players adopted more aggressive underwriting practices that we chose not to follow. As a result, our subprime originations stayed essentially flat for a few years before shrinking in 2015 despite growth in the subprime market. Our prime originations continued to grow during this period. In the first half of 2016, these competitive practices seem to have subsided somewhat, which enabled us to grow our subprime originations.
Even though we've had 2 quarters of stronger growth, the auto market and competitive practices remained dynamic. While we see opportunities for growth, we remained very vigilant about our competitor -- about competitor practices. Our underwriting assumes a decline in used car prices. We continue to focus on resilient originations, and we continue to expect a gradual decrease in margins and a gradual increase in charge-offs as this cycle plays out.
Consumer Banking revenue for the quarter decreased modestly from the second quarter of last year. Higher revenue from growth in auto loans and higher deposit volumes was offset by margin compression in auto and planned runoff of mortgage balances. Non-interest expense for the quarter increased 1% compared to the prior year quarter, driven by growth in auto loans and an increase in retail deposit marketing.
As we mentioned last quarter, we've been optimizing both the format and number of branches to better meet the evolving needs of our customers as banking goes digital. In the second quarter, actual charges related to branch moves were about $35 million. Year-to-date, we've recognized about $45 million of the $160 million in expected costs for 2016. These costs show up in the other category rather than in the Consumer Bank segment.
Second quarter provision for credit losses was up from the prior year, primarily driven by additions to the allowance for loan losses for the auto portfolio, which Scott described.
For several quarters, we've said that we expect pressure on our Consumer Banking financial results. We expect the pressure to become more visible in Consumer Banking quarterly results in the second half of the year. In the Home Loans business, planned mortgage runoff continues. In Auto Finance, margins are decreasing and charge-offs are rising modestly. And our deposit business continues to face a prolonged period of low interest rates. We expect that these factors will negatively affect Consumer Banking revenues, efficiency ratio and net income, even as we continue to tightly manage costs.
Moving to Slide 9. I'll discuss our Commercial Banking business. Second quarter ending loan balances increased 29% year-over-year, including the acquisition of the GE Healthcare finance business. Excluding the $8.3 billion of loans acquired from GE, ending loans grew about 13% over the same time period. Average loans increased 27% year-over-year, while average deposits increased 3%. Revenue was up 17% from the second quarter of 2015.
Credit pressures continue to be focused in the oil and gas and Taxi Medallion portfolios. Provision for credit losses increased $79 million from the prior year quarter to $128 million as we continued to build reserves. We've been building reserves over the last 6 quarters to reflect increasing risk in oil and gas and Taxi Medallion loans. Criticized and nonperforming loan rates were relatively stable in the quarter. The Commercial Bank criticized loan rate was 5.3% in the second quarter, comprised of the criticized performing loan rate of 3.7% and the criticized nonperforming loan rate of 1.6%.
We continue to focus on managing credit risk and working with our oil and gas customers. As you can see on Slide 10, our total oil and gas loans ended the second quarter at $3.0 billion or about 1.3% of total company loans. Unfunded exposure decreased to $2.7 billion.
We had a net release from the reserves allocated to the oil and gas portfolio, driven by reductions in our unfunded exposures following the spring redetermination process, but we still expect that oil and gas loans will continue to present challenges. At quarter-end, approximately $265 million of our total commercial allowance for loan losses was specifically allocated to our oil and gas portfolio. This allowance is about 8.9% of total oil and gas loans. Including unfunded reserves plus allowance, we held $310 million in total reserves allocated to the oil and gas portfolio.
I'll close this evening with some thoughts on second quarter results and our outlook for 2016. We posted another quarter of strong growth in Domestic Card loan balances and purchase volumes as well as growth in auto and commercial loans, driving strong year-over-year growth in revenue and related increases in operating expense, marketing and allowance for loan losses. Non-interest expense increased modestly from the linked quarter, but second quarter non-interest expense remains below our expected run rate for the remaining quarters of 2016 for several reasons. Our businesses continue to grow. We expect about $115 million in branch optimization costs to impact the remainder of 2016, and we expect higher FDIC expenses in the second half of 2016.
Our efficiency ratio guidance is not changing. Compared to 2015, we still expect some improvement in our full year 2016 efficiency ratio with continuing improvement in 2017, excluding Adjusting items. We plan to deliver efficiency improvement despite pressure from elevated branch optimization costs, higher FDIC expenses and recent deterioration in market expectations for interest rates. We expect our card growth will create positive operating leverage over time, and we continue to tightly manage costs across our businesses.
The 2016 CCAR process concluded in the quarter. The Federal Reserve did not object to our capital plan, so we expect to maintain our dividend and repurchase $2.5 billion of stock over the next 4 quarters. Bowling up [ph], we continue to be in a strong position to deliver attractive shareholder returns, driven by growth and sustainable returns at the higher end of banks as well as significant capital distribution subject to regulatory approval.
And now Scott, Steve and I will be happy to answer your questions."

We like to explain very much the mechanics of how things work. Growth Math, which -- on the way up and as growth is increasing, Growth Math works one way and then slowing growth, it, in some ways, works the other way. That would impact provisions -- provision expenses directly by reducing the allowance build driven by loan growth. And over time, slower growth could also reduce the pace of Growth Math related to cards overall loss rate by accelerating the point at which the natural seasoning of older growth offsets the Growth Math effects of newer growth. But a lot depends really on the magnitude and mix of the remaining growth. So we are growing at a pretty rapid pace now. So even if growth -- loan growth slows a bit from here, it is still quite a bit of book -- of growth relative to the highly seasoned back book. So you're right about the math. I'm reluctant to pick a peak here because there are a lot of factors involved, but I think that everyone should understand the way Growth Math works and the way it works on the -- as growth accelerates and as growth is big, and then it tends to be a good guy as it works through on the other side. But those effects can -- the Growth Math of a particular vintage has most of its impact over the 2 years following that. And then there's really a seasoning from there. And so this is really just the net seasoning math of all the different vintages and the size of those."

So look, we always -- as credit people, we are always worriers, right? And so we have -- and the auto business is a classic business that -- I mean, we really like the business, but we need to have our eyes very wide open about where we are in the credit cycle, which may or may not be the very same thing as in the economic cycle, and we have to act accordingly. So at the top of our worry list is underwriting practices because that not only affects volumes as we pull back, but it also can so quickly make its way into credit quality. And not only for those doing those practices, but it can have ripple effects on the industry. So at the top of our list of concerns has been competitor practices. And we have flagged, particularly in the subprime area, some concern about that. That, as I mentioned, is actually -- looks like it's mitigating somewhat. I don't want to declare victory on that, but that's a positive here. We'll keep an eye on that. The next thing is just the amount of supply out there. And from the amazingly low levels of supply a few years ago, this has been a very natural return to more and more supply in the industry. And you can see every year, there is a little bit more out there and more competition, and that's why over time, margins have gone down. And so far, we feel good that some of the most critical things like LTV have stayed -- haven't gotten affected yet. A lot of the pricing -- a lot of the impact has been more on the pricing that affects margins. And then -- so that's kind of the competitive side of it. And then as we mentioned for quite a long time, we've got to remember the collateral value side of this thing. And the fact that used car prices have been at record levels for a long time is certainly a matter of concern. And we said pretty much there's only one way for them to go from here. Interestingly, if you look at the Manheim Index, that is pretty flat, maybe ticking down a little bit. We have our own recovery index on our own business, and that has been actually declining for really for the last couple of years, which -- interesting point, well, why would our recovery index be disconnected a little bit from the Manheim Index? I think that is -- that's a little bit more about our mix is a little different from Manheim's mix. The Manheim mix has a higher proportion of larger vehicles. They have been increasing in price. Lately, prices for smaller vehicles have been declining. And on a relative basis, we have more of a mix of smaller cars and fewer trucks basically than the Manheim Index overall. So I think we see more of that effect than the industry does. But the main point is I think the only way from here is down. We underwrite to an assumption that this thing is coming down right away. How it actually plays out, we'll have to see. I don't think we've got any, like, scenario modeling quantitatively to share with you, but I think you're focusing on the right concerns in the business."

One is that we were growing at a pretty rapid rate and expected to continue to do that, which has, in fact, turned out to be the case. And it comes off of just a -- you probably won't see it again in your years of following this industry in terms of how season and recession sort of survived the existing back book is. And so the impact of all of that led us to feel it was important to give a sense of where, with lots of other things being equal, Growth Math would take our credit. And that's why -- and along the way, too, explain to you how Growth Math works. But I want to pull up on this. I found over the many years in building Capital One that just about anything that's really value creating involves digging a hole before the benefits come. If it weren't that way, everybody would rush in and do it and actually we would kill the opportunity. And we have many, many, many years of experience in studying credit and understanding how value gets created over time by origination. And -- but the key is very solid underwriting, incredibly rigorous, what I call horizontal accounting, so one understands the full vintage economics and how those -- how they perform over time, and then finally, helping our investors along the way to understand what comes with that journey. And we -- but if we pull way up at this very time when there's -- credit losses are going up, allowance is being built, we feel great about the business that we are booking. We're incredibly happy that we've had the growth opportunity for the period of time that we have. We know competition is increasing, but we're still pretty bullish that we can get some continuing growth opportunities. And I think this is -- can be a real value creator for our investors."

So I start with we are very bullish about our growth opportunity. It is a factual matter that the growth rate is down over some of the highs of the last couple of quarters on a year-over-year basis, but we're continuing to have pretty significant, and to us, very attractive growth. But we are very obsessive about how competition works. So many -- so often people always talk about, well, what's the economy doing and how big is the opportunity? #1 on our list is how does the -- what is the nature of the competitive environment? And that, of course, in its most of first order effect, affects growth itself. And so it is noteworthy that competition from rewards, all the way down to subprime, despite sometimes protestations of folks that they don't do subprime, there is an increase. And in fact, the actual growth rate in subprime by our tally industry is actually higher than in prime. So there is -- and you can see in the overall revolving debt numbers, growth is up. So all other things being equal, that increases the challenge with respect to our own growth rate. But again, we've created some, I think, pretty unique opportunities. And we like the value that we're offering customers, the customer experience, and we feel good about that opportunity. The second thing, and I made the same point last quarter and I make it so often, is when there's a very natural -- what we're seeing here is a very natural part of how the competitive cycle works. But increased growth over time tends to make its way into credit metrics in the industry as well. All of us -- this is an industry where all of us share a lot of the same customers. So it is a natural part of the cycle that when you have sustained competition typically, we tend to see on a delayed basis that, that makes its way into industry credit metrics. And then the thing even more worrisome that we look for, and we have not seen this, is sort of at the next stage in cycles, do people actually start really compromising their underwriting standards. And that becomes something that is kind of at the next level in how these cycles evolve. So we feel great about the opportunity. It's not lost on us that the competition has increased and industry growth is up. And we will watch incredibly vigilantly. We will continue to pursue this growth window because we're very focused on windows of opportunity as a company. We believe in this window. We will continue to pursue it with our eyes wide open, and that's kind of how we operate at Capital One."

This is a creeping increase in competition. It is -- it's primarily by the biggest players in the business who, in fact, definitionally dominate the business. So you've seen some increased competition in the rewards space. You've seen some competitors strengthen some of their rewards proposition, value propositions, just volume. There's actually been people stepping up and announcing they're going to step up some of their marketing. And finally, we can see it in -- just in the -- in some of the growth numbers across the segment. I would also point out in the -- that there is sort of pulling back beyond sort of credit cards or auto for that matter. There continues to be growth in other forms of consumer credit like installment loans and student loans. So that's part of the supply equation as well.

I really believe in the business, and I think that we are incredibly bullish about the opportunity in this business and the long-term economics in the business. I think we have wanted to point out that over a multiyear period, there is this migration that has gone on."

And then there are those of us on this side who seem to be getting wrong the reserve build. And with what seems like relative stability in the charge-offs, right, you're talking about charge-offs that average a little more than 4% for the first half and you're saying pretty much that for the full year, so not a big change in the next couple of quarters and then low 4s after that, so really not -- doesn't sound like there's a big change in that.

But we do expect that we're going to continue to see fluctuations in the allowance quarter-to-quarter. I really do appreciate that modeling that thing is tough. And I'm just going to give you a very blunt hypothetical example, that a 10 basis point move in loss rate, which can easily happen, not be anything more than noise, can trigger a $90 million allowance change.

But over the last 18 months, as we knew this was going to be a real consideration, we really deliberately tried to talk about the 3 or 4 factors that drive our allowance, and actually, as Rich said earlier, despite the discomfort, stepped out and went even further trying to predict loss rates in 2017 just to give people a sense as to the fact that there weren't any surprises here.

That's going to be with us through the -- I mean, that's not going to suddenly turn around. But I think that what I like so much about this is the coiled spring of economic value for which we are paying upfront through higher -- through allowance build and a loss curve that is front-loaded that, that coils the spring of value creation in a business and in an industry that doesn't have that many of those kind of opportunities. And this is, in many ways, really the payoff for the information-based strategy where we invested for years. And I'd also point out, too, that we're a company that -- while a lot of companies look around and say, ""What's the next thing we can buy,"" we are a company that is designed to -- has an origination-based company, where can we really massively test and find growth opportunities that really pay off in the long term and work with our investors to understand the journey of how the performance actually plays out. But the payoff is not going to come in the near term by credit losses turning around and going down. This is -- over the longer term, each vintage will peak and actually go down, and there's a continuing dividend that will be paid over time. But right now, this is the period of rising losses and Growth Math on the way up."

Capital One earned $942 million or $1.69 per share in the second quarter. Excluding Adjusting items, earnings per share were $1.76.
Adjusting items in the quarter included a $54 million build in our U.K. Payment Protection Insurance customer refund reserve, which was partially offset by a gain on sale of our interest in Visa Europe of $24 million. A slide outlining Adjusting items can be found on Page 11 of the slide deck.
Pre-provision earnings decreased 1% on a linked-quarter basis as higher revenues were offset by higher non-interest expenses. Provision for credit losses increased 4% on a linked-quarter basis as modestly lower charge-offs were more than offset by a higher linked-quarter allowance build. We have provided an allowance roll forward by segment, which you can see on Table 8 of our earnings supplement.
Let me take a moment to explain the movements in our allowance across our businesses. In our Domestic Card business, we built $290 million of allowance in the quarter. Two factors drove that increase: balanced growth in the quarter and our expectation of rising charge-offs associated with Growth Math. Our allowance covers 12 months of losses. So as we continue to move through 2016, we are picking up more of the loss increases that we are projecting into 2017. And as we have been saying, based on the credit guidance we have today, we expect allowance builds to continue.
Allowance in our Consumer Banking segment increased $58 million in the quarter. This increase was attributable to our auto business, where we built allowance for new originations that included a higher portion of subprime, and we expect that auto auction prices will decline from current levels.
Lastly, we had a net $50 million build in reserves in our Commercial Banking segment. We built allowance in the quarter to address increased risks in our Taxi Medallion lending business, particularly in Chicago where we have around a $100 million portfolio and Taxi Medallion trading values decreased by about 60% in the quarter.
In our oil and gas portfolio, our allowance for the quarter was essentially flat, but we released $57 million of reserves for unfunded commitments coming out of the spring redetermination process.
Turning to Slide 4. You can see that reported NIM decreased 2 basis points from the first quarter to 6.7%, primarily driven by lower yields on investment securities. Net interest margin increased 17 basis points year-over-year, fueled by strong growth in our Domestic Card business.
Turning to Slide 5. I will discuss capital. Our 2016 CCAR results demonstrate our continued commitment to return capital to shareholders. As previously announced, following the approval of our 2016 CCAR capital plan, our board authorized repurchases of up to 2.5 billion of common stock through the end of the second quarter of 2017. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio on a Basel III Standardized basis was 10.9%, which reflects current phase-ins. On a standardized fully phased-in basis, it was 10.8%. And we reduced our net share count by 8.6 million shares in the quarter.
As we continue our parallel run for Basel III Advanced Approaches, we estimate our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio remains above our 8% target. Given existing and likely changes coming in capital regulations, we no longer believe that Advanced Approaches will be our long-term constraint. Accordingly, until we exit parallel run for [ph] Advanced Approaches, we plan to only report our Standardized Approach common equity Tier 1 capital ratio.
Before I turn the call over to Rich, I want to call out that in the third quarter, we expect a onetime rewards expense that will reduce net interchange income by approximately $45 million to $55 million. Our rewards liability has been measured on a slight lag to quarter-end. In the third quarter, we expect to complete some system enhancements that will move the rewards liability cut-off to the last day of the quarter, resulting in a onetime increase in rewards costs in the third quarter.
With that, I will turn the call over to Rich."
336241,370625075,1010632,"Capital One Financial Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 21, 2016",2016-07-21,"Earnings Calls","Capital One Financial Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Scott. I'll begin tonight on Slide 7 with our Domestic Card business. Growth of loans and purchase volume remained strong, although growth decelerated modestly. Compared to the second quarter of last year, our ending loans grew $9.6 billion or abo",1627,"Thanks, Scott. I'll begin tonight on Slide 7 with our Domestic Card business. Growth of loans and purchase volume remained strong, although growth decelerated modestly. Compared to the second quarter of last year, our ending loans grew $9.6 billion or about 12%. Average loans were up $10.1 billion or about 13%. Second quarter purchase volume increased about 14% from the prior year.
Competition is picking up across the domestic credit card market from the rewards space to subprime. Over time, this can have impact on the growth opportunity and even credit quality in the business. While we always watch vigilantly for these effects, we continue to find attractive growth opportunities in the parts of the market we've been focusing on for some time.
Revenue for the quarter increased 12% from the prior year quarter, slightly lagging average loan growth as revenue margin declined modestly with our exit of the back book of Payment Protection products at the end of the first quarter. Revenue margin for the quarter was 16.6%.
Non-interest expense increased 3% compared to the prior year quarter with higher marketing and growth-related operating expenses as well as continuing digital investments.
Net interchange revenue for the total company increased 9% from the prior year quarter versus the 14% growth in Domestic Card purchase volume. As we've discussed, there is considerable quarterly volatility in the relationship between these 2 metrics. For the past several years, on an annual basis, net interchange growth has been well below Domestic Card purchase volume growth. We'd expect this difference to continue as we originate new rewards customers in our flagship products and extend rewards to existing customers. Additionally, a few of the largest merchants have negotiated custom deals with the card networks. These deals are putting pressure on interchange revenue, and we expect the pressure to continue.
As we've discussed for several quarters, 2 factors are driving our current credit trends and expectations. The first is Growth Math, which is the upward pressure on delinquencies and charge-offs as new loan balances season and become a larger proportion of our overall portfolio. The second is seasonality. Growth Math drove the increase in charge-off rate compared to the second quarter of last year, and seasonality drove the improvement in charge-off rate compared to the linked quarter.
Our guidance for Domestic Card charge-off rate remains unchanged. We expect the upward pressure from Growth Math will continue through 2016 and begin to moderate in 2017. We still expect the full year 2016 charge-off rate to be around 4% with quarterly seasonal variability. And while it's still 18 months in the future, based on what we see today and assuming relative stability in consumer behavior, the domestic economy and competitive conditions, we still expect full year 2017 charge-off rate in the low 4s with quarterly seasonal variability.
Our Domestic Card business delivered strong growth in returns in the second quarter, and we really like the business we're booking. While we continue to closely watch the marketplace, we still see attractive growth opportunities in our Domestic Card business.
Slide 8 summarizes second quarter results for the Consumer Banking business. Ending loans were essentially flat compared to the prior year. Growth in auto loans was offset by planned mortgage runoff. Ending deposits were up about $6 billion versus the prior year. Second quarter auto originations were $6.5 billion, about 20% higher compared to the second quarter of last year. Similar to our Domestic Card growth, we like the earnings profile and resilience of the auto business we're booking and continue to believe that through-the-cycle economics of our auto business are attractive.
Sustained success in the auto business requires active management of competitive cycles rather than aiming for arbitrary growth or market share targets. Immediately after the Great Recession, we had a unique opportunity in auto that we've vigorously pursued. Gradually, as competition intensified, some subprime players adopted more aggressive underwriting practices that we chose not to follow. As a result, our subprime originations stayed essentially flat for a few years before shrinking in 2015 despite growth in the subprime market. Our prime originations continued to grow during this period. In the first half of 2016, these competitive practices seem to have subsided somewhat, which enabled us to grow our subprime originations.
Even though we've had 2 quarters of stronger growth, the auto market and competitive practices remained dynamic. While we see opportunities for growth, we remained very vigilant about our competitor -- about competitor practices. Our underwriting assumes a decline in used car prices. We continue to focus on resilient originations, and we continue to expect a gradual decrease in margins and a gradual increase in charge-offs as this cycle plays out.
Consumer Banking revenue for the quarter decreased modestly from the second quarter of last year. Higher revenue from growth in auto loans and higher deposit volumes was offset by margin compression in auto and planned runoff of mortgage balances. Non-interest expense for the quarter increased 1% compared to the prior year quarter, driven by growth in auto loans and an increase in retail deposit marketing.
As we mentioned last quarter, we've been optimizing both the format and number of branches to better meet the evolving needs of our customers as banking goes digital. In the second quarter, actual charges related to branch moves were about $35 million. Year-to-date, we've recognized about $45 million of the $160 million in expected costs for 2016. These costs show up in the other category rather than in the Consumer Bank segment.
Second quarter provision for credit losses was up from the prior year, primarily driven by additions to the allowance for loan losses for the auto portfolio, which Scott described.
For several quarters, we've said that we expect pressure on our Consumer Banking financial results. We expect the pressure to become more visible in Consumer Banking quarterly results in the second half of the year. In the Home Loans business, planned mortgage runoff continues. In Auto Finance, margins are decreasing and charge-offs are rising modestly. And our deposit business continues to face a prolonged period of low interest rates. We expect that these factors will negatively affect Consumer Banking revenues, efficiency ratio and net income, even as we continue to tightly manage costs.
Moving to Slide 9. I'll discuss our Commercial Banking business. Second quarter ending loan balances increased 29% year-over-year, including the acquisition of the GE Healthcare finance business. Excluding the $8.3 billion of loans acquired from GE, ending loans grew about 13% over the same time period. Average loans increased 27% year-over-year, while average deposits increased 3%. Revenue was up 17% from the second quarter of 2015.
Credit pressures continue to be focused in the oil and gas and Taxi Medallion portfolios. Provision for credit losses increased $79 million from the prior year quarter to $128 million as we continued to build reserves. We've been building reserves over the last 6 quarters to reflect increasing risk in oil and gas and Taxi Medallion loans. Criticized and nonperforming loan rates were relatively stable in the quarter. The Commercial Bank criticized loan rate was 5.3% in the second quarter, comprised of the criticized performing loan rate of 3.7% and the criticized nonperforming loan rate of 1.6%.
We continue to focus on managing credit risk and working with our oil and gas customers. As you can see on Slide 10, our total oil and gas loans ended the second quarter at $3.0 billion or about 1.3% of total company loans. Unfunded exposure decreased to $2.7 billion.
We had a net release from the reserves allocated to the oil and gas portfolio, driven by reductions in our unfunded exposures following the spring redetermination process, but we still expect that oil and gas loans will continue to present challenges. At quarter-end, approximately $265 million of our total commercial allowance for loan losses was specifically allocated to our oil and gas portfolio. This allowance is about 8.9% of total oil and gas loans. Including unfunded reserves plus allowance, we held $310 million in total reserves allocated to the oil and gas portfolio.
I'll close this evening with some thoughts on second quarter results and our outlook for 2016. We posted another quarter of strong growth in Domestic Card loan balances and purchase volumes as well as growth in auto and commercial loans, driving strong year-over-year growth in revenue and related increases in operating expense, marketing and allowance for loan losses. Non-interest expense increased modestly from the linked quarter, but second quarter non-interest expense remains below our expected run rate for the remaining quarters of 2016 for several reasons. Our businesses continue to grow. We expect about $115 million in branch optimization costs to impact the remainder of 2016, and we expect higher FDIC expenses in the second half of 2016.
Our efficiency ratio guidance is not changing. Compared to 2015, we still expect some improvement in our full year 2016 efficiency ratio with continuing improvement in 2017, excluding Adjusting items. We plan to deliver efficiency improvement despite pressure from elevated branch optimization costs, higher FDIC expenses and recent deterioration in market expectations for interest rates. We expect our card growth will create positive operating leverage over time, and we continue to tightly manage costs across our businesses.
The 2016 CCAR process concluded in the quarter. The Federal Reserve did not object to our capital plan, so we expect to maintain our dividend and repurchase $2.5 billion of stock over the next 4 quarters. Bowling up [ph], we continue to be in a strong position to deliver attractive shareholder returns, driven by growth and sustainable returns at the higher end of banks as well as significant capital distribution subject to regulatory approval.
And now Scott, Steve and I will be happy to answer your questions."

So I'm just trying to understand. If let's just say loan growth would remain steady or even decelerate from here, given the way that the book seasons, how far out is it going to take for charge-offs to peak?

We like to explain very much the mechanics of how things work. Growth Math, which -- on the way up and as growth is increasing, Growth Math works one way and then slowing growth, it, in some ways, works the other way. That would impact provisions -- provision expenses directly by reducing the allowance build driven by loan growth. And over time, slower growth could also reduce the pace of Growth Math related to cards overall loss rate by accelerating the point at which the natural seasoning of older growth offsets the Growth Math effects of newer growth. But a lot depends really on the magnitude and mix of the remaining growth. So we are growing at a pretty rapid pace now. So even if growth -- loan growth slows a bit from here, it is still quite a bit of book -- of growth relative to the highly seasoned back book. So you're right about the math. I'm reluctant to pick a peak here because there are a lot of factors involved, but I think that everyone should understand the way Growth Math works and the way it works on the -- as growth accelerates and as growth is big, and then it tends to be a good guy as it works through on the other side. But those effects can -- the Growth Math of a particular vintage has most of its impact over the 2 years following that. And then there's really a seasoning from there. And so this is really just the net seasoning math of all the different vintages and the size of those."

So look, we always -- as credit people, we are always worriers, right? And so we have -- and the auto business is a classic business that -- I mean, we really like the business, but we need to have our eyes very wide open about where we are in the credit cycle, which may or may not be the very same thing as in the economic cycle, and we have to act accordingly. So at the top of our worry list is underwriting practices because that not only affects volumes as we pull back, but it also can so quickly make its way into credit quality. And not only for those doing those practices, but it can have ripple effects on the industry. So at the top of our list of concerns has been competitor practices. And we have flagged, particularly in the subprime area, some concern about that. That, as I mentioned, is actually -- looks like it's mitigating somewhat. I don't want to declare victory on that, but that's a positive here. We'll keep an eye on that. The next thing is just the amount of supply out there. And from the amazingly low levels of supply a few years ago, this has been a very natural return to more and more supply in the industry. And you can see every year, there is a little bit more out there and more competition, and that's why over time, margins have gone down. And so far, we feel good that some of the most critical things like LTV have stayed -- haven't gotten affected yet. A lot of the pricing -- a lot of the impact has been more on the pricing that affects margins. And then -- so that's kind of the competitive side of it. And then as we mentioned for quite a long time, we've got to remember the collateral value side of this thing. And the fact that used car prices have been at record levels for a long time is certainly a matter of concern. And we said pretty much there's only one way for them to go from here. Interestingly, if you look at the Manheim Index, that is pretty flat, maybe ticking down a little bit. We have our own recovery index on our own business, and that has been actually declining for really for the last couple of years, which -- interesting point, well, why would our recovery index be disconnected a little bit from the Manheim Index? I think that is -- that's a little bit more about our mix is a little different from Manheim's mix. The Manheim mix has a higher proportion of larger vehicles. They have been increasing in price. Lately, prices for smaller vehicles have been declining. And on a relative basis, we have more of a mix of smaller cars and fewer trucks basically than the Manheim Index overall. So I think we see more of that effect than the industry does. But the main point is I think the only way from here is down. We underwrite to an assumption that this thing is coming down right away. How it actually plays out, we'll have to see. I don't think we've got any, like, scenario modeling quantitatively to share with you, but I think you're focusing on the right concerns in the business."

And that's why -- and along the way, too, explain to you how Growth Math works. But I want to pull up on this. I found over the many years in building Capital One that just about anything that's really value creating involves digging a hole before the benefits come. If it weren't that way, everybody would rush in and do it and actually we would kill the opportunity. And we have many, many, many years of experience in studying credit and understanding how value gets created over time by origination. And -- but the key is very solid underwriting, incredibly rigorous, what I call horizontal accounting, so one understands the full vintage economics and how those -- how they perform over time, and then finally, helping our investors along the way to understand what comes with that journey. And we -- but if we pull way up at this very time when there's -- credit losses are going up, allowance is being built, we feel great about the business that we are booking. We're incredibly happy that we've had the growth opportunity for the period of time that we have.

So I start with we are very bullish about our growth opportunity. It is a factual matter that the growth rate is down over some of the highs of the last couple of quarters on a year-over-year basis, but we're continuing to have pretty significant, and to us, very attractive growth. But we are very obsessive about how competition works. So many -- so often people always talk about, well, what's the economy doing and how big is the opportunity? #1 on our list is how does the -- what is the nature of the competitive environment? And that, of course, in its most of first order effect, affects growth itself. And so it is noteworthy that competition from rewards, all the way down to subprime, despite sometimes protestations of folks that they don't do subprime, there is an increase. And in fact, the actual growth rate in subprime by our tally industry is actually higher than in prime. So there is -- and you can see in the overall revolving debt numbers, growth is up. So all other things being equal, that increases the challenge with respect to our own growth rate. But again, we've created some, I think, pretty unique opportunities. And we like the value that we're offering customers, the customer experience, and we feel good about that opportunity. The second thing, and I made the same point last quarter and I make it so often, is when there's a very natural -- what we're seeing here is a very natural part of how the competitive cycle works. But increased growth over time tends to make its way into credit metrics in the industry as well. All of us -- this is an industry where all of us share a lot of the same customers. So it is a natural part of the cycle that when you have sustained competition typically, we tend to see on a delayed basis that, that makes its way into industry credit metrics. And then the thing even more worrisome that we look for, and we have not seen this, is sort of at the next stage in cycles, do people actually start really compromising their underwriting standards. And that becomes something that is kind of at the next level in how these cycles evolve. So we feel great about the opportunity. It's not lost on us that the competition has increased and industry growth is up. And we will watch incredibly vigilantly. We will continue to pursue this growth window because we're very focused on windows of opportunity as a company. We believe in this window. We will continue to pursue it with our eyes wide open, and that's kind of how we operate at Capital One."

This is a creeping increase in competition. It is -- it's primarily by the biggest players in the business who, in fact, definitionally dominate the business. So you've seen some increased competition in the rewards space. You've seen some competitors strengthen some of their rewards proposition, value propositions, just volume. There's actually been people stepping up and announcing they're going to step up some of their marketing. And finally, we can see it in -- just in the -- in some of the growth numbers across the segment. I would also point out in the -- that there is sort of pulling back beyond sort of credit cards or auto for that matter. There continues to be growth in other forms of consumer credit like installment loans and student loans. So that's part of the supply equation as well. But this is something that we're just give -- we give a continuing description about this phenomenon because over time, that -- these things affect the business.

But over the last 18 months, as we knew this was going to be a real consideration, we really deliberately tried to talk about the 3 or 4 factors that drive our allowance, and actually, as Rich said earlier, despite the discomfort, stepped out and went even further trying to predict loss rates in 2017 just to give people a sense as to the fact that there weren't any surprises here.

And then if you have lower new originations, then you have a higher percentage of the back book relative to the front book compared to what you otherwise would have.

A bigger and bigger percentage of our book has actually been recently originated. So Growth Math will be with us in terms of the -- how losses go up. That's going to be with us through the -- I mean, that's not going to suddenly turn around. But I think that what I like so much about this is the coiled spring of economic value for which we are paying upfront through higher -- through allowance build and a loss curve that is front-loaded that, that coils the spring of value creation in a business and in an industry that doesn't have that many of those kind of opportunities. And this is, in many ways, really the payoff for the information-based strategy where we invested for years. And I'd also point out, too, that we're a company that -- while a lot of companies look around and say, ""What's the next thing we can buy,"" we are a company that is designed to -- has an origination-based company, where can we really massively test and find growth opportunities that really pay off in the long term and work with our investors to understand the journey of how the performance actually plays out. But the payoff is not going to come in the near term by credit losses turning around and going down. This is -- over the longer term, each vintage will peak and actually go down, and there's a continuing dividend that will be paid over time. But right now, this is the period of rising losses and Growth Math on the way up."

Compared to the third quarter of last year, our ending loans grew $8.8 billion or about 11%. A",1473,"Thanks, Jeff, and good evening, everyone. I'll begin tonight on Slide 4 with our Domestic Card business. Loan growth and purchase volume growth remained strong. Compared to the third quarter of last year, our ending loans grew $8.8 billion or about 11%. Average loans were up $9.4 billion or about 12%. Third quarter purchase volume increased about 12% from the prior year. We continue to like the return and resilience profile of the business we're booking.
In the quarter, we also announced that we entered into an agreement for a new partnership with Cabela's and the acquisition of Cabela's co-branded card portfolio, which has roughly $5.2 billion in outstandings. The agreement is subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing condition. Cabela's is a great retailer with a powerful brand highly -- and highly engaged and loyal customers.
Revenue for the quarter increased 8% from the prior year quarter, slightly lagging average loan growth. Even with the positive margin impacts of higher subprime mix, revenue margin declined year-over-year, as expected, with our exit of the back book of Payment Protection products at the end of the first quarter. Revenue margin for the third quarter was 16.6%.
Non-interest expense increased 4% compared to the prior year quarter. Our Domestic Card business continues to gain scale and improve efficiency. Net interchange revenue for the total company grew 9% from the prior year quarter versus the 12% growth in Domestic Card purchase volume. As we've discussed, there is considerable quarterly volatility in the relationship between these 2 metrics. For the past several years, on an annual basis, net interchange growth has been well below Domestic Card purchase volume growth. We'd expect this difference to continue as we originate new rewards customers in our flagship products and extend rewards to existing customers.
Additionally, a few of the larger -- largest merchants have negotiated custom deals with the card networks. These deals are putting pressure on interchange revenue, and we expect the pressure to continue.
As we've discussed for several quarters, the dominant driver of year-over-year charge-off rate trends is Growth Math, which is the upward pressure on delinquencies and charge-offs as new loan balances in our front books season and become a larger proportion of our overall portfolio relative to the older and highly seasoned back book. Growth Math began to impact charge-off rates in 2015. We still expect the peak impact of Growth Math in terms of its contribution to year-over-year change in our loss rate to be in 2016, with the diminishing effect in 2017 and only a modest effect beyond that.
In the third quarter, Growth Math drove the increase in charge-off rate compared to the prior year, and seasonality drove the improvement in charge-off rate compared to the linked quarter.
Looking ahead, 2 effects are together moderately impacting our charge-off outlooks since last quarter. One effect is better-than-expected growth, especially in subprime. While we are growing nicely everywhere we are investing, we are seeing particular success in subprime, which has raised the mix modestly. Our proportion of loans below FICO 6 60 [ph] has grown from 35% 1 quarter ago to 36% at the end of the third quarter. Subprime has higher losses than average and they're also more frontloaded so it tends to have a pretty immediate impact on our near-term credit metrics. 
Beyond the growth and mix effect, we have revised slightly upward our front book loss expectations for 2017 and slightly downward our front book loss expectations for 2018 based on the composite performance and projections for a hundreds of credit programs. These effects together lead us to raise our full year 2017 charge-off guidance from the low 4s to the mid-4s with normal seasonal variability and excluding the modest benefit we expect from adding the Cabela's portfolio. With 9 months of actual results in the books, we expect 2016 full year charge-off rate will be around 4.15%. 
We expect the changes in guidance to largely play out over the next 3 or 4 quarters, so the expected impact of higher charge-offs is mostly captured in our current allowance. While we are modestly raising our loss outlook for 2017, our internal view of 2018 losses is unchanged, with slightly improved expectations for front book performance offsetting higher subprime mix.
Pulling up, the higher growth in subprime mix are also driving up our revenues and pre-provision earnings. We continue to see attractive growth opportunities in our Domestic Card business, but it's clear this opportunity won't last forever. The marketplace is moving and competitive intensity across the card business remains high, and revolving credit growth is now 6% year-over-year. We will continue to monitor the marketplace diligently. But in the meantime, we continue to like the opportunities that we see.
Slide 5 summarizes third quarter results for our Consumer Banking business. Ending loans grew about 2% compared to the prior year. Growth in auto loans was partially offset by planned mortgage runoff. Ending deposits were up about $8 billion or 5% versus the prior year. Third quarter auto originations were $6.8 billion, about 22% higher compared to the third quarter of last year with strong growth in prime, near prime and subprime.
Similar to our Domestic Card growth, we like the earnings profile and resilience of the auto business we're booking and continue to believe that through the cycle economics of our auto business are attractive. The auto market and competitive prices remained dynamic. While we see opportunities for growth, we remain very vigilant about competitor practice. Our underwriting assumes a decline in used car prices. We continue to focus on resilient origination, and we continue to expect a gradual decrease in margins and a gradual increase in charge-offs as the cycle plays out.
Consumer Banking revenue for the quarter increased about 3% from the third quarter of last year. Higher revenue from growth in auto loans and higher deposit volumes was partially offset by margin compression in auto and planned runoff of mortgage balances. 
Non-interest expense for the quarter also increased 3% compared to the prior year quarter, driven by growth in auto loans and an increase in retail deposit marketing.
As we've discussed in prior quarters, we've been optimizing both the format and number of branches to better meet the evolving needs of our customers as banking goes digital. In the third quarter, actual changes related to branch moves were about $60 million. Year-to-date, we recognized about $106 million of the $160 million in expected costs for 2016. We expect branch optimization costs to continue in 2017. These costs show up in the other category rather than in the Consumer Banking segment.
Third quarter provision for credit losses was up from the prior year, primarily as the result of charge-offs in addition to the allowance for loan losses for the auto portfolio. Growth in auto loans, the expectation of gradually rising auto charge-off rates and the expectation of declining used vehicle values drove the trend in Consumer Banking provision for credit losses.
For several quarters, we've said that we expect pressure on our Consumer Banking financial results. In the home loans business, planned mortgage runoff continues. In auto finance, margins are decreasing and charge-offs are rising modestly and our deposit businesses continue to face a prolonged period of low interest rate. We expect that these factors will negatively affect Consumer Banking revenues, efficiency ratio and net income even as we continue to tightly manage costs.
Moving to Slide 6. I'll discuss our Commercial Banking business. Third quarter ending loan balances increased 28% year-over-year, including the acquisition of the GE Healthcare finance business. Excluding the $8.3 billion of loans acquired from GE, ending loans grew about 12% over the same time period.
Average loans increased 28% year-over-year while average deposits increased 2%. Revenue was up 27% from the third quarter of 2015. Credit pressures continue to be focused in the oil and gas and Taxi Medallion portfolios. We've provided summaries of loans, exposures, reserves and other metrics for these portfolios on Slide 14 and 15.
For the total Commercial Banking business, third quarter charge-offs were $108 million, primarily driven by charge-offs impact of Chicago Taxi Medallion loans, and to a lesser extent, oil and gas loans. The charge-off rate for the quarter was 66 basis points. We added to reserves for some third quarter weakness in New York City Taxi Medallion values, but the reserve additions only partially offset the charge-offs flowing out of reserves, resulting in a net reserve release in the quarter. Combining both charge-offs and reserve changes, provision for credit losses declined $14 million from the prior year quarter to $61 million. Criticized and nonperforming loan rates were relatively stable in the quarter. The criticized performing loan rate for the quarter was 3.7%, and the criticized nonperforming loan rate was 1.5%.
Now I'll pass the call over to Scott."

Capital One earned $1 billion or $1.90 a share in the third quarter. Excluding adjusting items, earnings per share was $2.03. Adjusting items in the quarter included a 61 -- $63 million build in our U.K. Payment Protection Insurance customer refund reserve, of which $47 million was an offset to revenue and $16 million was captured in operating expenses. A slide outlining adjusting items can be found on Page 12 of the slide deck.
Pre-provision earnings increased modestly on a linked-quarter basis as higher revenues were only partially offset by higher non-interest expenses. As I highlighted last quarter, we had a onetime rewards expense that reduced net interchange income by $38 million, driven by the completion of some system enhancements that moved our rewards liability cutoff to the last day of the quarter. Provision for credit losses was flat on a linked-quarter basis as higher charge-offs were almost entirely offset by a lower linked-quarter allowance build. An allowance rolled forward by segment can be found on Table 8 of our earnings supplement.
Let me take a moment to explain the movements in our allowance across businesses in the quarter.
In our Domestic Card business, we built $349 million of allowance. This build was driven by growth and subprime mix in the quarter and incorporating our charge-off expectations for the next 12 months into our allowance calculation.
In our Consumer Banking segment, allowance increased $31 million in the quarter, almost entirely driven by growth in our auto business. 
In our Commercial Banking segment, we had a $48 million reduction in reserves, driven by charge-offs in our Taxi Medallion portfolio. Recent reserve movements have focused on taxi and our oil and gas portfolios, and we have provided details for those portfolios on slides 14 and 15 of the appendix on tonight's slide deck.
Turning to Slide 9. You can see that reported net interest margin increased 6 basis points from the second quarter to 6.79%. That was primarily driven by day count. [indiscernible] also increased 6 basis point year-over-year, which was fueled by strong growth in our Domestic Card business.
Turning to Slide 10, I'll discuss capital. As previously announced, following the approval of our 2016 CCAR capital plan, our board authorized repurchase of up to 2.5 billion of common stock through the end of the second quarter of 2017. In the quarter, we accelerated the pace of our buybacks and repurchased 17 million shares or $1.2 billion of our authorization. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio on the Basel III standardized basis was 10.6%, which reflects current phase ins. On a standardized fully phased-in basis, it was 10.5%.
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Rich."

We posted another strong quarter of growth in Domestic Card balances and purchase volumes as well as growth in auto and commercial loans, driving strong year-over-year growth in revenue and related increases in operating expense and allowance for loan losses. We've been working hard to improve efficiency by growing revenues, realizing analog cost savings and other efficiency gains as we become a more digital company and tightly managing costs across the enterprise.
Our efforts are paying off. Our efficiency ratio for the quarter was 52%. Excluding the impacts of U.K. PPI, the adjusted efficiency ratio was 51.4% for the third quarter and 51.8% year-to-date.
It's clear that we're on track to deliver much more than our prior guidance of some improvement in our full year 2016 efficiency ratio, excluding adjusting items. Even with the expected significant seasonal increase in non-interest expenses in the fourth quarter, we now expect that our full year 2016 efficiency ratio will be substantially lower than full year 2015.
In 2016, we are already on pace to deliver the efficiency ratio improvement we had expected to achieve in 2017, primarily driven by enhanced revenues and concerted efforts to drive out analog costs. From this more efficient starting point, we expect that our near-term annual efficiency ratio, excluding adjusting items and the expected impact of Cabela's, will be in the 52s [ph], plus or minus a reasonable margin of volatility.
Over the longer term, we continue to believe that we should be able to achieve gradual efficiency improvement driven by growth and digital productivity gains.
Pulling up, our strong growth over the last 2 years puts us in a position to deliver solid EPS growth in 2017, assuming no substantial change in the broader credit and economic cycles. We expect that revenue will grow and will drive growth in pre-provision earnings as well. We expect the upward pressure from Growth Math on the allowance for loan losses will begin to moderate, and we're reducing share count.
We continue to be in a strong position to deliver attractive shareholder returns, driven by growth and sustained returns at the higher end of banks as well as significant capital distribution, subject to regulatory approval.
And now Scott, Steve and I will be happy to answer your questions."

So as our front book loss expectations kind of beyond -- in other words, beyond the effect of the growth and mix, so I'm trying to the average all these effects, there's a slight upward revision that we made in the quarter for 2017 and a slight downward revision in 2018. And that's driven by a comp positive like many multiple vintages across like hundreds of lending program. And just give you just a little bit more granularity behind this. If you compile them all and pull way up through the patterns that we see, 2015 programs are coming in with slightly higher losses than 2014 programs. And now 2016 programs are coming in a little bit better than 2015 programs. And so the higher 2015 origination losses makes their way into the late 2016 and 2017 numbers. The lower 2016 origination losses make their way into the later 2017 and 2018 numbers. Now these are all very modest effects as the most important point I want to leave with you. The other thing is our view of the value creation from our lending programs is not only bullish and high. Just to put it in perspective, this thing we're calling the front book, which is basically everything that all the growth we've had since the higher growth began. So we're talking about 2014, 2015, 2016. Our view of the value creation for that is at the high end of anything we booked in the last 15 years. So the -- back to your question about how we feel about the earnings potential in the business. What you actually have as a card business, if you kind of pull up on a yearly basis, that has maintained pretty flattish earnings and strong earnings power while absorbing a whopping increase in especially frontloaded credit costs that come in the form of originations that are, a, higher than the back book; b, that have their losses more frontloaded; and c, of course, it flows right through allowance. And so this brings a lot of pressure right upfront when we grow at the kind of trajectory that we're talking about. But I think -- but the -- hopefully, you can see when you look at the numbers and do the math on what we are booking here, this is the coiled spring of a lot of earnings power, and we're -- and that's why we continue to work hard to originate and grow what we can very prudently during this window of opportunity. Scott, why don't you comment about the allowance part of this question."

Ryan, let me spend a minute and just kind of walk through some of the puts and takes of the allowance. So one way to look at the build is to start off by taking the coverage ratio from last quarter and applying it to the change in ending balances. That really ignores the effects of growth and subprime mix that are impacting the loss rate that you can see, that if you kind of start with that static coverage ratio and apply it to the change in balances, that's going to explain roughly 1/3 of the build. Be mindful that when you get to Q4, if you're going to try to do that calculation, you need to adjust for seasonable -- seasonal balances. So just keep that in mind. Now the rest of the build is really associated with the loss rate and kind of the mechanics of doing the calculation of the allowance. Rich just walked through in detail the drivers of our updated charge-off guidance, growth in mix and performance. And so most of that guidance change happened during periods that are included in our Q3 allowance, and so we captured those as part of our updated allowance calculation this quarter. In addition to that, the mechanical effect of the quarter swap, which is moving forward the last 4 cast [ph] 1 [ph] quarter results in us dropping off Q3 '16 and adding Q3 '17 to the allowance calculation. Our forecast, as you know and as we've been saying, is for losses to be higher in '17 versus '16 so that change in quarters, all things equal, add to the allowance calculation. And on top of that, we always have qualitative factors, which are for the rest that are outside the models. So just kind of pulling up though, looking ahead I want to give you kind of some of the building blocks as you think about how you can calculate the estimates of the allowance movements in 2017. So we told you a couple key things. One, we told you that what the full year loss rate for 2017 is expected to be. We told you that the increase in our loss guidance has already been captured in the current allowance, and we've told you that we expect the impact of Growth Math is diminishing in 2017 and only has a modest effect beyond that. So all those factors I think collectively give you a good base to start kind of building up what your loss expectation is going to be in your 2017 allowance."

The -- but I think all I would say is again, just think through the mechanics of kind of the timing of how this plays out. You start with a lot of growth, which has more costs but especially most importantly, impacts the credit metrics and especially goes right through the allowance line. So how the earnings power shows up, the line item where the earnings power will really start to hit that inflection point is really as allowance builds start to mitigate. And that, of course, happens right at the time when looking ahead, the growth math effects are also starting to really settle out. And we're -- our point is we are approaching that period in this dramatic period of growth in the card business. And I think that, that's why we're not giving specific guidance on earnings power. We're just saying that we should start seeing earnings power play out over time as this -- the Growth Math does its very predictable thing."

If you look at the composition of the industry's growth over the last 12 months, about -- and I'm going to just exclude Capital One from the whole calculation because your question is an industry effect there. About 31% of the growth is in subprime. And so subprime growth has certainly picked up now. It's growing faster than prime and certainly that has our attention. Now I do want to say on the other hand, it remains well below prerecession levels in absolute terms because there was such an exodus from that part of the business over the years following the Great Recession. So at times, I think you hear from some players subprime, we don't do that. Well, all I'm saying is 31% of all the growth is subprime, and somebody's doing it. And so yes, that has our attention, and it's part of -- it's one -- it's an important part of the overall -- if you kind of look at the industry -- sorry, and this by the way, is the #1 thing that we worry about more so than like it's the next recession. Obviously, we worry about things like that, too. But the industry growth being at 6% and the subprime component of that and then also the -- beyond card growth when you look at student lending, auto lending, installment lending, that's been running for a while now at around 7%. So the -- we're pretty obsessive about these things. It causes us to believe, first of all, that we have a window, and it's just another reason we doubled down and gone really hard while we have this window. It means we have to be doubly and triply obsessive about looking for indicators of things that inevitably happen when supply goes up a lot. And those indicators can be broad-based impact on credit metrics as well as, of course, just directly affecting response rates and things like that. So we're on the lookout and we -- as we kind of always do for our investors, try to raise these flags, but we feel very good about what we're booking. We like the resilience of what we're booking, and we still are moving forward with resolve to continue to capitalize on these opportunities, but there's no doubt. We -- the information -- the data, the industry growth data is just one more reason to remind ourselves that everything is a window of opportunity, and we have to carefully watch the industry from here."

As we've talked about -- first of all, we really like the auto business. I think it plays to Capital One's strength, and we've built a very strong and kind of leading presence in that space. The auto business in the -- after the Great Recession was something that I don't think we'll see again in our lifetimes in terms of unique opportunity to grow and create value with high margins and exceptional credit quality because so many players had headed for the hills and consumers were there were even a times walking away from their houses and still paying on their cars. So that was -- and used car prices were just at incredible highs. So that was -- so, so much of our commentary about auto has been predicting -- saying it's got to be that this thing will normalize over time. And the journey since then has really been one of normalization where pretty much every year, the margins are going down. Every year, credit losses have kind of gone up. Now in Capital One's cases, 2 things I want to say. Anything that we -- we've also had a mixed change going on within Capital One over the last 2 years that has been more market growth, and so that has tended to dampen this effect. But let me also say really, if you stack vintage after vintage year after year in auto, they have been the last few years going up year-over-year, but the overall thing that we've seen is that we've been -- surprised is probably an overstatement, but I think we have kind of predicted something a more rapid normalization than we've actually seen. All of that said, I think the auto business is still in a good place for us to generate profitable business, but it is mostly kind of normalized and it has a number of things going on in the industry that cause us to be very vigilant, most importantly, kind of underwriting practices there. But I would say really over the last few years, the actual credit performance has been strikingly good and maybe even a little better than expected."

In what we call our partnership business, there are 2 types of credit card programs. One is private label, which is not a Visa MasterCard. That is just a retailers card. And the other is co-brand where the retailer -- or the issuer is issuing a Visa card or a MasterCard and they're spent both at the store and outside of the store. As it turns out, the key to a co-brand program and a really good cobra and program is kind of the Holy Grail. That's what -- when you talk to any card issuer I think the race there are handful -- a few -- a couple of handfuls, maybe a little more than that of a truly great co-brand program. And the thing that characterizes it in addition to strong retailers in that kind of thing is this -- is where you see high out-of-stores spend to supplement good in-store spend. And when you see that, then all the kind of strong economics in the way credit cards work is a great thing, and that's why there's a lot of -- and all the card issuers are really trying to get those great flagship programs. I would put -- absolutely put Cabela's in that category. Then private label is -- it's again, it's a different business and not a co-brand business by definition all the spend is going inside the store. And there, our -- I think our focus has been going after the really top-of-the-line retailers, and we have not been going after the middle or lower end of that marketplace. So where you see us, where we've had a lot of growth and great success is, for example, with Kohl's. We also have Neiman Marcus. We have Sak's, but Capital One's focus has been more at the upper end. And we've added -- I don't have the count but we've added several brands that are really good modestly sized brands on the private label side. So that business is -- the private label business is pound for pound, not as profitable as the pure-branded card business. It's a great business to have in conjunction with the branded card business but it is -- it for us has lower returns but it's a natural part of our business. The top co-brands are something that are very additive to any card program, and we're pursuing those with a lot of interest."

It's obviously something that we are focused on and have a lot of people who are starting to build out some of the work. I have a couple of thoughts on that.

I do think that you may see some divergent practices initially, and I think that, Bill, you'll see kind of the industry kind of coming together on some topics over time. So I'm a little cautious about getting ahead in putting out kind of estimates in guidance and seasonal because I do think that we'll see kind of people's estimates kind of converge over time as we all kind of get together on some of the interpretation issues. Pulling up for us, when we look at kind of the effects of see sell, I think we're probably not going to be in the business of giving any kind of the estimates on that until we are well into kind of being certain that we know how the standard's going to be interpreted and kind of what the net impacts are going to be here.

I mean, I think it's just it's inched up a little bit. I'm talking industry losses now. It's kind of -- I think there's a little bit still to go in that normalization of auto losses. And as I said in many ways, we -- it keeps a little bit outperforming in a good way our own expectations of that normalization, but I think there's a little bit more normalization still that happened. In the U.S. card business, every cardplayer has a back book that is at exceptionally low loss level. It's because for years, a couple of things behind that. And most importantly, anybody in our back book who like survived the Great Recession not surprisingly is pretty resilient in having great credit performance at this point. Additionally, most players didn't grow very much for a whole bunch of years there, so that there isn't a lot of kind of front book effects on people's existing books. So against that backdrop, our belief is at some point, there will be some normalization of that credit. And I'm reluctant to pick numbers because that's going to depend on a lot of things. And one of the things it's going to depend on is how much subprime the industry does, for example. If you go back to the late 90 [ph], there was a -- in the middle of an economy that didn't really move at all, credit losses went up quite a bit just due to a lot of probably subprime is a wrong word, just a lot of risk expansion, a lot of lending in the card business. And so I've just been around long enough that I find myself the longer I do this the more reluctant I am to declare what a normalized loss rate is. But I think there is a net pressure over time that will pull up losses for kind of existing books of all players, including Capital One. We also have one other effect that at some point will be beneficial to Capital One, which is the actual -- the other side of Growth Math, which is the seasoning that -- remember, we've talked about the general pattern of credit programs is they have higher upfront losses. Now it depends on what kind of credit program, whether it's origination? A line increase? What part of the subprime is a little different from prime. But if you put it all together, the general pattern is for front book programs, they have higher losses early on and then they gradually settle out over time. So with the big front book that we have at Capital One, that will, at some point, become a bit of a good guy in terms of the seasoning effects. I'm not here to predict the exact timing of that and so on. So I think over the longer run when we think about our own book, there is just kind of upward pressure on all card businesses and some long run seasoning that I think will be beneficial for Capital One. The key thing that we focus on since I don't think that we feel we can absolutely predict like the precise through-the-cycle loss rate for our businesses is, is everything that we underwrite, we assume significant worsening, and we focus actually more so than the loss rate itself that we predict our biggest focus is on resilience because even some of the low loss programs -- this is really the story of program in general. A lot of times some of the low loss programs look great until they don't and they don't have much of a buffer there. So in all of our underwriting, we are very -- in addition to doing all the projections we always do about losses and a whole life cycle of a vintage, we are very focused on resilience so that we have a maximum chance to not only like the business and its full net present value but to like the business a lot when we get there in the middle of a bad economic cycle. So that's kind of a long answer but that's in the context of all of that. We believe that the business we're booking over the -- in this front book is particularly resilient and frankly is particularly good economic."

I'll begin tonight on Slide 4 with our Domestic Card business. Loan growth and purchase volume growth remained strong. Compared to the third quarter of last year, our ending loans grew $8.8 billion or about 11%. A",1467,"Thanks, Jeff, and good evening, everyone. I'll begin tonight on Slide 4 with our Domestic Card business. Loan growth and purchase volume growth remained strong. Compared to the third quarter of last year, our ending loans grew $8.8 billion or about 11%. Average loans were up $9.4 billion or about 12%. Third quarter purchase volume increased about 12% from the prior year. We continue to like the return and resilience profile of the business we're booking.
In the quarter, we also announced that we entered into an agreement for a new partnership with Cabela's and the acquisition of Cabela's co-branded card portfolio, which has roughly $5.2 billion in outstandings. The agreement is subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing condition. Cabela's is a great retailer with a powerful brand highly -- and highly engaged and loyal customers.
Revenue for the quarter increased 8% from the prior year quarter, slightly lagging average loan growth. Even with the positive margin impacts of higher subprime mix, revenue margin declined year-over-year, as expected, with our exit of the back book of Payment Protection products at the end of the first quarter. Revenue margin for the third quarter was 16.6%.
Noninterest expense increased 4% compared to the prior year quarter. Our Domestic Card business continues to gain scale and improve efficiency. Net interchange revenue for the total company grew 9% from the prior year quarter versus the 12% growth in Domestic Card purchase volume. As we've discussed, there is considerable quarterly volatility in the relationship between these 2 metrics. For the past several years, on an annual basis, net interchange growth has been well-below Domestic Card purchase volume growth. We'd expect this difference to continue as we originate new rewards customers in our flagship products and extend rewards to existing customers.
Additionally, a few of the larger -- largest merchants have negotiated custom deals with the card networks. These deals are putting pressure on interchange revenue, and we expect the pressure to continue.
As we've discussed for several quarters, the dominant driver of year-over-year charge-off rate trend is Growth Math, which is the upward pressure on delinquencies and charge-offs as new loan balances in our front-book season and become a larger proportion of our overall portfolio relative to the older and highly seasoned back book. Growth Math began to impact charge-off rates in 2015. We still expect the peak impact of Growth Math in terms of its contribution to year-over-year change in our loss rate to be in 2016, with the diminishing effect in 2017 and only a modest effect beyond that.
In the third quarter, Growth Math drove the increase in charge-off rate compared to the prior year, and seasonality drove the improvement in charge-off rate compared to the linked quarter.
Looking ahead, 2 effects are together moderately impacting our charge-off outlook since last quarter. One effect is better-than-expected growth, especially in subprime. While we are growing nicely everywhere we are investing, we are seeing particular success in subprime, which has raised the mix modestly. Our proportion of loans below FICO 660 has grown from 35% 1 quarter ago to 36% at the end of the third quarter. Subprime has higher losses than average, and they're also more front loaded so it tends to have a pretty immediate impact on our near-term credit metrics. 
Beyond the growth and mix effect, we have revised slightly upward our front-book loss expectations for 2017 and slightly downward our front-book loss expectations for 2018 based on the composite performance and projections for a hundreds of credit programs. These effects together lead us to raise our full year 2017 charge-off guidance from the low 4s to the mid-4s with normal seasonal variability and excluding the modest benefit we expect from adding the Cabela's portfolio. With 9 months of actual results in the books, we expect 2016 full year charge-off rate will be around 4.15%. 
We expect the changes in guidance to largely play out over the next 3 or 4 quarters, so the expected impact of higher charge-offs is mostly captured in our current allowance. While we are modestly raising our loss outlook for 2017, our internal view of 2018 losses is unchanged, with slightly improved expectations for front-book performance offsetting higher subprime mix.
Pulling up, the higher growth in subprime mix are also driving up our revenues and pre-provision earnings. We continue to see attractive growth opportunities in our Domestic Card business, but it's clear this opportunity won't last forever. The marketplace is moving and competitive intensity across the card business remains high, and revolving credit growth is now 6% year-over-year. We will continue to monitor the marketplace vigilantly. But in the meantime, we continue to like the opportunities that we see.
Slide 5 summarizes third quarter results for our Consumer Banking business. Ending loans grew about 2% compared to the prior year. Growth in auto loans was partially offset by planned mortgage runoff. Ending deposits were up about $8 billion or 5% versus the prior year. Third quarter auto originations were $6.8 billion, about 22% higher compared to the third quarter of last year with strong growth in prime, near prime and subprime.
Similar to our Domestic Card growth, we like the earnings profile and resilience of the auto business we're booking and continue to believe that through the cycle economics of our auto business are attractive. The auto market and competitor practices remained dynamic. While we see opportunities for growth, we remain very vigilant about competitor practices. Our underwriting assumes a decline in used car prices. We continue to focus on resilient origination, and we continue to expect a gradual decrease in margins and a gradual increase in charge-offs as the cycle plays out.
Consumer Banking revenue for the quarter increased about 3% from the third quarter of last year. Higher revenue from growth in auto loans and higher deposit volumes was partially offset by margin compression in auto and planned runoff of mortgage balances. Noninterest expense for the quarter also increased 3% compared to the prior year quarter, driven by growth in auto loans and an increase in retail deposit marketing.
As we've discussed in prior quarters, we've been optimizing both the format and number of branches to better meet the evolving needs of our customers as banking goes digital. In the third quarter, actual changes related to branch moves were about $60 million. Year-to-date, we've recognized about $106 million of the $160 million in expected costs for 2016. We expect branch optimization costs to continue in 2017. These costs show up in the other category rather than in the Consumer Banking segment.
Third quarter provision for credit losses was up from the prior year, primarily as the result of charge-offs in addition to the allowance for loan losses for the auto portfolio. Growth in auto loans, the expectation of gradually rising auto charge-off rates and the expectation of declining used vehicle values drove the trend in Consumer Banking provision for credit losses.
For several quarters, we've said that we expect pressure on our Consumer Banking financial results. In the Home Loans business, planned mortgage runoff continues. In Auto Finance, margins are decreasing and charge-offs are rising modestly, and our deposit businesses continue to face a prolonged period of low interest rate. We expect that these factors will negatively affect Consumer Banking revenues, efficiency ratio and net income even as we continue to tightly manage costs.
Moving to Slide 6. I'll discuss our Commercial Banking business. Third quarter ending loan balances increased 28% year-over-year, including the acquisition of the GE Healthcare finance business. Excluding the $8.3 billion of loans acquired from GE, ending loans grew about 12% over the same time period.
Average loans increased 28% year-over-year while average deposits increased 2%. Revenue was up 27% from the third quarter of 2015. Credit pressures continue to be focused in the oil and gas and Taxi Medallion portfolios. We've provided summaries of loans, exposures, reserves and other metrics for these portfolios on Slides 14 and 15.
For the total Commercial Banking business, third quarter charge-offs were $108 million, primarily driven by charge-offs impact of Chicago Taxi Medallion loans, and to a lesser extent, oil and gas loans. The charge-off rate for the quarter was 66 basis points. We added to reserves for some third quarter weakness in New York City Taxi Medallion values, but the reserve additions only partially offset the charge-offs flowing out of reserves, resulting in a net reserve release in the quarter. Combining both charge-offs and reserve changes, provision for credit losses declined $14 million from the prior year quarter to $61 million. Criticized and nonperforming loan rates were relatively stable in the quarter. The criticized performing loan rate for the quarter was 3.7%, and the criticized nonperforming loan rate was 1.5%.
Now I'll pass the call over to Scott."

A slide outlining adjusting items can be found on Page 12 of the slide deck.
Pre-provision earnings increased modestly on a linked-quarter basis as higher revenues were only partially offset by higher noninterest expenses. As I highlighted last quarter, we had a onetime rewards expense that reduced net interchange income by $38 million, driven by the completion of some system enhancements that moved our rewards liability cutoff to the last day of the quarter. Provision for credit losses was flat on a linked-quarter basis as higher charge-offs were almost entirely offset by a lower linked-quarter allowance build. An allowance roll forward by segment can be found on Table 8 of our earnings supplement.
Let me take a moment to explain the movements in our allowance across businesses in the quarter. In our Domestic Card business, we built $349 million of allowance. This build was driven by growth and subprime mix in the quarter and incorporating our charge-off expectations for the next 12 months into our allowance calculation.
In our Consumer Banking segment, allowance increased $31 million in the quarter, almost entirely driven by growth in our auto business. 
In our Commercial Banking segment, we had a $48 million reduction in reserves, driven by charge-offs in our Taxi Medallion portfolio. Recent reserve movements have focused on taxi and our oil and gas portfolios, and we have provided details for those portfolios on Slides 14 and 15 of the appendix of tonight's slide deck.
Turning to Slide 9. You can see that reported net interest margin increased 6 basis points from the second quarter to 6.79%. That was primarily driven by day count. NIM also increased 6 basis point year-over-year, which was fueled by strong growth in our Domestic Card business.
Turning to Slide 10, I'll discuss capital. As previously announced, following the approval of our 2016 CCAR capital plan, our board authorized repurchase of up to 2.5 billion of common stock through the end of the second quarter of 2017. In the quarter, we accelerated the pace of our buybacks and repurchased 17 million shares or $1.2 billion of our authorization. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio on a Basel III standardized basis was 10.6%, which reflects current phase ins. On a standardized fully phased-in basis, it was 10.5%.
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Rich."

We posted another strong quarter of growth in Domestic Card loan balances and purchase volumes as well as growth in auto and commercial loans, driving strong year-over-year growth in revenue and related increases in operating expense and allowance for loan losses. We've been working hard to improve efficiency by growing revenues, realizing analog cost savings and other efficiency gains as we become a more digital company and tightly managing costs across the enterprise.
Our efforts are paying off. Our efficiency ratio for the quarter was 52%. Excluding the impacts of U.K. PPI, the adjusted efficiency ratio was 51.4% for the third quarter and 51.8% year-to-date.
It's clear that we're on track to deliver much more than our prior guidance of some improvement in our full year 2016 efficiency ratio, excluding adjusting items. Even with the expected significant seasonal increase in noninterest expenses in the fourth quarter, we now expect that our full year 2016 efficiency ratio will be substantially lower than full year 2015.
In 2016, we are already on pace to deliver the efficiency ratio improvement we had expected to achieve in 2017, primarily driven by enhanced revenues and concerted efforts to drive out analog costs. From this more efficient starting point, we expect that our near-term annual efficiency ratio, excluding adjusting items and the expected impact of Cabela's, will be in the 52s, plus or minus a reasonable margin of volatility.
Over the longer term, we continue to believe that we should be able to achieve gradual efficiency improvement driven by growth and digital productivity gains. Pulling up, our strong growth over the last 2 years puts us in a position to deliver solid EPS growth in 2017, assuming no substantial change in the broader credit and economic cycles. We expect that revenue will grow and will drive growth in pre-provision earnings as well. We expect the upward pressure from Growth Math on the allowance for loan losses will begin to moderate, and we're reducing share count.
We continue to be in a strong position to deliver attractive shareholder return, driven by growth and sustained returns at the higher end of banks as well as significant capital distribution, subject to regulatory approval.
And now Scott, Steve and I will be happy to answer your questions."

So as our front-book loss expectations kind of beyond -- in other words, beyond the effect of the growth and mix, so I'm trying to de-average all these effects, there's a slight upward revision that we made in the quarter for 2017 and a slight downward revision in 2018. And that's driven by a comp positive like many multiple vintages across like hundreds of lending program. And just give you just a little bit more granularity behind this. If you compile them all and pull way up for the patterns that we see, 2015 programs are coming in with slightly higher losses than 2014 programs. And now 2016 programs are coming in a little bit better than 2015 programs. And so the higher 2015 origination losses make their way into the late 2016 and 2017 numbers. The lower 2016 origination losses make their way into the later 2017 and 2018 numbers. Now these are all very modest effects as the most important point I want to leave with you. The other thing is our view of the value creation from our lending programs is not only bullish and high. Just to put it in perspective, this thing we're calling the front book, which is basically everything that all the growth we've had since the higher growth began. So we're talking about 2014, 2015, 2016. Our view of the value creation for that is at the high end of anything we booked in the last 15 years. So the -- back to your question about how we feel about the earnings potential in the business. What you actually have as a card business, if you kind of pull up on a yearly basis, that has maintained pretty flattish earnings and strong earnings power while absorbing a whopping increase in especially front-loaded credit costs that come in the form of originations that are, a, higher than the back book; b, that have their losses more front loaded; and c, of course, it flows right through allowance. And so this brings a lot of pressure right upfront when we grow at the kind of trajectory that we're talking about. But I think -- but the -- hopefully, you can see when you look at the numbers and do the math on what we are booking here, this is a coiled spring of a lot of earnings power, and we're -- and that's why we continue to work hard to originate and grow what we can very prudently during this window of opportunity. Scott, why don't you comment about the allowance part of this question."

Ryan, let me spend a minute and just kind of walk through some of the puts and takes of the allowance. So one way to look at the build is to start off by taking the coverage ratio from last quarter and applying it to the change in ending balances. That really ignores the effects of growth and subprime mix that are impacting the loss rate but you can see, that if you kind of start with that static coverage ratio and apply it to the change in balances, that's going to explain roughly 1/3 of the build. Be mindful that when you get to Q4, if you're going to try to do that calculation, you need to adjust for seasonable -- seasonal balances. So just keep that in mind. Now the rest of the build is really associated with the loss rate and kind of the mechanics of doing the calculation of the allowance. Rich just walked through in detail the drivers of our updated charge-off guidance, growth in mix and performance. And so most of that guidance change happened during periods that are included in our Q3 allowance, and so we captured those as part of our updated allowance calculation this quarter. In addition to that, the mechanical effect of the quarter swap, which is moving forward the last forecast 1 quarter results in us dropping off Q3 '16 and adding Q3 '17 to the allowance calculation. Our forecast, as you know and as we've been saying, is for losses to be higher in '17 versus '16 so that change in quarters, all things equal, add to the allowance calculation. And on top of that, we always have qualitative factors, which are for the rest that are outside the models. So just kind of pulling up, though, looking ahead, I want to give you kind of some of the building blocks as you think about how you can calculate the estimates of the allowance movements in 2017. So we told you a couple key things. One, we told you that what the full year loss rate for 2017 is expected to be. We told you that the increase in our loss guidance has already been captured in the current allowance, and we've told you that we expect the impact of Growth Math is diminishing in 2017 and only has a modest effect beyond that. So all those factors, I think, collectively give you a good base to start kind of building up what your loss expectation is going to be in your 2017 allowance."

The -- but I think all I would say is, again, just think through the mechanics of kind of the timing of how this plays out. You start with a lot of growth, which has more costs but especially most importantly, impacts the credit metrics and especially goes right through the allowance line. So how the earnings power shows up, the line item where the earnings power will really start to hit that inflection point is really as allowance builds start to mitigate. And that, of course, happens right at the time when looking ahead, the Growth Math effects are also starting to really settle out. And we're -- our point is we are approaching that period in this dramatic period of growth in the card business. And I think that, that's why we're not giving specific guidance on earnings power. We're just saying that we should start seeing earnings power play out over time as this -- the Growth Math does its very predictable thing."

We talked a lot about industry growth, and we talked off in about industry growth has gone from very low single digits or even occasionally negative a couple of years ago to 6%, and that has our attention. But here's another stat that's an interesting one. If you look at the composition of the industry's growth over the last 12 months, about -- and I'm going to just exclude Capital One from the whole calculation because your question is an industry effect there. About 31% of the growth is in subprime. And so subprime growth has certainly picked up now. It's growing faster than prime and certainly that has our attention. Now I do want to say, on the other hand, it remains well-below prerecession levels in absolute terms because there was such an exodus from that part of the business over the years following the Great Recession. So at times, I think you hear from some players, subprime, we don't do that. Well, all I'm saying is 31% of all the growth is subprime, and somebody's doing it. And so yes, that has our attention, and it's part of -- it's one -- it's an important part of the overall -- if you kind of look at the industry -- sorry, and this by the way, is the #1 thing that we worry about more so than like it's the next recession. Obviously, we worry about things like that, too. But the industry growth being at 6% and the subprime component of that and then also the -- beyond card growth when you look at student lending, auto lending, installment lending, that's been running for a while now at around 7%. So the -- we're pretty obsessive about these things. It causes us to believe, first of all, that we have a window, and it's just another reason we doubled down and gone really hard while we have this window. It means we have to be doubly and triply obsessive about looking for indicators of things that inevitably happen when supply goes up a lot. And those indicators can be broad-based impact on credit metrics as well as, of course, just directly affecting response rates and things like that. So we're on the lookout and we -- as we kind of always do for our investors, try to raise these flags, but we feel very good about what we're booking. We like the resilience of what we're booking, and we still are moving forward with resolve to continue to capitalize on these opportunities, but there's no doubt. We -- the information -- the data, the industry growth data is just one more reason to remind ourselves that everything is a window of opportunity, and we have to carefully watch the industry from here."

As you know, we're a national company in just about everything we do, except we are local and really only 20% of the nation in retail banking. And so Capital One cafés are kind of the manifestation of how we're reimagining the future of banking and also how we can kind of enhance the national banking presence we already have through our old ING book that, of course, we call Capital One 360 now. But the key thing there is it's not about putting a branch on every corner, far from it. It is about building kind of, if you will, flagship stores in key metropolitan areas and using that as a -- in many ways, a manifestation of banking reimagined relative to the very traditional way that banking has been done forever basically. So we have been gradually expanding our footprint in the cafés. We've been very pleased with the early results from the cafés, and we are -- what we see is -- reinforces our view that this will -- this is a good thing to continue to build out on a very thin basis, distribution in major metropolitan areas with these cafés."

As we've talked about -- first of all, we really like the auto business. I think it plays to Capital One's strength, and we've built a very strong and kind of leading presence in that space. The auto business in the -- after the Great Recession was something that I don't think we'll see again in our lifetimes in terms of unique opportunity to grow and create value with high margins and exceptional credit quality because so many players had headed for the hills and consumers were, gosh, there were even a times walking away from their houses and still paying on their cars. So that was -- and used car prices were just at incredible highs. So that was -- so, so much of our commentary about auto has been predicting -- saying, it's got to be that this thing will normalize over time. And the journey since then has really been one of normalization where pretty much every year, the margins are going down. Every year, credit losses have kind of gone up. Now in Capital One's cases, 2 things I want to say. Anything that we -- we've also had a mixed change going on within Capital One over the last few years that has been more market growth, and so that has tended to dampen this effect. But let me also say really, if you stack vintage after vintage, year after year in auto, they have been the last few years going up year-over-year, but the overall thing that we've seen is we've been -- surprised is probably an overstatement, but I think we have kind of predicted something a more rapid normalization than we've actually seen. All of that said, I think the auto business is still in a good place for us to generate profitable business, but it is mostly kind of normalized and it has a number of things going on in the industry that cause us to be very vigilant, most importantly, kind of underwriting practices there. But I would say really over the last few years, the actual credit performance has been strikingly good and maybe even a little better than expected."

It maybe a commentary on our marketing, but probably it's much a commentary about the window of opportunity we have to grow and the success of that. One thing is very clear, competitors have stepped up their marketing. Competitors are stepping up their advertising. Competitors are working in a number of cases. In fact, try -- sort of duplicated some of the Capital One products themselves. This game will require a pretty high level of marketing, and that's probably the case even as the growth opportunity wanes a little bit just because it's the nature of how this competition works.

One thing I want to say is that the Cabela's deal is actually a co-brand partnership, so let me just pull way up there, too. In what we call our partnership business, there are 2 types of credit card programs. One is private label, which is not a Visa, MasterCard. That is just a retailers' card. And the other is co-brand where the retailer -- or the issuer is issuing a Visa card or a MasterCard and there is spend both at the store and outside of the store. As it turns out, the key to a co-brand program and a really good co-brand program is kind of the Holy Grail. That's what -- when you probably talk to any card issuer, I think there are a handful -- a few -- a couple of handfuls, maybe a little more than that of like truly great co-brand program. And the thing that characterizes in addition to strong retailers in that kind of thing is this -- is where you see high out-of-stores spend to supplement good in-store spend. And when you see that, then all the kind of strong economics in the way credit cards work is a great thing, and that's why there's a lot of -- and all the card issuers are really trying to get those great flagship programs. I would put -- absolutely put Cabela's in that category. Then private label is -- it's again, it's a different business and not a co-brand business by definition all the spend that's going is inside the store. And there, our -- I think our focus has been going after the really top-of-the-line retailers, and we have not been going after the middle or lower end of that marketplace. So where you see us, where we've had a lot of growth and great success is, for example, with Kohl's. We also have Neiman Marcus, we have Sak's, but Capital One's focus has been more at the upper end. And we've added -- I don't have the count, but we've added several brands that are really good modestly sized brands on the private label side. So that business is -- the private label business is pound for pound, not as profitable as the pure-branded card business. It's a great business to have in conjunction with the branded card business, but it is -- it for us has lower returns, but it's a natural part of our business. The top co-brands are something that are very additive to any card program, and we're pursuing those with a lot of interest."

It's obviously something that we are focused on and have a lot of people who are starting to build out some of the work. I have a couple of thoughts on that. One, the rules that have come out there allow for a fair amount of judgment in guidance or judgments. It's more principle-based guidance as opposed to a set of rules. So I do think that you may see some divergent practices initially. And I think that, Bill, you'll see kind of the industry kind of coming together on some topics over time. So I'm a little cautious about getting ahead of putting out kind of estimates in guidance on seasonal [ph] because I do think that we'll see kind of people's estimates kind of converge over time as we all kind of get together on some of the interpretation issues. Pulling up for us, when we look at kind of the effects of seasonal [ph], I think we're probably not going to be in the business of giving any kind of estimates on that until we are well into kind of being certain that we know how the standard's going to be interpreted and kind of what the net impacts are going to be here. So that may not be that you're going to hear from me on the topic until well into next year."

I mean, I think it's just it's inched up a little bit. I'm talking industry losses now. It's kind of -- I think there's a little bit still to go in that normalization of auto losses. And as I said in many ways, we -- it keeps a little bit outperforming in a good way our own expectations of that normalization, but I think there's a little more normalization still to happen. In the U.S. card business, every cardplayer has a back book that is at exceptionally low-loss level. It's because for years, a couple of things behind that. And most importantly, anybody in our back book who like survived the Great Recession not surprisingly is pretty resilient in having great credit performance at this point. Additionally, most players didn't grow very much for a whole bunch of years there, so that there isn't a lot of kind of front-book effects on people's existing books. So against that backdrop, our belief is, at some point, there will be some normalization of that credit. And I'm reluctant to pick numbers because that's going to depend on a lot of things. And one of the things it's going to depend on is how much subprime the industry does, for example. If you go back to the late 90, there was a -- in the middle of an economy that didn't really move at all, credit card losses went up quite a bit just due to a lot of -- probably subprime is a wrong word, just a lot of risk expansion, a lot of lending in the card business. And so I've just been around long enough that I find myself the longer I do this, the more reluctant I am to declare what a normalized loss rate is. But I think there is a net pressure over time that will pull up losses for kind of existing books of all players, including Capital One. We also have one other effect that at some point will be beneficial to Capital One, which is the actual -- the other side of Growth Math, which is the seasoning that -- remember, we've talked about the general pattern of credit programs is they have higher upfront losses. Now it depends on what kind of credit program, whether it's origination, a line increase? What part of the subprime is a little different from prime. But if you pull it all together, the general pattern is for front-book programs, they have higher losses early on and then they gradually settle out over time. So with the big front book that we have at Capital One, that will, at some point, become a bit of a good guy in terms of the seasoning effects. I'm not here to predict the exact timing of that and so on. So I think over the longer run when we think about our own book, there is kind of just upward pressure on ALL [ph] card businesses and some long-run seasoning that I think will be beneficial for Capital One. The key thing that we focus on since I don't think that we feel we can absolutely predict like the precise through-the-cycle loss rate for our businesses is, is everything that we underwrite, we assume significant worsening, and we focus actually more so than the loss rate itself that we predict our biggest focus is on resilience because even some of the low-loss programs, this is really the story of banking in general. A lot of times some of the low-loss programs look great until they don't and they don't have much of a buffer there. So in all of our underwriting, we are very -- in addition to doing all the projections we always do about losses and a whole life cycle of a vintage, we are very focused on resilience so that we have a maximum chance to not only like the business and its full net present value but to like the business a lot when we get there in the middle of a bad economic cycle. So that's kind of a long answer but that's in the context of all of that. We believe that the business we're booking over the -- in this front book is particularly resilient and frankly is particularly good economic."

I'll begin tonight on Slide 4 with our Domestic Card business. Loan growth and purchase volume growth remained strong. Compared to the third quarter of last year, our ending loans grew $8.8 billion or about 11%. A",1466,"Thanks, Jeff, and good evening, everyone. I'll begin tonight on Slide 4 with our Domestic Card business. Loan growth and purchase volume growth remained strong. Compared to the third quarter of last year, our ending loans grew $8.8 billion or about 11%. Average loans were up $9.4 billion or about 12%. Third quarter purchase volume increased about 12% from the prior year. We continue to like the return and resilience profile of the business we're booking.
In the quarter, we also announced that we entered into an agreement for a new partnership with Cabela's and the acquisition of Cabela's co-branded card portfolio, which has roughly $5.2 billion in outstandings. The agreement is subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing condition. Cabela's is a great retailer with a powerful brand highly -- and highly engaged and loyal customers.
Revenue for the quarter increased 8% from the prior year quarter, slightly lagging average loan growth. Even with the positive margin impacts of higher subprime mix, revenue margin declined year-over-year, as expected, with our exit of the back book of Payment Protection products at the end of the first quarter. Revenue margin for the third quarter was 16.6%.
Noninterest expense increased 4% compared to the prior year quarter. Our Domestic Card business continues to gain scale and improve efficiency. Net interchange revenue for the total company grew 9% from the prior year quarter versus the 12% growth in Domestic Card purchase volume. As we've discussed, there is considerable quarterly volatility in the relationship between these 2 metrics. For the past several years, on an annual basis, net interchange growth has been well-below Domestic Card purchase volume growth. We'd expect this difference to continue as we originate new rewards customers in our flagship products and extend rewards to existing customers.
Additionally, a few of the larger -- largest merchants have negotiated custom deals with the card networks. These deals are putting pressure on interchange revenue, and we expect the pressure to continue.
As we've discussed for several quarters, the dominant driver of year-over-year charge-off rate trend is Growth Math, which is the upward pressure on delinquencies and charge-offs as new loan balances in our front-book season and become a larger proportion of our overall portfolio relative to the older and highly seasoned back book. Growth Math began to impact charge-off rates in 2015. We still expect the peak impact of Growth Math in terms of its contribution to year-over-year change in our loss rate to be in 2016, with a diminishing effect in 2017 and only a modest effect beyond that.
In the third quarter, Growth Math drove the increase in charge-off rate compared to the prior year, and seasonality drove the improvement in charge-off rate compared to the linked quarter.
Looking ahead, 2 effects are together moderately impacting our charge-off outlook since last quarter. One effect is better-than-expected growth, especially in subprime. While we are growing nicely everywhere we are investing, we are seeing particular success in subprime, which has raised the mix modestly. Our proportion of loans below FICO 660 has grown from 35% 1 quarter ago to 36% at the end of the third quarter. Subprime has higher losses than average, and they're also more front loaded so it tends to have a pretty immediate impact on our near-term credit metrics. 
Beyond the growth and mix effect, we have revised slightly upward our front-book loss expectations for 2017 and slightly downward our front-book loss expectations for 2018 based on the composite performance and projections for a hundreds of credit programs. These effects together lead us to raise our full year 2017 charge-off guidance from the low 4s to the mid-4s with normal seasonal variability and excluding the modest benefit we expect from adding the Cabela's portfolio. With 9 months of actual results in the books, we expect 2016 full year charge-off rate will be around 4.15%. 
We expect the changes in guidance to largely play out over the next 3 or 4 quarters, so the expected impact of higher charge-offs is mostly captured in our current allowance. While we are modestly raising our loss outlook for 2017, our internal view of 2018 losses is unchanged, with slightly improved expectations for front-book performance offsetting higher subprime mix.
Pulling up, the higher growth in subprime mix are also driving up our revenues and pre-provision earnings. We continue to see attractive growth opportunities in our Domestic Card business, but it's clear this opportunity won't last forever. The marketplace is moving and competitive intensity across the card business remains high, and revolving credit growth is now 6% year-over-year. We will continue to monitor the marketplace vigilantly. But in the meantime, we continue to like the opportunities that we see.
Slide 5 summarizes third quarter results for our Consumer Banking business. Ending loans grew about 2% compared to the prior year. Growth in auto loans was partially offset by planned mortgage runoff. Ending deposits were up about $8 billion or 5% versus the prior year. Third quarter auto originations were $6.8 billion, about 22% higher compared to the third quarter of last year with strong growth in prime, near prime and subprime.
Similar to our Domestic Card growth, we like the earnings profile and resilience of the auto business we're booking and continue to believe that the through-the-cycle economics of our auto business are attractive. The auto market and competitor practices remained dynamic. While we see opportunities for growth, we remain very vigilant about competitor practices. Our underwriting assumes a decline in used car prices. We continue to focus on resilient origination, and we continue to expect a gradual decrease in margins and a gradual increase in charge-offs as the cycle plays out.
Consumer Banking revenue for the quarter increased about 3% from the third quarter of last year. Higher revenue from growth in auto loans and higher deposit volumes was partially offset by margin compression in auto and planned runoff of mortgage balances. Noninterest expense for the quarter also increased 3% compared to the prior year quarter, driven by growth in auto loans and an increase in retail deposit marketing.
As we've discussed in prior quarters, we've been optimizing both the format and number of branches to better meet the evolving needs of our customers as banking goes digital. In the third quarter, actual changes related to branch moves were about $60 million. Year-to-date, we've recognized about $106 million of the $160 million in expected costs for 2016. We expect branch optimization costs to continue in 2017. These costs show up in the other category rather than in the Consumer Banking segment.
Third quarter provision for credit losses was up from the prior year, primarily as the result of charge-offs in addition to the allowance for loan losses for the auto portfolio. Growth in auto loans, the expectation of gradually rising auto charge-off rates and the expectation of declining used vehicle values drove the trend in Consumer Banking provision for credit losses.
For several quarters, we've said that we expect pressure on our Consumer Banking financial results. In the Home Loans business, planned mortgage runoff continues. In Auto Finance, margins are decreasing and charge-offs are rising modestly, and our deposit businesses continue to face a prolonged period of low interest rate. We expect that these factors will negatively affect Consumer Banking revenues, efficiency ratio and net income even as we continue to tightly manage costs.
Moving to Slide 6. I'll discuss our Commercial Banking business. Third quarter ending loan balances increased 28% year-over-year, including the acquisition of the GE Healthcare finance business. Excluding the $8.3 billion of loans acquired from GE, ending loans grew about 12% over the same time period.
Average loans increased 28% year-over-year while average deposits increased 2%. Revenue was up 27% from the third quarter of 2015. Credit pressures continue to be focused in the oil and gas and Taxi Medallion portfolios. We've provided summaries of loans, exposures, reserves and other metrics for these portfolios on Slides 14 and 15.
For the total Commercial Banking business, third quarter charge-offs were $108 million, primarily driven by charge-offs impact of Chicago Taxi Medallion loans, and to a lesser extent, oil and gas loans. The charge-off rate for the quarter was 66 basis points. We added to reserves for some third quarter weakness in New York City Taxi Medallion values, but the reserve additions only partially offset the charge-offs flowing out of reserves, resulting in a net reserve release in the quarter. Combining both charge-offs and reserve changes, provision for credit losses declined $14 million from the prior year quarter to $61 million. Criticized and nonperforming loan rates were relatively stable in the quarter. The criticized performing loan rate for the quarter was 3.7%, and the criticized nonperforming loan rate was 1.5%.
Now I'll pass the call over to Scott."

Capital One earned $1 billion or $1.90 a share in the third quarter. Excluding adjusting items, earnings per share was $2.03. Adjusting items in the quarter included a 61 -- $63 million build in our U.K. Payment Protection Insurance customer refund reserve, of which $47 million was an offset to revenue and $16 million was captured in operating expenses. A slide outlining adjusting items can be found on Page 12 of the slide deck.
Pre-provision earnings increased modestly on a linked-quarter basis as higher revenues were only partially offset by higher noninterest expenses. As I highlighted last quarter, we had a onetime rewards expense that reduced net interchange income by $38 million, driven by the completion of some system enhancements that moved our rewards liability cutoff to the last day of the quarter. Provision for credit losses was flat on a linked-quarter basis as higher charge-offs were almost entirely offset by a lower linked-quarter allowance build. An allowance roll forward by segment can be found on Table 8 of our earnings supplement.
Let me take a moment to explain the movements in our allowance across businesses in the quarter. In our Domestic Card business, we built $349 million of allowance. This build was driven by growth in subprime mix in the quarter and incorporating our charge-off expectations for the next 12 months into our allowance calculation.
In our Consumer Banking segment, allowance increased $31 million in the quarter, almost entirely driven by growth in our auto business. 
In our Commercial Banking segment, we had a $48 million reduction in reserves, driven by charge-offs in our Taxi Medallion portfolio. Recent reserve movements have focused on taxi and our oil and gas portfolios, and we have provided details for those portfolios on Slides 14 and 15 of the appendix of tonight's slide deck.
Turning to Slide 9. You can see that reported net interest margin increased 6 basis points from the second quarter to 6.79%. That was primarily driven by day count. NIM also increased 6 basis point year-over-year, which was fueled by strong growth in our Domestic Card business.
Turning to Slide 10, I'll discuss capital. As previously announced, following the approval of our 2016 CCAR capital plan, our board authorized repurchase of up to 2.5 billion of common stock through the end of the second quarter of 2017. In the quarter, we accelerated the pace of our buybacks and repurchased 17 million shares or $1.2 billion of our authorization. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio on a Basel III standardized basis was 10.6%, which reflects current phase-ins. On a standardized fully phased-in basis, it was 10.5%.
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Rich."

We posted another strong quarter of growth in Domestic Card loan balances and purchase volumes as well as growth in auto and commercial loans, driving strong year-over-year growth in revenue and related increases in operating expense and allowance for loan losses. We've been working hard to improve efficiency by growing revenues, realizing analog cost savings and other efficiency gains as we become a more digital company and tightly managing costs across the enterprise.
Our efforts are paying off. Our efficiency ratio for the quarter was 52%. Excluding the impacts of U.K. PPI, the adjusted efficiency ratio was 51.4% for the third quarter and 51.8% year-to-date.
It's clear that we're on track to deliver much more than our prior guidance of some improvement in our full year 2016 efficiency ratio, excluding adjusting items. Even with the expected significant seasonal increase in noninterest expenses in the fourth quarter, we now expect that our full year 2016 efficiency ratio will be substantially lower than full year 2015.
In 2016, we are already on pace to deliver the efficiency ratio improvement we had expected to achieve in 2017, primarily driven by enhanced revenues and concerted efforts to drive out analog costs. From this more efficient starting point, we expect that our near-term annual efficiency ratio, excluding adjusting items and the expected impact of Cabela's, will be in the 52s, plus or minus a reasonable margin of volatility.
Over the longer term, we continue to believe that we should be able to achieve gradual efficiency improvement driven by growth in digital productivity gains. Pulling up, our strong growth over the last 2 years puts us in a position to deliver solid EPS growth in 2017, assuming no substantial change in the broader credit and economic cycles. We expect that revenue will grow and will drive growth in pre-provision earnings as well. We expect the upward pressure from Growth Math on the allowance for loan losses will begin to moderate, and we're reducing share count.
We continue to be in a strong position to deliver attractive shareholder return, driven by growth in sustained returns at the higher end of banks as well as significant capital distribution, subject to regulatory approval.
And now Scott, Steve and I will be happy to answer your questions."

If you compile them all and pull way up for the patterns that we see, 2015 programs are coming in with slightly higher losses than 2014 programs.

The lower 2016 origination losses make their way into the later 2017 and 2018 numbers. Now these are all very modest effects as the most important point I want to leave with you. The other thing is our view of the value creation from our lending programs is not only bullish and high. Just to put it in perspective, this thing we're calling the front book, which is basically everything that -- all the growth we've had since the higher growth began. So we're talking about 2014, 2015, 2016. Our view of the value creation for that is at the high end of anything we've booked in the last 15 years. So the -- back to your question about how we feel about the earnings potential in the business. What you actually have as a card business, if you kind of pull up on a yearly basis, that has maintained pretty flattish earnings and strong earnings power while absorbing a whopping increase in especially front-loaded credit costs that come in the form of originations that are, a, higher than the back book; b, that have their losses more front loaded; and c, of course, it flows right through allowance. And so this brings a lot of pressure right upfront when we grow at the kind of trajectory that we're talking about. But I think -- but the -- hopefully, you can see when you look at the numbers and do the math on what we are booking here, this is a coiled spring of a lot of earnings power, and we're -- and that's why we continue to work hard to originate and grow what we can very prudently during this window of opportunity. Scott, why don't you comment about the allowance part of this question."

Ryan, let me spend a minute and just kind of walk through some of the puts and takes of the allowance. So one way to look at the build is to start off by taking the coverage ratio from last quarter and applying it to the change in ending balances. Th",426,"Yes. Ryan, let me spend a minute and just kind of walk through some of the puts and takes of the allowance. So one way to look at the build is to start off by taking the coverage ratio from last quarter and applying it to the change in ending balances. That really ignores the effects of growth in subprime mix that are impacting the loss rate but you can see, that if you kind of start with that static coverage ratio and apply it to the change in balances, that's going to explain roughly 1/3 of the build. Be mindful that when you get to Q4, if you're going to try to do that calculation, you need to adjust for seasonable -- seasonal balances. So just keep that in mind. Now the rest of the build is really associated with the loss rate and kind of the mechanics of doing the calculation of the allowance. Rich just walked through in detail the drivers of our updated charge-off guidance, growth in mix and performance. And so most of that guidance change happened during periods that are included in our Q3 allowance, and so we captured those as part of our updated allowance calculation this quarter. In addition to that, the mechanical effect of the quarter swap, which is moving forward the loss forecast 1 quarter results in us dropping off Q3 '16 and adding Q3 '17 to the allowance calculation. Our forecast, as you know and as we've been saying, is for losses to be higher in '17 versus '16 so that change in quarters, all things equal, add to the allowance calculation. And on top of that, we always have qualitative factors, which are for risks that are outside the models. So just kind of pulling up, though, looking ahead, I want to give you kind of some of the building blocks as you think about how you can calculate the estimates of the allowance movements in 2017. So we told you a couple key things. One, we told you that what the full year loss rate for 2017 is expected to be. We told you that the increase in our loss guidance has already been captured in the current allowance, and we've told you that we expect the impact of Growth Math is diminishing in 2017 and only has a modest effect beyond that. So all those factors, I think, collectively give you a good base to start kind of building up what your loss expectation is going to be in your 2017 allowance."

Puts a lot of pressure on the P&L of the card business. And it has been absorbing that. Now meanwhile, and I always use this term of a coiled spring, I think it's a great metaphor, but -- meanwhile when we look at the value of what we're originating here, we're very bullish and that's why we're growing at the rate that we are. The -- but I think all I would say is, again, just think through the mechanics of kind of the timing of how this plays out. You start with a lot of growth, which has more costs but especially most importantly, impacts the credit metrics and especially goes right through the allowance line. So how the earnings power shows up, the line item where the earnings power will really start to hit that inflection point is really as allowance builds start to mitigate. And that, of course, happens right at the time when looking ahead, the Growth Math effects are also starting to really settle out. And we're -- our point is we are approaching that period in this dramatic period of growth in the card business. And I think that, that's why we're not giving specific guidance on earnings power. We're just saying that we should start seeing earnings power play out over time as this -- the Growth Math does its very predictable thing."

We talked a lot about industry growth, and we talk often about industry growth has gone from very low single digits or even occasionally negative a couple of years ago to 6%, and that has our attention. But here's another stat that's an interesting one. If you look at the composition of the industry's growth over the last 12 months, about -- and I'm going to just exclude Capital One from the whole calculation because your question is an industry effect there. About 31% of the growth is in subprime. And so subprime growth has certainly picked up now. It's growing faster than prime and certainly that has our attention. Now I do want to say, on the other hand, it remains well-below prerecession levels in absolute terms because there was such an exodus from that part of the business over the years following the Great Recession. So at times, I think you hear from some players, subprime, we don't do that. Well, all I'm saying is 31% of all the growth is subprime, and somebody's doing it. And so yes, that has our attention, and it's part of -- it's one -- it's an important part of the overall -- if you kind of look at the industry -- sorry, and this by the way, is the #1 thing that we worry about more so than like it's the next recession. Obviously, we worry about things like that, too. But the industry growth being at 6% and the subprime component of that and then also the -- beyond card growth when you look at student lending, auto lending, installment lending, that's been running for a while now at around 7%. So the -- we're pretty obsessive about these things. It causes us to believe, first of all, that we have a window, and it's just another reason we doubled down and gone really hard while we have this window. It means we have to be doubly and triply obsessive about looking for indicators of things that inevitably happen when supply goes up a lot. And those indicators can be broad-based impact on credit metrics as well as, of course, just directly affecting response rates and things like that. So we're on the lookout and we -- as we kind of always do for our investors, try to raise these flags, but we feel very good about what we're booking. We like the resilience of what we're booking, and we still are moving forward with resolve to continue to capitalize on these opportunities, but there's no doubt. We -- the information -- the data, the industry growth data is just one more reason to remind ourselves that everything is a window of opportunity, and we have to carefully watch the industry from here."

As we've talked about -- first of all, we really like the auto business. I think it plays to Capital One's strength, and we've built a very strong and kind of leading presence in that space. The auto business in the -- after the Great Recession was something that I don't think we'll see again in our lifetimes in terms of unique opportunity to grow and create value with high margins and exceptional credit quality because so many players had headed for the hills and consumers were, gosh, there were even a times walking away from their houses and still paying on their cars. So that was -- and used car prices were just at incredible highs. So that was -- so, so much of our commentary about auto has been predicting -- saying, it's got to be that this thing will normalize over time. And the journey since then has really been one of normalization where pretty much every year, the margins are going down. Every year, credit losses have kind of gone up. Now in Capital One's cases, 2 things I want to say. Anything that we -- we've also had a mixed change going on within Capital One over the last few years that has been more market growth, and so that has tended to dampen this effect. But let me also say really, if you stack vintage after vintage, year after year in auto, they have been the last few years going up year-over-year, but the overall thing that we've seen is we've been -- surprised is probably an overstatement, but I think we have kind of predicted something a more rapid normalization than we've actually seen. All of that said, I think the auto business is still in a good place for us to generate profitable business, but it is mostly kind of normalized and it has a number of things going on in the industry that cause us to be very vigilant, most importantly, kind of underwriting practices there. But I would say really over the last few years, the actual credit performance has been strikingly good and maybe even a little better than expected."

The other thing I want to say about marketing is that while I think on a -- just kind of pulling way up calibrated across the years, I think marketing efficiency's at a pretty high level right now. It may be a commentary on our marketing, but probably as much a commentary about the window of opportunity we have to grow and the success of that. One thing is very clear, competitors have stepped up their marketing. Competitors are stepping up their advertising. Competitors are working in a number of cases they have, in fact, try to sort of duplicated some of the Capital One products themselves. This game will require a pretty high level of marketing, and that's probably the case even as the growth opportunity wanes a little bit just because it's the nature of how this competition works.

One thing I want to say is that the Cabela's deal is actually a co-brand partnership, so let me just pull way up there, too. In what we call our partnership business, there are 2 types of credit card programs. One is private label, which is not a Visa, MasterCard. That is just a retailers' card. And the other is co-brand where the retailer -- or the issuer is issuing a Visa card or a MasterCard and there is spend both at the store and outside of the store. As it turns out, the key to a co-brand program and a really good co-brand program is kind of the Holy Grail. That's what -- when you probably talk to any card issuer, I think there are a handful -- a few -- a couple of handfuls, maybe a little more than that of like truly great co-brand program. And the thing that characterizes in addition to strong retailers and that kind of thing is this -- is where you see high out-of-stores spend to supplement good in-store spend. And when you see that, then all the kind of strong economics and the way credit cards work is a great thing, and that's why there's a lot of -- and all the card issuers are really trying to get those great flagship programs. I would put -- absolutely put Cabela's in that category. Then private label is -- it's again, it's a different business and not a co-brand business by definition all the spend that's going is inside the store. And there, our -- I think our focus has been going after the really top-of-the-line retailers, and we have not been going after the middle or lower end of that marketplace. So where you see us, where we've had a lot of growth and great success is, for example, with Kohl's. We also have Neiman Marcus, we have Saks, but Capital One's focus has been more at the upper end. And we've added -- I don't have the count, but we've added several brands that are really good modestly sized brands on the private label side. So that business is -- the private label business is, pound for pound, not as profitable as the pure-branded card business. It's a great business to have in conjunction with the branded card business, but it is -- it, for us, has lower returns, but it's a natural part of our business. The top co-brands are something that are very additive to any card program, and we're pursuing those with a lot of interest."

So I'm a little cautious about getting ahead of putting out kind of estimates in guidance on CECL because I do think that we'll see kind of people's estimates kind of converge over time as we all kind of get together on some of the interpretation issues.

I mean, I think it's just it's inched up a little bit. I'm talking industry losses now. It's kind of -- I think there's a little bit still to go in that normalization of auto losses. And as I said in many ways, we -- it keeps a little bit outperforming in a good way our own expectations of that normalization, but I think there's a little more normalization still to happen. In the U.S. card business, every cardplayer has a back book that is at exceptionally low-loss level. It's because for years, a couple of things behind that. And most importantly, anybody in our back book who, like, survived the Great Recession not surprisingly is pretty resilient in having great credit performance at this point. Additionally, most players didn't grow very much for a whole bunch of years there, so that there isn't a lot of kind of front-book effects on people's existing books. So against that backdrop, our belief is, at some point, there will be some normalization of that credit. And I'm reluctant to pick numbers because that's going to depend on a lot of things. And one of the things it's going to depend on is how much subprime the industry does, for example. If you go back to the late 90, there was a -- in the middle of an economy that didn't really move at all, credit card losses went up quite a bit just due to a lot of -- probably subprime is a wrong word, just a lot of risk expansion, a lot of lending in the card business. And so I've just been around long enough that I find myself the longer I do this, the more reluctant I am to declare what a normalized loss rate is. But I think there is a net pressure over time that will pull up losses for kind of existing books of all players, including Capital One. We also have one other effect that at some point will be beneficial to Capital One, which is the actual -- the other side of Growth Math, which is the seasoning that -- remember, we've talked about the general pattern of credit programs is they have higher upfront losses. Now it depends on what kind of credit program, whether it's origination, a line increase? What part of the subprime is a little different from prime. But if you pull it all together, the general pattern is for front-book programs, they have higher losses early on and then they gradually settle out over time. So with the big front book that we have at Capital One, that will, at some point, become a bit of a good guy in terms of the seasoning effects. I'm not here to predict the exact timing of that and so on. So I think over the longer run when we think about our own book, there is kind of just upward pressure on all card businesses and some long-run seasoning that I think will be beneficial for Capital One. The key thing that we focus on since I don't think that we feel we can absolutely predict like the precise through-the-cycle loss rate for our businesses is, is everything that we underwrite, we assume significant worsening, and we focus actually more so than the loss rate itself that we predict our biggest focus is on resilience because even some of the low-loss programs, this is really the story of banking in general. A lot of times some of the low-loss programs look great until they don't and they don't have much of a buffer there. So in all of our underwriting, we are very -- in addition to doing all the projections we always do about losses and a whole life cycle of a vintage, we are very focused on resilience so that we have a maximum chance to not only like the business and its full net present value but to like the business a lot when we get there in the middle of a bad economic cycle. So that's kind of a long answer but that's in the context of all of that. We believe that the business we're booking over the -- in this front book is particularly resilient and frankly is particularly good economics."
