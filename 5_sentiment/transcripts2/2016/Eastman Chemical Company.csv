We delivered our sixth consecutive year of solid EPS growth",387,"Good morning, everyone. I'll start on Slide 3. 2015 was another outstanding year for Eastman as we continue to make excellent progress in our strategy to transform towards a specialty portfolio. We delivered our sixth consecutive year of solid EPS growth despite a very challenging global business environment and generated record free cash flow of $960 million, reflecting strong earnings as well as the benefit of recent acquisitions, which generated outstanding free cash flow. 
A strong contributor to earnings growth in our specialty businesses in 2015 was the progress we made on organic growth initiatives. I'll highlight just a couple of examples. In Advanced Materials segment, our window interlayers, particularly our acoustic and heads-up display products, delivered solid double-digit volume growth for the year. Also in AM, we delivered very strong growth from our new optical film solutions for mobile devices. And in Additives & Functional Products, tackifying resins into tires was a strong contributor to overall growth in 2015. 
These are just a few examples of how innovation and market development and supporting growth in overall difficult environment. We also did a great job in 2015 to successfully integrating our recently acquired businesses. Each of these acquisitions were completed and aligns well with our strategy of delivering consistent superior value and combined, delivered over $0.50 a share in accretion for the year as expected. 
In the cost management, we did an outstanding job in 2015, reflecting very strong productivity gains. Overall, we were able to more than offset inflation by about $25 million. 
We also made substantial progress on reducing our net debt. Finally, during the year, we remain committed to returning cash to our stockholders. We increased our dividend by 15%, the sixth straight year of increases, and over at that time, we have more than doubled the dividend, and we repurchased more than $100 million of stock. This strong performance in so many fronts is a great testament strength of Eastman's portfolio and integration and scale that has been built over decades. More importantly, I am very fortunate to work with such a strong team of employees, who consistently overcome challenges and find ways to deliver results for our stakeholders. 
Now I hand the call over to Curt to cover the financial details for 2015, and then I'll come back to talk about 2016."
109103,321971239,923466,"Eastman Chemical Co., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 29, 2016",2016-01-29,"Earnings Calls","Eastman Chemical Company","Executives","Thanks, Mark. Good morning, everyone. Since we have a lot to cover today, I'll be brief with my comments. I'll start with our fourth quarter corporate results on Slide 4. We delivered solid earnings despite the many increasing challenges we faced during t",1083,"Thanks, Mark. Good morning, everyone. Since we have a lot to cover today, I'll be brief with my comments. I'll start with our fourth quarter corporate results on Slide 4. We delivered solid earnings despite the many increasing challenges we faced during the quarter. The decline in revenue largely reflected lower selling prices due to lower raw material and energy costs. 
Operating earnings were down somewhat. Positives include strong volume growth in Advanced Materials and strong operating margins in Adhesives & Plasticizers. Headwinds were lower oil prices and the associated propane hedges, which largely impacted Specialty Fluids & Intermediates and lower volumes in Fibers. 
Earnings per share were solid and included a lower tax rate year-over-year, which reflected the full year impact of the tax extenders enacted in December. 
Next on Slide 5, looking at the full year, we delivered outstanding results, reflecting the strength and robustness of our strategy to transform to a specialty portfolio. Sales revenue increased slightly as sales from recently acquired businesses more than offset lower selling prices, which largely reflected lower raw material costs. Operating earnings increased in 3 of our segments with particularly strong earnings growth in Advanced Materials. Our operating margin for the year was 18%, an increase of nearly 100 basis points compared to 2014. Overall, we're very pleased with our results in a challenging business climate. 
Moving next to the segment results beginning on Slide 6, the Advanced Materials had an exceptional year as they continue to deliver on the elements of their strategy. Sales revenue increased due to higher sales volume and sales of products of the acquired performance films business. Offsets were currency and lower selling prices, which reflected lower raw material costs, particularly paraxylene for copolyesters. 
Operating earnings increased more than $100 million or about 40% due to a number of factors: volume growth and mix improvement, volume from the acquisition, operational improvements and improved spread. The improved product mix was driven by increased sales of optical film solutions and premium interlayers. 
The operating margin increased to roughly 17% from just over 12% in 2014. These results reflect execution of a strategy over a number of years to improve the operating margin in this business and to achieve an appropriate return given the investments made. We expect to build on this success going forward. 
Moving next to Additives & Functional Products on Slide 7, which had a solid year. The revenue increase was due to the impact of the Taminco acquisition. This was partially offset by lower coatings and other formulated products, selling prices, which reflected lower raw material and energy costs as well as the impact of currency. Operating earnings were up year-over-year, reflecting both improved spread and the impact of the Taminco acquisition. The business did a great job managing value in the face of a slower growth environment, increased competitive rivalry and narrowing olefin spreads. 
Moving next to additives -- I'm sorry, Adhesives & Plasticizers on Slide 8. For 2015, sales revenue declined, primarily due to lower prices reflecting lower raw material costs and currency. Volume was about flat as growth in nonphthalate plasticizers, particularly in North America, was offset by lower adhesives resins volume due to the lack of availability of raw materials earlier in the year as well as operational constraints. Operating earnings increased as improved spread was partially offset by propane hedges and currency. The operating margin increased to just under 20% as we did a good job of holding onto val through the year. 
Now to Fibers on Slide 9. Revenue declined mainly due to lower acetate tow and acetyl chemicals sales volume. The decline in tow volume was mainly attributed to consumer destocking especially in China. And the decline in acetyl chemicals volume was due to increased sales to the cellulose acetate flake joint venture in Kingsport. Operating earnings were down year-over-year due to lower tow and acetyl chemicals volume despite. The challenge for lower volume, the operating margin for the segment was 32%. 
I'll finish the segment review with Specialty Fluids & Intermediates on Slide 10. Sales revenue decreased as lower selling prices and lower chemical and other intermediate sales volumes more than offset the impact of acquisitions. For operating earnings, we had a number of significant headwinds impacting results. The significant decline in oil prices reduced the North American shale gas advantage. And as the market became long in ethylene and propylene, the drop in olefin prices outpaced the decline in oil, further impacting margins. Also slower-than-expected economic growth in Asia led to an increased level of competitive of import threats to the U.S. and Europe, and the impact of propane hedges was significant for this segment. These headwinds more than offset earnings from acquired businesses and commercial productivity actions we took through the year. While operating earnings declined for the year, we did a good job managing through a challenging environment. 
On Slide 11, I'll transition to the overview of cash flow and other financial highlights for 2015. We did an excellent job of generating cash in 2015 with operating cash flow over $1.6 billion. This is a new record for cash from operations as is our free cash flow of $960 million for the year. Capital expenditures totaled $652 million, below our previous expectations as we managed the pace of spend with the current economic environment while maintaining our growth investments. We expect to be at a similar level in 2016. 
Looking at the balance sheet. Net debt stands at $6.7 billion as of year-end, reflecting almost $600 million in debt reduction for the year. Our cash flows from balance sheet and liquidity keep Eastman in a position of strength in uncertain economy. 
Our full year dividend was $238 million, and this included a 15% increase in the fourth quarter. In addition, we had $103 million in share repurchases through the year, including $55 million in the fourth quarter. 
The combination of regular increases in our dividend and share repurchases reflected our continued confidence in future earnings and cash flows. And finally, our effective tax rate for the year was approximately 25%, which again includes the enactment of tax extenders for the fourth quarter as well as favorable geographic mix of earnings. We expect the effective tax rate for 2016 will be at a similar level, if not better as we continue to pursue opportunities to reduce this rate further. Overall, a strong year results given the challenging conditions. 
And with that, I'll turn it back over to Mark."

We're obviously, in a challenging macro environment and are using every lever to create value for our shareholders. 
In the next few slides, I'll discuss some of these levers. First, our priority will be continued volume growth and mix upgrade in our specialties. We're aggressively increasing our cost-reduction activities, and we're also taking our next steps in portfolio management and organizational design, and we will return our strong free cash flow to shareholders. 
On Slide 14, I want to provide you a quick view on our historical volume growth as a basis for our forward look. Over the last 5 years, we delivered 10% compounded volume growth. Let's start with the foundation before our acquisitions. The yellow line reflects volume growth from our heritage specialty businesses, which you roughly see a 3% compounded growth. And then we levered our strong free cash flow and very strong balance sheet to expand our connection to attractive end markets with high-quality specialty products through several attractive specialty acquisitions. 
This organic growth both in heritage Eastman and within our acquisitions, is a tribute to our management team on 2 fronts: one, we are driving high-growth and innovation platforms that is well above end market growth rates; and second, we are doing an excellent job of balancing price-volume trade-offs in our core businesses. 
It's a great story of organic growth and disciplined capital deployment. We're also not waiting around for market growth. We are focused on creating our own growth. 
On Slide 15 you can see a depiction of how we execute our innovation and market development efforts. On the vertical axis are our key world-class technology platforms, and this is a combination of platforms that Eastman has had for decades: cellulose esters, polyesters, OXOs and hydrocarbon resins, and some that we recently acquired, PVBs and alkyl amines. 
Across the horizontal axis are 4 key end markets where we are concentrating our growth efforts. What you see is that we have a fairly concentrated set of initiatives that take advantage of our expertise in these platforms to help us further penetrate these attractive markets, some we've already mentioned this morning such as tire resins, acoustic and heads-up inter displays -- interlayers and new mobile device displays, others we have discussed in the past, including Tritan, our next-generation copolyester coatings and microfibers. 
We're making great progress with the innovation and market development portfolio, and I'm committed to accelerating investment in and emphasis on these efforts because I believe it is the key to Eastman's long-term success. We expect over the next 3 years that innovation and market development initiatives will add between 1% to 2% to overall Eastman revenue growth on a competitive basis, and that operating earnings for these revenues will be well above corporate average. 
Moving next to Slide 16. We also recognize that we're in a tough economic environment that will require aggressive cost management. Over the last couple of years, we've been able to offset inflation with productivity and cost-reduction initiatives. And in 2015, we were able to do a little bit more with over $25 million falling to the bottom line. 
This year, we know that in this very challenging environment, we need to do much more. We expect to double our productivity and cost-reduction efforts so that they're in the range of $200 million. After offsetting inflation, we project these combined efforts contribute about $0.50 per share to EPS this year, and I want to emphasize that as we achieve these cost reductions, we will continue to invest in our innovation and market development initiatives. We have a great track record of cost management, and I'm highly confident we will manage and achieve these cost-reduction targets for '16. 
That brings me to our outlook on Slide 17, and it starts with growth drivers that have been constant for us over the last 6 years. We have a strong performance specialty businesses that are well positioned for growth. They have delivered over the last 6 years. We expect that to continue into '16 and beyond. In addition, we expect that our innovative specialty products will continue to grow strongly, improving product mix and accelerating overall earnings growth. As I mentioned on the previous slide, we are today aggressive cost actions to add $0.50 a share. 
In addition, we will achieve further cost synergies from the acquisitions as we have guided in the past. We're also looking at every other lever. We see further improvement in tax, as Curt mentioned, and pension costs. We also will repurchase shares with our industry leading free cash flow after delevering in the back half of the year. 
All that said, we face remaining -- we face some increasing near-term challenges. The further collapse in the price of oil recently has increased price pressure, especially in our olefin and acetyl products. Stagnant global economic growth combined with weakening Asian European currencies are increasing some competitive activity in some products. We further expect to see inventory destocking in Fibers in China. 
In this challenging environment, we will drive hard to deliver EPS in 2016 that approaches our 2015 EPS, and we expect our EBITDA margins to be similar to 2015. Finally, we expect to deliver another strong year of free cash flow above $900 million. 
Next on Slide 18. As our announcement that we are improving our business structure, which results in changes to the segments, in which we report our financial results. Principally, we are making changes that better align our business model to drive long-term growth and support our continued transformation to a specialty portfolio, and part of this is enabled by the completion of the Taminco integration. This new structure should result in acceleration of growth opportunities and attractive markets. This also enables us to reduce cost in a more streamlined structure. And finally, this improved reporting structural will result in less complexity and enhanced visibility for those tracking our performance. 
On Slide 19, you can see this new structure. The biggest changes that we have moved from 5 segments to 4 with the Adhesives business moving to Additives & Functional Products and the Plasticizer business moving to the new Chemical Intermediates segment. Adhesives and AFP will enable us to better manage our businesses in combination with our great success of our tackifying resins going into tires. We also see more opportunities in application development adhesives, and we can leverage our world-class market development, application development capability in AFP. Plasticizers and distribution solvents from AFP will be better managed in chemical intermediates, where we have commercial excellence in managing pricing and asset utilization at a highly competitive environment. 
In addition, there are various product line moves to enhance market connect. This reporting structure's effective here in the first quarter, and we provide -- we plan to provide historical segment results on the new segment basis prior to releasing first quarter earnings. 
With these moves, the more specialty businesses are now in Additives & Functional Products and Advanced Materials, and the significant majority of our oil exposure, olefins, will now be in chemical intermediates. 
Our 2016 earnings expectations for these segments are as follows: we expect another year of strong growth in Advanced Materials, driven by volume and mix upgrade. Additives & Functional Products is expected to remain stable despite a tough market with volume growth offsetting price pressures, including adhesives being modestly lower. For Fibers, we are expecting declining prices due to lower pulp prices and weakening currencies, which will be offset by cost actions we have taken. 
Therefore, the key variable is volume. We expect continued destocking China, but we don't know yet how far it'll go, and we expect to know more in the coming months. For Chemical Intermediates, we expect earnings to be lower, given the collapse in the oil and the pressure on spreads in that business with the same trends impacting plasticizers. And once again, we believe this new business structure supports our strategy to transform towards a specialty portfolio. 
As you know, we have been on a long and committed journey to divest commodity businesses and add specialties. On Slide 20, I'll provide an update on our portfolio management efforts. Having successfully integrated our attractive acquisitions in 2015, we're shifting our focus in 2016 towards portfolio optimization consistent with our long-term strategy. Over the last few years, we've been looking to divest our excess ethylene position that continues to be a source of earnings volatility. These efforts have been constrained due to pipeline dispute with Westlake, which we have discussed previously. With favorable rulings from the Texas commission and the appeals court, we believe we can now move forward with our efforts to divest the excess ethylene. We are also pursuing strategic options for both excess ethylene and commodity olefin intermediates that are not essential to our specialty strategy and can be operationally segregated at the site. 
Of course, the specific scope may vary depending on buyer interest and valuation. I also want to be clear that our integrated Texas site produces advantaged ethylene and propylene, much of which we translate into our specialty derivatives and as such, will remain a critical integrated stream within our portfolio. We've hired an investment bank to restart the process to monetize our excess ethylene position and the other commodity olefin-related product lines that are not essential to our long-term strategy. This effort will be one of our top priorities in 2016, and we'll provide more details later in the year as it progresses. 
On Slide 21, our expectations for cash generation. As you can see on the bar chart, we have a history of generating strong free cash flow, particularly over the last 5 years. This reflects the strength of our solid core businesses as well as the transformation of our portfolio. 
Looking at 2016, we expect free cash flow to be greater than $900 million. With this free cash flow, we expect to continue deleveraging, having reduced the debt by over $600 million in 2015, and we expect to complete our delevering in 2016 to get to approximately $1 billion of debt reduction. As a result, we've also committed to our investors in past calls that we expect to fully utilize our free cash to pay an increasing dividend, continue delevering and repurchase shares. 
So in summary, on Slide 22, we have a strong portfolio specialty businesses that we are confident in, and we know that are going to drive volume growth this year and continue to drive on growth into the future. This organic set of initiatives our innovation our product improvement are essential our strategy, and they were essential in how we grew value last year, this year, in the future. We are committed to using every lever we have in this challenging environment, including increasing our cost-reduction efforts, and we will return our strong free cash to stockholders. Despite our short-term challenges this year, I'm confident we'll continue to deliver solid earnings growth for the long term and looking forward to the questions on this call. Thank you."

The first on the specialties part with the resegmentation you should think about the parts of the products that we have that are commodity oriented that have been concentrated Chemical Intermediates. So the other segments really don't have anything we consider to be commodities, and the reality is that even in specialty businesses when you have oil prices drop from $100 to $30, and you're oil-based, your customers sort of noticed and expect that some of that raw material benefit is going to be shared with them. So throughout last year, we realize obviously significant raw material benefits in our specialties and our commodities and the pace at which the price is shared within is very different. So in the commodities, it happens quickly. In the specialties, you still give back value to your customers. If you don't do that and if you hold onto price very aggressively, which you can certainly do a specialty, you set yourself up for volume within the future because even if your proprietary product, and we have a number of ones where we're the only a manufacturer in the world if you don't share some of that at an appropriate level, you put your customers on to find new suppliers, whether it's an alternative material or a smaller competitor you might have or you're a very strong leader in a Specialty business. So we do that. We are probably the most sophisticated commercial excellent pricing systems. I think in the industry, where we make these price volume all year long to make sure that we are sharing value but maintaining the ability to grow volume in the long term. Over the year, that plays out and prices come down and, to some degree, and you take that into this year, and that's a bit of a headwind versus how you started last year. But no, I don't think our specialties are commoditizing at all, and what I love about most of our technology platforms is we have next-generation products building up of the same assets, whether it's the next generation of acoustics and heads-up display product replacing copolyesters any series of opportunities going on to improve Crystex with our next-generation Crystex technology, et cetera. So we never sit around waiting for people to try and replicate as we always moving the ball down the field and advancing what we offer to our customers. So overall, I'd say the performance feels great on that front. What I did say, though, in my prepared remarks is we are expanding the scope of what we're considering selling be on excess ethylene. So we are looking at what other olefins that have commodity behavior in Chemical Intermediates, a lot of volatility, a lot of distraction for investors that is not essential to our long-term strategies are there not critical intermediates for our specialties. And so we're going to a look at how much of that we can package with excess ethylene and find a buyer who values that olefin portfolio in their strategy."

So that would almost imply kind of a 4-plus percent improvement in that area. My sense is that given the economic backdrop in 2016, that would not be the case.

So I think we'll go with those markets. So I think we'll have volume growth that will be like history and within that, I think they'll get the mix uplift that will be these high-growth specialty products that aren't necessarily huge volumes, but they're very attractive earnings, and they provide nice leverage to earnings, but we don't see a volume problem in this year. We think it continues to be solid. We think will have good volume growth. We think volume growth will be better this year than last year when we look at because last year wasn't as much as we wanted, of course.

As we look at it, we do see a lot of tailwinds as you noted, good volume growth, mix upgrade, the cost-reduction actions, the acquisition synergies, improvements in tax, pension costs as well as share account. So there are a  number very attractive tailwinds for us and really 2 principal issues as you've identified that are headwinds. So how much spread compression do we take this year versus last year and this volume on Fibers. When it comes to the spread issued, I think that there's predominantly that spread person is going to be and chemical intermediates feel a little bit of that AFP would still will have some olefins in that segment, and we expect prices to come off a bit in the adhesive, where things have been relatively tight last year. And so we'll have a little bit price get back and better volume growth this year netting each other but somewhat down. With the majority of the issues really a spread issue. And then, of course, we put in an expectation of some additional destocking in Fibers. There's a lot of moving parts when it comes to oil, the economy, the uncertainty and destocking that can combine those in a variety of different scenarios. The way of would suggest you all think about it is we're somewhere between stable to 2015 EPS and down 5% when I combine all of those different factors together in those I think give us that sort of range. Specific to FX, I'll let Curt answer that question."

Just the way to think about currency itself right now, the currencies we've seen, particularly our exposures euro, is slightly down compared to what we saw on average for '15. Maybe the best way to look at it is if you think about just the net impact of hedges whether that was the cost of the propane hedges or the benefit of the currency hedges, net-net, that was probably a $0.60 headwind for us for the year. For '16, we think the net impact of these changes in hedges, net-net, is going to be about flat. This is was a little lower than we were thinking before, primarily due to the collapse of oil and the underlying impact on our propane hedges, but then that $0.60 impact really rolls off in '17 and '18."

To Curt's point if oil and currency stay where they at, we'll just get natural $0.60 lift in '17 and '18, $0.60 a share lift as those roll off. Oil prices go up, our earnings will improve just as they've pressured it down. So either way, you look at you got earnings growth coming in '17 and '18 depending on your view about oil prices because I think is likely they'll be better than where they are today. In addition to that, you've got continued volume growth next year. You've got this transition of spread expansion in '15, normalizing a bit of those spreads in '16. That is a 2-year event when you're adjusting from $100 to $30 oil, but you don't have that in '16 anymore. That'll be behind us and then on top of that, we've got continued ways to improve costs and importantly, we have a very strong free cash flow, and we'll be repurchasing shares started in the back half of this year and strongly in '17. So while we're certainly disappointed about some of the challenges right now, we are focused on driving long-term growth and taking actions that makes sense to maintain volume growth long term and deliver strong earnings growth beyond this year and '17, '18 and beyond."

So certainly there's a first half headwind this year versus last year when it comes to propylene. The ethylene is sort of the opposite story. Ethylene prices were relatively good in first half of last year and then obviously, came off pretty significantly in the back half of last year. So it sort of the flip story there on sort of where it goes, but we expect ethylene prices to improve into the second quarter this year as is very large cracking maintenance schedule takes place this year. That should certainly move ethylene prices back up a bit. We're not expecting it to go back to last year, but we certainly expect improvement versus right now. So moving parts there.

So with the tow business, first I'll take outside of China, which is the more straightforward story. What we see there is that destocking come to an end, and we expect times to be relatively stable into this year. Outside of China, we have seen prices come off some with the reduction in pulp prices and our competitors in Europe and Asia Pacific using their weakening currency as a way to attempt to chase volume. We, of course, defended our market position, but the crisis did come down a bit. With all the cost actions we're taking in that business, we've been able to offset that pricing decline that we're seeing outside of China. So really it is about a pure question around what does a volume do in China at this point. And what I'd say is well, from what we can see the chinese national tobacco company made progress in their destocking company in 2015, but not achieved their objectives in going as far as they are wanted to. They have to walk a tight balance in delivering their tax revenue increase for the year, which they did do, which limits how far they can go and producing production and achieving their inventory management goals, and so they're going to do another round of that this year and trying to work that inventory down. It's important to keep in mind as well that when you see this sort of volume issue in '15 and '16, a good portion of it is also CNTC backward integrating with tow suppliers. So we did JV in the end of '14 with CNTC, and that is what led to a certain amount of volume decline in '15. And Daicel did a JV, which is going to be part of why volume goes down this year. So you shouldn't misinterpret that as a decline in primary demand. We don't see any issues with primary demand. Our consumption going to decline. This is all about inventory management and some backward integration. The good news on the backward integration front is that we don't expect any other tow backward integration by CNTC until the 2019, '20 time frame. So that won't be an issue as we go into '17 and '18 and other upside for sort of '17, '18 versus what we're seeing this year. So overall, I'd say it's we expect some decline, and we just have to wait and see how it goes with a final conversations and content negotiation."

We have a lot bunch of little small competitors in Asia, and we've been dealing with since 2012, and we're seeing some price pressure there. I'd say in one place our Japanese competitors using their weakening yen to sort of chase volume, where we're once again defending our market positions.

Our customers are probably more qualified to comment. On the tire side, 75% of that business is roughly replacement, and it's important to remember we're leveraging commercial tires much more so than passenger tires when it comes to the amount of Crystex per tires, 10x in a commercial tire versus passengers. So what we see there is like there will be economy getting better in the U.S. improving in Europe, and it's still growing in China, by the way, just not as fast as we'd all like, and so that's all sort of driving the need for replacement tires especially increased construction activity in North America and even some increased construction activity in Europe that we're seeing. So that's sort of how we talk about the tire side of it. On coatings, when you look at transportation and building construction, we expect a good year in North America, which is where we have our largest market share with the increasing construction rate of housing coming for us in '16. And we also saw decent growth rates in Europe. So that's all feeling relatively good. China's a bit of a wildcard but still some growth. When it comes to interlayers they had a phenomenal year last year and automotive as well as a good architectural year in Europe. And on the automotive side, we've significantly faster than the market for a couple of reasons. One is we're seeing good the addressable market grow because a lot of the company OEMs are moving to putting laminated glass on the side windows and even the sunroofs. So the market's just getting bigger relative to OEM build rate. In addition, a lot more use of acoustics, both for quieting the cabin as well as lightweight in the windows, and heads-up displays been growing very strongly with a home mobility trend. It's now to figure out an extra as you've got to go to the Consumer Electronics Show for cars, and the heads-up displays a critical part of all those technology trends. So all of that allowing grow much faster than the OEM build rate, which is about 60%, 70% of the total for interlayers. So each business is a different story, but all of them are good ones."

I'll start on Slide 3. 2015 was another outstanding year for Eastman, as we continue to make excellent progress in our strategy to transform towards a specialty portfolio. We delivered our sixth consecutive year of solid EPS growth",391,"Good morning, everyone. I'll start on Slide 3. 2015 was another outstanding year for Eastman, as we continue to make excellent progress in our strategy to transform towards a specialty portfolio. We delivered our sixth consecutive year of solid EPS growth despite a very challenging global business environment and generated record free cash flow of $960 million, reflecting strong earnings as well as the benefit of recent acquisitions, which generated outstanding free cash flow.
A strong contributor to earnings growth in our specialty businesses in 2015 was the progress we made on organic growth initiatives. I'll highlight just a couple of examples. In Advanced Materials segment, our window interlayers, particularly our acoustic and heads-up display products, delivered solid double-digit volume growth for the year. Also in AM, we delivered very strong growth from our new optical film solutions for mobile devices. And in Additives & Functional Products, tackifying resins into tires was a strong contributor to overall growth in 2015.
These are just a few examples of how innovation and market development and supporting growth in an overall difficult environment. We also did a great job in 2015 to successfully integrating our recently acquired businesses. Each of these acquisitions were completed and aligns well with our strategy of delivering consistent superior value and combined, delivered over $0.50 a share in accretion for the year as expected.
In our cost management, we did an outstanding job in 2015, reflecting very strong productivity gains. Overall, we were able to more than offset inflation by about $25 million.
We also made substantial progress on reducing our net debt. Finally, during the year, we remain committed to returning cash to our stockholders. We increased our dividend by 15%, the sixth straight year of increases. And over at that time, we have more than doubled the dividend, and we repurchased more than $100 million of stock. This strong performance in so many fronts is a great testament to the strength of Eastman's portfolio and the integration and scale that has been built over decades. More importantly, I am very fortunate to work with such a strong team of employees, who consistently overcome challenges and find ways to deliver results for our stakeholders.
Now I hand the call over to Curt to cover the financial details for 2015, and then I'll come back to talk about 2016."

I'll start with our fourth quarter corporate results on Slide 4. We delivered solid earnings despite the many increasing challenges we faced during the quarter. The decline in revenue largely reflected lower selling prices due to lower raw material and energy costs.
Operating earnings were down somewhat. Positives include strong volume growth in Advanced Materials and strong operating margins in Adhesives & Plasticizers. Headwinds were low oil prices and the associated propane hedges, which largely impacted Specialty Fluids & Intermediates and lower volumes in Fibers.
Earnings per share was solid and included a lower tax rate year-over-year, which reflected the full year impact of the tax extenders enacted in December.
Next on Slide 5. Looking at the full year, we delivered outstanding results, reflecting the strengths and robustness of our strategy to transform to a specialty portfolio. Sales revenue increased slightly as sales from recently acquired businesses more than offset lower selling prices, which largely reflected lower raw material costs. Operating earnings increased in 3 of our segments with particularly strong earnings growth in Advanced Materials. Our operating margin for the year was 18%, an increase of nearly 100 basis points compared to 2014. Overall, we're very pleased with our results in a challenging business climate.
Moving next to the segment results beginning on Slide 6, Advanced Materials had an exceptional year as they continue to deliver on the elements of their strategy. Sales revenue increased due to higher sales volume and sales of products of the acquired performance films business. Offsets were currency and lower selling prices, which reflected lower raw material costs, particularly paraxylene for copolyesters. 
Operating earnings increased more than $100 million or about 40% due to a number of factors: volume growth and mixed improvement, volume from the acquisition, operational improvements and improved spread. The improved product mix was driven by increased sales of optical film solutions and premium interlayers.
The operating margin increased to roughly 17% from just over 12% in 2014. These results reflect execution of a strategy over a number of years to improve the operating margin in this business and to achieve an appropriate return given the investments made. We expect to build on this success going forward.
Moving next to Additives & Functional Products on Slide 7, which had a solid year. The revenue increase was due to the impact of the Taminco acquisition. This was partially offset by lower coatings and other formulated products, selling prices, which reflected lower raw material and energy costs as well as the impact of currency. Operating earnings were up year-over-year, reflecting both improved spread and the impact of the Taminco acquisition. The business did a great job managing value in the face of a slower growth environment, increased competitive rivalry and narrowing olefin spreads.
Moving next to Additives -- I'm sorry, Adhesives & Plasticizers on Slide 8. For 2015, sales revenue declined, primarily due to lower prices reflecting lower raw material costs and currency. Volume was about flat as growth in non-phthalate plasticizers, particularly in North America, was offset by lower adhesives resins volume due to the lack of availability of raw materials earlier in the year as well as some operational constraints. Operating earnings increased as improved spread was partially offset by propane hedges and currency. The operating margin increased to just under 20% as we did a good job of holding onto value through the year.
Now to Fibers on Slide 9. Revenue declined mainly due to lower acetate tow and acetyl chemicals sales volume. The decline in tow volume was mainly attributed to consumer destocking especially in China. And the decline in acetyl chemicals volume was due to increased sales to the cellulose acetate flake joint venture in Kingsport. Operating earnings were down year-over-year due to lower tow and acetyl chemicals volume. Despite the challenge for lower volume, the operating margin for the segment was 32%.
I'll finish the segment review with Specialty Fluids & Intermediates on Slide 10. Sales revenue decreased as lower selling prices and lower chemical and other intermediate sales volumes more than offset the impact of acquisitions. For operating earnings, we had a number of significant headwinds impacting results. The significant decline in oil prices reduced the North American shale gas advantage. And as the market became long in ethylene and propylene, the drop in olefin prices outpaced the decline in oil, further impacting margins. Also slower-than-expected economic growth in Asia led to an increased level of competitive import threats to the U.S. and Europe, and the impact of propane hedges was significant for this segment. These headwinds more than offset earnings from acquired businesses and commercial and productivity actions we took through the year. While operating earnings declined for the year, we did a good job managing through a challenging environment.
On Slide 11, I'll transition to the overview of cash flow and other financial highlights for 2015. We did an excellent job of generating cash in 2015 with operating cash flow over $1.6 billion. This is a new record for cash from operations as is our free cash flow of $960 million for the year. Capital expenditures totaled $652 million, below our previous expectations as we managed the pace of spend with the current economic environment while maintaining our growth investments. We expect to be at a similar level in 2016.
Looking at the balance sheet. Net debt stands at $6.7 billion as of year-end, reflecting almost $600 million in debt reduction for the year. Our cash flow, balance sheet and liquidity keep Eastman in a position of strength in an uncertain economy.
Our full year dividend was $238 million, and this included a 15% increase in the fourth quarter. In addition, we had $103 million in share repurchases through the year, including $55 million in the fourth quarter.
The combination of regular increases in our dividend and share repurchases reflected our continued confidence in future earnings and cash flows. And finally, our effective tax rate for the year was approximately 25%, which again includes the enactment of tax extenders during the fourth quarter as well as favorable geographic mix of earnings. We expect the effective tax rate for 2016 will be at a similar level, if not better as we continue to pursue opportunities to reduce this rate further. Overall, a strong year results given the challenging conditions.
And with that, I'll turn it back over to Mark."

We're, obviously, in a challenging macro environment and are using every lever to create value for our shareholders.
In the next few slides, I'll discuss some of these levers. First, our priority will be continued volume growth and mix upgrade in our specialties. We're aggressively increasing our cost-reduction activities, and we're also taking our next steps in portfolio management and organizational design, and we will return our strong free cash flow to shareholders.
On Slide 14, I want to provide you a quick view on our historical volume growth as a basis for our forward look. Over the last 5 years, we delivered 10% compounded volume growth. Let's start with the foundation before our acquisitions. The yellow line reflects volume growth from our heritage specialty businesses, which you roughly see a 3% compounded growth. And then we levered our strong free cash flow and very strong balance sheet to expand our connection to attractive end markets with high-quality specialty products through several attractive specialty acquisitions.
This organic growth, both in heritage Eastman and within our acquisitions, is a tribute to our management team on 2 fronts: one, we are driving high-growth and innovation platforms that is well above end-market growth rates; and second, we are doing an excellent job of balancing price-volume trade-offs in our core businesses.
It's a great story of organic growth and disciplined capital deployment. We're also not waiting around for market growth. We're focused on creating our own growth.
On Slide 15 you can see a depiction of how we execute our innovation and market development efforts. On the vertical axis are our key world-class technology platforms, and this is a combination of platforms that Eastman has had for decades: cellulose esters, polyesters, OXOs and hydrocarbon resins, and some that we recently acquired, PVBs and alkyl amines.
Across the horizontal axis are 4 key end markets, where we are concentrating our growth efforts. What you see is that we have a fairly concentrated set of initiatives that take advantage of our expertise in these platforms to help us further penetrate these attractive markets, some we've already mentioned this morning such as tire resins, acoustic and heads-up interdisplays -- interlayers and new mobile device displays. Others, we have discussed in the past, including Tritan, our next-generation copolyester coatings and microfibers.
We're making great progress with the innovation and market development portfolio, and I'm committed to accelerating investment in and emphasis on these efforts because I believe it is the key to Eastman's long-term success. We expect over the next 3 years that innovation and market development initiatives will add between 1% to 2% to overall Eastman revenue growth on a compounded basis, and that operating earnings for these revenues will be well above corporate average.
Moving next to Slide 16. We also recognize that we're in a tough economic environment that will require aggressive cost management. Over the last couple of years, we've been able to offset inflation with productivity and cost-reduction initiatives. And in 2015, we were able to do a little bit more with over $25 million falling to the bottom line.
This year, we know that in this very challenging environment, we need to do much more. We expect to double our productivity and cost-reduction efforts, so that they are in the range of $200 million. After offsetting inflation, we project these combined efforts contribute about $0.50 per share to EPS this year. And I want to emphasize that as we achieve these cost reductions, we will continue to invest in our innovation and market development initiatives. We have a great track record of cost management, and I'm highly confident we will manage and achieve these cost-reduction targets for '16.
That brings me to our outlook on Slide 17, and it starts with growth drivers that have been constant for us over the last 6 years. We have a strong portfolio of specialty businesses that are well positioned for growth. They have delivered over the last 6 years. We expect that to continue into '16 and beyond. In addition, we expect that our innovative specialty products will continue to grow strongly, improving product mix and accelerating overall earnings growth. As I mentioned on the previous slide, we are taking aggressive cost actions to add $0.50 a share.
In addition, we will achieve further cost synergies from the acquisitions as we have guided in the past. We're also looking at every other lever. We see further improvements in tax, as Curt mentioned, and pension costs. We also will repurchase shares with our industry-leading free cash flow after delevering in the back half of the year.
All that said, we face remaining -- we face some increasing near-term challenges. The further collapse in the price of oil recently has increased price pressure, especially in our olefin and acetyl products. Stagnant global economic growth combined with weakening Asia and European currencies are increasing some competitive activity in some products, and we further expect to see inventory destocking in Fibers in China.
In this challenging environment, we will drive hard to deliver EPS in 2016 that approaches our 2015 EPS, and we expect our EBITDA margins to be similar to 2015. Finally, we expect to deliver another strong year of free cash flow above $900 million.
Next on Slide 18. As an announcement that we are improving our business structure, which results in changes to the segments, in which we report our financial results. Principally, we are making changes that better align our business model to drive long-term growth and support our continued transformation to the specialty portfolio, in part this is enabled by the completion of the Taminco integration. This new structure should result in acceleration of growth opportunities in attractive markets. This also enables us to reduce cost in a more streamlined structure. And finally, this improved reporting structure will result in less complexity and enhanced visibility for those tracking our performance.
On Slide 19, you can see this new structure. The biggest change is that we have moved from 5 segments to 4 with the Adhesives business moving to Additives & Functional Products and the Plasticizer business moving to the new Chemical Intermediates segment. Adhesives and AFP will enable us to better manage our businesses in combination with our great success of our tackifying resins going into tires. We also see more opportunities in application development adhesives, and we can leverage our world-class market development, application development capability in AFP.
Plasticizers and distribution solvents from AFP will be better managed in chemical intermediates, where we have commercial excellence in managing pricing and asset utilization in a highly competitive environment.
In addition, there are various product line moves to enhance market connect. This reporting structure is effective here in the first quarter, and we provide -- we plan to provide historical segment results on the new segment basis prior to releasing first quarter earnings.
With these moves, the more specialty businesses are now in Additives & Functional Products and Advanced Materials and the significant majority of our oil exposure and olefins will now be in chemical intermediates.
Our 2016 earnings expectations for these segments are as follows: we expect another year of strong growth in Advanced Materials, driven by volume and mix upgrade. Additives & Functional Products is expected to remain stable despite a tough market with volume growth offsetting price pressures, including adhesives being modestly lower. For Fibers, we are expecting declining prices due to lower pulp prices and weakening currencies, which will be offset by cost actions we have taken.
Therefore, the key variable is volume. We expect continued destocking in China, but we don't know yet how far it'll go, and we expect to know more in the coming months. For chemical intermediates, we expect earnings to be lower, given the collapse in oil and the pressure on spreads in that business with the same trends impacting plasticizers. And once again, we believe this new business structure supports our strategy to transform towards a specialty portfolio. As you know, we have been on a long and committed journey to divest commodity businesses and add specialties.
On Slide 20, I'll provide an update on our portfolio management efforts. Having successfully integrated our attractive acquisitions in 2015, we're shifting our focus in 2016 towards portfolio optimization consistent with our long-term strategy. Over the last few years, we've been looking to divest our excess ethylene position that continues to be a source of earnings volatility. These efforts have been constrained due to pipeline dispute with Westlake, which we have discussed previously. With favorable rulings from the Texas Railroad Commission and the appeals court, we believe we can now move forward with our efforts to divest the excess ethylene. We are also pursuing strategic options for both excess ethylene and commodity olefin intermediates that are not essential to our specialty strategy and can be operationally segregated at the site.
Of course, the specific scope may vary depending on buyer interest and valuation. I also want to be clear that our integrated Texas site produces advantaged ethylene and propylene, much of which we translate into our specialty derivatives and as such will remain a critical integrated stream within our portfolio. We've hired investment bank to restart the process to monetize our excess ethylene position and the other commodity olefin-related product lines that are not essential to our long-term strategy. This effort will be one of our top priorities in 2016, and we'll provide more details later in the year as it progresses.
On Slide 21, here are our expectations for cash generation. As you can see on the bar chart, we have a history of generating strong free cash flow, particularly over the last 5 years. This reflects the strength of our solid core businesses as well as the transformation of our portfolio.
Looking at 2016, we expect free cash flow to be greater than $900 million. With this free cash flow, we expect to continue deleveraging, having reduced the debt by over $600 million in 2015, and we expect to complete our delevering in 2016 to get to approximately $1 billion of debt reduction. As a result, we've also committed to our investors in past calls that we expect to fully utilize our free cash flow to pay an increasing dividend, continue delevering and repurchase shares.
So in summary, on Slide 22, we've a strong portfolio specialty businesses that we are confident in and we know that are going to drive volume growth this year and continue to drive volume growth into the future. This organic set of initiatives, our innovation, our product mix improvement are essential to our strategy, and they were essential in how we grow value last year, this year and in the future.
We are committed to using every lever we have in this challenging environment, including increasing our cost-reduction efforts, and we will return our strong free cash to stockholders. So despite our short-term challenges this year, I'm confident we'll continue to deliver solid earnings growth in the long term and looking forward to -- and I'm looking forward to the questions on this call. Thank you."

That Workington closure was not included in that $100 million. So that's an additional plus. I'd also emphasize that you've got quite a bit of cost synergies continuing to flow in from the acquisitions on top of that $0.50 a share. So in collection, it adds up to a pretty significant number."

So Mark, as you think about your portfolio and you went through this exercise to resegment into 4, at what percent do you see it being commodity versus specialty in your mind? And I know you mentioned that you're going to restart the ethylene sale process. Are there other parts of the portfolio that you see is -- as perhaps not fitting longer-term into EMN?"

The first on the specialty part, with the resegmentation you should think about the parts of the products that we have that are commodity oriented that have been concentrated in chemical intermediates. So the other segments really don't have",520,"Sure, Frank. The first on the specialty part, with the resegmentation you should think about the parts of the products that we have that are commodity oriented that have been concentrated in chemical intermediates. So the other segments really don't have anything we consider to be commodities. And the reality is that even in specialty businesses when you have oil prices drop from $100 to $30, and you're oil-based, your customers sort of notice and expect that some of that raw material benefit is going to be shared with them. So throughout last year, we realized obviously significant raw material benefits in our specialties and our commodities. And the pace at which the price is shared within is very different. So in the commodities, it happens relatively quickly. In the specialties, you still give back value to your customers. If you don't do that and if you hold onto price very aggressively, which you can certainly do in a specialty, you set yourself up for volume cliff in the future. Because even if you're a proprietary product, and we have a number of ones where we're the only manufacturer in the world, if you don't share some of that value at an appropriate level, you put your customers on a jihad to find new suppliers, whether it's an alternative material or smaller competitor you might have or you are a very strong leader in a specialty business. So we do that. We have probably the most sophisticated commercial excellence and pricing systems I think in the industry, where we make these price volume trade offs all year long to make sure that we're sharing value but we're also maintaining the ability to grow volume in the long term. Over the year, that plays out and prices come down and to some degree and you take that into this year, and that's a bit of a headwind versus how you started last year. But no, I don't think our specialties are commoditizing at all. And what I love about most of our technology platforms is we have next-generation products building off of the same assets, whether it's the next generation of acoustics and heads-up display, attracting product, replacing some copolyesters in a series of opportunities going on to improve Crystex with our next-generation Crystex technology, et cetera. So we never sit around waiting for people to try and replicate as we always moving the ball down the field and advancing what we offer to our customers. So overall, I'd say the portfolio feels great on that front. What I did say, though, in my prepared remarks is we are expanding the scope of what we're considering selling beyond excess ethylene. So we are looking at what other olefins that have commodity behavior in chemical intermediates, a lot of volatility, a lot of distraction for investors and that is not essential to our long-term strategies, so they're not critical intermediates for our specialties. And so we're going to look at how much of that we can package with excess ethylene and find a buyer who values that olefin portfolio in their strategy."

So I think we'll have volume growth that will be like history and within that, I think we'll get some mix uplift that will be these high-growth specialty products that aren't necessarily huge volumes, but they're very attractive earnings and they provide a nice leverage to earnings, but we don't see a volume problem in this year. We think it continues to be solid. We think AM and AFP will have good volume growth. We think AFP's volume growth will be better this year than last year, when we look at -- because last year wasn't as much as we wanted, of course.

And it's obviously a very important one. As we look at it, we do see a lot of tailwinds as you noted, good volume growth, mix upgrade, the cost-reduction actions, the acquisition synergies, improvements in tax, pension costs as well as share account. So there are a number very attractive tailwinds for us, and there are really 2 principal issues as you've identified that are the headwinds. So how much spread compression do we take this year versus last year and this volume on Fibers. When it comes to the spread issue, I think that there's predominantly that spread for compression is going to be in chemical intermediates, but you'll feel a little bit of an AFP, which still will have some olefins in that segment, and we expect prices to come off a bit in adhesives, where things have been relatively tight last year. And so we'll have a little bit price get back and better volume growth this year netting each other but somewhat down. But the majority of the issue is really a spread issue. And then, of course, we put in an expectation of some additional destocking in Fibers. There's a lot of moving parts when it comes to oil, the economy, the uncertainty in destocking and I can combine those in a variety of different scenarios. The way I would suggest you all think about it is we're somewhere between stable to 2015 EPS and down 5% when I combine all of those different factors together and those I think give us that sort of range. Specific to FX, I'll let Curt answer that question."

Maybe the best way to look at it is if you think about just the net impact of hedges whether that was the cost of the propane hedges or the benefit of the currency hedges, net-net, that was probably a $0.60 headwind for us for the year. For '16, we think the net impact of these changes in hedges, net-net, is going to be about flat. This is was a little lower than we were thinking before, primarily due to the collapse of oil and the underlying impact on our propane hedges, but then that $0.60 impact really rolls off in '17 and '18."

We don't think there's anything undermining our long-term growth strategy of delivering attractive earnings growth in '17 and beyond. To Curt's point, if oil and currency stay where they at, we'll just get a natural $0.60 lift in '17 and '18, $0.60 a share lift as those roll off. If oil prices go up, our earnings will improve just as they've pressured it down. So either way, you look at you got earnings growth coming in '17 and '18 depending on your view about oil prices, because I think likely they'll be better than where they are today. In addition to that, you've got continued volume growth next year. You've got this transition of spread expansion in '15, normalizing a bit of those spreads in '16. That is a 2-year event when you're adjusting from $100 to $30 oil, but you don't have that in '16 anymore. That will be behind us. And then on top of that, we've got continued ways to improve costs and very importantly, we have a very strong free cash flow, and we'll be repurchasing shares starting in the back half of this year and strongly in '17. So while we are certainly disappointed about some of these challenges we're doing right now, we are focused on driving long-term growth and taking actions that make sense to maintain that volume growth long term and deliver strong earnings growth beyond this year and '17, '18 and beyond."

And when we look at cracking spreads, they obviously came in on the propylene side if you look at the first half versus the second half of the year, and our prices tracked with it, and we're taking that lower propylene price into this year. So certainly there's a first half headwind this year versus last year when it comes to propylene. The ethylene is sort of the opposite story. Ethylene prices were relatively good in first half of last year and then obviously, came off pretty significantly in the back half of last year. So it sort of the flip story there on sort of where it goes. But we expect ethylene prices to improve into the second quarter this year as is very large cracking maintenance schedule takes place this year, that should move ethylene prices back up a bit. We're not expecting it to go back to last year, but we certainly expect improvements versus right now. So moving parts there. On the coating side, the -- our customers there has done pretty good job -- sorry. I thought you had said something.

So with the tow business, first I'll take outside of China, which is the more straightforward story. What we've seen there is that destocking come to an end, and we expect volumes to be relatively stable into this year. Outside of China, we have seen prices come off some with the reduction in pulp prices and our competitors in Europe and Asia Pacific using their weakening currency as a way to attempt to chase volume. We, of course, defended our market position, but the prices did come down a bit. With all the cost actions we're taking in our business, we have been able to offset that pricing decline that we're seeing outside of China. So really it is about a pure question around what does a volume do in China at this point. And what I'd say is in -- well, from what we can see the Chinese National Tobacco Company made progress in their destocking in 2015, but not -- did not achieve their objectives in going as far as they wanted to. They have to walk a tight balance in delivering their tax revenue increase for the year, which they did do, which limits how far they can go in reducing production and achieving their inventory management goals. And so they're going to do another round of that this year and trying to work that inventory down. It's important to keep in mind as well that when you see this sort of volume issue in '15 and '16, a good portion of it is also CNTC backward integrating with tow suppliers. So we did our JV in the end of '14 with CNTC, and that is what led to a certain amount of volume decline in '15. And Daicel did a JV, which is going to be part of why volume goes down this year. So you shouldn't misinterpret that as a decline in primary demand. We don't see any issues with primary demand and see our consumption going to a decline. This is all about inventory management and some backward integration. The good news on the backward integration front is that we don't expect any other tow backward integration by CNTC until the 2019, '20 time frame. So that won't be an issue, again, as we go into '17 and '18 and other upside for sort of '17, '18 versus what we're seeing this year. So overall, I'd say it's -- we expect some decline, and we just have to wait and see how it goes with final conversations and content negotiation."

So from a demand point of view, everything seems to be on track. On the pricing side, it's a competitive business. We have a bunch of little small competitors in Asia, that we've been dealing with since 2012, and we're seeing some price pressure there. I'd say in one place, our Japanese competitors using their weakening yen to sort of chase volume, where we're once again defending our market position. So they're just giving up potential earnings growth, but -- and improving margins, but I think it's all playing out sort of as we plan. We feel very good about our new technology.

On the tire side, 75% of that business is roughly replacement. It's important to remember that we're levered to commercial tires much more so than passenger tires. When it comes to the amount of Crystex per tires, 10x in a commercial tire versus passengers. So what we see there is like the globe, the economy is getting better in the U.S., improving in Europe, and it's still growing in China, by the way, just not as fast as we'd all like. And so that's all sort of driving the need for replacement tires especially increased construction activity in North America and even some increased construction activity in Europe that we're seeing. So that's sort of how we talked about the tire side of it. On coatings, when you look at transportation and building construction, we expect a good year in North America, which is where we have our largest market share with the increasing construction rate of housing coming for us in '16. And we also saw decent growth rates in Europe. So that's all feeling relatively good. China is a bit of a wildcard but still some growth. When it comes to interlayers, they had a phenomenal year last year and automotive as well as a good architectural year in Europe. And on the automotive side, we grew significantly faster than the market for a couple of reasons: one is we're seeing the addressable market grow because a lot of the company OEMs are moving to putting laminated glass on the side windows and even the sunroofs. So the market is just getting bigger relative to OEM build rate. In addition, a lot more use of acoustics, both for quieting the cabin as well as lightweighting the windows, and heads-up displays growing very strongly with a whole mobility trend. It's now -- to figure out the next trends, you got to go to the Consumer Electronics Show for cars, and the heads-up displays is a critical part of all those technology trend. So all of that allowing to grow much faster than the OEM build rate, which is about 60%, 70% of the total for interlayers. So each business is a different story, but all of them are good ones."

So go into 4 segments, concentrating the olefins in one segment, where we can better manage that business and the volatility in day to day to make sure we capture the best value in the current market situation. That's why we pull the distribution solvents out of AFP and put plasticizers in there. It also allows us to look at all the options for what is best divested from this portfolio that certainly is a distraction for investors having a disproportionate impact on our evaluation and allow us to focus on our specialty strategy, because what you -- you're right, last year, we did a great job of growing our specialties. It was why we delivered earnings growth, and we're going to do it again this year and beyond, and that's where we should be spending our time and focusing our efforts. When it comes to acquisitions, as I said in the second quarter call and the third quarter call last year, we're not looking for a large M&A. We're looking to focus and growing our platforms that we have. We have a lot of great organic growth initiatives kicking into gear already and ones that are about to come especially in AFP. Those were a little bit behind in cycle relative to Advanced Materials. So you're going to hear a lot more stories about that as we go forward, but we're not looking for any large M&A. It's always possible to find some bolt-on M&A that might be attractive that dramatically improves the business we're in like we did last year in Advanced Materials with our Commonwealth acquisition, but our focus right now is generating cash flow and repurchasing shares."

I'll start on Slide 3. 2015 was another outstanding year for Eastman, as we continue to make excellent progress in our strategy to transform towards a specialty portfolio. We delivered our sixth consecutive year of solid EPS growth",391,"Good morning, everyone. I'll start on Slide 3. 2015 was another outstanding year for Eastman, as we continue to make excellent progress in our strategy to transform towards a specialty portfolio. We delivered our sixth consecutive year of solid EPS growth despite a very challenging global business environment and generated record free cash flow of $960 million, reflecting strong earnings as well as the benefit of recent acquisitions, which generate outstanding free cash flow.
A strong contributor to earnings growth in our specialty businesses in 2015 was the progress we made on organic growth initiatives. I'll highlight just a couple of examples. In Advanced Materials segment, our window interlayers, particularly our acoustic and heads-up display products, delivered solid double-digit volume growth for the year. Also in AM, we delivered very strong growth from our new optical film solutions for mobile devices. And in Additives & Functional Products, tackifying resins into tires was a strong contributor to overall growth in 2015.
These are just a few examples of how innovation and market development is supporting growth in an overall difficult environment. We also did a great job in 2015 to successfully integrating our recently acquired businesses. Each of these acquisitions were completed and aligns well with our strategy of delivering consistent superior value and, combined, delivered over $0.50 a share in accretion for the year as expected.
In our cost management, we did an outstanding job in 2015, reflecting very strong productivity gains. Overall, we were able to more than offset inflation by about $25 million.
We also made substantial progress on reducing our net debt. Finally, during the year, we remained committed to returning cash to our stockholders. We increased our dividend by 15%, the sixth straight year of increases. And over at that time, we have more than doubled the dividend, and we repurchased more than $100 million of stock. This strong performance on so many fronts is a great testament to the strength of Eastman's portfolio and the integration and scale that has been built over decades. More importantly, I am very fortunate to work with such a strong team of employees, who consistently overcome challenges and find ways to deliver results for our stakeholders.
Now I'll hand the call over to Curt to cover the financial details for 2015, and then I'll come back to talk about 2016."
109103,321971239,923766,"Eastman Chemical Co., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 29, 2016",2016-01-29,"Earnings Calls","Eastman Chemical Company","Executives","Thanks, Mark. Good morning, everyone. Since we have a lot to cover today, I'll be brief with my comments. I'll start with our fourth quarter corporate results on Slide 4. We delivered solid earnings despite the many increasing challenges we faced during t",1083,"Thanks, Mark. Good morning, everyone. Since we have a lot to cover today, I'll be brief with my comments. I'll start with our fourth quarter corporate results on Slide 4. We delivered solid earnings despite the many increasing challenges we faced during the quarter. The decline in revenue largely reflected lower selling prices due to lower raw material and energy costs.
Operating earnings were down somewhat. Positives include strong volume growth in Advanced Materials and strong operating margins in Adhesives & Plasticizers. Headwinds were low oil prices and the associated propane hedges, which largely impacted Specialty Fluids & Intermediates and lower volumes in Fibers.
Earnings per share was solid and included a lower tax rate year-over-year, which reflected the full year impact of the tax extenders enacted in December.
Next on Slide 5. Looking at the full year, we delivered outstanding results, reflecting the strengths and robustness of our strategy to transform to a specialty portfolio. Sales revenue increased slightly as sales from recently acquired businesses more than offset lower selling prices, which largely reflected lower raw material costs. Operating earnings increased in 3 of our segments with particularly strong earnings growth in Advanced Materials. Our operating margin for the year was 18%, an increase of nearly 100 basis points compared to 2014. Overall, we're very pleased with our results in a challenging business climate.
Moving next to the segment results beginning on Slide 6, Advanced Materials had an exceptional year as they continued to deliver on the elements of their strategy. Sales revenue increased due to higher sales volume and sales of products of the acquired performance films business. Offsets were currency and lower selling prices, which reflected lower raw material costs, particularly paraxylene for copolyesters. 
Operating earnings increased more than $100 million or about 40% due to a number of factors: volume growth and mixed improvement, volume from the acquisition, operational improvements and improved spread. The improved product mix was driven by increased sales of optical film solutions and premium interlayers.
The operating margin increased to roughly 17% from just over 12% in 2014. These results reflect execution of a strategy over a number of years to improve the operating margin in this business and to achieve an appropriate return given the investments made. We expect to build on this success going forward.
Moving next to Additives & Functional Products on Slide 7, which had a solid year. The revenue increase was due to the impact of the Taminco acquisition. This was partially offset by lower coatings and other formulated products' selling prices, which reflected lower raw material and energy costs as well as the impact of currency. Operating earnings were up year-over-year, reflecting both improved spread and the impact of the Taminco acquisition. The business did a great job managing value in the face of a slower growth environment, increased competitive rivalry and narrowing olefin spreads.
Moving next to Additives -- I'm sorry, Adhesives & Plasticizers on Slide 8. For 2015, sales revenue declined, primarily due to lower prices reflecting lower raw material costs and currency. Volume was about flat as growth in non-phthalate plasticizers, particularly in North America, was offset by lower adhesives resins volume due to the lack of availability of raw materials earlier in the year as well as some operational constraints. Operating earnings increased as improved spread was partially offset by propane hedges and currency. The operating margin increased to just under 20% as we did a good job of holding onto value through the year.
Now to Fibers on Slide 9. Revenue declined mainly due to lower acetate tow and acetyl chemicals sales volume. The decline in tow volume was mainly attributed to consumer destocking especially in China. And the decline in acetyl chemicals volume was due to increased sales to the cellulose acetate flake joint venture in Kingsport. Operating earnings were down year-over-year due to lower tow and acetyl chemicals volume. Despite the challenge for lower volume, the operating margin for the segment was 32%.
I'll finish the segment review with Specialty Fluids & Intermediates on Slide 10. Sales revenue decreased as lower selling prices and lower chemical and other intermediate sales volumes more than offset the impact of acquisitions. For operating earnings, we had a number of significant headwinds impacting results. The significant decline in oil prices reduced the North American shale gas advantage. And as the market became long in ethylene and propylene, the drop in olefin prices outpaced the decline in oil, further impacting margins. Also slower-than-expected economic growth in Asia led to an increased level of competitive import threats to the U.S. and Europe, and the impact of propane hedges was significant for this segment. These headwinds more than offset earnings from acquired businesses and commercial and productivity actions we took through the year. While operating earnings declined for the year, we did a good job managing through a challenging environment.
On Slide 11, I'll transition to the overview of cash flow and other financial highlights for 2015. We did an excellent job of generating cash in 2015 with operating cash flow over $1.6 billion. This is a new record for cash from operations as is our free cash flow of $960 million for the year. Capital expenditures totaled $652 million, below our previous expectations as we managed the pace of spend with the current economic environment while maintaining our growth investments. We expect to be at a similar level in 2016.
Looking at the balance sheet. Net debt stands at $6.7 billion as of year-end, reflecting almost $600 million in debt reduction for the year. Our cash flow, balance sheet and liquidity keep Eastman in a position of strength in an uncertain economy.
Our full year dividend was $238 million, and this included a 15% increase in the fourth quarter. In addition, we had $103 million in share repurchases through the year, including $55 million in the fourth quarter.
The combination of regular increases in our dividend and share repurchases reflected our continued confidence in future earnings and cash flows. And finally, our effective tax rate for the year was approximately 25%, which again includes the enactment of tax extenders during the fourth quarter as well as favorable geographic mix of earnings. We expect the effective tax rate for 2016 will be at a similar level, if not better, as we continue to pursue opportunities to reduce this rate further. Overall, a strong year results given the challenging conditions.
And with that, I'll turn it back over to Mark."

We're obviously in a challenging macro environment and are using every lever to create value for our shareholders.
In the next few slides, I'll discuss some of these levers. First, our priority will be continued volume growth and mix upgrade in our specialties. We're aggressively increasing our cost-reduction activities, and we're also taking our next steps in portfolio management and organizational design, and we will return our strong free cash flow to shareholders.
On Slide 14, I want to provide you a quick view on our historical volume growth as a basis for our forward look. Over the last 5 years, we delivered 10% compounded volume growth. Let's start with the foundation before our acquisitions. The yellow line reflects volume growth from our heritage specialty businesses, which you roughly see a 3% compounded growth. And then we levered our strong free cash flow and very strong balance sheet to expand our connection to attractive end markets with high-quality specialty products through several attractive specialty acquisitions.
This organic growth, both in heritage Eastman and within our acquisitions, is a tribute to our management team on 2 fronts: one, we are driving high-growth in innovation platforms that is well above end-market growth rates; and second, we are doing an excellent job of balancing price-volume trade-offs in our core businesses.
It's a great story of organic growth and disciplined capital deployment. We're also not waiting around for market growth. We're focused on creating our own growth.
On Slide 15 you can see a depiction of how we execute our innovation and market development efforts. On the vertical axis are our key world-class technology platforms, and this is a combination of platforms that Eastman has had for decades: cellulose esters, polyesters, OXOs and hydrocarbon resins, and some that we recently acquired, PVBs and alkyl amines.
Across the horizontal axis are 4 key end markets, where we are concentrating our growth efforts. What you see is that we have a fairly concentrated set of initiatives that take advantage of our expertise in these platforms to help us further penetrate these attractive markets, some we've already mentioned this morning such as tire resins, acoustic and heads-up interdisplays -- interlayers and new mobile device displays. Others, we have discussed in the past, including Tritan, our next-generation copolyester coatings and microfibers.
We're making great progress with the innovation and market development portfolio, and I'm committed to accelerating investment in and emphasis on these efforts because I believe it is the key to Eastman's long-term success. We expect over the next 3 years that innovation and market development initiatives will add between 1% to 2% to overall Eastman revenue growth on a compounded basis, and that operating earnings for these revenues will be well above corporate average.
Moving next to Slide 16. We also recognize that we are in a tough economic environment that will require aggressive cost management. Over the last couple of years, we've been able to offset inflation with productivity and cost-reduction initiatives. And in 2015, we were able to do a little bit more with over $25 million falling to the bottom line.
This year, we know that in this very challenging environment, we need to do much more. We expect to double our productivity and cost-reduction efforts, so that they are in the range of $200 million. After offsetting inflation, we project these combined efforts contributed about $0.50 per share to EPS this year. And I want to emphasize that as we achieve these cost reductions, we will continue to invest in our innovation and market development initiatives. We have a great track record of cost management, and I'm highly confident we will manage and achieve these cost-reduction targets for '16.
That brings me to our outlook on Slide 17, and it starts with growth drivers that have been constant for us over the last 6 years. We have a strong portfolio of specialty businesses that are well positioned for growth. They have delivered over the last 6 years. We expect that to continue into '16 and beyond. In addition, we expect that our innovative specialty products will continue to grow strongly, improving product mix and accelerating overall earnings growth. As I mentioned on the previous slide, we are taking aggressive cost actions to add $0.50 a share.
In addition, we will achieve further cost synergies from the acquisitions as we have guided in the past. We're also looking at every other lever. We see further improvements in tax, as Curt mentioned, and pension costs. We also will repurchase shares with our industry-leading free cash flow after delevering in the back half of the year.
All that said, we face remaining -- we face some increasing near-term challenges. The further collapse in the price of oil recently has increased price pressure, especially in our olefin and acetyl products. Stagnant global economic growth combined with weakening Asia and European currencies are increasing some competitive activity in some products. And we further expect to see inventory destocking in Fibers in China.
In this challenging environment, we will drive hard to deliver EPS in 2016 that approaches our 2015 EPS, and we expect our EBITDA margins to be similar to 2015. Finally, we expect to deliver another strong year of free cash flow above $900 million.
Next on Slide 18 is an announcement that we are improving our business structure, which results in changes to the segments in which we report our financial results. Principally, we are making changes that better align our business model to drive long-term growth and support our continued transformation to the specialty portfolio. In part this is enabled by the completion of the Taminco integration. This new structure should result in acceleration of growth opportunities in attractive markets. This also enables us to reduce cost in a more streamlined structure. And finally, this improved reporting structure will result in less complexity and enhanced visibility for those tracking our performance.
On Slide 19, you can see this new structure. The biggest change is that we have moved from 5 segments to 4 with the Adhesives business moving to Additives & Functional Products and the Plasticizer business moving to the new Chemical Intermediates segment. Adhesives in AFP will enable us to better manage our businesses in combination with our great success of our tackifying resins going into tires. We also see more opportunities in application development adhesives, and we can leverage our world-class market development, application development capability in AFP.
Plasticizers and distribution solvents from AFP will be better managed in Chemical Intermediates, where we have commercial excellence in managing pricing and asset utilization in a highly competitive environment.
In addition, there are various product line moves to enhance market connect. This reporting structure is effective here in the first quarter, and we provide -- we plan to provide historical segment results on the new segment basis prior to releasing first quarter earnings.
With these moves, the more specialty businesses are now in Additives & Functional Products and Advanced Materials and the significant majority of our oil exposure and olefins will now be in Chemical Intermediates.
Our 2016 earnings expectations for these segments are as follows: we expect another year of strong growth in Advanced Materials, driven by volume and mix upgrades. Additives & Functional Products is expected to remain stable despite a tough market with volume growth offsetting price pressures, including adhesives being modestly lower. For Fibers, we are expecting declining prices due to lower pulp prices and weakening currencies, which will be offset by cost actions we have taken.
Therefore, the key variable is volume. We expect continued destocking in China, but we don't know yet how far it'll go, and we expect to know more in the coming months. For chemical intermediates, we expect earnings to be lower, given the collapse in oil and the pressure on spreads in that business with the same trends impacting plasticizers. And once again, we believe this new business structure supports our strategy to transform towards a specialty portfolio. As you know, we have been on a long and committed journey to divest commodity businesses and add specialties.
On Slide 20, I'll provide an update on our portfolio management efforts. Having successfully integrated our attractive acquisitions in 2015, we're shifting our focus in 2016 towards portfolio optimization consistent with our long-term strategy. Over the last few years, we've been looking to divest our excess ethylene position that continues to be a source of earnings volatility. These efforts have been constrained due to pipeline dispute with Westlake, which we have discussed previously. With favorable rulings from the Texas Railroad Commission and the appeals court, we believe we can now move forward with our efforts to divest the excess ethylene. We are also pursuing strategic options for both excess ethylene and commodity olefin intermediates that are not essential to our specialty strategy and can be operationally segregated at the site.
Of course, the specific scope may vary depending on buyer interest and valuation. I also want to be clear that our integrated Texas site produces advantaged ethylene and propylene, much of which we translate into our specialty derivatives and as such will remain a critical integrated stream within our portfolio. We've hired an investment bank to restart the process to monetize our excess ethylene position and the other commodity olefin-related product lines that are not essential to our long-term strategy. This effort will be one of our top priorities in 2016, and we'll provide more details later in the year as it progresses.
On Slide 21, here are our expectations for cash generation. As you can see on the bar chart, we have a history of generating strong free cash flow, particularly over the last 5 years. This reflects the strength of our solid core businesses as well as the transformation of our portfolio.
Looking at 2016, we expect free cash flow to be greater than $900 million. With this free cash flow, we expect to continue deleveraging, having reduced the debt by over $600 million in 2015, and we expect to complete our delevering in 2016 to get to approximately $1 billion of debt reduction. As a result, we've also committed to our investors in past calls that we expect to fully utilize our free cash flow to pay an increasing dividend, continue delevering and repurchase shares.
So in summary, on Slide 22, we've a strong portfolio specialty businesses that we are confident in and we know that are going to drive volume growth this year and continue to drive volume growth into the future. This organic set of initiatives, our innovation, our product mix improvement are essential to our strategy, and they were essential in how we grow value last year, this year and in the future.
We are committed to using every lever we have in this challenging environment, including increasing our cost-reduction efforts, and we will return our strong free cash to stockholders. So despite our short-term challenges this year, I'm confident we'll continue to deliver solid earnings growth in the long term and looking forward to -- and I'm looking forward to the questions on this call. Thank you."

So Mark, as you think about your portfolio and you went through this exercise to resegment into 4, at what percent do you see it being commodity versus specialty in your mind? 
And I know you mentioned that you're going to restart the ethylene sale process. Are there other parts of the portfolio that you see is -- as perhaps not fitting longer-term into EMN?"
109103,321971239,923766,"Eastman Chemical Co., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 29, 2016",2016-01-29,"Earnings Calls","Eastman Chemical Company","Executives","Sure, Frank.

So the other segments really don't have",521,"Sure, Frank. The first on the specialty part, with the resegmentation you should think about the parts of the products that we have that are commodity oriented that have been concentrated in chemical intermediates. So the other segments really don't have anything we consider to be commodities. And the reality is that even in specialty businesses when you have oil prices drop from $100 to $30, and you're oil-based, your customers sort of notice and expect that some of that raw material benefit is going to be shared with them. So throughout last year, we realized obviously significant raw material benefits in our specialties and our commodities. And the pace at which the price is shared with them is very different. So in the commodities, it happens relatively quickly. In the specialties, you still give back value to your customers. If you don't do that and if you hold onto price very aggressively, which you can certainly do in a specialty, you set yourself up for volume cliff in the future. Because even if you're a proprietary product, and we have a number of ones where we're the only manufacturer in the world, if you don't share some of that value at an appropriate level, you put your customers on a jihad to find new suppliers, whether it's an alternative material or smaller competitor you might have or you are a very strong leader in a specialty business. So we do that. We have probably the most sophisticated commercial excellence and pricing systems I think in the industry, where we make these price volume trade-offs all year long to make sure that we're sharing value but we're also maintaining the ability to grow volume in the long term. Over the year, that plays out and prices come down and to some degree and you take that into this year, and that's a bit of a headwind versus how you started last year. But no, I don't think our specialties are commoditizing at all. And what I love about most of our technology platforms is we have next-generation products building off of the same assets, whether it's the next generation of acoustics and heads-up display, the Tritan product, replacing some copolyesters in a series of opportunities going on to improve Crystex with our next-generation Crystex technology, et cetera. So we never sit around waiting for people to try and replicate as we always moving the ball down the field and advancing what we offer to our customers. 
So, no, overall I'd say the portfolio feels great on that front. What I did say, though, in my prepared remarks is we are expanding the scope of what we're considering selling beyond excess ethylene. So we are looking at what other olefins that have commodity behavior in chemical intermediates, a lot of volatility, a lot of distraction for investors that is not essential to our long-term strategy, so they're not critical intermediates for our specialties. And so we're going to look at how much of that we can package with excess ethylene and find a buyer who values that olefin portfolio in their strategy."

And it's obviously a very important one. As we look at it, we do see a lot of tailwinds as you noted, good volume growth, mix upgrade, the cost-reduction actions, the acquisition synergies, improvements in tax, pension costs as well as share count. So there are a number very attractive tailwinds for us, and there are really 2 principal issues as you've identified that are the headwinds. So how much spread compression do we take this year versus last year and this volume on Fibers. When it comes to the spread issue, I think that there's predominantly that spread for compression is going to be in Chemical Intermediates, but you also feel a little bit of it in AFP, which still will have some olefins in that segment, and we expect prices to come off a bit in adhesives, where things have been relatively tight last year. And so we'll have a little bit price give back and better volume growth this year netting each other but somewhat down. But the majority of the issue is really a spread issue. And then, of course, we put in an expectation of some additional destocking in Fibers. There's a lot of moving parts when it comes to oil, the economy, the uncertainty in destocking and I can combine those in a variety of different scenarios. The way I would suggest you all think about it is we're somewhere between stable to 2015 EPS and down 5% when I combine all of those different factors together and those I think give us that sort of range. Specific to FX, I'll let Curt answer that question."

This is was a little lower than we were thinking before, primarily due to the collapse of oil and the underlying impact on our propane hedges, but then that $0.60 impact really rolls off in '17 and '18."

We don't think there's anything undermining our long-term growth strategy of delivering attractive earnings growth in '17 and beyond. To Curt's point, if oil and currency stay where they at, we'll just get a natural $0.60 lift in '17 and '18, $0.60 a share lift as those roll off. If oil prices go up, our earnings will improve just as they've pressured it down. So either way, you look at you got earnings growth coming in '17 and '18 depending on your view about oil prices, because I think likely they'll be better than where they are today. In addition to that, you've got continued volume growth next year. You've got this transition of spread expansion in '15, normalizing a bit of those spreads in '16. That is a 2-year event when you're adjusting from $100 to $30 oil, but you don't have that in '16 anymore. That will be behind us. And then on top of that, we've got continued ways to improve costs and very importantly, we have a very strong free cash flow, and we'll be repurchasing shares starting in the back half of this year and strongly in '17. So while we are certainly disappointed about some of these challenges we're doing right now, we are focused on driving long-term growth and taking actions that make sense to maintain that volume growth long term and deliver strong earnings growth beyond this year and '17, '18 and beyond."

And when we look at cracking spreads, they obviously came in on the propylene side if you look at the first half versus the second half of the year, and our prices tracked with it, and we're taking that lower propylene price into this year. So certainly there's a first half headwind this year versus last year when it comes to propylene. The ethylene is sort of the opposite story. Ethylene prices were relatively good in first half of last year and then obviously, came off pretty significantly in the back half of last year. So it's sort of the flip story there on sort of where it goes. But we expect ethylene prices to improve into the second quarter this year as this very large cracking maintenance schedule takes place this year, that should move ethylene prices back up a bit. We're not expecting it to go back to last year, but we certainly expect improvements versus right now. So moving parts there. On the coating side, the -- our customers there has done pretty good job -- sorry. I thought you had said something. On the coating side, we certainly saw our customers do a very good job of working with us and getting their prices down on the propylene-related derivatives and getting a benefit from that."

So with the tow business, first I'll take outside of China, which is the more straightforward story. What we've seen there is that destocking come to an end, and we expect volumes to be relatively stable into this year. Outside of China, we have seen prices come off some with the reduction in pulp prices and our competitors in Europe and Asia Pacific using their weakening currency as a way to attempt to chase volume. We, of course, defended our market position, but the prices did come down a bit. With all the cost actions we're taking in that business, we have been able to offset that pricing decline that we're seeing outside of China. So really it is about a pure question around what does a volume do in China at this point. And what I'd say is in -- well, from what we can see the Chinese National Tobacco Company made progress in their destocking in 2015, but not -- did not achieve their objectives in going as far as they wanted to. They have to walk a tight balance in delivering their tax revenue increase for the year, which they did do, which limits how far they can go in reducing production and achieving their inventory management goals. And so they're going to do another round of that this year and trying to work that inventory down. It's important to keep in mind as well that when you see this sort of volume issue in '15 and '16, a good portion of it is also CNTC backward integrating with tow suppliers. So we did our JV in the end of '14 with CNTC, and that is what led to a certain amount of volume decline in '15. And Daicel did a JV, which is going to be part of why volume goes down this year. So you shouldn't misinterpret that as a decline in primary demand. We don't see any issues with primary demand and see our consumption going to a decline. This is all about inventory management and some backward integration. The good news on the backward integration front is that we don't expect any other tow backward integration by CNTC until the 2019, '20 time frame. So that won't be an issue, again, as we go into '17 and '18, another upside for sort of '17, '18 versus what we're seeing this year. So overall, I'd say it's -- we expect some decline, and we just have to wait and see how it goes with final conversations and contract negotiation."

So from a demand point of view, everything seems to be on track. On the pricing side, it's a competitive business. We have a bunch of little small competitors in Asia, that we've been dealing with since 2012, and we're seeing some price pressure there. I'd say in one place, our Japanese competitors using their weakening yen to sort of chase volume, where we're once again defending our market position. So they're just giving up potential earnings growth, but -- and improving margins, but I think it's all playing out sort of as we plan. We feel very good about our new technology.

And we also saw decent growth rates in Europe. So that's all feeling relatively good. China is a bit of a wildcard but still some growth. When it comes to interlayers, they had a phenomenal year last year and automotive as well as a good architectural year in Europe. And on the automotive side, we grew significantly faster than the market for a couple of reasons: one is we're seeing the addressable market grow because a lot of the company OEMs are moving to putting laminated glass on the side windows and even the sunroofs. So the market is just getting bigger relative to OEM build rate. In addition, a lot more use of acoustics, both for quieting in the cabin as well as light-weighting the windows, and heads-up displays growing very strongly with a whole mobility trend. It's now -- to figure out the next trends, you got to go to the Consumer Electronics Show for cars, and the heads-up displays is a critical part of all those technology trends. So all of that allowing to grow much faster than the OEM build rate, which is about 60%, 70% of the total for interlayers. So each business is a different story, but all of them are good ones."

So going to 4 segments, concentrating the olefins in one segment where we can better manage that business and the volatility in day to day to make sure we capture the best value in the current market situation. That's why we pulled the distribution solvents out of AFP and put plasticizers in there. It also allows us to look at all the options for what is best divested from this portfolio that certainly is a distraction for investors having a disproportionate impact on our evaluation and allow us to focus on our specialty strategy, because what you -- you're right, last year, we did a great job of growing our specialties. It was why we delivered earnings growth, and we're going to do it again this year and beyond, and that's where we should be spending our time and focusing our efforts. 
When it comes to acquisitions, as I said in the second quarter call and the third quarter call last year, we're not looking for a large M&A. We're looking to focus in growing our platforms that we have. We have a lot of great organic growth initiatives kicking into gear already and ones that are about to come especially in AFP. Those were a little bit behind in cycle relative to Advanced Materials. So you're going to hear a lot more stories about that as we go forward, but we're not looking for any large M&A. It's always possible to find some bolt-on M&A that might be attractive that dramatically improves the business we're in like we did last year in Advanced Materials with our Commonwealth acquisition, but our focus right now is generating cash flow and repurchasing shares."

We had a solid start of the year with the first quarter results, which were slightly better than our expectations. Overall, our strategy is working. We did a great job of holding onto value through the quarter as we increased our operating margin by 40 basis points or over 18%. We continue to upgrade the quality of our product mix by growing high-margin specialty product lines, a key component of our winning strategy. 
To see more of our strategy in action, I recently traveled to visit customers in Asia, and I'm really excited about all the innovation and customer engagement that's gaining traction across the region from India to China to Japan. In India, we secured our first commercial success on our next-generation polyester coatings platform with a leading manufacturer of SUVs and tractors. As I met with them, I was excited to see their engagement and enthusiasm for our solution and how it could significantly improve their ability to maintain their leadership cost effectively. 
With increasing expectations from the emerging middle class in India and new western competitors, this customer faced a challenge. Upgrade the durability and glass retention of their mono coat coating were spent significant money to build a more expensive 2-coat systems. Our revolutionary next-gen polyester coating enabled them to achieve best-in-class performance with a mono coat instead of moving to a much more expensive 2-coat solution. We were there last September when the first SUVs rolled off the assembly line, a short 15 months after the project started in, and now there are more than 30,000 SUVs on the road. 
Key to this success was a tremendous partnership built between this auto OEM, their exceptional coatings formulator and Eastman. We started with auto coatings, and we're making tremendous progress in industrial and package coatings as well. 
In China, we recently partnered with a leading local housewares brand to launch a product line that utilizes their tracking copolyester, and we're seeing increased local need for greater product safety and durability. Similar to success in India, this customer's looking for a way to differentiate themselves from other local competitors, and I'm very bullish on this market expansion into China for a product that is predominantly been sold to North America and European consumers. 
As part of our success, we are providing training to the company's 20,000-person sales force that works throughout department stores in China, who were pitching our Tritan value proposition for us everyday. These are just 2 of many examples where we're succeeding by helping our customers through innovation. 
On the cost management front, we are well on track with our corporate cost-reduction efforts without sacrificing our long-term growth initiatives. Our SG&A and R&D as a percentage of sales remains in the low -- lowest quartile of our peers, which is a function of our scale and integration and the great discipline of our employees. We've also made excellent progress in reducing manufacturing costs. Productivity is in the DNA of Eastman, and we continue to succeed. 
Cash flow is consistent with our expectations, and we are on track to deliver another strong year of free cash flow, enabling our increasing dividend, deleveraging and repurchasing shares in the back half of the year. 
Beyond these great results, we've also been the recipient of numerous awards over the past several months, which highlight many of the qualities our stakeholders have come to expect from Eastman. We received the Glassdoor Employees Choice Award honoring the best places to work. What I valued most of this -- about this award is it's based solely on the input of employees. We're the only chemical company to be in the top 50 best place to work ever, and this is our third year in a row we've been honored. The award speaks to our winning culture, which enable us to innovate with our customers and integrate our acquisition so successfully. 
We're also named one of the world's most ethical companies for the third consecutive year by Ethisphere for outstanding corporate ethics and corporate responsibility, characteristics highly valued by our employees, our communities and our customers. 
Finally, we were recognized by the EPAs and Energy Star Partner of the Year award, becoming the only chemical company to ever receive this recognition consecutively for 5 years in a row, and only 2 other chemical companies have received it once. This is a great win for both the environment and our cost structure. 
Our solid first quarter results and the continued recognition we're receiving are direct result of the great work being done by Eastman employees around the world, and I want to thank them for their outstanding contributions. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Curt."

Thanks, Mark, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. I know it's been a busy week for you. I want to go off script for a second here just to pile on a little to Mark's comments.

I want to go off script for a second here just to pile on a little to Mark's comments. I'm now coming on -- the CFO now coming on 8 years, and I just wanted to express the excitement we have with our various growth programs. When I look through my finance lens, I'm convinced that these growth programs will lead to meaningful revenue growth and strong returns for the coming years, and it's a real pleasure to watch a winning strategy get executed by Mark and our business technology and strategy teams despite this business climate that we're facing and to be a part about high-performing, winning culture that Mark talked about. 
So many of you know this already. Good things are happening at Eastman that will benefit both 2016 and beyond. 
So with that, let me get back to my prepared remarks. I'll start on our first quarter corporate results on Slide 4. Overall, we delivered a solid quarter in a challenging business climate. Sales revenue declined as sales -- solid sales line growth was more than offset by lower selling prices. As we expected, the largest decline was in the Chemical Intermediates segment, where low oil has its greatest impact. 
Our operating earnings decreased as strong performance in Advanced Materials was more than offset by a decline in Chemical Intermediates. Overall, earnings per share was solid, reflecting good quality earnings and a lower tax rate, and I'm proud of how our commercial teams are finding the right balance of retaining appropriate value given the attributes and value proposition of our specialties and sharing some that benefit of lower raws with our customers. 
On Slide 5, I'll transition to an overview of our cash flow and other financial highlights for the year -- or for the quarter, sorry. We continue to do an excellent job of generating cash with first quarter operating cash flow of $47 million in what is typically our lowest quarter. These results reflect our normal beginning of the year working capital build. 
Capital expenditures totaled $110 million. We continue to manage the pace of capital spending with the current economic environment while maintaining growth investments. We expect full year capital expenditures to be approximately $650 million, maybe a little less as the year unfolds. 
Free cash flow was a negative $63 million for the quarter, consistent with our expectations. Our first quarter dividend was $68 million. Our effective tax rate for the first quarter improved to approximately 24%. We continue to expect our full year tax rate will be between 24% and 25%, reflecting the continued benefits of our improved business operations, and we'll continue doing what we can to be at the lower end of that range. 
For free cash flow, we remain on track to be above $900 million. As a whole, I'm pleased with our earnings and cash flow per to start the year. 
On Slides 6 and 7, I'll provide an overview of the 2 segments most affected by our business restructuring. This is the first quarter we're reporting under the new business structure. So we thought these would be helpful. 
First under our new structure, Additives & Functional Products is well positioned for GDP-plus growth with an attractive market footprint and diverse geographic profile. Our transportation exposure is about 75% replacement, 25% OEM. This split is similar for building and construction. 
Performance drivers for the segment include increasing demand for quality vehicles, the improvement in housing market and increasing use of consumables by growing middle class, and we remain focused on attractive secular growth end markets, where innovation and deep customer connect offer a clear competitive advantage. 
As we look forward, I'm excited about the growth we expect from our innovation projects. Mark already shared an exceptional story of rapid innovation in India. We are continuing to see strong growth in our tire resins as a performance additive and strong growth in our low VLC, low order for architectural paints, and we're just getting started with integration efforts in alkylamine specialties. 
Next on Slide 7, the new Chemical Intermediates segment, which now comprises the majority of our olefins exposure. We'll benefit from advantaged market positions in key intermediates, particularly in North America. Performance drivers for this segment include growing middle class, continued adoption of nonphthalate plasticizers and North American shale gas advantage. In addition, flexible market outlets will drive our asset utilization and support growth for our strategic specialty product lines. Overall, the segment has a set of good value-adding businesses, which benefit from scale, integration and reliability and are essential to supporting the growth in our specialty businesses. 
Moving next to the segment results and starting with Advanced Materials on Slide 8, which delivered a strong quarter. Sales revenue increased due to higher sales volume of premium products, including Eastman Tritan copolyester and Saflex acoustic interlayers. This was partially offset by lower selling prices, primarily for copolyesters, attributed to lower raw material costs. Earnings increased, primarily due to higher sales volume and improved product mix of premium products and lower unit cost due to higher capacity utilization. 
Looking at the full year, we continue to expect strong results for Advanced Materials as they progress on our strategy for this business of volume growth, mix improvement and fixed cost leverage. Sequentially, we expect volume will increase due to normal seasonality for our copolyester customers. We had strong sales in March that has continued into mid-April. 
Interlayer volumes remains strong as OEM auto builds remain solid, acoustic growth continues, and overall building construction market in Europe is improving. As a result, for the year, we expect greater-than-GDP volume growth for this business. 
In addition to the strong volume growth, we expect further robust mix improvements with continued growth in high-margin products such as Trident copolyester and acoustic interlayers. As we continue to fill out our existing capacity, we benefit from fixed cost leverage. We expect all of these factors will result in strong earnings growth for Advanced Materials. 
Now it's Additives & Functional Products on Slide 9. Overall, a solid quarter despite the short-term challenges. Revenue declined, primarily due to lower selling prices, attributed into lower raw material energy costs and competitive pressure for certain products, particularly in Asia Pacific. Operating earnings decreased, primarily due to an unfavorable shift in foreign currency rates. 
Looking at the full year 2016, we expect solid volume growth for AFP, in line with the end market growth. In particular, we expect volume growth in the transportation, building and construction and consumables end markets. We also expect lower selling prices, reflecting both lower raw material costs, and as we discussed in January, we did an excellent job holding onto value last year while we also started to share this value with our customers towards the end of 2015 and through the first quarter this year. 
Overall, we expect Additives & Functional Products to be stable to slightly down, which would be a solid result in the current business climate. 
Now to Fibers on Slide 10. Results for this segment were as expected. Sales revenue declined, primarily due to lower acetyl chemical sales volume and lower acetate tow selling prices, mostly offset by higher acetate tow sales volume. The higher acetate tow sales volume was attributed to customer buying patterns. The decline in acetyl chemicals was due to lower cost internal sourcing of cellulose acetate flake raw materials rather than obtaining these raw materials from our joint venture in Kingsport. 
Earnings for the quarter declined moderately as lower selling prices were partially offset by higher acetate tow sales volume, lower raw material energy costs and reduced operating cost resulting from recent actions. Looking at the full year 2016, our current expectations are in line with the guidance I provided at an investor conference in March. We expect acetate tow sales volume to be down about 10% for the year, mainly reflecting customer backward integration and destocking in China. We also expect selling prices to decline but to be mostly offset by lower raw material costs as well as the benefit of cost actions we have taken. As a result, we are expecting earnings to be down close to 15% for the year. 
I'll finish up the segment review with Chemicals Intermediates on Slide 11. Chemicals Intermediates delivered a solid quarter despite significantly volatility -- significant volatility impacting their business. Sales revenues in the first quarter declined, primarily reflecting lower selling prices attributed to lower raw material costs. Chemical Intermediates is also impacted by continued competitive pressure resulting from weak demand in Asia Pacific. Operating earnings declined, in part due to a difficult comparison. In the first half of 2015, we did a great job of holding onto value during a period of significant raw material cost decline. In the first quarter 2016, selling prices were down, reflecting the lower raw material costs and therefore, margins declined. 
Looking at the full year 2016, we expect a number of factors to impact results. We expect solid volume growth due to continued plasticizers growth, particularly in the building and construction market as well as overall modest growth in North America, which is almost 70% of the overall segment revenue. We also expect olefin margins to remain under pressure as the recent increase in oil price has not yet translated to improving olefin prices, particularly ethylene, and we expect lower methanol prices to enable lower pricing by competitors in some of our acetyl and amines product lines. Therefore, for 2016, we expect earnings to be meaningfully lower, given the low oil environment and the pressure on spreads, and I'd add that when you think about how the year will unfold, we expect second quarter operating earnings will be lower than first quarter due to both significantly higher maintenance shutdown costs and how our propane hedge flows through cost. 
Lastly, I'll give you a quick update on our process for divesting our merchant ethylene position and potentially other commodity olefin product lines. As we mentioned in January, we're moving forward with this process and having engaged bankers. The books are now out, and we're talking with potential buyers and are pleased with the initial interest. We will be disciplined, patient sellers as we move through this process, and we will update you further as the process continues to progress. 
With that, I'll turn it back over to Mark."

They've delivered over the last 6 years, and we expect that to continue in 2016. We expect our innovative specialty products will continue to grow strongly, improving product mix and accelerating overall earnings growth. And we are levered to grow in attractive end markets as specialty transportation, building construction and consumables. 
We're equally committed to meet our aggressive cost-reduction targets. In addition, we expect to achieve further cost synergies from our acquisitions. And after delevering, we also expect to repurchase shares in the back half of the year. 
In the near term, however, slow global economic growth combined with low oil and weak Asian and European currencies are increasing competitive pressure in some products. And as we guided earlier in the year, we expect some inventory destocking in China to impact Fibers results. 
Net, we'll continue to drive hard to deliver EPS that approaches our 2015 EPS, and we are maintaining our guidance for EPS to be flat to down 5%. And given where olefins are today, we are likely to be more towards the lower end of that range. 
I'd also note that the first half of the year will be a tougher comp than the back half. As I look beyond 2016, we are well positioned for growth as these short-term challenges recede and our strong growth drivers continue. Altogether, I'm confident we'll continue to deliver attractive earnings growth in the long term as we transform towards a specialty portfolio.

So obviously it's pretty dynamic environment out there with oil and currency, and it's difficult to predict the next month, let alone the remainder of the year. What I love about our portfolio right now is we're growing the way we should in our specialties. We drive a lot of strong volume growth, a lot of mix improvements through innovation in Advanced Materials. We did a great job of holding onto value and as in functional products. So we feel good about that, and we feel great about the cost reductions coming through as we expected. But what we're not seeing right now, as we expected in January, is the improvement in olefin spreads. Oil certainly gone up, as we all know, to $45, but we're not seeing sort of the olefin prices recover in the way we would have expected especially on the ethylene side. So it should have been more in the low 30% -- $0.30 range, and we'll get spot down to $0.25. So that's really the main issue, Dave. There's some increasing activity with currencies. Currencies and just about FX translation, it includes how people use that improved cost structure to pursue volume unsuccessfully I might add, but they give it a good shot, and that put some price pressure in the marketplace that you have to respond. So we're seeing a little bit out here and there, but principally, it's an olefins issue. Overall, though, I feel very much on track with our strategy and how we're going to create earnings growth especially as I look at it from '16 through '17 and beyond. And the one interesting upside that's coming out of all this is we're finding customers highly motivated to find innovation these days because we're all living in a tough world, and so we're seeing tremendous engagement even from Asian customers looking on how to innovate value add their product portfolio. So we're really starting to see some acceleration on that front, which is great to see."

So I'll break it down both from a cigarette demand point of view and a tow point of view. So on the cigarette side, we see primary demand being very consistent with our views we've shared in all the previous calls. Outside of China sort of down 1% to 2% like it's been for years. Inside China, we're still not seeing any signs that there's some significant change in primary consumption of cigarettes I call it sort of flat, maybe up 1%,but there's some uncertainty here in the short term is the economic pressure in China could affect people's rate of purchasing cigarettes. But overall, I would say it's very stable, especially when you think inside China that the Chinese National Tobacco Company principal goal is to grow tax revenue. They are assigned a target to grow at stated China GDP around 6.5%, 7%. They've never missed their target ever from what I know. So I think we should expect stability there when it comes to primary demand. So then you get back to what's going on in destocking and what we see is at the tow level, the Chinese National Tobacco Company has set a pretty aggressive destocking target for tow this year, and you have to remember that demand dropped last year, and this year is a function of 2 things. The first driver is CNTC backward integrating with us in '14, with Daicel in '15, and so certain amount of import demand was just replaced by internal production inside China. That's actually a little bit bigger driver than the stocking relative to primary demand, and so you've got that happening plus they've built up too much tow inventory in their imports as they did this backward integration, and so now they're pulling the inventory down. Their target puts it to a very low level. So I think that destocking will be complete. So now we're really looking at what other decisions do they make around cigarette inventory in the marketplace in between tow and primary demand. That's very opaque. We think they're making good progress on that, and they've got this mandate to keep on growing. So I think the vast majority of the destocking should be behind us, but I'm not going to forecast inventory of cigarettes in China."

I'm not sure I need to say anything else, but that's exactly what we've been doing to get. In Advanced Materials, we've been growing through volume and mix, and spreads have been relatively stable when it comes to raw materials, and so that is a volume mix story and how we're improving the margins there and how we're growing deliver results. So I would take that off the table, and we feel very, very stable about how we're going to grow there. AFP, as you saw prices came off a bit in the first quarter, and what we did last year and on a restated basis if you look at Additives & Functional Products last year from '14 to '15, prices were only down about 3%. So we had a great success last year in holding onto value through the beginning half of last year really through the third quarter, expanding our margins and tremendous growth earnings as you can now see in Additives & Functional Products and our specialty businesses from '14 to '15. So we started giving some of that value back and sharing the value of raw materials with our customer in the fourth quarter last year through the first quarter this year, which is the right thing to do. It's the way you create value because in the end of the day what you all want is as to grow long term not just short-term earnings, and you've got to have market share and more importantly, you've got have customers that are motivated and engaged with you to work on innovation for the next generation of products. And I think we're walking that balance as carefully as we can. And margins, I would expect, will normalize around sort of what you're seeing in the first quarter, and I think that's what we'll see for the rest of the year. So I think that business is doing well, and there's always the choice to hold prices high, be aggressive and deliver greater earnings relative to raws in the short term, but sooner or later, you're setting yourself up for volume fall and certainly lack of innovation in that portfolio if you do that because customers are very motivated when they can see how much your raw materials have improved to work with you. So we're not going to make that choice. I think that's in the stake, and I'm proud of how the team's walking that balance. It's not easy in a tough environment. We're pushing hard for earnings growth everyday, but I think that's going to work out well for us long term."

Interlayers is just having another phenomenal year building on top of last year in addition to OEM growth rate, which has clearly been pretty good around the world especially in North America and Europe. We're seeing a significant increase in our real estate of the cars moving from the windshields to the sidelines to the sunroofs as they're adding more not just laminated glass but particularly acoustic laminated glass to quiet the cabin for better rider experience, and so we're seeing great engagement there. In fact, when I was with a key customer glass customer in Japan last week, it was very exciting to hear about how much they're looking forward to our next-gen acoustics and heads-up display products. We added a lot of value to this industry already. We've got a new acoustic product that's going to allow them to lightweight the glass, maybe take as much as 25% of the weight of the glass out, which is a big deal, and we've got a far superior heads-up display product coming out as well that's going to dramatically increase size and clarity, allowing a lot of mobility to be added of information to the car for the whole new Internet of Things trend in the car. So a lot of engagement, a lot of innovation there, so great success. And then even in performance films, we've rolled out a very successful new channel strategy in performance films, where we're growing especially in North America, bringing a lot more people into the category, seeing the value proposition of greater solar ejections, skin protection from skin cancer as well as aesthetics and securities.

So overall, I'd say price is more or less playing out the way we would expect. It's important that we defend our markets and keep these customers engaged as we work on this next generation of product introductions. Really excited about the Crystex process that we're launching.

And so when you combine that excess capacity with low oil environment and some other places, some weakening currencies, you can get competitors chasing volume with their improved cost structure and basically that's what you're seeing. So you see some pressure in olefin-related products in Chemical Intermediates. You see some pressure in asset. So as methanol price gets low, that allows the Asians, particularly the Chinese, to drop their so you can prices, and you have to respond to that as it works its way across the world and even in alkyl amines, we have contracts that track methanol. We have very advantage methanol contract that goes into our cost structure. So it's just like our coal gasification or shale gas position if our competitors have lower methanol price, some of that price come down you're going to get a bit of compression. So that's what you're seeing. I'd say added to that, some pressure in plasticizers. We've been talking about that since 2013, where the Koreans have been dumping their product all over the world since they cannot get it into China anymore. So you see some pressure in a few products like that. There's a few products that I already discussed in the prior question around functional products like adhesives.

There's a lot of people talk about product introductions, and you have to be very careful in how you compare it relative to our peers because you can count it in very different ways. I think about technology platforms that lead to many customer wins and many applications as opposed to talking about every individual customer application I win. And so we've got great platforms across Advanced Materials. We've got Tritan as you said. We've got a wide range of both cellulosic and some other technology products in the displays industry. As I mentioned, whole portfolio of acoustic and heads-up display products and next generation of performance film product. So basically, where we are, we're introducing new products in Advanced Materials. Functional products, same thing. We are now starting to see in our new polyester coating platform, which is taking the Tritan chemistry on into polyester coatings. That's a huge market when you look at market from auto to industrial to packaging. So tremendous amount of opportunities and wins we expect there. Nice set of portfolios for next-gen on products. The tire resins, next-gen acoustic -- next-gen Crystex products rolling out. So everywhere you go where we're a leader in specialty product, we have multigeneration product plans delivering sustainable growth and sustainable margins into the future, but we're not going to start firming out individual product wins because I find those numbers not to make a lot of sense that I've seen in some other places."

We had a solid start of the year with the first quarter results, which was slightly better than our expectations. Overall, our strategy is working. We did a great job of holding on to the value through the quarter as we increased our operating margin by 40 basis points or over 18%. We continued to upgrade the quality of our product mix by growing high-margin specialty product lines, a key component of our winning strategy. To see more of our strategy in action, I recently traveled to visit customers in Asia. And I'm really excited about all the innovation and customer engagement that's gaining traction across the region from India to China to Japan. 
In India, we secured our first commercial success on our next-generation polyester coatings platform with a leading manufacturer of SUVs and tractors. As I met with them, I was excited to see their engagement and enthusiasm for our solution and how it could significantly improve their ability to maintain their leadership cost-effectively. With increasing expectations from the emerging middle class in India and new Western competitors, this customer faced a challenge. Upgrade the durability and gloss retention of their monocoat coating or spend significant money to build a more expensive 2-coat system. 
Our revolutionary next-gen polyester coating enabled them to achieve best-in-class performance with a monocoat instead of moving to a much more expensive 2-coat solution. We were there last September when the first SUVs rolled off the assembly line, a short 15 months after the project started. And now there are more than 30,000 SUVs on the road. Key to this success was a tremendous partnership built between this auto OEM, their exceptional coatings formulator and Eastman. We've started with auto coatings, and we're making tremendous progress in industrial and package coatings as well. 
In China, we've recently partnered with a leading local housewares brand to launch a product line that utilizes our Tritan copolyester as we're seeing an increased local need for greater product safety and durability. Similar to success in India, this customer is looking for a way to differentiate themselves from other local competitors. And I'm very bullish on this market expansion into China for a product that has predominantly been sold to North America and European consumers. As part of our success, we are providing training to the company's 20,000-person sales force that works throughout department stores in China, who are pitching our Tritan value proposition for us every day. These are just 2 of many examples where we're succeeding by helping our customers through innovation. 
On the cost management front, we are well on track with our corporate cost reduction efforts without sacrificing our long-term growth initiatives. Our SG&A and R&D as a percentage of sales remains in the low -- lowest quartile of our peers, which is a function of our scale and integration and the great discipline of our employees. We've also made excellent progress in reducing manufacturing costs. Productivity is in the DNA of Eastman, and we continue to succeed. Cash flow is consistent with our expectations, and we are on track to deliver another strong year of free cash flow, enabling our increasing dividend, deleveraging and repurchasing shares in the back half of the year. 
Beyond these great results, we've also been the recipient of numerous awards over the past several months, which highlight many of the qualities our stakeholders have come to expect from Eastman. We received the Glassdoor Employees' Choice Award, honoring the best places to work. What I valued most of this -- about this award is it's based solely on the input of employees. We're the only chemical company to be in the top 50 best place to work ever. And this is our third year in a row we've been honored. The award speaks to our winning culture, which enables us to innovate with our customers and integrate our acquisition so successfully. We're also named one of the world's most ethical companies for the third consecutive year by Ethisphere for outstanding corporate ethics and corporate responsibility, characteristics highly valued by our employees, our communities and our customers. Finally, we were recognized by the EPA as an ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year Award, becoming the only chemical company to have received this recognition consecutively for 5 years in a row. And only 2 other chemical companies have received it once. This is a great win for both the environment and our cost structure. 
Our solid first quarter results and the continued recognition we're receiving are a direct result of the great work being done by Eastman employees around the world. And I want to thank them for their outstanding contributions. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Curt."

I want to go off script for a second here just to pile on a little to Mark's comments. I'm now coming on the CFO -- now coming on 8 years. And I just wanted to express the excitement we have with our various growth programs. When I look through my finance lens, I'm convinced that these growth programs will lead to meaningful revenue growth and strong returns for the coming years. And it's a real pleasure to watch a winning strategy get executed by Mark and our business technology and strategy teams despite this business climate that we're facing and to be a part of that high-performing, winning culture that Mark talked about. So many of you know this already, good things are happening at Eastman that will benefit both 2016 and beyond. So with that, let me get back to my prepared remarks. 
I'll start on our first quarter corporate results on Slide 4. Overall, we delivered a solid quarter in a challenging business climate. Sales revenue declined as solid sales line growth was more than offset by lower selling prices. As we expected, the largest decline was in the Chemical Intermediates segment, where low oil has its greatest impact. Our operating earnings decreased as strong performance in Advanced Materials was more than offset by a decline in Chemical Intermediates. Overall, earnings per share was solid, reflecting good quality earnings and a lower tax rate. And I'm proud of how our commercial teams are finding the right balance of retaining appropriate value, given the attributes and value proposition of our specialties and sharing some that benefit of lower raws with our customers. 
On Slide 5, I'll transition to an overview of our cash flow and other finance highlights for the year -- or for the quarter, sorry. We continue to do an excellent job of generating cash with first quarter operating cash flow of $47 million in what is typically our lowest quarter. These results reflect our normal beginning of the year working capital build. Capital expenditures totaled $110 million. We continue to manage the pace of capital spending with the current economic environment while maintaining growth investments. We expect full year capital expenditures to be approximately $650 million, maybe a little less as the year unfolds. 
Free cash flow was a negative $63 million for the quarter, consistent with our expectations. Our first quarter dividend was $68 million. Our effective tax rate for the first quarter improved to approximately 24%. We continue to expect our full year tax rate will be between 24% and 25%, reflecting the continued benefits of our improved business operations. And we'll continue doing what we can to be at the lower end of that range. For free cash flow, we remain on track to be above $900 million. As a whole, I'm pleased with our earnings and cash flow performance to start the year. 
On Slides 6 and 7, I'll provide an overview of the 2 segments most affected by our business restructuring. This is the first quarter we're reporting under the new business structure, so we thought this would be helpful. First, under our new structure, Additives & Functional Products is well positioned for GDP-plus growth with an attractive market footprint and diverse geographic profile. Our transportation exposure is about 75% replacement and 25% OEM. This split is similar for building and construction. 
Performance drivers for the segment include increasing demand for quality vehicles, the improvement in housing market and increasing use of consumables by growing middle class. And we remain focused on attractive secular growth end markets, where innovation and deep customer connect offer a clear competitive advantage. As we look forward, I'm excited about the growth we expect from our innovation projects. And Mark already shared an exceptional story of rapid innovation in India. We are continuing to see strong growth in our tire resins as a performance additive and strong growth in our low VOC, low odor coalescents for architectural paints. And we're just getting started with innovation efforts in alkylamine specialties. 
Next, on Slide 7, the new Chemical Intermediates segment, which now comprises the majority of our olefins exposure. We'll benefit from advantaged market positions in key intermediates, particularly in North America. Performance drivers for this segment include growing middle class, continued adoption of nonphthalate plasticizers and North America shale gas advantage. In addition, flexible market outlets will drive our asset utilization and support growth for our strategic specialty product lines. Overall, the segment has a set of good value-adding businesses, which benefit from scale, integration and reliability and are essential to supporting the growth in our specialty businesses. 
Moving next to the segment results and starting with Advanced Materials on Slide 8, which delivered a strong quarter. Sales revenue increased due to higher sales volume of premium products, including Eastman Tritan copolyester and Saflex acoustic interlayers. This was partially offset by lower selling prices, primarily for copolyesters, attributed to lower raw material costs. Earnings increased primarily due to higher sales volume and improved product mix of premium products and lower unit cost due to higher capacity utilization. Looking at the full year, we continue to expect strong results for Advanced Materials as they progress on our strategy for this business of volume growth, mix improvement and fixed cost leverage. 
Sequentially, we expect volume will increase due to normal seasonality for our copolyester customers. We had strong sales in March and that has continued into mid-April. Interlayer volumes remain strong as OEM auto builds remain solid, acoustic growth continues and overall building and construction market in Europe is improving. As a result, for the year, we expect greater-than-GDP volume growth for this business. In addition to the strong volume growth, we expect further robust mix improvements with continued growth in higher-margin products such as Trident copolyester and acoustic interlayers. As we continue to fill out our existing capacity, we benefit from fixed cost leverage. We expect all of these factors will result in strong earnings growth for Advanced Materials. 
Now at Additives & Functional Products on Slide 9. Overall, a solid quarter despite the short-term challenges. Revenue declined, primarily due to lower selling prices, attributed into lower raw material and energy costs and competitive pressure for certain products, particularly in Asia Pacific. Operating earnings decreased, primarily due to an unfavorable shift in foreign currency rates. Looking at the full year 2016, we expect solid volume growth for AFP, in line with the end market growth. In particular, we expect volume growth in the transportation, building and construction and consumables end markets. We also expect lower selling prices, reflecting both lower raw material costs. And as we discussed in January, we did an excellent job holding on to value last year while we also started to share this value with our customers towards the end of 2015 and through the first quarter this year. Overall, we expect Additives & Functional Products to be stable to slightly down, which would be a solid result in the current business climate. 
Now to Fibers on Slide 10. Results for this segment were as expected. Sales revenue declined, primarily due to lower acetyl chemical sales volume and lower acetate tow selling prices, mostly offset by higher acetate tow sales volume. The higher acetate tow sales volume was attributed to customer buying patterns. The decline in acetyl chemicals was due to lower-cost internal sourcing of cellulose acetate flake raw materials rather than obtaining these raw materials from our joint venture in Kingsport. Earnings for the quarter declined moderately as lower selling prices were partially offset by higher acetate tow sales volume, lower raw material and energy costs and reduced operating costs resulting from recent actions. 
Looking at the full year 2016, our current expectations are in line with the guidance I provided at an investor conference in March. We expect acetate tow sales volume to be down about 10% for the year, mainly reflecting customer backward integration and destocking in China. We also expect selling prices to decline but to be mostly offset by lower raw material costs as well as the benefit of cost actions we have taken. As a result, we are expecting earnings to be down close to 15% for the year. 
I'll finish up the segment review with Chemicals Intermediates on Slide 11. Chemicals Intermediates delivered a solid quarter despite significantly volatility -- significant volatility impacting their business. Sales revenues in the first quarter declined, primarily reflecting lower selling prices attributed to lower raw material costs. Chemicals Intermediates is also impacted by continued competitive pressure resulting from weak demand in Asia Pacific. Operating earnings declined, in part due to a difficult comparison. In the first half of 2015, we did a great job of holding on to value during a period of significant raw material cost decline. In the first quarter of 2016, selling prices were down, reflecting the lower raw material costs, and therefore margins declined. 
Looking at the full year 2016, we expect a number of factors to impact results. We expect solid volume growth due to continued plasticizers growth, particularly in the building and construction market as well as overall modest growth in North America, which is almost 70% of the overall segment revenue. We also expect olefin margins to remain under pressure as the recent increase in oil price has not yet translated to improving olefin prices, particularly ethylene. And we expect lower methanol prices to enable lower pricing by competitors in some of our acetyl and amines product lines. Therefore, for 2016, we expect earnings to be meaningfully lower, given the low oil environment and the pressure on spreads. And I'd add that when you think about how the year will unfold, we expect second quarter operating earnings will be lower than first quarter due to both significantly higher maintenance shutdown costs and how our propane hedge flows through cost. 
Lastly, I'll give you a quick update on our process for divesting our merchant ethylene position and potentially other commodity olefin product lines. As we mentioned in January, we're moving forward with this process and have to engage the bankers. The books are now out, and we're talking with potential buyers and are pleased with the initial interest. We will be disciplined, patient sellers as we move through this process, and we will update you further as the process continues to progress. 
With that, I'll turn it back over to Mark."

They've delivered over the last 6 years, and we expect that to continue in 2016. We expect our innovative specialty products will continue to grow strongly, improving product mix and accelerating overall earnings growth. And we are levered to grow in attractive end markets of specialty transportation, building and construction and consumables. 
We're equally committed to meet our aggressive cost reduction targets. In addition, we expect to achieve further cost synergies from our acquisitions. And after delevering, we also expect to repurchase shares in the back half of the year. In the near term, however, slow global economic growth, combined with low oil and weak Asian and European currencies, are increasing competitive pressure in some products. And as we guided earlier in the year, we expect some inventory destocking in China to impact Fibers' results. 
Net, we will continue to drive hard to deliver EPS that approaches our 2015 EPS and we are maintaining our guidance for EPS to be flat to down 5%. And given where olefin spreads are today, we are likely to be more towards the lower end of that range. I would also note that the first half of the year will be a tougher comp than the back half. As I look beyond 2016, we are well positioned for growth as these short-term challenges recede and our strong growth drivers continue. Altogether, I'm confident we'll continue to deliver attractive earnings growth in the long term as we transform towards a specialty portfolio.

So obviously, it's a pretty dynamic environment out there with oil and currency and it's difficult to predict the next month, let alone the remainder of the year. What I love about our portfolio right now is we're growing the way we should in our specialties. We're driving a lot of strong volume growth, a lot of mix improvement through innovation in Advanced Materials, did a great job of holding on to value in Additives & Functional Products. So we feel good about that, and we feel great about the cost reductions coming through as we expected. But what we're not seeing right now, as we expected in January, is the improvement in olefin spreads. Oil has certainly gone up, as we all know, to $45, but we're not seeing sort of the olefin prices recover in the way we would have expected, especially on the ethylene side. So it should have been more in the low 30% -- $0.30 range and we'll get the spot down to $0.25. So that's really the main issue, Dave. There's some increasing competitive activity with currencies. Currencies and just about FX translation, it includes how people use that improved cost structure to pursue volume, unsuccessfully I might add, but they gave it a good shot. And that put some price pressure in the marketplace that you have to respond. So we're seeing a little bit out here and there. But principally, it's an olefins issue. Overall though, I feel very much on track with our strategy and how we're going to create earnings growth, especially as you look at it from '16 through '17 and beyond. And the one interesting upside that's coming out of all this is we're finding customers highly motivated to find innovation these days because we're all living in a tough world. And so we're seeing tremendous engagement even from Asian customers looking on how to innovate and value up their product portfolio. So we're really starting to see some acceleration on that front, which is great to see."

So I'll break it down both from a cigarette demand point of view and a tow point of view. So on the cigarette side, we see primary demand being very consistent with our views we've shared in all the previous calls. Outside of China, it's sort of down 1% to 2% like it's been for years. Inside China, we're still not seeing any signs that there's some significant change in primary consumption of cigarettes, so I'd call it sort of flat, maybe up 1%. But there's -- some uncertainty here in the short term is the economic pressure in China could affect people's rate of purchasing cigarettes. But overall, I would say it's very stable. And especially when you think inside China that the Chinese National Tobacco Company's principal goal is to grow tax revenue, they're assigned a target to grow at stated China GDP around 6.5%, 7%. And they've never missed their target ever from what I know. So I think we should expect stability there when it comes to primary demand. So then you get back to what's going on in destocking. And what we see is at the tow level, the Chinese National Tobacco Company has set a pretty aggressive destocking target for tow this year. And you have to remember that demand dropped last year and this year is a function of 2 things. The first driver is CNTC backward integrating with us in '14, with Daicel in '15. And so certain amount of import demand was just replaced by internal production inside China. That's actually a little bit bigger driver than destocking relative to primary demand. And so you've got that happening plus they've built up too much tow inventory in their imports as they did this backward integration. And so now they're pulling the inventory down. Their target puts it to a very low level, so I think that destocking will be complete. So we're now really looking at what other decisions do they make around cigarette inventory in the marketplace in between tow and primary demand. That's very opaque. We think they're making good progress on that and they've got this mandate to keep on growing. So I think the vast majority of the destocking should be behind us, but I'm not going to forecast inventory of cigarettes in China."

I'm not sure I need to say anything else. But that's exactly what we've been doing. In Advanced Materials, we've been growing through volume and mix and spreads have been relatively stable when it comes to raw materials. And so that is a volume-mix story and how we're improving the margins there and how we're growing and delivering results. So I would take that off the table, and we feel very, very stable about how we're going to grow there. AFP, as you saw, prices came off a bit in the first quarter. And what we did last year, and I would -- on a restated basis, if you look at Additives & Functional Products last year from '14 to '15, prices were only down about 3%. So we had a great success last year in holding on to value through the beginning half of last year really through the third quarter, expanding our margins and tremendous growth in earnings as you can now see in Additives & Functional Products and our specialty businesses from '14 to '15. So we started giving some of that value back and sharing the value of raw materials with our customer in the fourth quarter last year through the first quarter of this year, which is the right thing to do. It's the way you create value because at the end of the day, what you all want is us to grow long term, not just short term our earnings. And you've got to have market share. And more importantly, you've got to have customers that are motivated and engaged with you to work on innovation for the next generation of products. And I think we're walking that balance as carefully as we can. And the margins, I would expect, will normalize around sort of what you're seeing in the first quarter. And I think that's what we'll see for the rest of the year. So I think that business is doing well. And there's always the choice to hold prices high, be aggressive and deliver great earnings relative to raws in the short term. But sooner or later, you're setting yourself up for a volume fall and certainly a lack of innovation in that portfolio if you do that because customers aren't very motivated when they can see how much your raw materials have improved to work with you. So we're not going to make that choice. I think that's in the stake. And I'm proud of how the team is walking that balance. It's not easy in a tough environment. We're pushing hard for earnings growth every day, but I think that's going to work out well for us long term."

So we're moving from the windshields to the side lamps to the sunroofs as they're adding more, not just laminated glass, but particularly acoustic laminated glass to quiet the cabin for a better rider experience. So we're seeing great engagement there. In fact, when I was with a key customer glass customer in Japan last week, it was very exciting to hear about how much they're looking forward to our next-gen acoustics and heads-up display products. So we've added a lot of value to this industry already. And we've got a new acoustic product that's going to allow them to lightweight the glass, maybe take as much as 25% of the weight of the glass out, which is a big deal. And we've got a far superior heads-up display product coming out as well that's going to dramatically increase the size and clarity, allowing a lot of mobility to be added of information to the car for the whole, new Internet of Things trend in the car. So a lot of engagement, a lot of innovation there, so a great success. And then even in performance films, we've rolled out a very successful new channel strategy in performance films, where we're growing, especially in North America, bringing a lot more people into the category, seeing the value proposition of greater solar ejection, skin protection from skin cancer as well as aesthetics and security.

We've told the investors about that for several quarters now. And that's sort of playing out as expected, but that's some of the price decline. The other places, in the olefin-related products, the specialty products like our coalescents, where we're seeing some prices being shared with our customers. As raw materials improved last year, we held prices fairly well. And now we're reducing from prices there to share the value with our customers. We are seeing prices come off a bit in the Crystex product as we are growing in that business and defending our share again very much as we expected but some of the prices coming off there, especially in Asia. What I would say is it's quite encouraging about the tires market as we're seeing a nice recovery in demand in tires, especially in the first quarter here relative to last year. And that market is getting back on stable footing and well positioned to deliver some nice volume growth this year. So overall, I'd say the prices are more or less playing out the way we would expect. It's important that we defend our markets and keep these customers engaged as we work on this next generation of product introductions. Really excited about the Crystex process that we're launching. We've got the retrofit line in Germany up and running that will improve our cost and enable us to have a much superior product.

To take another step further, if you look at the quality of our operating earings in our company right now, it's substantially better, right? It's about $0.60 share better if you strip out both the propane hedge and the currency hedge, which I think of as financial activity. So we'd have had -- and that will be the same number roughly applied to last year. So we would have very strong earnings last year and very strong earnings this year relative to sort of what you're seeing because of this financial hedging. So that's why we're divesting the bulk ethylene and some of these other associated Chemical Intermediates is to get this volatility noise out of our story because the real story for Eastman is tremendous growth in specialties, tremendous innovation across a wide range of very attractive markets, a very consistent strategy in driving that. We fundamentally believe in integration and the value it's created for us and are very happy to have our large integrated assets supporting our specialty.

So we're making great progress towards our goal of $200 million of productivity gains.

And it's not surprising that you would see it in those kind of products. And it's really a combination of the world's growing slowly, in particular China is growing slowly and not consuming a lot of capacity that they've added for a variety of products that sit in Chemical Intermediates. And so when you combine that excess capacity with low oil environment and in some other places, some weakening currencies, you can get competitors chasing volume with their improved cost structure. And basically, that's what you're seeing. So you see some pressure in olefin-related products in Chemical Intermediates. You see some pressure in acetyls. So as methanol price gets low, that allows the Asians, and particularly the Chinese, to drop their acetic acids, acetic anhydride prices, and you have to respond to that as it works its way across the world. And even in alkylamines, we have some formula contracts that track methanol. And we have a very advantaged methanol contract that goes into our cost structure. So just like our coal gasification or shale gas position, if our competitors have lower methanol price, some of that price then come down, you're going to get a bit of a compression. So that's what you're seeing. I'd say added to that, there is some structural pressure in things like plasticizers. We've been talking about that since 2013, where the Koreans have been dumping their product all over the world since they cannot get it into China anymore. And So You see some pressure in a few products like that. And it's principally there. There's a few products that I already discussed in the prior question around Additives & Functional Products like adhesives. So I think I've already addressed that in AFP."

So there are lumpy buying patterns, and so you have to be extremely careful about trying to overinterpret any quarter when you're comparing us to our tow peers. But there is also a difference that we've discussed in the past, which is we've been incredibly successful in having a very large share of imports into China that's allowed us to grow a lot of earnings and generate a lot of cash for shareholders in the past 10 years. Of course, there's the flip side of that now when imports are dropping, we're going to feel the pressure of that more than our peers with the drop in imports in China. So I'd say you're right there, that's sort of the key difference. On a global basis, I think our market shares are very stable and we certainly have every intention of maintaining our position on a global basis from a share point of view. What I like about Eastman and our long-term future here is we have the lowest cost, largest scale, fully integrated back to coal, flake and tow position for the world. And we've got a great asset here in flake that allows us to support all of our assets both here, Korea and China. And because of the integration, because of the great value creation we get from our other cellulosic products in Additives & Functional Products, Advanced Materials, we also have more innovation capability than anyone else in sort of keeping that integrated asset base running.

I think we have one of the strongest EBITDA margins in the industry and have every intention to keeping them stable as we go forward leveraging our fixed cost as well as mix improvement. So overall, I think we're on the right strategy. As I look beyond this year, we're clearly doing a lot of adjustments. We have such significant changes in margin -- not margin but in oil prices and currency. You're going to get margins flying up and down as you sort of normalize around stable levels. And you're going to see that stabilize. That's not unique to us, it's going to be true for any company connected to petrochemicals or a global business.

We've got the cost management that is going to continue to deliver great results. And we'll continue being very disciplined in the cost. We've got the hedges rolling off. So that $0.60 a share I mentioned earlier will come back to earnings over the next 2 years. And then you've got a very strong free cash flow that will continue to get better as we go from this year forward. And that once the delevering is completed, you've got repurchasing shares and increasing the dividend. So it all adds up. I mean, obviously there's a lot we can't control around the economy when it comes to how it's going to play out on oil and currency. But I like the fact that we have a lot in our control. The company is very focused on innovation, very focused on customer engagement, which is the only way you get to innovate. And that's how we're going to deliver results for our owners."

We had a solid start of the year with the first quarter results, which was slightly better than our expectations. Overall, our strategy is working. We did a great job of holding on to the value through the quarter as we increased our operating margin by 40 basis points or over 18%. We continued to upgrade the quality of our product mix by growing high-margin specialty product lines, a key component of our winning strategy. To see more of our strategy in action, I recently traveled to visit customers in Asia. And I'm really excited about all the innovation and customer engagement that's gaining traction across the region from India to China to Japan. 
In India, we secured our first commercial success on our next-generation polyester coatings platform with a leading manufacturer of SUVs and tractors. As I met with them, I was excited to see their engagement and enthusiasm for our solution and how it could significantly improve their ability to maintain their leadership cost-effectively. With increasing expectations from the emerging middle class in India and new Western competitors, this customer faced a challenge. Upgrade the durability and gloss retention of their monocoat coating or spend significant money to build a more expensive 2-coat system. 
Our revolutionary next-gen polyester coating enabled them to achieve best-in-class performance with a monocoat instead of moving to a much more expensive 2-coat solution. We were there last September when the first SUVs rolled off the assembly line, a short 15 months after the project started. And now there are more than 30,000 SUVs on the road. Key to this success was a tremendous partnership built between this auto OEM, their exceptional coatings formulator and Eastman. We've started with auto coatings, and we're making tremendous progress in industrial and package coatings as well. 
In China, we've recently partnered with a leading local housewares brand to launch a product line that utilizes our Tritan copolyester as we're seeing an increased local need for greater product safety and durability. Similar to success in India, this customer is looking for a way to differentiate themselves from other local competitors. And I'm very bullish on this market expansion into China for a product that has predominantly been sold to North America and European consumers. As part of our success, we are providing training to the company's 20,000-person sales force that works throughout department stores in China, who are pitching our Tritan value proposition for us every day. These are just 2 of many examples where we're succeeding by helping our customers through innovation. 
On the cost management front, we are well on track with our corporate cost reduction efforts without sacrificing our long-term growth initiatives. Our SG&A and R&D as a percentage of sales remains in the lowest quartile of our peers, which is a function of our scale and integration and the great discipline of our employees. We've also made excellent progress in reducing manufacturing costs. Productivity is in the DNA of Eastman, and we continue to succeed. Cash flow is consistent with our expectations, and we are on track to deliver another strong year of free cash flow, enabling our increasing dividend, deleveraging and repurchasing shares in the back half of the year. 
Beyond these great results, we've also been the recipient of numerous awards over the past several months, which highlight many of the qualities our stakeholders have come to expect from Eastman. We received the Glassdoor Employees' Choice Award, honoring the best places to work. What I valued most of this -- about this award is it's based solely on the input of employees. We're the only chemical company to be in the top 50 best place to work ever. And this is our third year in a row we've been honored. The award speaks to our winning culture, which enables us to innovate with our customers and integrate our acquisition so successfully. 
We were also named one of the world's most ethical companies for the third consecutive year by Ethisphere for outstanding corporate ethics and corporate responsibility, characteristics highly valued by our employees, our communities and our customers. Finally, we were recognized by the EPA as an ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year Award, becoming the only chemical company to have received this recognition consecutively for 5 years in a row. And only 2 other chemical companies have received it once. This is a great win for both the environment and our cost structure.  Our solid first quarter results and the continued recognition we're receiving are a direct result of the great work being done by Eastman employees around the world. And I want to thank them for their outstanding contributions. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Curt."

I want to go off script for a second here just to pile on a little to Mark's comments. I'm now coming on the CFO -- now coming on 8 years. And I just wanted to express the excitement we have with our various growth programs. When I look through my finance lens, I'm convinced that these growth programs will lead to meaningful revenue growth and strong returns for the coming years. And it's a real pleasure to watch a winning strategy get executed by Mark and our business technology and strategy teams despite this business climate that we're facing and to be a part of that high-performing, winning culture that Mark talked about. So many of you know this already, good things are happening at Eastman that will benefit both 2016 and beyond. So with that, let me get back to my prepared remarks. 
I'll start on our first quarter corporate results on Slide 4. Overall, we delivered a solid quarter in a challenging business climate. Sales revenue declined as solid sales line growth was more than offset by lower selling prices. As we expected, the largest decline was in the Chemical Intermediates segment, where low oil has the greatest impact. Our operating earnings decreased as strong performance in Advanced Materials was more than offset by a decline in Chemical Intermediates. Overall, earnings per share was solid, reflecting good quality earnings and a lower tax rate. And I'm proud of how our commercial teams are finding the right balance of retaining appropriate value, given the attributes and value proposition of our specialties and sharing some that benefit of lower raws with our customers. 
On Slide 5, I'll transition to an overview of our cash flow and other finance highlights for the year -- or for the quarter, sorry. We continue to do an excellent job of generating cash with first quarter operating cash flow of $47 million in what is typically our lowest quarter. These results reflect our normal beginning of the year working capital build. Capital expenditures totaled $110 million. We continue to manage the pace of capital spending with the current economic environment while maintaining growth investments. We expect full year capital expenditures to be approximately $650 million, maybe a little less as the year unfolds. 
Free cash flow was a negative $63 million for the quarter, consistent with our expectations. Our first quarter dividend was $68 million. Our effective tax rate for the first quarter improved to approximately 24%. We continue to expect our full year tax rate will be between 24% and 25%, reflecting the continued benefits of our improved business operations. And we'll continue doing what we can to be at the lower end of that range. For free cash flow, we remain on track to be above $900 million. As a whole, I'm pleased with our earnings and cash flow performance to start the year. 
On Slides 6 and 7, I'll provide an overview of the 2 segments most affected by our business restructuring. This is the first quarter we're reporting under the new business structure, so we thought this would be helpful. First, under our new structure, Additives & Functional Products is well positioned for GDP-plus growth with an attractive market footprint and diverse geographic profile. Our transportation exposure is about 75% replacement and 25% OEM. This split is similar for building and construction. 
Performance drivers for the segment include increasing demand for quality vehicles, the improvement in housing market and increasing use of consumables by growing middle class. And we remain focused on attractive secular growth end markets, where innovation and deep customer connect offer a clear competitive advantage. As we look forward, I'm excited about the growth we expect from our innovation projects. And Mark already shared an exceptional story of rapid innovation in India. We are continuing to see strong growth in our tire resins as a performance additive and strong growth in our low VOC, low odor coalescents for architectural paints. And we're just getting started with innovation efforts in alkylamine specialties. 
Next, on Slide 7, the new Chemical Intermediates segment, which now comprises the majority of our olefins exposure. We'll benefit from advantaged market positions in key intermediates, particularly in North America. Performance drivers for this segment include growing middle class, continued adoption of nonphthalate plasticizers and North America shale gas advantage. In addition, flexible market outlets will drive our asset utilization and support growth for our strategic specialty product lines. Overall, the segment has a set of good value-adding businesses, which benefit from scale, integration and reliability and are essential to supporting the growth in our specialty businesses. 
Moving next to the segment results and starting with Advanced Materials on Slide 8, which delivered a strong quarter. Sales revenue increased due to higher sales volume of premium products, including Eastman Tritan copolyester and Saflex acoustic interlayers. This was partially offset by lower selling prices, primarily for copolyesters, attributed to lower raw material costs. Earnings increased primarily due to higher sales volume and improved product mix of premium products and lower unit cost due to higher capacity utilization. Looking at the full year, we continue to expect strong results for Advanced Materials as they progress on our strategy for this business of volume growth, mix improvement and fixed cost leverage. 
Sequentially, we expect volume will increase due to normal seasonality for our copolyester customers. We had strong sales in March and that has continued into mid-April. Interlayer volumes remain strong as OEM auto builds remain solid, acoustic growth continues and overall building and construction market in Europe is improving. As a result, for the year, we expect greater-than-GDP volume growth for this business. In addition to the strong volume growth, we expect further robust mix improvements with continued growth in higher-margin products such as Trident copolyester and acoustic interlayers. As we continue to build out our existing capacity, we benefit from fixed cost leverage. We expect all of these factors will result in strong earnings growth for Advanced Materials. 
Now to Additives & Functional Products on Slide 9. Overall, a solid quarter despite the short-term challenges. Revenue declined, primarily due to lower selling prices, attributed into lower raw material and energy costs and competitive pressure for certain products, particularly in Asia Pacific. Operating earnings decreased, primarily due to an unfavorable shift in foreign currency rates. Looking at the full year 2016, we expect solid volume growth for AFP, in line with the end market growth. In particular, we expect volume growth in the transportation, building and construction and consumables end markets. We also expect lower selling prices, reflecting both lower raw material costs. And as we discussed in January, we did an excellent job holding on to value last year while we also started to share this value with our customers towards the end of 2015 and through the first quarter this year. Overall, we expect Additives & Functional Products to be stable to slightly down, which would be a solid result in the current business climate. 
Now to Fibers on Slide 10. Results for this segment were as expected. Sales revenue declined, primarily due to lower acetyl chemical sales volume and lower acetate tow selling prices, mostly offset by higher acetate tow sales volume. The higher acetate tow sales volume was attributed to customer buying patterns. The decline in acetyl chemicals was due to lower-cost internal sourcing of cellulose acetate flake raw materials rather than obtaining these raw materials from our joint venture in Kingsport. Earnings for the quarter declined moderately as lower selling prices were partially offset by higher acetate tow sales volume, lower raw material and energy costs and reduced operating costs resulting from recent actions. 
Looking at the full year 2016, our current expectations are in line with the guidance I provided at an investor conference in March. We expect acetate tow sales volume to be down about 10% for the year, mainly reflecting customer backward integration and destocking in China. We also expect selling prices to decline but to be mostly offset by lower raw material costs as well as the benefit of cost actions we have taken. As a result, we are expecting earnings to be down close to 15% for the year. 
I'll finish up the segment review with Chemicals Intermediates on Slide 11. Chemicals Intermediates delivered a solid quarter despite significantly volatility -- significant volatility impacting their business. Sales revenues in the first quarter declined, primarily reflecting lower selling prices attributed to lower raw material costs. Chemicals Intermediates is also impacted by continued competitive pressure resulting from weak demand in Asia Pacific. Operating earnings declined, in part due to a difficult comparison. In the first half of 2015, we did a great job of holding onto value during a period of significant raw material cost decline. In the first quarter of 2016, selling prices were down, reflecting the lower raw material costs, and therefore margins declined. 
Looking at the full year 2016, we expect a number of factors to impact results. We expect solid volume growth due to continued plasticizers growth, particularly in the building and construction market as well as overall modest growth in North America, which is almost 70% of the overall segment revenue. We also expect olefin margins to remain under pressure as the recent increase in oil price has not yet translated to improving olefin prices, particularly ethylene. And we expect lower methanol prices to enable lower pricing by competitors in some of our acetyl and amines product lines. Therefore, for 2016, we expect earnings to be meaningfully lower, given the low oil environment and the pressure on spreads. And I'd add that when you think about how the year will unfold, we expect second quarter operating earnings will be lower than first quarter due to both significantly higher maintenance shutdown costs and how our propane hedge flows through cost. 
Lastly, I'll give you a quick update on our process for divesting our merchant ethylene position and potentially other commodity olefin product lines. As we mentioned in January, we're moving forward with this process and have to engage the bankers. The books are now out, and we're talking with potential buyers and are pleased with the initial interest. We will be disciplined, patient sellers as we move through this process, and we will update you further as the process continues to progress. 
With that, I'll turn it back over to Mark."

They've delivered over the last 6 years, and we expect that to continue in 2016. We expect our innovative specialty products will continue to grow strongly, improving product mix and accelerating overall earnings growth. And we are levered to grow in attractive end markets, especially transportation, building and construction and consumables. 
We're equally committed to meet our aggressive cost reduction targets. In addition, we expect to achieve further cost synergies from our acquisitions. And after delevering, we also expect to repurchase shares in the back half of the year. In the near term, however, slow global economic growth, combined with low oil and weak Asian and European currencies, are increasing competitive pressure in some products. And as we guided earlier in the year, we expect some inventory destocking in China to impact Fibers' results. 
Net, we will continue to drive hard to deliver EPS that approaches our 2015 EPS and we are maintaining our guidance for EPS to be flat to down 5%. And given where olefin spreads are today, we are likely to be more towards the lower end of that range. I would also note that the first half of the year will be a tougher comp than the back half. As I look beyond 2016, we are well positioned for growth as these short-term challenges recede and our strong growth drivers continue. Altogether, I'm confident we'll continue to deliver attractive earnings growth in the long term as we transform towards a specialty portfolio.

So obviously, it's a pretty dynamic environment out there with oil and currency and it's difficult to predict the next month, let alone the remainder of the year. What I love about our portfolio right now is we're growing the way we should in our specialties. We're driving a lot of strong volume growth, a lot of mix improvement through innovation in Advanced Materials, did a great job of holding onto value in Additives & Functional Products. So we feel good about that, and we feel great about the cost reductions coming through as we expected. But what we're not seeing right now, as we expected in January, is the improvement in olefin spreads. Oil has certainly gone up, as we all know, to $45, but we're not seeing sort of the olefin prices recover in the way we would have expected, especially on the ethylene side. So it should have been more in the low 30% -- $0.30 range and we'll get spot down to $0.25. So that's really the main issue, Dave. There's some increasing competitive activity with currencies. Currencies and just about FX translation, it includes how people use that improved cost structure to pursue volume, unsuccessfully I might add, but they gave it a good shot. And that put some price pressure in the marketplace that you have to respond. So we're seeing a little bit of that here and there. But principally, it's an olefins issue. Overall though, I feel very much on track with our strategy and how we're going to create earnings growth, especially as you look at it from '16 through '17 and beyond. And the one interesting upside that's coming out of all this is we're finding customers highly motivated to find innovation these days because we're all living in a tough world. And so we're seeing tremendous engagement even from Asian customers looking on how to innovate and value up their product portfolio. So we're really starting to see some acceleration on that front, which is great to see."

So I'll break it down both from a cigarette demand point of view and a tow point of view. So on the cigarette side, we see primary demand being very consistent with our views we've shared in all the previous calls. Outside of China, it's sort of down 1% to 2% like it's been for years. Inside China, we're still not seeing any signs that there's some significant change in primary consumption of cigarettes, so I'd call it sort of flat, maybe up 1%. But there's -- some uncertainty here in the short term is the economic pressure in China could affect people's rate of purchasing cigarettes. But overall, I would say it's very stable. And especially when you think inside China that the Chinese National Tobacco Company principal goal is to grow tax revenue, they're assigned a target to grow at stated China GDP around 6.5%, 7%. And they've never missed their target ever from what I know. So I think we should expect stability there when it comes to primary demand. So then you get back to what's going on in destocking. And what we see is at the tow level, the Chinese National Tobacco Company has set a pretty aggressive destocking target for tow this year. And you have to remember that demand drop last year and this year is a function of 2 things. The first driver is CNTC backward integrating with us in '14, with Daicel in '15. And so certain amount of import demand was just replaced by internal production inside China. That's actually a little bit bigger driver than destocking relative to primary demand. And so you've got that happening plus they've built up too much tow inventory in their imports as they did this backward integration. And so now they're pulling the inventory down. Their target puts it to a very low level, so I think that destocking will be complete. So we're now really looking at what other decisions do they make around cigarette inventory in the marketplace in between tow and primary demand. That's very opaque. We think they're making good progress on that and they've got this mandate to keep on growing. So I think the vast majority of the destocking should be behind us, but I'm not going to forecast inventory of cigarettes in China."

I'm not sure I need to say anything else. But that's exactly what we've been doing. In Advanced Materials, we've been growing through volume and mix and spreads have been relatively stable when it comes to raw materials. And so that is a volume-mix story and how we're improving the margins there and how we're growing and delivering results. So I would take that off the table, and we feel very, very stable about how we're going to grow there. AFP, as you saw, prices came off a bit in the first quarter. And what we did last year, and I would -- on a restated basis, if you look at Additives & Functional Products last year from '14 to '15, prices were only down about 3%. So we had a great success last year in holding on to value through the beginning half of last year really through the third quarter, expanding our margins and tremendous growth in earnings as you can now see in Additives & Functional Products and our specialty businesses from '14 to '15. So we started giving some of that value back and sharing the value of raw materials with our customer in the fourth quarter last year through the first quarter of this year, which is the right thing to do. It's the way you create value because at the end of the day, what you all want is us to grow long term, not just short term our earnings. And you've got to have market share. And more importantly, you've got to have customers that are motivated and engaged with you to work on innovation for the next generation of products. And I think we're walking that balance as carefully as we can. And the margins, I would expect, will normalize around sort of what you're seeing in the first quarter. And I think that's what we'll see for the rest of the year. So I think that business is doing well. And there's always the choice to hold prices high, be aggressive and deliver great earnings relative to raws in the short term. But sooner or later, you're setting yourself up for a volume fall and certainly a lack of innovation in that portfolio if you do that because customers aren't very motivated when they can see how much your raw materials have improved to work with you. So we're not going to make that choice. I think that's a mistake. And I'm proud of how the team is walking that balance. It's not easy in a tough environment. We're pushing hard for earnings growth every day, but I think that's going to work out well for us long term."

So we're moving from the windshields to the side lamps to the sunroofs as they're adding more, not just laminated glass, but typically acoustic laminated glass to quiet the cabin for a better rider experience. So we're seeing great engagement there. In fact, when I was with a key customer glass customer in Japan last week, it was very exciting to hear about how much they're looking forward to our next-gen acoustics and heads-up display products. So we've added a lot of value to this industry already. And we've got a new acoustic product that's going to allow them to lightweight the glass, maybe take as much as 25% of the weight of the glass out, which is a big deal. And we've got a far superior heads-up display product coming out as well that's going to dramatically increase the size and clarity, allowing a lot of mobility to be added of information to the car for the whole new Internet of Things trend in the car. So lot of engagement, a lot of innovation there, so a great success. And then even in performance films, we've rolled out a very successful new channel strategy in performance films, where we're growing, especially in North America, bringing a lot more people into the category, seeing the value proposition of greater solar ejection, skin protection from skin cancer as well as aesthetics and security.

We've told investors about that for several quarters now. And that's sort of playing out as expected, but that's some of the price decline. The other places, in the olefin-related products, the specialty products like our coalescents, where we're seeing some prices being shared with our customers. As raw materials improved last year, we held prices fairly well. And now we're reducing some prices there to share the value with our customers. We are seeing prices come off a bit in the Crystex product as we are growing in that business and defending our share again very much as we expected but some of the prices coming off there, especially in Asia. What I would say is it's quite encouraging about the tires market as we're seeing a nice recovery in demand in tires, especially in the first quarter here relative to last year. And that market is getting back on stable footing and well positioned to deliver some nice volume growth this year. So overall, I'd say the prices are more or less playing out the way we would expect. It's important that we defend our markets and keep these customers engaged as we work on this next generation of product introductions. Really excited about the Crystex process that we're launching. We've got the retrofit line in Germany up and running that'll improve our cost and enable us to have a much superior product.

To take another step further, if you look at the quality of our operating earnings in our company right now, it's substantially better, right? It's about $0.60 share better if you strip out both the propane hedge and the currency hedge, which I think of as financial activity. So we'd have had -- and that will be the same number roughly applied to last year. So we would have very strong earnings last year and very strong earnings this year relative to sort of what you're seeing because of this financial hedging. So that's why we're divesting the bulk ethylene and some of these other associated Chemical Intermediates is to get this volatility noise out of our story. Because the real story for Eastman is tremendous growth in specialties, tremendous innovation across a wide range of very attractive markets, a very consistent strategy in driving that. We fundamentally believe in integration and the value it's created for us and are very happy to have our large integrated assets supporting our specialty.

So we're making great progress towards our goal of $200 million of productivity gains.

And it's not surprising that you would see it in those kind of products. And it's really a combination of the world's growing slowly, in particular China is growing slowly and not consuming a lot of capacity that they've added for a variety of products that sit in Chemical Intermediates. And so when you combine that excess capacity with a low oil environment and in some other places, some weakening currencies, you can get competitors chasing volume with their improved cost structure. And basically, that's what you're seeing. So you see some pressure in olefin-related products in Chemical Intermediates. You see some pressure in acetyls. So as methanol price gets low, that allows the Asians, and particularly the Chinese, to drop their acetic acids, acetic anhydride prices, and you have to respond to that as it works its way across the world. And even in alkylamines, we have some formula contracts that track methanol. And we have a very advantaged methanol contract that goes into our cost structure. So just like our coal gasification or shale gas position, if our competitors have lower methanol price, some of that price if going to come down, you're going to get a bit of a compression. So that's what you're seeing. I'd say added to that, there is some structural pressure in things like plasticizers. We've been talking about that since 2013, where the Koreans have been dumping their product all over the world since they cannot get it into China anymore. And so you see some pressure in a few products like that. And it's principally there. There's a few products that I already discussed in the prior question around Additives & Functional Products like adhesives. So I think I've already addressed that in AFP."

So there are lumpy buying patterns, and so you have to be extremely careful about trying to over interpret any quarter when you're comparing us to our tow peers. But there is also a difference that we've discussed in the past, which is we've been incredibly successful in having a very large share of imports into China that's allowed us to grow a lot of earnings and generate a lot of cash for shareholders in the past 10 years. Of course, there's the flip side of that now when imports are dropping, we're going to feel the pressure of that more than our peers with the drop in imports in China. So I'd say you're right there, that's sort of the key difference. On a global basis, I think our market shares are very stable and we certainly have every intention of maintaining our position on a global basis from a share point of view. What I like about Eastman and our long-term future here is we have the lowest cost, largest scale, fully integrated back to coal, flake and tow position for the world. And we've got a great asset here in flake that allows us to support all of our assets both here, Korea and China. And because of that integration, because of the great value creation we get from our other cellulosic products in Additives & Functional Products, Advanced Materials, we also have more innovation capability than anyone else in sort of keeping that integrated asset base running. So I'm very confident about long-term position, and we're committed to doing it. So we'll see how it plays out. But I think we're the winner at the end of this game."

I feel very confident about our ability to grow value of mix, command very attractive margins. I think we have one of the strongest EBITDA margins in the industry and have every intention to keeping them stable as we go forward leveraging our fixed cost as well as mix improvement. So overall, I think we're on the right strategy. As I look beyond this year, we're clearly doing a lot of adjustments. We have such significant changes in margin -- not margin but in oil prices and currency. You're going to get margins flying up and down as you sort of normalize around stable levels. And you're going to see that stabilize. That's not unique to us, it's going to be true for any company connected to petrochemicals or a global business. But what I like is, as I look beyond this year, we've got a lot of great drivers to deliver growth going forward. So we've got the strong product mix and innovation. We've got the cost management that is going to continue to deliver great results. And we'll continue being very disciplined in the cost. We've got the hedges rolling off. So that $0.60 a share I mentioned earlier will come back to earnings over the next 2 years. And then you've got a very strong free cash flow that will continue to get better as we go from this year forward. And that once the delevering is completed, you've got repurchasing shares and increasing the dividend. So it all adds up. I mean, obviously there's a lot we can't control around the economy when it comes to how it's going to play out on oil and currency. But I like the fact that we have a lot in our control. The company is very focused on innovation, very focused on customer engagement, which is the only way you get to innovate. And that's how we're going to deliver results for our owners."

I'll start on Slide 3. I'll begin my comments with strategic highlights for the second quarter and first half of 2016. We continue to make solid progress in executing our strategy of becoming a more specialty chemical company. Du",711,"Good morning, everyone. I'll start on Slide 3. I'll begin my comments with strategic highlights for the second quarter and first half of 2016. 
We continue to make solid progress in executing our strategy of becoming a more specialty chemical company. During the quarter, we continued to upgrade the quality of our product mix by growing high-margin specialty product lines, particularly in Advanced Materials and Additives & Functional Products. In the first half, AM delivered 14% growth over last year on top of 40% growth in 2015 over '14, and we did it primarily through organic volume and mix and the highly attractive bolt-on acquisition. 
As growing innovative, high-value products is a key component of our strategy, and that was several customers in Europe recently to see how our innovation strategies proceeding in action and how we're helping our customers win through innovation. In Germany, I met with a leading manufacturer medical devices for the operating theater. They've been in search of a polymer that can withstand the new stronger disinfectants being used in hospitals, which is causing cracking with existing polymers. The company tested a lot of polymers, all of which failed to deliver the needed chemical resistance. 
However, Tritan delivered on the challenge by providing the required blend of chemical resistance and durability. This has positioned Tritan as a material choice in both clear and opaque applications. Next up for Tritan are applications in safety and protection devices. 
Also in Nuremberg, Germany, we successfully started up our new Crystex technology. This improves our cost position by better than 20% while also creating the opportunity for more differentiated products like Crystex. This 2 -- this new technology pushes the boundaries of thermostability, dispersion and flow, all important properties of insoluble sulfur, which can help our customers maximize the productivity of their operations. With the conversion, we are rolling out several new Crystex products with differentiated costs and/or performance, and we are working with several customers to get our products to market. 
Early indications of performance are very positive, and we anticipate having business before the end of the year. The success in the Nuremberg supports our investment in Malaysia, where we continue to deploy this technology and build the largest and lowest cost facility in the world, and this is just great evidence of us creating value through innovation, not only in an heritage Eastman but our acquisitions here as well as you've already seen us deliver in interlayers and performance films. 
Finally, we have recently launched Aerafin. It's a family of new adhesive polymers for hygiene and packaging markets, leveraging Eastman's olefin technology platform, which expands our offering beyond adhesive resins to adhesive polymers. The need in this market at the consumer level is for low-odor adhesives, and Aerafin is recognized as best-in-class on that front. 
In addition to low odor, Aerafin provides more robust operating environment, enabling higher line speeds at lower temperatures. I'm incredibly excited and very proud of how we are driving innovation and customer engagement. As I spend a lot of time out of the marketplace, it's great to see the evidence of these wins, which gives me great confidence we're on the right track to drive growth through innovation. 
While we're seeing growth in innovation and specialty products, we're also facing increasing macro challenges, particularly in Chemical Intermediates. We're pulling all levers to mitigate the impact of these challenges. 
On the cost management front, we remain well on track with our cost-reduction efforts to deliver $100 million to the bottom line without sacrificing our long-term growth initiatives. And we are making progress with process we restarted earlier this year to divest our merchant ethylene as well as potentially other commodity olefin product lines. 
Our team continues to generate very impressive free cash flow as we are on track to deliver another great year of $900 million, enabling our strong dividend, deleveraging and accelerating our share repurchases. 
Our second quarter earnings overall are disappointing. We continue to deliver compelling results in Advanced Materials and Additives & Functional Products, and I'm confident as we get the challenges for Chemical Intermediates behind us and we stabilize Fibers, Eastman will emerge stronger than ever. 
Now I'll turn it over to Curt to discuss the corporate and segment results."

I know it's been a busy week. So I appreciate you joining us this morning. I'll start with our corporate results on Slide 5.

So I appreciate you joining us this morning. 
I'll start with our corporate results on Slide 5. Overall, sales revenue decreased, primarily due to lower selling prices, particularly in Chemical Intermediates. Volume was down slightly with the decline in Fibers mostly offset by an increase in Advanced Materials. Our operating earnings decreased, primarily to declines in Chemical Intermediates and Fibers. 
Despite the challenges, our operating margin was above 16%, and adjusted earnings per share was $1.68 for the quarter. By no means are we satisfied with the business environment we find ourselves in and the negative impact it is having on our results. Thus, we are taking additional actions to mitigate the challenges we face, and Mark will outline these actions in a few minutes. 
Moving next to the segment results and starting with Advanced Materials on Slide 6, which delivered a great first half of the year. Second quarter sales revenue was relatively unchanged as higher sales volume of premium products, including Saflex acoustic interlayers and Tritan copolyester, was offset by lower selling prices, primarily for copolyesters attributed to lower raw material cost such as paraxylene. 
One other point on second quarter volumes, Advanced Materials experienced some destocking in the first quarter of 2015 followed by a restocking in second quarter 2015. So we are very pleased with these results for our second quarter of 2016, especially given the tough comp. 
Year-over-year, operating earnings were relatively unchanged. Sequentially, operating earnings increased by $24 million or more than 20%, driven by a seasonal increase in sales volume, including another quarterly volume record for Tritan copolyester. And for the first half, operating earnings increased year-over-year by 14% or $30 million, driven by a 5% increase in sales volume, improved product mix and lower unit cost due to higher capacity utilization. 
As a result, first half of 2016 operating margins increased to 19.4%, an approximately 200 basis point improvement over the first half of 2015. For the back half of the year, underlying business performance should remain strong as Advanced Materials continues to execute its strategy of volume growth, mix improvement and fixed-cost leverage. 
To underscore how well this business is executing this strategy in 2015, Advanced Materials increased earnings by almost 40%, and we expect to build on that success this year. Given the results of the first half of 2016 and our strong outlook for the second half, Advanced Materials is positioned to deliver double-digit earnings growth in 2016. We are delivering compelling proof of our ability to drive growth through innovation even in a difficult macro environment. 
Now to Additives & Functional Products on Slide 7. Overall, a solid quarter despite short-term challenges. Revenue declined due to lower selling prices attributed to lower raw material costs, 2% volume growth for many attractive end markets, including strong growth for Crystex, for our tire resins and for nutrition products was offset by volume and mix declines in product lines exposed to energy and industrial construction markets. Operating earnings decreased, primarily due to lower prices more than offsetting lower raw material costs. And the operating margin remains solid at 21.8%, slightly above the year-ago period. 
As I look at full year of 2016, we expect to grow volumes and expect our prices to stabilize. Our commercial teams are doing great job in managing trade-offs and maintaining margins and customer engagement for innovation and growth. We will continue to face macroeconomic and competitive challenges, but given the strength of the portfolio businesses in this segment and attractive end markets, Additives & Functional Products remains on track with our previous expectations for full year earnings to be slightly down, which would be a solid result in the current business climate. 
Now to Fibers on Slide 8. Second quarter revenue, volume and earnings were slightly below our expectations. Sales revenue decreased, primarily due to the lower sales volume, particularly for acetate tow, flake and yarn combined with lower selling prices, particularly for tow. The decline in acetate tow sales volume was due to customer inventory destocking in China, consistent with our expectations for volumes to be down to [ph] about 10% for the year. The lower acetate flake sales volume was due to timing of shipments to our China acetate tow joint venture. Lower yarn volume was due to trade issues impacting our customers. 
Earnings for the second quarter decreased due to lower sales volume. Despite the decline of volume, operating margins were about 31% as our cost-reduction efforts offset the decline in prices. Looking at the full year of 2016, we expect second half earnings to be similar to first half, which is slightly below our previous expectations as we are experiencing some short-term challenges in acetate flake and yarn, which is an incremental headwind. And I'll add that as we discussed for some time now in the last earnings call and at investor conferences, price risk exists going into 2017. Given the current lower capacity utilization in acetate tow and the lack of additional asset rationalizations beyond what we did in the United Kingdom, the risk of competitors chasing share with price does exist, and we have seen our competitors attempt this strategy, which has created pricing pressure in our contract discussions for next year. 
Frankly, I don't understand the logic of these actions in a flat to declining business, but yet, here we are. What I do understand and what I like about Eastman and our future in this industry is we have the lowest cost position from the largest scale with backward integration into flake, masked with our tow position in Tennessee, Korea and China. And our customers place significant strategic value on both our asset footprint and our ability to innovate and deliver high-quality, reliable product. 
Further, our vertical and horizontal integration creates tremendous value and innovation capability for cellulosic products in Additives & Functional Products and Advanced Materials, and we have a track record of innovation from this technology platform that is well established for -- over decades. 
So I am confident about our long-term position and strongly believe this will continue to be a valuable business for Eastman going forward. 
I'll finish up the segment review of Chemical Intermediates on Slide 9. Sales revenue decreased due to lower selling prices, which were mostly the result of negative impact of lower market prices for propylene, ethylene and methanol and continued competitive pressure from weak demand in Asia Pacific. Operating earnings decreased due to lower selling prices more than offset lower raw material costs, in addition to higher planned maintenance costs. 
Looking at the full year of 2016, we expect a number of factors to impact results. We expect olefin margins to remain under pressure as the increase in oil prices is not yet translated to improving olefin prices. In particular, both ethylene prices have been disappointing as we have seen U.S. prices remain significantly discounted versus the rest of the world. We also expect lower methanol prices to continue putting pressure on market prices for some of our acetyl and amines product lines. And competitive pressures particular from competitors in Asia have intensified, and we expect this will continue to the back half of the year. 
Considering the low oil environment, excess global capacity in olefins and methanol and increased competitive pressures due to slow economic growth, we expect second half year earnings to be below first half, with sequential improvement for both third and fourth quarters, which should continue into next year. 
Lastly, I'll give you a quick update on our process for divesting our merchant ethylene capacity and potentially certain commodity olefin product lines. We continue our discussions with potential buyers and still expect this process will take the greater part of this year to resolve itself. As you would expect, we'll remain disciplined and patient sellers as we move through the process. 
On Slide 10, I'll transition to an overview of our cash flow and other financial highlights for second quarter. We continue to do an excellent job of generating cash with second quarter operating cash flow of approximately $500 million. We had nominal income tax payments and no contributions to our U.S. pension plans in the quarter. These payments are typically in the second half of the year, and we expect that will be the case in 2016. 
Capital expenditures totaled $124 million. We continue to manage the pace of capital spending with the current economic environment while still maintaining our growth investments and thus, have reduced our full year capital expenditures to be between $600 million and $625 million. 
Free cash flow for the quarter was a very strong $370 million. And during the quarter, we reduced net debt by over $300 million, paid our second quarter dividend of $68 million and repurchased $25 million of our shares. 
Also during the quarter, we successfully sold EUR 500 million, 1.5% notes due 2023 in the European public debt market, with proceeds used to repay $500 million of our 2.4% notes due in June of 2017 as well as some other borrowings. 
Our effective tax rate for the second quarter was just over 21%, aided by an expected discrete tax benefit. We continue to expect our full year tax rate will be between 24% and 25%, reflecting the continued benefits of our improvement in business operations. 
And lastly, we remain on track to generate more than $900 million of free cash flow for the year, which is a very strong performance in this current environment. 
And with that, I'll turn it back over to Mark."

I'll transition to our outlook on Slide 11. Looking at the back half of the year, we expect our innovative specialty businesses will continue to grow strongly, improving product mix and accelerating our overall earnings growth. We continue t",784,"Thanks, Curt. I'll transition to our outlook on Slide 11. Looking at the back half of the year, we expect our innovative specialty businesses will continue to grow strongly, improving product mix and accelerating our overall earnings growth. We continue to see the benefits of our vertical and horizontal integration as it enables an advantaged cost position and delivers capital-efficient earnings growth in our specialties. We will also get benefit from the acquisitions, which are creating value in both cost synergies and accelerating revenue growth. 
We remain committed to our aggressive cost-reduction targets and are on track with them. And after reducing debt, we also expect to accelerate share repurchases in the back half of the year. 
In the near term, we have a number of challenges, particularly in packing Chemical Intermediates, and these have been increasing. As Curt mentioned, lower olefin margins and lower methanol prices are headwinds. In particular, the most significant change in our expectation was U.S. ethylene prices not tracking up with oil and global ethylene prices. We're also seeing excess supply pressure as slow economic growth is not sufficient to absorb the large amount of capacity that's been built in a number of products, especially in China for Chemical Intermediates. 
Our most recent outlook was that 2016 adjusted EPS will be down about 5%. Given the challenges we faced, most significantly in Chemical Intermediates and modestly in Fibers, we expect full year 2016 EPS will be down up to 10% compared with 2015. As you think about the cadence through the rest of the year, we expect earnings in the third quarter will be similar to the second quarter as sequential growth and operating earnings is offset by an increase in the tax rate for the quarter. 
Last, this outlook assumes current business conditions continue in the back half of the year. If the conditions improve, that would be upside. 
Turning next to Slide 12. Obviously, our EPS expectation for this year are not what we want them to be, and we're not happy about that. Given that, we are taking significant action to mitigate impacted challenges we see in front of us. We're using all levers to improve results not just in 2016 but going forward. 
For me, that begins by maintaining our commitment to innovation and market development and doing everything we can to accelerate growth from these platforms. We've already realized commercial success for many of these platforms this year, and we are on the cusp of even bigger wins, and we're working to deliver these successes as fast as possible. 
We also remain committed to cost reduction. As I mentioned, we are on target with the cost reductions we implemented earlier this year. And as the challenges we faced have increased, we will be removing at least another $100 million of costs towards the end of this year to ensure that we deliver attractive earnings growth next year. 
While our SG&A and R&D as a percent of sales was already in the lowest quartile of our peers, we are committed to attaining this new cost-reduction target without sacrificing innovation and market development. We continue to review our portfolio. This includes a process to divest our merchant ethylene capacity and some other product lines, and we will effectively manage capital allocation through this slow growth environment. This includes our strong dividend, which will increase; reducing debt; and increasing our share repurchases in the second half of '16 and into '17. 
As I look beyond '16, we are well positioned for growth as these short-term challenges recede and our strong growth drivers continue. Altogether, I'm confident we will continue to deliver attractive earnings growth in the long term as we transform towards a specialty portfolio. 
With the combined set of actions we're taking, we expect to be back on track for 8% to 12% EPS growth in 2017. 
I'll close with our key themes for 2016 on Slide 13. We continue to have a strong portfolio of specialty businesses, and through these businesses, we are driving growth, we're innovating, and we are improving our earnings mix. We face increasing challenges, particularly in Chemical Intermediates and Fibers, and we are responding to this challenging environment with the actions I just outlined. Our cash flow remains one of the best in our industry, and we are deploying it for a strong dividend, leverage and accelerating repurchases of shares. 
And lastly, despite near-term temporary challenges, I remain very confident in our strategy and our ability to grow earnings. Eastman will emerge from the challenges stronger than ever, and we'll continue our journey to achieving our vision of becoming a leading specialty company. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Greg."

But as you already mentioned, Frank, we recognize it's currently a tough economic environment or environment with ethylene margins right now. So really in order for this truly progress, our belief it really requires 2 strategic parties, buyers or sellers, that understand the long-term value of olefins and the value of the quality of assets that we have. So I -- my sense is ethylene is kind of looking at that way, but we'll see how it plays out. In regards to timing, it's still a top priority for us. We've got a great team working on it, but we'll just have to be disciplined as we go through the process, and it will still take a greater part of this year to see how this plays out."

There's a lot of volatility going on right now as I mentioned. On the olefin side, we're seeing especially ethylene but as well as propylene being fairly depressed in the U.S. relative to what's going on outside the U.S. So even though oil's improved, we haven't really seen a logical improvement of those olefin prices, and that's been a disappointment in the second quarter, and we certainly revised our outlook for the rest of the year to reflect the current conditions that have been in the sort of June, early July time frame when we built our forecast. I would also note that while the olefin prices haven't gone up much, the propane prices and ethylene prices have, especially propane. So they have tracked up with oil significant improvement in global export capacity to get the propane out of the country. So that's created some compression here that on a long-term basis I don't think plays out. I don't think you have ethylene and propylene stranded in the U.S. forever. There's obviously not enough derivative capacity to monetize that monomer in the globe, but that will come online like many people have already discussed. And this disconnect will be closed, and we'll go back to what is a normal situation, where these prices are more closely connected to the globe. And then that would be a material recovery in earnings from -- for us as -- when that happens in the future. So I think that's all playing out sort of as we expected. That's sort of the olefin story. I would note that there's 2 other parts to the story when it comes to Chemical Intermediates. Methanol prices are 40% lower than they were a year ago, and it's the same kind of story, not only have they tracked down with the oil, but there's oversupply in methanol, and so we haven't seen methanol prices recover really in the second quarter as you would have expected with the recovery in oil. And that's also putting pressure on the earnings in the segment when you think about acid and hydride competitors in Asia set the price ultimately, based on the purchased methanol costs, and that's but a lot of price pressure on those products, not as significant as olefins for us, but it's still quite material, and it's even having a modest impact on functional amines, where we have a lot of costs pass-through contracts tied to methanol prices. And in both acetyls and methanol, we have advantaged coal gasification as well as disadvantaged fixed-price methanol contract. And so you get some compression there and then there is some additional pressure, of course, with Asian competitors with excess supply, no demand in China to absorb it. So they're dumping those products all over the world. I would say though, Frank, that the good news about this is that we're seeing the price stabilize, and we're seeing evidence of this in a couple of different fronts. One, we just filed an antidumping case in plasticizers, where we're seeing some pretty extreme behavior from our Korean-based competitors, and the Commerce Department's already agreed that we may have a case for economic harm and have launched an investigation to that, and we're also seeing some of their products, some of our competitors in China shut down because they're out of the money at the current pricing that they're sort of driving in the marketplace. So I would say we think it's bottoming, and we just need to start seeing some of the situations improve, and that's all embedded in our guidance. But right now, our guidance for the rest of the year is it stays challenging like it is now for this year."

And so I spent a little time trying to put my thoughts together, and I think there's a number of things that are important to be clear about those in the market context and what our strategy is. So let's start with demand. First of all, nothing's changed our view about tow demand for this year and moving forward. Outside of China continues declining 1% to 2%. We still believe that the primary issue in China this year is inventory destocking of tow, where they had way too much inventory in tow. We think that will run its course this year. There remains uncertainty about that will turn into next year because while I think tow destocking will be over, we still don't have clear understanding of what's going on in cigarette demand in China, and so there's a chance of some continued destocking there. But when you put it all together our view is tow imports into China next will be sort of flat, potentially modestly up. Regarding our specific performance versus our competitors as you can see through the first of this year and the data, we have obviously taking a bit more of a hidden volume than our competitors, and we've been clear about that because for 10 years, we've been huge beneficiary of having the larger share of imports in China while China was growing, and there's always 2 sides to those positions. And when imports drop, we're going to feel more of that than anyone else. But when we look through all that, we still see that we're on track for 10% decline in tow and demand. Nothing's changed our view about that at all, but you've got to remember that there's some chunkiness in the buying patterns with all different customers, to some degree, and so there's some chunkiness in buying patterns that will -- so for our second quarter, we are probably a little bit like compared to what we expected but nothing material. It's also important to remember in our volume numbers that while we're saying 10% down in tow, there's other things going on like the timing issue in flake, some yarn being off and no longer having as acetyl chemical sales to our self of the JV we have with Solvay for making flake. But we are seeing some aggressive actions by all of our competitors going after share, and we mentioned a long time ago when you get a huge currency change like you do in Japan and Europe, you can think about passing the marketplace to take share and not even feel the margin impact. And we've seen as you can see through the data that everyone's reporting that we have some dynamics going on there and a part of the story for us is some modest share loss this year outside of China, but it's pretty modest at this point, but it's disappointing to see this happen. We've been talking about the fact that if excess capacity remains in the industry, it's entirely possible that we're going to have people behave in a way where they're trying to chase share with price. With these margins, it's really tempting as you're just living for the short term, and we're seeing some of that. But in this context, I think we've had a very clear strategy what we're trying to do and yes, I just want to sort of make sure we're clear about what we're doing. First, we recognize and accept the challenges that we have in China, and so when we added capacity with CNTC, which was very low-cost tow capacity, we chose to take out an equal amount of capacity in the United Kingdom that was relatively high-cost for us, balancing our position there and accepting those changes in market conditions. We also exited our flake JV with Solvay to reduce our costs, given we no longer need that capacity given we shut down the U.K. tow situation. So we've done everything we can to sort of balance our capacity situation and the result of what's going on in China, and we're now down to being the lowest cost supplier in the world in tow. We have the largest scale asset in flake. It's backward integrated in coal, and we have lowest cost tow assets in Tennessee, Korea and China that equally matched to that flake capacity, and we have no further tow assets that we can shut down at or it would just leave us long in flake, which doesn't make much sense for us. Second, we since we have the best cost position in the history, we have every intention of maintaining our market share outside of China. So when these competitors are trying to gain share from us, which obviously they've done, it simply results in lower prices and therefore, lower earnings and cash flow for everyone. Third, we're committed to be the leading supplier of customers based on the strength that we have in our quality, in our reliability, our unique innovation capabilities and the strength of our asset base to supply our customers. So as we look at 2016, we do expect earnings are going to be down due to this price pressure as these contract discussions have now started early, and we're seeing this behavior from our competitors and is likely we'll be down 10% to 20% before you include the cost actions we just announced. But it's early, and so we're going to have to see all these contract discussions play out for the rest of the year and how it nets out, and we'll keep you updated. When I look beyond 2017, and this is quite important, many of these new contracts are going to be multiyear contracts, providing price and supplies stability for our customers. You would also think that given how all of this is playing out and not really working out well for anyone, our competitors are going to have to start looking at their cost positions like we did and think about rationalizing high cost assets that we all certainly have, and we'll just have to see what they choose to do. I would also note that we're not just sitting around waiting for what's going to happen at tow business. Eastman's been innovator for 90 years in cellulosics. We've innovated a huge range of new products over the years, and you've seen those great results we found in AFP and AM, and so as we saw these things start to develop all the way back in 2014, and we knew that we had to accelerate our innovation efforts for new applications in cellulosics, and we been doing that as we need to load these assets and new applications. It's obviously still early when it comes to growth and innovation, but I've been incredibly impressed by our teams and how they've raised to that challenge, and we have a number of great projects going forward here developing new applications that'll help of the long term. So when I look at the Fibers challenges that we have and included I'm still confident we can do 8% to 12% earnings growth next year when I consider the company wide cost actions we're going to take as well as doing everything we can to reduce cost in Fibers directly, and the growth that I expect in the other 3 segments relative to this year as well as our ability to deploy our free cash flow."

So that's both the propane hedge headwind being rolled off as well as the currency has benefits coming on. On the outlook for propane and propylene because what really matters is the cracking spread relative to propylene and ethylene to our view is the market is already reconnecting propane to global values with all the export capacity that's readily available in the U.S. So I think you're seeing that now with how propane prices improved through second quarter and even as oils come off recently, you see propane prices follow it down. So just depends on your view on oil, and you can get a view of what you think propane's going to do next year. The bigger question is what I already discussed, which is what our ethylene and propylene prices going to do, especially ethylene as they've been stranded and disconnected. I mean, it's really significant when you think about ethylene in Asia in the mid-$0.40 range, and we're in the mid to high $0.20 range in ethylene times 700 million pounds of ethylene that we sell, and this is that product line. You do the math and whatever you think that delta should be, and you can get to some very large earning numbers that have been a headwind for us relative to what we expected at the beginning of the year."

Certainly, we're committed to driving our portfolio towards specialty as hard as we possibly can, and you do that through multiple things. We've done, I think, some excellent acquisitions, large ones like Solutia and Taminco and some bolt-ons as well, and we paid reasonable prices for them and are going to get attractive ROICs relative to where the average cost of capital. So -- and frankly, those acquisitions were intentional. We always knew we had challenges in Fibers and olefins at some point in the future. We intentionally chose not to build crackers and PDH units because we were convinced 5 years ago that, that industry would overbuild, and we were intentionally diversifying our portfolio with the strength of the cash that we had at the time in olefins and Fibers into more attractive long-term markets where we can innovate. So I think that part of the strategy is great and on track. And of course, we've always been a disciplined seller of underperforming businesses. We sold off $3.5 billion of revenue from PT to polyolefins, et cetera, in the past, and we're trying to get rid of more of it now in this current prices on the bulk ethylene and some other products. We're doing everything in our control. Unfortunately, I've said this before we're out of the M&A market as a tool to sort of further diversify our portfolio at this moment in time. I think the valuations are way too high in the market that are being paid right now 15x anything, it seems. It's hard to get on ROIC at an acceptable level, and we still old-fashioned that way. We still believe on levered return on capital even if that is close to free, and so we don't think that value creating for our shareholders, we're not going to do that. What we are going to do is focus on innovation and driving innovative growth across our portfolio. We've been doing it for a long time as heritage Eastman, and we're actually excellent proof points about how we're doing it in the acquisitions from interlayers to Crystex performance films and/or starting to accelerate somewhat great opportunities in Taminco out that we've got under the hood there. So we're going to do that. We're going to take out cost as much as we possible can but not cut our innovation programs. That's a core choice for us and ask Curt mentioned, we've got one of the best free cash flows in the industry, and we'll be repurchasing shares as aggressively as we can but also containing our credit rating."

Propylene is a little bit artificially depressed by excess supply of PDH out there but end of the day, propylene prices going to gets out of Asia, particularly probably China, either be PDH methanol or olefins or NAFTA or connected oil. So once you get derivative capacity either to turn off as propylene into something, I think you start getting back to some more normal relationships of propylene to propane with where oil turns out to be."

So in regards to the shape of the curve, we are definitely the lowest-cost player, and answer your question, the curve has flattened out a bit because while we're be based on coal, our competitors are based on natural gas and methanol that drives our cost structure. And certainly those prices have come down. So in this year, it's feeling a little bit sort of flattened out relative to the past. As you look forward, coal's probably going to stay pretty low in the U.S., and natural gas prices are already moving up and methanol prices will certainly move up with oil as well. So I think the curve is actually going to steepen relative to us from this year going forward is our view of sort of how that cost curve's changed and is going to go back to being steeper as we move forward. I'm not going to get into details of the steepness of the curve. What I can tell you there's plenty of high cost assets out there that are discrete stand-alone assets.

We're also going to do everything we can to reduce cost offset the short-term challenges being responsible for delivering value for our shareholders, both the short and long term at the same time. So you're going to see us drive execution as hard as we can. You're going to see us push results as hard as we can in this very tough environment, and we feel good about our way to fight our way through this and deliver growth next year."

I'll start on Slide 3. I'll begin my comments with strategic highlights for the second quarter and first half of 2016. We continue to make solid progress in executing our strategy of becoming a more specialty chemical company. Du",717,"Good morning, everyone. I'll start on Slide 3. I'll begin my comments with strategic highlights for the second quarter and first half of 2016. 
We continue to make solid progress in executing our strategy of becoming a more specialty chemical company. During the quarter, we continued to upgrade the quality of our product mix by growing high-margin specialty product lines, particularly in Advanced Materials and Additives & Functional Products. In the first half, AM delivered 14% growth over last year on top of 40% growth in 2015 over '14, and we did it primarily through organic volume and mix and a highly attractive bolt-on acquisition. 
As growing innovative, high-value products is a key component of our strategy, and that's with several customers in Europe recently, to see how our innovation strategies proceeding in action and how we're helping our customers win through innovation. 
In Germany, I met with a leading manufacturer of medical devices for the operating theater. They've been in search of a polymer that can withstand the new stronger disinfectants being used in hospitals, which is causing cracking with existing polymers. The company tested a lot of polymers, all of which failed to deliver the needed chemical resistance. 
However, Tritan delivered on the challenge by providing the required blend of chemical resistance and durability. This has positioned Tritan as a material choice in both clear and opaque applications. Next up for Tritan are applications in safety and protection devices. 
Also in Nuremberg, Germany, we have successfully started up our new Crystex technology. This improves our cost position by better than 20% while also creating the opportunity for more differentiated products like Crystex. This new technology pushes the boundaries of thermostability, dispersion and flow, all important properties of insoluble sulfur, which can help our customers maximize the productivity of their operations. With the conversion, we are rolling out several new Crystex products with differentiated costs and/or performance, and we are working with several customers to get our products to market. Early indications of performance are very positive, and we anticipate having business before the end of the year. 
The success in Nuremberg supports our investment in Kuantan, Malaysia, where we're continuing to deploy this technology and build the largest and lowest-cost facility in the world. And this is just great evidence of us creating value through innovation, not only in heritage Eastman but in our acquisitions here as well as what you've already seen us deliver in interlayers and performance films. 
Finally, we have recently launched Aerafin. It's a family of new adhesive polymers for hygiene and packaging markets, leveraging Eastman's olefin technology platform, which expands our offering beyond adhesive resins to adhesive polymers. The need in this market at the consumer level is for low-odor adhesives, and Aerafin is recognized as best in class on that front. In addition to low odor, Aerafin provides a more robust operating environment, enabling higher line speeds at lower temperatures. 
I'm incredibly excited and very proud of how we are driving innovation and customer engagement. As I spend a lot of time out in the marketplace, it's great to see the evidence of these wins, which gives me great confidence we're on the right track to drive growth through innovation. 
While we are seeing growth in innovative specialty products, we are also facing increasing macro challenges, particularly in Chemical Intermediates. We're pulling all levers to mitigate the impact of these challenges. 
On the cost management front, we remain well on track with our cost reduction efforts to deliver $100 million to the bottom line without sacrificing our long-term growth initiatives. And we are making progress with the process we restarted earlier this year to divest our merchant ethylene as well as potentially other commodity olefin product lines. 
Our cash engine continues to generate very impressive free cash flow as we are on track to deliver another great year of $900 million, enabling our strong dividend, deleveraging and accelerating our share repurchases. 
Our second quarter earnings overall are disappointing. We continue to deliver compelling results in Advanced Materials and Additives & Functional Products. And I'm confident as we get the challenges for Chemical Intermediates behind us and we stabilize Fibers, Eastman will emerge stronger than ever. 
Now I'll turn it over to Curt to discuss the corporate and segment results."

I know it's been a busy week, so I appreciate you joining us this morning. I'll start with our corporate results on Slide 5. Overall, sales revenue decreased primarily due to lower selling prices, particularly i",1606,"Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. I know it's been a busy week, so I appreciate you joining us this morning. 
I'll start with our corporate results on Slide 5. Overall, sales revenue decreased primarily due to lower selling prices, particularly in Chemical Intermediates. Volume was down slightly, with the decline in Fibers mostly offset by an increase in Advanced Materials. Our operating earnings decreased primarily due to declines in Chemical Intermediates and Fibers. 
Despite the challenges, our operating margin was above 16%, and adjusted earnings per share was $1.68 for the quarter. By no means are we satisfied with the business environment we find ourselves in and the negative impact it is having on our results. Thus, we are taking additional actions to mitigate the challenges we face, and Mark will outline these actions in a few minutes. 
Moving next to the segment results, starting with Advanced Materials on Slide 6, which delivered a great first half of the year. Second quarter sales revenue was relatively unchanged as higher sales volume of premium products, including Saflex acoustic interlayers and Tritan copolyester, was offset by lower selling prices primarily for copolyesters, attributed to lower raw material costs such as paraxylene. 
One other point on second quarter volumes. Advanced Materials experienced some destocking in the first quarter of 2015 followed by a restocking in second quarter 2015. So we are very pleased with these results for our second quarter of 2016, especially given the tough comp. 
Year-over-year, operating earnings were relatively unchanged. Sequentially, operating earnings increased by $24 million or more than 20%, driven by a seasonal increase in sales volume, including another quarterly volume record for Tritan copolyester. And for the first half, operating earnings increased year-over-year by 14% or $30 million, driven by a 5% increase in sales volume, improved product mix and lower unit cost due to higher capacity utilization. 
As a result, first half of 2016 operating margins increased to 19.4%, an approximately 200 basis point improvement over the first half of 2015. For the back half of the year, underlying business performance should remain strong as Advanced Materials continues to execute its strategy of volume growth, mix improvement and fixed-cost leverage. 
To underscore how well this business is executing this strategy, in 2015, Advanced Materials increased earnings by almost 40%, and we expect to build on that success this year. Given the results of the first half of 2016 and our strong outlook for the second half, Advanced Materials is positioned to deliver double-digit earnings growth in 2016. We are delivering compelling proof of our ability to drive growth through innovation even in a difficult macro environment. 
Now to Additives & Functional Products on Slide 7. Overall, a solid quarter despite short-term challenges. Revenue declined due to lower selling prices attributed to lower raw material costs. 2% volume growth for many attractive end markets, including strong growth for Crystex, for our tire resins and for animal nutrition products, was offset by volume and mix declines in product lines exposed to energy and industrial construction markets. 
Operating earnings decreased primarily due to lower selling prices more than offsetting lower raw material costs. And the operating margin remains solid at 21.8%, slightly above the year ago period. 
As I look at full year of 2016, we expect to grow volumes and expect our prices to stabilize. Our commercial teams are doing a great job in managing trade-offs and maintaining margins and customer engagement for innovation and growth. We will continue to face macroeconomic and competitive challenges, but given the strength of the portfolio businesses in this segment and attractive end markets, Additives & Functional Products remains on track with our previous expectations for full year earnings to be slightly down, which would be a solid result in the current business climate. 
Now to Fibers on Slide 8. Second quarter revenue, volume and earnings were slightly below our expectations. Sales revenue decreased primarily due to lower sales volume, particularly for acetate tow, flake and yarn, combined with lower selling prices, particularly for tow. The decline in acetate tow sales volume was due to customer inventory destocking in China, consistent with our expectations for volumes to be down to about 10% for the year. The lower acetate flake sales volume was due to timing of shipments to our China acetate tow joint venture. Lower yarn volume was due to trade issues impacting our customers. 
Earnings for the second quarter decreased due to lower sales volume. Despite the decline of volume, operating margins were about 31% as our cost reduction efforts offset the decline in prices. 
Looking at the full year of 2016, we expect second half earnings to be similar to first half, which is slightly below our previous expectations as we are experiencing some short-term challenges in acetate flake and yarn, which is an incremental headwind. And I'll add that as we discussed for some time now in the last earnings call and at investor conferences, price risk exists going into 2017. Given the current lower capacity utilization in acetate tow and the lack of additional asset rationalizations beyond what we did in the United Kingdom, the risk of competitors chasing share with price does exist. And we have seen our competitors attempt this strategy, which has created pricing pressure in our contract discussions for next year. Frankly, I don't understand the logic of these actions in a flat to declining growth business, but yet here we are. 
What I do understand and what I like about Eastman and our future in this industry is we have the lowest cost position, from the largest scale with backward integration into flake, masked with our tow position in Tennessee, Korea and China. And our customers place significant strategic value on both our asset footprint and our ability to innovate and deliver high-quality, reliable product. 
Further, our vertical and horizontal integration creates tremendous value and innovation capability for cellulosic products in Additives & Functional Products and Advanced Materials. And we have a track record of innovation from this technology platform that is well established for -- over decades. So I am confident about our long-term position and strongly believe this will continue to be a valuable business for Eastman going forward. 
I'll finish up the segment review of Chemical Intermediates on Slide 9. Sales revenue decreased due to lower selling prices, which were mostly the result of negative impact of lower market prices for propylene, ethylene and methanol and continued competitive pressure from weak demand in Asia Pacific. Operating earnings decreased due to lower selling prices more than offset lower raw material costs, in addition to higher planned maintenance costs. 
Looking at the full year of 2016, we expect a number of factors to impact results. We expect olefin margins to remain under pressure as the increase in oil prices has not yet translated to improving olefin prices. In particular, bulk ethylene prices have been disappointing as we have seen U.S. prices remain significantly discounted versus the rest of the world. We also expect lower methanol prices to continue putting pressure on market prices for some of our acetyl and amines product lines. And competitive pressures particularly from competitors in Asia have intensified, and we expect this will continue to the back half of the year. 
Considering the low oil environment, excess global capacity in olefins and methanol and increased competitive pressures due to slow economic growth, we expect second half year earnings to be below first half, with sequential improvement for both third and fourth quarters, which should continue into next year. 
Lastly, I'll give you a quick update on our process for divesting our merchant ethylene capacity and potentially certain commodity olefin product lines. We continue our discussions with potential buyers and still expect this process will take the greater part of this year to resolve itself. As you would expect, we'll remain disciplined and patient sellers as we move through the process. 
On Slide 10, I'll transition to an overview of our cash flow and other financial highlights for second quarter. We continue to do an excellent job of generating cash, with second quarter operating cash flow of approximately $500 million. We had nominal income tax payments and no contributions to our U.S. pension plans in the quarter. These payments are typically in the second half of the year, and we expect that will be the case in 2016. 
Capital expenditures totaled $124 million. We continue to manage the pace of capital spending with the current economic environment while still maintaining our growth investments and thus have reduced our full year capital expenditures to be between $600 million and $625 million. 
Free cash flow for the quarter was a very strong $370 million. And during the quarter, we reduced net debt by over $300 million, paid our second quarter dividend of $68 million and repurchased $25 million of our shares. 
Also during the quarter, we successfully sold EUR 500 million 1.5% notes due 2023 in the European public debt market, with proceeds used to repay $500 million of our 2.4% notes due in June of 2017 as well as some other borrowings. 
Our effective tax rate for the second quarter was just over 21%, aided by an expected discrete tax benefit. We continue to expect our full year tax rate will be between 24% and 25%, reflecting the continued benefits of our improvement in business operations. 
And lastly, we remain on track to generate more than $900 million of free cash flow for the year, which is a very strong performance in this current environment. 
And with that, I'll turn it back over to Mark."

I'll transition to our outlook on Slide 11. Looking at the back half of the year, we expect our innovative specialty businesses will continue to grow strongly, improving product mix and accelerating our overall earnings growth. We continue t",792,"Thanks, Curt. I'll transition to our outlook on Slide 11. Looking at the back half of the year, we expect our innovative specialty businesses will continue to grow strongly, improving product mix and accelerating our overall earnings growth. We continue to see the benefits of our vertical and horizontal integration as it enables an advantaged cost position and delivers capital-efficient earnings growth in our specialties. We are also getting benefit from the acquisitions, which are creating value in both cost synergies and accelerating revenue growth. 
We remain committed to our aggressive cost reduction targets and are on track with them. And after reducing debt, we also expect to accelerate share repurchases in the back half of the year. 
In the near term, we have a number of challenges particularly impacting Chemical Intermediates, and these have been increasing. As Curt mentioned, lower olefin margins and lower methanol prices are headwinds. In particular, the most significant change in our expectation was U.S. ethylene prices not tracking up with oil and global ethylene prices. We're also seeing excess supply pressure as slow economic growth is not sufficient to absorb the large amount of capacity that's been built in a number of products, especially in China for Chemical Intermediates. 
Our most recent outlook was that 2016 adjusted EPS would be down about 5%. Given the challenges we face, most significantly in Chemical Intermediates and modestly in Fibers, we expect full year 2016 EPS will be down up to 10% compared with 2015. As you think about the cadence through the rest of the year, we expect earnings in the third quarter will be similar to this second quarter as sequential growth in operating earnings is offset by an increase in the tax rate for the quarter. 
Lastly, this outlook assumes current business conditions continue in the back half of the year. If the conditions improve, that would be upside. 
Turning next to Slide 12. Obviously, our EPS expectations for this year are not where we want them to be, and we're not happy about that. Given that, we are taking significant action to mitigate the impact of the challenges we see in front of us. We are using all levers to improve results not just in 2016 but going forward. For me, that begins by maintaining our commitment to innovation and market development and doing everything we can to accelerate growth from these platforms. We've already realized commercial success from many of these platforms this year, and we are on the cusp of even bigger wins, and we are working to deliver these successes as fast as possible. 
We also remain committed to cost reduction. As I mentioned, we are on target with the cost reductions we implemented earlier this year. And as the challenges we faced have increased, we will be removing at least another $100 million of costs towards the end of this year to ensure that we deliver attractive earnings growth next year. 
While our SG&A and R&D as a percentage of sales is already in the lowest quartile of our peers, we are committed to attaining this new cost reduction target without sacrificing innovation and market development. 
We continue to review our portfolio. This includes a process to divest our merchant ethylene capacity and some other product lines. And we will effectively manage capital allocation through this slow growth environment. This includes our strong dividend, which will increase; reducing debt; and increasing our share repurchases in the second half of '16 and into '17. 
As I look beyond '16, we are well positioned for growth as these short-term challenges recede and our strong growth drivers continue. Altogether, I'm confident we will continue to deliver attractive earnings growth in the long term as we transform towards a specialty portfolio. With the combined set of actions we're taking, we expect to be back on track for 8% to 12% EPS growth in 2017. 
I'll close with our key themes for 2016 on Slide 13. We continue to have a strong portfolio of specialty businesses. And through these businesses, we are driving growth, we are innovating, and we are improving our earnings mix. We face increasing challenges, particularly in Chemical Intermediates and Fibers, and we are responding to this challenging environment with the actions I just outlined. Our cash flow remains one of the best in our industry, and we are deploying it for a strong dividend, reducing leverage and accelerating repurchases of shares. 
And lastly, despite near-term temporary challenges, I remain very confident in our strategy and our ability to grow earnings. Eastman will emerge from these challenges stronger than ever, and we'll continue our journey to achieving our vision of becoming a leading specialty company. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Greg."

So if I could add, again, as we mentioned, there have been a number of management presentations that have occurred, and there, again, are active conversations going on. But as you already mentioned, Frank, we recognize it's currently a tough economic environment or environment with ethylene margins right now. So really, in order for this to really progress, our belief, it really requires 2 strategic parties, buyers or sellers, that understand the long-term value of olefins and the value of the quality of assets that we have. So I -- my sense is everyone's kind of looking at that way, but we'll see how it plays out. In regards to timing, it's still a top priority for us. We've got a great team working on it, but we'll just have to be disciplined as we go through the process, and it will still take a greater part of this year to see how this plays out."

There's a lot of volatility going on right now, as I mentioned. On the olefin side, we're seeing especially ethylene but as well as propylene being fairly depressed in the U.S. relative to what's going on outside the U.S. So even though oil's improved, we haven't really seen a logical improvement of those olefin prices. And that's been a disappointment in the second quarter, and we certainly revised our outlook for the rest of the year to reflect the current conditions that have been in the sort of June, early July time frame when we built our forecast. I would also note that while the olefin prices haven't gone up much, the propane prices and ethylene prices have, especially propane. So they have tracked up with oil with the significant improvement in global export capacity to get the propane out of the country. So that's created some compression here that, on a long-term basis, I don't think plays out. I don't think you have ethylene and propylene stranded in the U.S. forever. There's obviously not enough derivative capacity to monetize that monomer in the globe, but that will come online, like many people have already discussed. And this disconnect will get closed, and we'll go back to what is a normal situation where these prices are more closely connected to the globe. And then that would be a material recovery in earnings from -- for us as -- when that happens in the future. So I think that's all playing out sort of as we expected. That's sort of the olefin story. I would note that there's 2 other parts of the story when it comes to Chemical Intermediates. Methanol prices are 40% lower than they were a year ago, and it's the same kind of story. Not only have they tracked down with oil, but there's oversupply in methanol. And so we haven't seen methanol prices recover really in the second quarter as you would have expected with the recovery in oil. And that's also putting pressure on the earnings in the segment when you think about acetic acid, acetic anhydride competitors in Asia set the price ultimately based on their purchased methanol cost. And that's put a lot of price pressure on those products, not as significant as olefins for us, but it's still quite material. And it's even having a modest impact on functional amines, where we have a lot of cost pass-through contracts tied to methanol prices. And in both acetyls and methanol, we have advantaged coal gasification as well as disadvantaged fixed-price methanol contract, and so you get some compression there. And then there is some additional pressure, of course, with Asian competitors with excess supply, no demand in China to absorb it. So they're dumping those products all over the world. I would say, though, Frank, that the good news about this is that we're seeing the prices stabilize, and we're seeing evidence of this in a couple of different fronts. One, we just filed an antidumping case in plasticizers, where we're seeing some pretty extreme behavior from our Korean-based competitors. And the commerce department has already agreed that we have made a case for economic harm and have launched an investigation into that. And we're also seeing some other products, some of our competitors in China shut down because they're out of the money at the current pricing that they're sort of driving in the marketplace. So I would say we think it's bottoming, and we just need to start seeing some of the situation to improve, and that's all embedded in our guidance. But right now, our guidance for the rest of the year is it stays challenging like it is now for this year."

And obviously, there's been a lot of commentary in the industry already with investors about what's going on in the space. And so I've spent a little time trying to put my thoughts together, and I think there's a number of things that are important to be clear about both in the market context and what our strategy is. So let's start with demand. First of all, nothing's changed in our view about tow demand for this year and moving forward. Outside of China continues declining 1% to 2%. We still believe that the primary issue in China this year is inventory destocking of tow, where they had way too much inventory in tow, and we think that will run its course this year. There remains some uncertainty about what that will turn into next year because while I think tow destocking will be over, we still don't have clear understanding of what's going on in cigarette demand in China. And so there's a chance of some continued destocking there. But when you put it all together, our view is tow imports into China next will be sort of flat, potentially modestly up. Regarding our specific performance versus our competitors, as you can see through the first of this year in the data, we have obviously taking a bit more of a hit in volume than our competitors. And we've been clear about that because for 10 years, we've been a huge beneficiary of having the largest share of imports in China while China was growing, and there's always 2 sides to those positions. And when imports drop, we're going to feel more of that than anyone else. But when you -- when we look through all that, we still see that we're on track for 10% decline in tow in demand. Nothing's changed in our view about that at all, but you got to remember that there's some chunkiness in the buying patterns with all different customers, to some degree. And so there's some chunkiness in buying patterns that will -- so for our second quarter, we're probably a little bit light compared to what we expected but nothing material. It's also important to remember in our volume numbers that while we're saying 10% down in tow, there's other things going on, like the timing issue in flake, some yarn being off and no longer having acetyl chemical sales to ourself in the JV we have with Solvay for making flake. But we are seeing some aggressive actions by all of our competitors going after share. And we mentioned a long time ago, when you get a huge currency change like you do in Japan and Europe, you can think about passing the marketplace to chase share and not even feel the margin impact. And we've seen, as you can see through the data that everyone's reporting, that we have some dynamics going on there. And a part of the story for us is some modest share loss this year outside of China, but it's pretty modest at this point, but it's disappointing to see this happen. We've been talking about the fact that if the excess capacity remains in the industry, it's entirely possible that we're going to have people behave in a way where they're trying to chase share with price. With these margins, it's really tempting as you're just living for the short term, and we're seeing some of that. But in this context, I think we've had a very clear strategy of what we're trying to do, and I just want to sort of make sure we're clear about what we're doing. First, we recognize and accept the challenges that we have in China. And so when we added capacity with CNTC, which was very low-cost tow capacity, we chose to take out an equal amount of capacity in the United Kingdom that was relatively high-cost for us, balancing our position there and accepting those changes in market conditions. We also exited our flake JV with Solvay to reduce our costs given we no longer need that capacity given we shut down the U.K. tow situation. So we've done everything we can to sort of balance our capacity situation and the results of what's going on in China. And we're now down to being the lowest-cost supplier in the world in tow. We have the largest-scale asset in flake. It's backward-integrated in coal. And we have the lowest-cost tow assets in Tennessee, Korea and China that's equally matched to that flake capacity, and we have no further tow assets that we can shut down or would just leave us long in flake, which doesn't make much sense for us. Second, we -- since we have the best cost position in the industry, we have every intention of maintaining our market share outside of China. So when these competitors are trying to gain share from us, which obviously they have done, it simply results in lower prices and therefore lower earnings and cash flow for everyone. Third, we're committed to being the leading supplier to our customers based on the strength that we have in our quality, in our reliability, our unique innovation capabilities and the strength of our asset base to supply our customers. So as we look at 2016, we do expect earnings are going to be down due to this price pressure as these contract discussions have now started early, and we're seeing this behavior from our competitors. And it's likely we'll be down 10% to 20% before you include the cost actions we just announced. But it's early, and so we're going to have to see how all these contract discussions play out for the rest of the year and then how it nets out, and then we'll keep you updated. When I look beyond 2017, and this is quite important, many of these new contracts are going to be multiyear contracts, providing price and supply stability for our customers. You would also think that, given how this is all playing out and not really working out very well for anyone, that our competitors are going to have to start looking at their cost positions like we did and thinking about rationalizing high-cost assets that they all certainly have. And we'll just have to see what they choose to do. I would also note that we're not just sitting around waiting for what's going to happen in the tow business. Eastman's been the innovator for 90 years in cellulosics. We've innovated a huge range of new products over the years, and you've seen those great results we've had in AFP and AM. And so as we saw these things start to develop all the way back in 2014, and we knew that we had to accelerate our innovation efforts for new applications in cellulosics, and we've been doing that as we need to load these assets in new applications. It's obviously still early when it comes to growth and innovation, but I've been incredibly impressed by our teams and how they've raised to that challenge, and we have a number of great projects going forward here, developing new applications that'll help in the long term. So when I look at the Fibers challenges that we have and included, I'm still confident we can do 8% to 12% earnings growth next year when I consider the companywide cost actions we're going to take as well as doing everything we can to reduce cost in Fibers directly, and the growth that I expect in the other 3 segments relative to this year as well as our ability to deploy our free cash flow."

So while we're having double-digit growth in really high-margin, great, innovative products like acoustic interlayers, heads-up display, Tritan, our whole performance films business, our core copolyesters are growing slower than that average that have lower margins. And so you're really getting a great mix improvement every quarter on top of just good overall solid volume growth."

And even as oil has come off recently, you've seen propane prices follow it down. So it just depends on your view on oil, and you can get a view of what you think propane's going to do next year. The bigger question is what I already discussed, which is what are ethylene and propylene prices going to do, especially ethylene as they've been stranded and disconnected? I mean, it's really significant when you think about ethylene in Asia in the mid-$0.40 range, and we're in the mid- to high $0.20 range in ethylene times 700 million pounds of ethylene that we sell. And this is our product line.

Certainly, we're committed to driving our portfolio towards specialty as hard as we possibly can, and you do that through multiple things. We've done, I think, some excellent acquisitions, large ones like Solutia and Taminco and some bolt-ons as well. And we paid reasonable prices for them and are going to get attractive ROICs relative to where the average cost of capital. So -- and frankly, those acquisitions were intentional. We always knew we had challenges in fibers and olefins at some point in the future. We intentionally chose not to build crackers and PDH units because we were convinced 5 years ago that, that industry would overbuild. And we were intentionally diversifying our portfolio with the strength of the cash that we had at the time in olefins and fibers into more attractive long-term markets where we can innovate. So I think that part of the strategy is great and on track. And of course, we've always been a disciplined seller of underperforming businesses. We've sold off $3.5 billion of revenue from PET to polyolefins, et cetera, in the past, and we're trying to get rid of more of it now in this current process on the bulk ethylene and some other products. So we're doing everything in our control. Unfortunately, I've said this before, we're out of the M&A market as a tool to sort of further diversify our portfolio at this moment in time. I think the valuations are way too high in the market that are being paid right now, 15x anything, it seems. It's hard to get an ROIC at an acceptable level, and we still -- we're old-fashioned that way. We still believe in an unlevered return on capital even if that is close to free. And so we don't think that's value creating for our shareholders. We're not going to do that. And what we are going to do is focus on innovation and driving innovative growth across our portfolio. We've been doing it for a long time as heritage Eastman, and we're showing you excellent proof points about how we're doing it in the acquisitions, from interlayers to Crystex to performance films, and/or starting to accelerate somewhat great opportunities in Taminco now that we've got under the hood there.

When we back our currency, that's $0.40 of propane hedges coming off and a $0.10 headwind in currency, net $0.30. And a lot of that tailwind flows into Chemical Intermediates, 80% roughly. So you've got that tailwind, and you've got what we think is a bottoming-out situation right now in pricing and behavior by our competitors.

So you've seen some compression in that spread. And if you look at it, year-over-year, obviously, there's tremendous compression in propylene-to-propane spread versus a year ago in the second quarter as well as how we view the next couple of quarters. But I think that, over time, it will go back to a more normal relationship. Propylene is a little bit artificially depressed by all the excess supply of PDH out there. But end of the day, propylene price is going to get set out of Asia, particularly probably China, and it's going to either be PDH, methanol or olefins or naphtha. All of them are connected to oil. And so once we get enough derivative capacity out there to turn all this propylene into something, I think you start getting back to some more normal relationships of propylene to propane with where oil turns out to be."

But I do think we're doing everything we can, and we're cutting costs aggressively to offset the margin compression we're facing in Fibers and CI as much as we can. And I think oil will recover to some degree at some point, and that'll give us a big tailwind relative to some of these businesses. So I think this is a really tough year for us obviously, not happy about it. We're doing everything we can on every front to make it as good as possible. But right now, we got to organically grow. We got to divest what we can and return share to -- returning cash to shareholders.

So in regards to the shape of the curve, we are definitely the lowest-cost player. And to answer your question, the curve has flattened out a bit because while we're based on coal, our competitors are based on natural gas and methanol, that drives our cost structure. And certainly, those prices have come down. So in this year, it's feeling a little bit sort of flattened out relative to the past. As you look forward, coal's going to probably stay pretty low in the U.S., and natural gas prices are already moving up, and methanol prices will certainly move up with oil as well. So I think the curve is actually going to steepen relative to us from this year going forward is our view of sort of how that cost curve's changed and is going to go back to being steeper as we move forward. I'm not going to get into details of the steepness of the curve. What I can tell you, though, is there's plenty of high-cost assets out there that are discrete stand-alone assets.

I'll start on Slide 3. I'll begin my comments with strategic highlights for the second quarter and first half of 2016.

I'll begin my comments with strategic highlights for the second quarter and first half of 2016. 
We continue to make solid progress in executing our strategy of becoming a more specialty chemical company. During the quarter, we continued to upgrade the quality of our product mix by growing high-margin specialty product lines, particularly in Advanced Materials and Additives & Functional Products. In the first half, AM delivered 14% growth over last year on top of 40% growth in 2015 over '14, and we did it primarily through organic volume and mix and a highly attractive bolt-on acquisition. 
As growing innovative, high-value products is a key component of our strategy, I met with several customers in Europe recently, to see how our innovation in strategies are proceeding in action and how we're helping our customers win through innovation. 
In Germany, I met with a leading manufacturer of medical devices for the operating theater. They've been in search of a polymer that can withstand the new stronger disinfectants being used in hospitals, which is causing cracking with existing polymers. The company tested a lot of polymers, all of which failed to deliver the needed chemical resistance. 
However, Tritan delivered on the challenge by providing the required blend of chemical resistance and durability. This has positioned Tritan as a material choice in both clear and opaque applications. Next up for Tritan are applications in safety and protection devices. 
Also in Nienburg, Germany, we have successfully started up our new Crystex technology. This improves our cost position by better than 20% while also creating the opportunity for more differentiated products like Crystex. This new technology pushes the boundaries of thermostability, dispersion and flow, all important properties of insoluble sulfur, which can help our customers maximize the productivity of their operations. With the conversion, we are rolling out several new Crystex products with differentiated costs and/or performance, and we are working with several customers to get our products to market. Early indications of performance are very positive, and we anticipate having business before the end of the year. 
The success in Nienburg supports our investment in Kuantan, Malaysia, where we're continuing to deploy this technology and build the largest and lowest-cost facility in the world. And this is just great evidence of us creating value through innovation not only in heritage Eastman but in our acquisitions, here, as well as what you've already seen us deliver in interlayers and performance films. 
Finally, we have recently launched Aerafin. It's a family of new adhesive polymers for hygiene and packaging markets, leveraging Eastman's olefin technology platform, which expands our offering beyond adhesive resins to adhesive polymers. The need in this market at the consumer level is for low-odor adhesives, and Aerafin is recognized as best in class on that front. In addition to low odor, Aerafin provides a more robust operating environment, enabling higher line speeds at lower temperatures. 
I'm incredibly excited and very proud of how we are driving innovation and customer engagement. As I spend a lot of time out in the marketplace, it's great to see the evidence of these wins, which gives me great confidence we're on the right track to drive growth through innovation. 
While we're seeing growth in innovative specialty products, we're also facing increasing macro challenges, particularly in Chemical Intermediates. We're pulling all levers to mitigate the impact of these challenges. 
On the cost management front, we remain well on track with our cost-reduction efforts to deliver $100 million to the bottom line without sacrificing our long-term growth initiatives. And we are making progress with the process we restarted earlier this year to divest our merchant ethylene, as well as potentially other commodity olefin product lines. 
Our cash engine continues to generate very impressive free cash flow as we are on track to deliver another great year of $900 million, enabling our strong dividend, deleveraging and accelerating our share repurchases. 
Our second quarter earnings overall are disappointing. We continue to deliver compelling results in Advanced Materials and Additives & Functional Products. And I'm confident as we get the challenges for Chemical Intermediates behind us and we stabilize Fibers, Eastman will emerge stronger than ever. 
Now I'll turn it over to Curt to discuss the corporate and segment results."

I know it's been a busy week, so I appreciate you joining us this morning. I'll start with our corporate results on Slide 5. Overall, sales revenue decreased primarily due to lower selling prices, particularly i",1604,"Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. I know it's been a busy week, so I appreciate you joining us this morning. 
I'll start with our corporate results on Slide 5. Overall, sales revenue decreased primarily due to lower selling prices, particularly in Chemical Intermediates. Volume was down slightly, with the decline in Fibers mostly offset by an increase in Advanced Materials. Our operating earnings decreased primarily due to declines in Chemical Intermediates and Fibers. 
Despite the challenges, our operating margin was above 16%. And adjusted earnings per share was $1.68 for the quarter. By no means are we satisfied with the business environment we find ourselves in and the negative impact it is having on our results. Thus, we are taking additional actions to mitigate the challenges we face, and Mark will outline these actions in a few minutes. 
Moving next to the segment results, starting with Advanced Materials on Slide 6, which delivered a great first half of the year. Second quarter sales revenue was relatively unchanged as higher sales volume of premium products, including Saflex acoustic interlayers and Tritan copolyester, was offset by lower selling prices primarily for copolyesters, attributed to lower raw material costs such as paraxylene. 
One other point on second quarter volumes. Advanced Materials experienced some destocking in the first quarter of 2015 followed by a restocking in second quarter 2015. So we are very pleased with these results for our second quarter of 2016, especially given the tough comp. 
Year-over-year, operating earnings were relatively unchanged. Sequentially, operating earnings increased by $24 million or more than 20% driven by a seasonal increase in sales volume, including another quarterly volume record for Tritan copolyester. And for the first half, operating earnings increased year-over-year by 14% or $30 million, driven by a 5% increase in sales volume, improved product mix and lower unit cost due to higher capacity utilization. 
As a result, first half of 2016 operating margins increased to 19.4%, an approximately 200 basis point improvement over the first half of 2015. For the back half of the year, underlying business performance should remain strong as Advanced Materials continues to execute its strategy of volume growth, mix improvement and fixed-cost leverage. 
To underscore how well this business is executing this strategy, in 2015, Advanced Materials increased earnings by almost 40%, and we expect to build on that success this year. Given the results of the first half of 2016 and our strong outlook for the second half, Advanced Materials is positioned to deliver double-digit earnings growth in 2016. We are delivering compelling proof of our ability to drive growth through innovation even in a difficult macro environment. 
Now to Additives & Functional Products on Slide 7. Overall, a solid quarter despite short-term challenges. Revenue declined due to lower selling prices attributed to lower raw material costs. 2% volume growth for many attractive end markets, including strong growth for Crystex, for our tire resins and for animal nutrition products, was offset by volume and mix declines in product lines exposed to energy and industrial construction markets. 
Operating earnings decreased primarily due to lower selling prices more than offsetting lower raw material costs. And the operating margin remains solid at 21.8%, slightly above the year-ago period. 
As I look at full year of 2016, we expect to grow volumes and expect our prices to stabilize. Our commercial teams are doing a great job in managing trade-offs and maintaining margins and customer engagement for innovation and growth. We will continue to face macroeconomic and competitive challenges, but given the strength of the portfolio businesses in this segment and attractive end markets, Additives & Functional Products remains on track with our previous expectations for full year earnings to be slightly down, which would be a solid result in the current business climate. 
Now to Fibers on Slide 8. Second quarter revenue, volume and earnings were slightly below our expectations. Sales revenue decreased primarily due to lower sales volume, particularly for acetate tow, flake and yarn, combined with lower selling prices, particularly for tow. The decline in acetate tow sales volume was due to customer inventory destocking in China, consistent with our expectations for volumes to be down to about 10% for the year. The lower acetate flake sales volume was due to timing of shipments to our China acetate tow joint venture. Lower yarn volume was due to trade issues impacting our customers. 
Earnings for the second quarter decreased due to lower sales volume. Despite the decline of volume, operating margins were about 31% as our cost-reduction efforts offset the decline in prices. 
Looking at the full year of 2016, we expect second half earnings to be similar to first half, which is slightly below our previous expectations as we are experiencing some short-term challenges in acetate flake and yarn, which is an incremental headwind. And I'll add that as we discussed for some time now in the last earnings call and at investor conferences, price risk exists going into 2017. Given the current lower capacity utilization in acetate tow and the lack of additional asset rationalizations beyond what we did in the United Kingdom, the risk of competitors chasing share with price does exist. And we have seen our competitors attempt this strategy, which has created pricing pressure in our contract discussions for next year. Frankly, I don't understand the logic of these actions in a flat to declining growth business, but yet here we are. 
What I do understand and what I like about Eastman and our future in this industry is we have the lowest cost position, from the largest scale with backward integration into flake, masked with our tow position in Tennessee, Korea and China. And our customers place significant strategic value on both our asset footprint and our ability to innovate and deliver high-quality, reliable product. 
Further, our vertical and horizontal integration creates tremendous value and innovation capability for cellulosic products in Additives & Functional Products and Advanced Materials. And we have a track record of innovation from this technology platform that is well established for -- over decades. So I am confident about our long-term position and strongly believe this will continue to be a valuable business for Eastman going forward. 
I'll finish up the segment review of Chemical Intermediates on Slide 9. Sales revenue decreased due to lower selling prices, which were mostly the result of negative impact of lower market prices for propylene, ethylene and methanol and continued competitive pressure from weak demand in Asia Pacific. Operating earnings decreased due to lower selling prices more than offset lower raw material costs, in addition to higher planned maintenance costs. 
Looking at the full year of 2016, we expect a number of factors to impact results. We expect olefin margins to remain under pressure as the increase in oil prices has not yet translated to improving olefin prices. In particular, bulk ethylene prices have been disappointing as we have seen U.S. prices remain significantly discounted versus the rest of the world. We also expect lower methanol prices to continue putting pressure on market prices for some of our acetyl and amines product lines. And competitive pressures particularly from competitors in Asia have intensified, and we expect this will continue to the back half of the year. 
Considering the low oil environment, excess global capacity in olefins and methanol and increased competitive pressures due to slow economic growth, we expect second half year earnings to be below first half, with sequential improvement for both third and fourth quarters, which should continue into next year. 
Lastly, I'll give you a quick update on our process for divesting our merchant ethylene capacity and potentially certain commodity olefin product lines. We continue our discussions with potential buyers and still expect this process will take the greater part of this year to resolve itself. As you would expect, we'll remain disciplined and patient sellers as we move through the process. 
On Slide 10, I'll transition to an overview of our cash flow and other financial highlights for second quarter. We continue to do an excellent job of generating cash, with second quarter operating cash flow of approximately $500 million. 
We had nominal income tax payments and no contributions to our U.S. pension plans in the quarter. These payments are typically in the second half of the year, and we expect that will be the case in 2016. 
Capital expenditures totaled $124 million. We continue to manage the pace of capital spending with the current economic environment while still maintaining our growth investments and thus have reduced our full year capital expenditures to be between $600 million and $625 million. 
Free cash flow for the quarter was a very strong $370 million. And during the quarter, we reduced net debt by over $300 million, paid our second quarter dividend of $68 million and repurchased $25 million of our shares. 
Also during the quarter, we successfully sold EUR 500 million 1.5% notes due 2023 in the European public debt market, with proceeds used to repay $500 million of our 2.4% notes due in June of 2017 as well as some other borrowings. 
Our effective tax rate for the second quarter was just over 21%, aided by an expected discrete tax benefit. We continue to expect our full year tax rate will be between 24% and 25%, reflecting the continued benefits of our improvement in business operations. 
And lastly, we remain on track to generate more than $900 million of free cash flow for the year, which is a very strong performance in this current environment. 
And with that, I'll turn it back over to Mark."

I'll transition to our outlook on Slide 11. Looking at the back half of the year, we expect our innovative specialty businesses will continue to grow strongly, improving product mix and accelerating our overall earnings growth. We continue t",790,"Thanks, Curt. I'll transition to our outlook on Slide 11. Looking at the back half of the year, we expect our innovative specialty businesses will continue to grow strongly, improving product mix and accelerating our overall earnings growth. We continue to see the benefits of our vertical and horizontal integration as it enables an advantaged cost position and delivers capital-efficient earnings growth in our specialties. We are also getting benefit from the acquisitions, which are creating value in both cost synergies and accelerating revenue growth. 
We remain committed to our aggressive cost-reduction targets and are on track with them. And after reducing debt, we also expect to accelerate share repurchases in the back half of the year. 
In the near term, we have a number of challenges, particularly impacting Chemical Intermediates, and these have been increasing. As Curt mentioned, lower olefin margins and lower methanol prices are headwinds. In particular, the most significant change in our expectation was U.S. ethylene prices not tracking up with oil and global ethylene prices. We're also seeing excess supply pressure as slow economic growth is not sufficient to absorb the large amount of capacity that's been built in a number of products, especially in China for Chemical Intermediates. 
Our most recent outlook was that 2016 adjusted EPS would be down about 5%. Given the challenges we face, most significantly in Chemical Intermediates and modestly in Fibers, we expect full year 2016 EPS will be down up to 10% compared with 2015. As you think about the cadence through the rest of the year, we expect earnings in the third quarter will be similar to this second quarter as sequential growth in operating earnings is offset by an increase in the tax rate for the quarter. 
Lastly, this outlook assumes current business conditions continue in the back half of the year. If the conditions improve, that would be upside. 
Turning next to Slide 12. Obviously, our EPS expectations for this year are not where we want them to be, and we're not happy about that. Given that, we are taking significant action to mitigate the impact of the challenges we see in front of us. We are using all levers to improve results not just in 2016 but going forward. For me, that begins by maintaining our commitment to innovation and market development and doing everything we can to accelerate growth from these platforms. We've already realized commercial success from many of these platforms this year, and we are on the cusp of even bigger wins, and we are working to deliver these successes as fast as possible. 
We also remain committed to cost reduction. As I mentioned, we are on target with the cost reductions we implemented earlier this year. And as the challenges we faced have increased, we will be removing at least another $100 million of cost towards the end of this year to ensure that we deliver attractive earnings growth next year. 
While our SG&A and R&D as a percentage of sales is already in the lowest quartile of our peers, we are committed to attaining this new cost-reduction target without sacrificing innovation and market development. 
We continue to review our portfolio. This includes the process to divest our merchant ethylene capacity and some other product lines. And we will effectively manage capital allocation through this slow growth environment. This includes our strong dividend, which will increase; reducing debt; and increasing our share repurchases in the second half of '16 and into '17. 
As I look beyond '16, we are well positioned for growth as these short-term challenges recede and our strong growth drivers continue. Altogether, I'm confident we will continue to deliver attractive earnings growth in the long term as we transform towards a specialty portfolio. With the combined set of actions we're taking, we expect to be back on track for 8% to 12% EPS growth in 2017. 
I'll close with our key themes for 2016 on Slide 13. We continue to have a strong portfolio of specialty businesses. And through these businesses, we are driving growth, we are innovating, and we are improving our earnings mix. We face increasing challenges, particularly in Chemical Intermediates and Fibers, and we are responding to this challenging environment with the actions I just outlined. Our cash flow remains one of the best in our industry, and we are deploying it for a strong dividend, reducing leverage and accelerating repurchases of shares. 
And lastly, despite near-term temporary challenges, I remain very confident in our strategy and our ability to grow earnings. Eastman will emerge from these challenges stronger than ever, and we'll continue our journey to achieving our vision of becoming a leading specialty company. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Greg."

So we have to make sure that we think about the long-term value of this business and get an appropriate price. We do have engaged buyers who are very seriously considering it, but we're working through the steps of it."

So if I could add, again, as we mentioned, there have been a number of management presentations that have occurred, and there, again, are active conversations going on. But as you already mentioned, Frank, we recognize it's currently a tough economic environment or environment with ethylene margins right now. So really, in order for this to really progress, our belief, it really requires 2 strategic parties, buyers or sellers, that understand the long-term value of olefins and the value of the quality of assets that we have. So I -- my sense is everyone's kind of looking at that way, but we'll see how it plays out. In regards to timing, this is still a top priority for us. We've got a great team working on it, but we'll just have to be disciplined as we go through the process, and it will still take a greater part of this year to see how this plays out."

There's a lot of volatility going on right now, as I mentioned. On the olefin side, we're seeing especially ethylene but as well as propylene being fairly depressed in the U.S. relative to what's gone on outside the U.S. So even though oil's improved, we haven't really seen a logical improvement of those olefin prices. And that's been a disappointment in the second quarter, and we certainly revised our outlook for the rest of the year to reflect the current conditions that have been in the sort of June, early July time frame when we built our forecast. I would also note that while the olefin prices haven't gone up much, the propane prices and ethylene prices have, especially propane. So they have tracked up with oil with the significant improvement in global export capacity to get the propane out of the country. So that's created some compression here that, on a long-term basis, I don't think plays out. I don't think you have ethylene and propylene stranded in the U.S. forever. There's obviously not enough derivative capacity to monetize that monomer in the globe, but that will come online, like many people have already discussed. And this disconnect will get closed, and we'll go back to what is a normal situation where these prices are more closely connected to the globe. And then that would be a material recovery in earnings from -- for us as -- when that happens in the future. So I think that's all playing out sort of as we expected. And that's sort of the olefin story. I would note that there's 2 other parts of the story when it comes to Chemical Intermediates. Methanol prices are 40% lower than they were a year ago, and it's the same kind of story. Not only have they tracked down with oil, but there's oversupply in methanol. And so we haven't seen methanol prices recover really in the second quarter as you would have expected with the recovery in oil. And that's also putting pressure on the earnings in the segment when you think about acetic acid, acetic anhydride competitors in Asia set the price ultimately based on their purchased methanol cost. And that's put a lot of price pressure on those products, not as significant as olefins for us, but it's still quite material. And it's even having a modest impact on functional amines, where we have a lot of cost pass-through contracts tied to methanol prices. And in both acetyls and methanol, we have advantaged coal gasification as well as disadvantaged fixed-price methanol contract, and so you get some compression there. And then there is some additional pressure, of course, with Asian competitors with excess supply, no demand in China to absorb it. So they're dumping those products all over the world. I would say, though, Frank, that the good news about this is that we're seeing the prices stabilize, and we're seeing evidence of this in a couple of different fronts. One, we just filed an antidumping case in plasticizers, where we're seeing some pretty extreme behavior from our Korean-based competitors. And the commerce department has already agreed that we have made a case for economic harm and have launched an investigation into that. And we're also seeing some other products, some of our competitors in China shut down because they're out of the money at the current pricing that they're sort of driving in the marketplace. So I would say we think it's bottoming, and we just need to start seeing some of the situation to improve, and that's all embedded in our guidance. But right now, our guidance for the rest of the year is it stays challenging like it is now for this year."

And obviously, there's been a lot of commentary in the industry already with investors about what's going on in the space. And so I've spent a little time trying to put my thoughts together, and I think there's a number of things that are important to be clear about both in the market context and what our strategy is. So let's start with demand. First of all, nothing's changed in our view about tow demand for this year and moving forward. Outside of China, continues declining 1% to 2%. We still believe that the primary issue in China this year is inventory destocking of tow, where they had way too much inventory in tow, and we think that will run its course this year. There remains some uncertainty about what that will turn into next year because while I think tow destocking will be over, we still don't have clear understanding of what's going on in cigarette demand in China and so there's a chance of some continued destocking there. But when you put it all together, our view is tow imports into China next year will be sort of flat, potentially modestly up. Regarding our specific performance versus our competitors, as you can see through the first half of this year and the data, we have obviously taking a bit more of a hit in volume than our competitors. And we've been clear about that because for 10 years, we've been a huge beneficiary of having the largest share of imports in China while China was growing, and there's always 2 sides to those positions. And when imports drop, we're going to feel more of that than anyone else. But when you -- when we look through all that, we still see that we're on track for a 10% decline in tow in demand. Nothing's changed our view about that at all, but you got to remember that there's some chunkiness in the buying patterns with all different customers, to some degree. And so there's some chunkiness in buying patterns that will -- so for our second quarter, we're probably a little bit light compared to what we expected but nothing material. It's also important to remember in our volume numbers that while we're saying 10% down in tow, there's other things going on, like the timing issue in flake, some yarn being off and no longer having acetyl chemical sales to ourself in the JV we have with Solvay for making flake. But we are seeing some aggressive actions by all of our competitors going after share. And we mentioned a long time ago, when you get a huge currency change like you do in Japan and Europe, you can think about passing out of the marketplace to chase share and not even feel the margin impact. And we've seen, as you can see through the data that everyone's reporting, that we have some dynamics going on there. And a part of the story for us is some modest share loss this year outside of China, but it's pretty modest at this point, but it's disappointing to see this happen. We've been talking about the fact that if the excess capacity remains in the industry, it's entirely possible that we're going to have people behave in a way where they're trying to chase share with price. With these margins, it's really tempting as you're just living for the short term, and we're seeing some of that. But in this context, I think we've had a very clear strategy of what we're trying to do, and I just want to sort of make sure we're clear about what we're doing. First, we recognize and accept the challenges that we have in China. And so when we added capacity with CNTC, which was very low-cost tow capacity, we chose to take out an equal amount of capacity in the United Kingdom that was relatively high cost for us, balancing our position there and accepting those changes in market conditions. We also exited our flake JV with Solvay to reduce our costs given we no longer need that capacity, given we'd shut down the U.K. tow situation. So we've done everything we can to sort of balance our capacity situation and the results of what's going on in China. And we're now down to being the lowest-cost supplier in the world in tow. We have the largest-scale asset in flake. It's backward-integrated in coal. And we have the lowest-cost tow assets in Tennessee, Korea and China that's equally matched to that flake capacity, and we have no further tow assets that we can shut down or would just leave us long in flake, which doesn't make much sense for us. Second, we -- since we have the best cost position in the industry, we have every intention of maintaining our market share outside of China. So when these competitors are trying to gain share from us, which obviously they have done, it simply results in lower prices and therefore lower earnings and cash flow for everyone. Third, we're committed to being the leading supplier to our customers based on the strength that we have in our quality, in our reliability, our unique innovation capabilities and the strength of our asset base to supply our customers. So as we look at 2016, we do expect earnings are going to be down due to this price pressure as these contract discussions have now started early, and we're seeing this behavior from our competitors. And it's likely we'll be down 10% to 20% before you include the cost actions we just announced. But it's early, and so we're going to have to see how all these contract discussions play out for the rest of the year and kind of how it nets out, and then we'll keep you updated. When I look beyond 2017, and this is quite important, many of these new contracts are going to be multiyear contracts, providing price and supply stability for our customers. You would also think that, given how this is all playing out and not really working out very well for anyone, that our competitors are going to have to start looking at their cost positions like we did and think about rationalizing high-cost assets that they all certainly have. And we'll just have to see what they choose to do. I would also note that we're not just sitting around waiting for what's going to happen in the tow business. Eastman's been the innovator for 90 years in cellulosics. We've innovated a huge range of new products over the years, and you've seen those great results we've had in AFP and AM. And so as we saw these things start to develop all the way back in 2014, and we knew that we had to accelerate our innovation efforts for new applications in cellulosics, and we've been doing that as ways to load these assets in new applications. It's obviously still early when it comes to growth and innovation, but I've been incredibly impressed by our teams and how they've raised to that challenge, and we have a number of great projects going forward here, developing new applications that'll help in the long term. So when I look at the Fibers challenges that we have and include it, I'm still confident we can do 8% to 12% earnings growth next year when I consider the companywide cost actions we're going to take, as well as doing everything we can to reduce cost in Fibers directly, and the growth that I expect in the other 3 segments relative to this year as well as our ability to deploy our free cash flow."

And some people responded, and we're defending. And so I think that that's -- that horse has left the barn as far as 2017 goes. We're going to see prices come down at our large customers. But I do think that the positive side of this story is they also put a high value on stability and security of supply and are looking for long-term commitments in contracts with suppliers that are committed to being in the industry for the long term. And we stand out as the most committed given our integration and scale, so that, I think, will work well for us as we try to maintain our market share position.

On the outlook for propane and propylene, because you really -- what really matters is the cracking spread relative to propylene and ethylene, our view is the market is already reconnecting propane to global values with all the export capacity that's readily available in the U.S. So I think you're seeing that now with how propane prices improved through second quarter. And even as oil has come off recently, you've seen propane prices follow it down. So it just depends on your view on oil, and you can get a view of what you think propane's going to do next year. The bigger question is what I already discussed, which is what are ethylene and propylene prices going to do, especially ethylene as they've been stranded and disconnected? I mean, it's really significant when you think about ethylene in Asia in the mid-$0.40 range, and we're in the mid- to high $0.20 range in ethylene times 700 million pounds of ethylene that we sell. And this is our product line.

Certainly, we're committed to driving our portfolio towards specialty as hard as we possibly can, and you do that through multiple things. We've done, I think, some excellent acquisitions, large ones like Solutia and Taminco and some bolt-ons as well. And we paid reasonable prices for them and are going to get attractive ROICs relative to where the average cost of capital. So -- and frankly, those acquisitions were intentional. We always knew we had challenges in fibers and olefins at some point in the future. We intentionally chose not to build crackers and PDH units because we were convinced 5 years ago that, that industry would overbuild. And we were intentionally diversifying our portfolio with the strength of the cash that we had at the time in olefins and fibers into more attractive long-term markets where we can innovate. So I think that part of the strategy is great and on track. And of course, we've always been a disciplined seller of underperforming businesses. We've sold off $3.5 billion of revenue from PET to polyolefins, et cetera, in the past, and we're trying to get rid of more of it now in this current process on the bulk ethylene and some other products. So we're doing everything within our control. Unfortunately, I've said this before, we're out of the M&A market as a tool to sort of further diversify our portfolio at this moment in time. I think the valuations are way too high in the market that are being paid right now, 15x anything, it seems. It's hard to get an ROIC at an acceptable level, and we still -- we're old-fashioned that way. We still believe in an unlevered return on capital even if that is close to free. And so we don't think that's value creating for our shareholders. We're not going to do that. What we are going to do is focus on innovation and driving innovative growth across our portfolio. We've been doing it for a long time as heritage Eastman, and we're showing you excellent proof points about how we're doing it in the acquisitions, from interlayers to Crystex to performance films, and/or starting to accelerate somewhat great opportunities in Taminco now that we've got under the hood there. So we're going to do that. We're going to take out cost as much as we possibly can but not cut our innovation programs. That's a core choice for us. And as Curt mentioned, we've got one of the best free cash flows in the industry, and we'll be repurchasing shares as aggressively as we can but also maintaining our credit rating."

And then antidumping tariffs on tires is really helping us out as we have a stronger position outside of China, and we're benefiting from that shift to the U.S. Coatings are growing with the market, consistent with our customers. And as you think about adhesives, it's also -- has modest growth. All of that success is being offset, to some degree, by decline in energy markets, which has been double digit. We have some products that go downhaul into that space and industrial construction, which is where our fluids go. And so we're obviously seeing a pretty drop in the construction cycle in China when it comes to chemical plants, and demand is off there."

And with those conditions, we believe Chemical Intermediates can grow earnings over this year. You have to remember that you got a net $0.30 a share tailwind with the hedge; when we back out currency, that's $0.40 of propane hedges coming off and a $0.10 headwind in currency, net $0.30. And a lot of that tailwind flows into Chemical Intermediates, 80% roughly. So you've got that tailwind, and you've got what we think is a bottoming-out situation right now in pricing and behavior by our competitors. And so we're not assuming some dramatic recovery next year."

So you've seen some compression in that spread. And if you look at it, year-over-year, obviously, there's tremendous compression in propylene-to-propane spread versus a year ago in the second quarter as well as how we view the next couple of quarters. But I think that, over time, it will go back to a more normal relationship. Propylene is a little bit artificially depressed by all the excess supply of PDH out there. But end of the day, propylene price is going to get set out of Asia, particularly probably China, and it's going to either be PDH, methanol or olefins or naphtha. All of them are connected to oil. So once we get enough derivative capacity out there to turn all this propylene into something, I think you start getting back to some more normal relationships of propylene to propane with where oil turns out to be."

And I think oil will recover to some degree at some point, and that'll give us a big tailwind relative to some of these businesses. So I think this is a really tough year for us obviously, not happy about it. We're doing everything we can on every front to make it as good as possible. But right now, we got to organically grow. We got to divest what we can and return share to -- returning cash to shareholders.

So in regards to the shape of the curve, we are definitely the lowest-cost player. And to answer your question, the curve has flattened out a bit because while we're based on coal, our competitors are based on natural gas and methanol, that drives our cost structure. And certainly, those prices have come down. So in this year, it's feeling a little bit sort of flattened out relative to the past. As you look forward, coal's going to probably stay pretty low in the U.S., and natural gas prices are already moving up, and methanol prices will certainly move up with oil as well. So I think the curve is actually going to steepen relative to us from this year going forward is our view of sort of how that cost curve's changed and is going to go back to being steeper as we move forward. I'm not going to get into details of the steepness of the curve. What I can tell you, though, is there's plenty of high-cost assets out there that are discrete stand-alone assets.

I'll start on Slide 3. I'll begin my comments with strategic highlights for the second quarter and first half of 2016.

I'll begin my comments with strategic highlights for the second quarter and first half of 2016. 
We continue to make solid progress in executing our strategy of becoming a more specialty chemical company. During the quarter, we continued to upgrade the quality of our product mix by growing high-margin specialty product lines, particularly in Advanced Materials and Additives & Functional Products. In the first half, AM delivered 14% growth over last year on top of 40% growth in 2015 over '14, and we did it primarily through organic volume and mix and a highly attractive bolt-on acquisition. 
As growing innovative, high-value products is a key component of our strategy, I met with several customers in Europe recently, to see how our innovation in strategies are proceeding in action and how we're helping our customers win through innovation. 
In Germany, I met with a leading manufacturer of medical devices for the operating theater. They've been in search of a polymer that can withstand the new stronger disinfectants being used in hospitals, which is causing cracking with existing polymers. The company tested a lot of polymers, all of which failed to deliver the needed chemical resistance. 
However, Tritan delivered on the challenge by providing the required blend of chemical resistance and durability. This has positioned Tritan as a material choice in both clear and opaque applications. Next up for Tritan are applications in safety and protection devices. 
Also in Nienburg, Germany, we have successfully started up our new Crystex technology. This improves our cost position by better than 20% while also creating the opportunity for more differentiated products like Crystex. This new technology pushes the boundaries of thermostability, dispersion and flow, all important properties of insoluble sulfur, which can help our customers maximize the productivity of their operations. With the conversion, we are rolling out several new Crystex products with differentiated costs and/or performance, and we are working with several customers to get our products to market. Early indications of performance are very positive, and we anticipate having business before the end of the year. 
The success in Nienburg supports our investment in Kuantan, Malaysia, where we're continuing to deploy this technology and build the largest and lowest-cost facility in the world. And this is just great evidence of us creating value through innovation not only in heritage Eastman but in our acquisitions, here, as well as what you've already seen us deliver in interlayers and performance films. 
Finally, we have recently launched Aerafin. It's a family of new adhesive polymers for hygiene and packaging markets, leveraging Eastman's olefin technology platform, which expands our offering beyond adhesive resins to adhesive polymers. The need in this market at the consumer level is for low-odor adhesives, and Aerafin is recognized as best in class on that front. In addition to low odor, Aerafin provides a more robust operating environment, enabling higher line speeds at lower temperatures. 
I'm incredibly excited and very proud of how we are driving innovation and customer engagement. As I spend a lot of time out in the marketplace, it's great to see the evidence of these wins, which gives me great confidence we're on the right track to drive growth through innovation. 
While we're seeing growth in innovative specialty products, we're also facing increasing macro challenges, particularly in Chemical Intermediates. We're pulling all levers to mitigate the impact of these challenges. 
On the cost management front, we remain well on track with our cost-reduction efforts to deliver $100 million to the bottom line without sacrificing our long-term growth initiatives. And we are making progress with the process we restarted earlier this year to divest our merchant ethylene, as well as potentially other commodity olefin product lines. 
Our cash engine continues to generate very impressive free cash flow as we are on track to deliver another great year of $900 million, enabling our strong dividend, deleveraging and accelerating our share repurchases. 
Our second quarter earnings overall are disappointing. We continue to deliver compelling results in Advanced Materials and Additives & Functional Products. And I'm confident as we get the challenges for Chemical Intermediates behind us and we stabilize Fibers, Eastman will emerge stronger than ever. 
Now I'll turn it over to Curt to discuss the corporate and segment results."

I know it's been a busy week, so I appreciate you joining us this morning. I'll start with our corporate results on Slide 5. Overall, sales revenue decreased primarily due to lower selling prices, particularly i",1604,"Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. I know it's been a busy week, so I appreciate you joining us this morning. 
I'll start with our corporate results on Slide 5. Overall, sales revenue decreased primarily due to lower selling prices, particularly in Chemical Intermediates. Volume was down slightly, with the decline in Fibers mostly offset by an increase in Advanced Materials. Our operating earnings decreased primarily due to declines in Chemical Intermediates and Fibers. 
Despite the challenges, our operating margin was above 16%. And adjusted earnings per share was $1.68 for the quarter. By no means are we satisfied with the business environment we find ourselves in and the negative impact it is having on our results. Thus, we are taking additional actions to mitigate the challenges we face, and Mark will outline these actions in a few minutes. 
Moving next to the segment results, starting with Advanced Materials on Slide 6, which delivered a great first half of the year. Second quarter sales revenue was relatively unchanged as higher sales volume of premium products, including Saflex acoustic interlayers and Tritan copolyester, was offset by lower selling prices primarily for copolyesters, attributed to lower raw material costs such as paraxylene. 
One other point on second quarter volumes. Advanced Materials experienced some destocking in the first quarter of 2015 followed by a restocking in second quarter 2015. So we are very pleased with these results for our second quarter of 2016, especially given the tough comp. 
Year-over-year, operating earnings were relatively unchanged. Sequentially, operating earnings increased by $24 million or more than 20% driven by a seasonal increase in sales volume, including another quarterly volume record for Tritan copolyester. And for the first half, operating earnings increased year-over-year by 14% or $30 million, driven by a 5% increase in sales volume, improved product mix and lower unit cost due to higher capacity utilization. 
As a result, first half of 2016 operating margins increased to 19.4%, an approximately 200 basis point improvement over the first half of 2015. For the back half of the year, underlying business performance should remain strong as Advanced Materials continues to execute its strategy of volume growth, mix improvement and fixed-cost leverage. 
To underscore how well this business is executing this strategy, in 2015, Advanced Materials increased earnings by almost 40%, and we expect to build on that success this year. Given the results of the first half of 2016 and our strong outlook for the second half, Advanced Materials is positioned to deliver double-digit earnings growth in 2016. We are delivering compelling proof of our ability to drive growth through innovation even in a difficult macro environment. 
Now to Additives & Functional Products on Slide 7. Overall, a solid quarter despite short-term challenges. Revenue declined due to lower selling prices attributed to lower raw material costs. 2% volume growth for many attractive end markets, including strong growth for Crystex, for our tire resins and for animal nutrition products, was offset by volume and mix declines in product lines exposed to energy and industrial construction markets. 
Operating earnings decreased primarily due to lower selling prices more than offsetting lower raw material costs. And the operating margin remains solid at 21.8%, slightly above the year-ago period. 
As I look at full year of 2016, we expect to grow volumes and expect our prices to stabilize. Our commercial teams are doing a great job in managing trade-offs and maintaining margins and customer engagement for innovation and growth. We will continue to face macroeconomic and competitive challenges, but given the strength of the portfolio businesses in this segment and attractive end markets, Additives & Functional Products remains on track with our previous expectations for full year earnings to be slightly down, which would be a solid result in the current business climate. 
Now to Fibers on Slide 8. Second quarter revenue, volume and earnings were slightly below our expectations. Sales revenue decreased primarily due to lower sales volume, particularly for acetate tow, flake and yarn, combined with lower selling prices, particularly for tow. The decline in acetate tow sales volume was due to customer inventory destocking in China, consistent with our expectations for volumes to be down to about 10% for the year. The lower acetate flake sales volume was due to timing of shipments to our China acetate tow joint venture. Lower yarn volume was due to trade issues impacting our customers. 
Earnings for the second quarter decreased due to lower sales volume. Despite the decline of volume, operating margins were about 31% as our cost-reduction efforts offset the decline in prices. 
Looking at the full year of 2016, we expect second half earnings to be similar to first half, which is slightly below our previous expectations as we are experiencing some short-term challenges in acetate flake and yarn, which is an incremental headwind. And I'll add that as we discussed for some time now in the last earnings call and at investor conferences, price risk exists going into 2017. Given the current lower capacity utilization in acetate tow and the lack of additional asset rationalizations beyond what we did in the United Kingdom, the risk of competitors chasing share with price does exist. And we have seen our competitors attempt this strategy, which has created pricing pressure in our contract discussions for next year. Frankly, I don't understand the logic of these actions in a flat to declining growth business, but yet here we are. 
What I do understand and what I like about Eastman and our future in this industry is we have the lowest cost position, from the largest scale with backward integration into flake, masked with our tow position in Tennessee, Korea and China. And our customers place significant strategic value on both our asset footprint and our ability to innovate and deliver high-quality, reliable product. 
Further, our vertical and horizontal integration creates tremendous value and innovation capability for cellulosic products in Additives & Functional Products and Advanced Materials. And we have a track record of innovation from this technology platform that is well established for -- over decades. So I am confident about our long-term position and strongly believe this will continue to be a valuable business for Eastman going forward. 
I'll finish up the segment review of Chemical Intermediates on Slide 9. Sales revenue decreased due to lower selling prices, which were mostly the result of negative impact of lower market prices for propylene, ethylene and methanol and continued competitive pressure from weak demand in Asia Pacific. Operating earnings decreased due to lower selling prices more than offset lower raw material costs, in addition to higher planned maintenance costs. 
Looking at the full year of 2016, we expect a number of factors to impact results. We expect olefin margins to remain under pressure as the increase in oil prices has not yet translated to improving olefin prices. In particular, bulk ethylene prices have been disappointing as we have seen U.S. prices remain significantly discounted versus the rest of the world. We also expect lower methanol prices to continue putting pressure on market prices for some of our acetyl and amines product lines. And competitive pressures particularly from competitors in Asia have intensified, and we expect this will continue to the back half of the year. 
Considering the low oil environment, excess global capacity in olefins and methanol and increased competitive pressures due to slow economic growth, we expect second half year earnings to be below first half, with sequential improvement for both third and fourth quarters, which should continue into next year. 
Lastly, I'll give you a quick update on our process for divesting our merchant ethylene capacity and potentially certain commodity olefin product lines. We continue our discussions with potential buyers and still expect this process will take the greater part of this year to resolve itself. As you would expect, we'll remain disciplined and patient sellers as we move through the process. 
On Slide 10, I'll transition to an overview of our cash flow and other financial highlights for second quarter. We continue to do an excellent job of generating cash, with second quarter operating cash flow of approximately $500 million. 
We had nominal income tax payments and no contributions to our U.S. pension plans in the quarter. These payments are typically in the second half of the year, and we expect that will be the case in 2016. 
Capital expenditures totaled $124 million. We continue to manage the pace of capital spending with the current economic environment while still maintaining our growth investments and thus have reduced our full year capital expenditures to be between $600 million and $625 million. 
Free cash flow for the quarter was a very strong $370 million. And during the quarter, we reduced net debt by over $300 million, paid our second quarter dividend of $68 million and repurchased $25 million of our shares. 
Also during the quarter, we successfully sold EUR 500 million 1.5% notes due 2023 in the European public debt market, with proceeds used to repay $500 million of our 2.4% notes due in June of 2017 as well as some other borrowings. 
Our effective tax rate for the second quarter was just over 21%, aided by an expected discrete tax benefit. We continue to expect our full year tax rate will be between 24% and 25%, reflecting the continued benefits of our improvement in business operations. 
And lastly, we remain on track to generate more than $900 million of free cash flow for the year, which is a very strong performance in this current environment. 
And with that, I'll turn it back over to Mark."

I'll transition to our outlook on Slide 11. Looking at the back half of the year, we expect our innovative specialty businesses will continue to grow strongly, improving product mix and accelerating our overall earnings growth. We continue t",790,"Thanks, Curt. I'll transition to our outlook on Slide 11. Looking at the back half of the year, we expect our innovative specialty businesses will continue to grow strongly, improving product mix and accelerating our overall earnings growth. We continue to see the benefits of our vertical and horizontal integration as it enables an advantaged cost position and delivers capital-efficient earnings growth in our specialties. We are also getting benefit from the acquisitions, which are creating value in both cost synergies and accelerating revenue growth. 
We remain committed to our aggressive cost-reduction targets and are on track with them. And after reducing debt, we also expect to accelerate share repurchases in the back half of the year. 
In the near term, we have a number of challenges, particularly impacting Chemical Intermediates, and these have been increasing. As Curt mentioned, lower olefin margins and lower methanol prices are headwinds. In particular, the most significant change in our expectation was U.S. ethylene prices not tracking up with oil and global ethylene prices. We're also seeing excess supply pressure as slow economic growth is not sufficient to absorb the large amount of capacity that's been built in a number of products, especially in China for Chemical Intermediates. 
Our most recent outlook was that 2016 adjusted EPS would be down about 5%. Given the challenges we face, most significantly in Chemical Intermediates and modestly in Fibers, we expect full year 2016 EPS will be down up to 10% compared with 2015. As you think about the cadence through the rest of the year, we expect earnings in the third quarter will be similar to this second quarter as sequential growth in operating earnings is offset by an increase in the tax rate for the quarter. 
Lastly, this outlook assumes current business conditions continue in the back half of the year. If the conditions improve, that would be upside. 
Turning next to Slide 12. Obviously, our EPS expectations for this year are not where we want them to be, and we're not happy about that. Given that, we are taking significant action to mitigate the impact of the challenges we see in front of us. We are using all levers to improve results not just in 2016 but going forward. For me, that begins by maintaining our commitment to innovation and market development and doing everything we can to accelerate growth from these platforms. We've already realized commercial success from many of these platforms this year, and we are on the cusp of even bigger wins, and we are working to deliver these successes as fast as possible. 
We also remain committed to cost reduction. As I mentioned, we are on target with the cost reductions we implemented earlier this year. And as the challenges we faced have increased, we will be removing at least another $100 million of cost towards the end of this year to ensure that we deliver attractive earnings growth next year. 
While our SG&A and R&D as a percentage of sales is already in the lowest quartile of our peers, we are committed to attaining this new cost-reduction target without sacrificing innovation and market development. 
We continue to review our portfolio. This includes the process to divest our merchant ethylene capacity and some other product lines. And we will effectively manage capital allocation through this slow growth environment. This includes our strong dividend, which will increase; reducing debt; and increasing our share repurchases in the second half of '16 and into '17. 
As I look beyond '16, we are well positioned for growth as these short-term challenges recede and our strong growth drivers continue. Altogether, I'm confident we will continue to deliver attractive earnings growth in the long term as we transform towards a specialty portfolio. With the combined set of actions we're taking, we expect to be back on track for 8% to 12% EPS growth in 2017. 
I'll close with our key themes for 2016 on Slide 13. We continue to have a strong portfolio of specialty businesses. And through these businesses, we are driving growth, we are innovating, and we are improving our earnings mix. We face increasing challenges, particularly in Chemical Intermediates and Fibers, and we are responding to this challenging environment with the actions I just outlined. Our cash flow remains one of the best in our industry, and we are deploying it for a strong dividend, reducing leverage and accelerating repurchases of shares. 
And lastly, despite near-term temporary challenges, I remain very confident in our strategy and our ability to grow earnings. Eastman will emerge from these challenges stronger than ever, and we'll continue our journey to achieving our vision of becoming a leading specialty company. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Greg."

So if I could add, again, as we mentioned, there have been a number of management presentations that have occurred, and there, again, are active conversations going on.

So really, in order for this to really progress, our belief, it really requires 2 strategic parties, buyers or sellers, that understand the long-term value of olefins and the value of the quality of assets that we have. So I -- my sense is everyone's kind of looking at that way, but we'll see how it plays out. In regards to timing, this is still a top priority for us. We've got a great team working on it, but we'll just have to be disciplined as we go through the process, and it will still take a greater part of this year to see how this plays out."

There's a lot of volatility going on right now, as I mentioned. On the olefin side, we're seeing especially ethylene but as well as propylene being fairly depressed in the U.S. relative to what's gone on outside the U.S. So even though oil's improved, we haven't really seen a logical improvement of those olefin prices. And that's been a disappointment in the second quarter, and we certainly revised our outlook for the rest of the year to reflect the current conditions that have been in the sort of June, early July time frame when we built our forecast. I would also note that while the olefin prices haven't gone up much, the propane prices and ethylene prices have, especially propane. So they have tracked up with oil with the significant improvement in global export capacity to get the propane out of the country. So that's created some compression here that, on a long-term basis, I don't think plays out. I don't think you have ethylene and propylene stranded in the U.S. forever. There's obviously not enough derivative capacity to monetize that monomer in the globe, but that will come online, like many people have already discussed. And this disconnect will get closed, and we'll go back to what is a normal situation where these prices are more closely connected to the globe. And then that would be a material recovery in earnings from -- for us as -- when that happens in the future. So I think that's all playing out sort of as we expected. And that's sort of the olefin story. I would note that there's 2 other parts of the story when it comes to Chemical Intermediates. Methanol prices are 40% lower than they were a year ago, and it's the same kind of story. Not only have they tracked down with oil, but there's oversupply in methanol. And so we haven't seen methanol prices recover really in the second quarter as you would have expected with the recovery in oil. And that's also putting pressure on the earnings in the segment when you think about acetic acid, acetic anhydride competitors in Asia set the price ultimately based on their purchased methanol cost. And that's put a lot of price pressure on those products, not as significant as olefins for us, but it's still quite material. And it's even having a modest impact on functional amines, where we have a lot of cost pass-through contracts tied to methanol prices. And in both acetyls and methanol, we have advantaged coal gasification as well as disadvantaged fixed-price methanol contract, and so you get some compression there. And then there is some additional pressure, of course, with Asian competitors with excess supply, no demand in China to absorb it. So they're dumping those products all over the world. I would say, though, Frank, that the good news about this is that we're seeing the prices stabilize, and we're seeing evidence of this in a couple of different fronts. One, we just filed an antidumping case in plasticizers, where we're seeing some pretty extreme behavior from our Korean-based competitors. And the commerce department has already agreed that we have made a case for economic harm and have launched an investigation into that. And we're also seeing some other products, some of our competitors in China shut down because they're out of the money at the current pricing that they're sort of driving in the marketplace. So I would say we think it's bottoming, and we just need to start seeing some of the situation to improve, and that's all embedded in our guidance. But right now, our guidance for the rest of the year is it stays challenging like it is now for this year."

And obviously, there's been a lot of commentary in the industry already with investors about what's going on in the space. And so I've spent a little time trying to put my thoughts together, and I think there's a number of things that are important to be clear about both in the market context and what our strategy is. So let's start with demand. First of all, nothing's changed in our view about tow demand for this year and moving forward. Outside of China, continues declining 1% to 2%. We still believe that the primary issue in China this year is inventory destocking of tow, where they had way too much inventory in tow, and we think that will run its course this year. There remains some uncertainty about what that will turn into next year because while I think tow destocking will be over, we still don't have clear understanding of what's going on in cigarette demand in China and so there's a chance of some continued destocking there. But when you put it all together, our view is tow imports into China next year will be sort of flat, potentially modestly up. Regarding our specific performance versus our competitors, as you can see through the first half of this year and the data, we have obviously taking a bit more of a hit in volume than our competitors. And we've been clear about that because for 10 years, we've been a huge beneficiary of having the largest share of imports in China while China was growing, and there's always 2 sides to those positions. And when imports drop, we're going to feel more of that than anyone else. But when you -- when we look through all that, we still see that we're on track for a 10% decline in tow in demand. Nothing's changed our view about that at all, but you got to remember that there's some chunkiness in the buying patterns with all different customers, to some degree. And so there's some chunkiness in buying patterns that will -- so for our second quarter, we're probably a little bit light compared to what we expected but nothing material. It's also important to remember in our volume numbers that while we're saying 10% down in tow, there's other things going on, like the timing issue in flake, some yarn being off and no longer having acetyl chemical sales to ourself in the JV we have with Solvay for making flake. But we are seeing some aggressive actions by all of our competitors going after share. And we mentioned a long time ago, when you get a huge currency change like you do in Japan and Europe, you can think about passing out of the marketplace to chase share and not even feel the margin impact. And we've seen, as you can see through the data that everyone's reporting, that we have some dynamics going on there. And a part of the story for us is some modest share loss this year outside of China, but it's pretty modest at this point, but it's disappointing to see this happen. We've been talking about the fact that if the excess capacity remains in the industry, it's entirely possible that we're going to have people behave in a way where they're trying to chase share with price. With these margins, it's really tempting as you're just living for the short term, and we're seeing some of that. But in this context, I think we've had a very clear strategy of what we're trying to do, and I just want to sort of make sure we're clear about what we're doing. First, we recognize and accept the challenges that we have in China. And so when we added capacity with CNTC, which was very low-cost tow capacity, we chose to take out an equal amount of capacity in the United Kingdom that was relatively high cost for us, balancing our position there and accepting those changes in market conditions. We also exited our flake JV with Solvay to reduce our costs given we no longer need that capacity, given we'd shut down the U.K. tow situation. So we've done everything we can to sort of balance our capacity situation and the results of what's going on in China. And we're now down to being the lowest-cost supplier in the world in tow. We have the largest-scale asset in flake. It's backward-integrated in coal. And we have the lowest-cost tow assets in Tennessee, Korea and China that's equally matched to that flake capacity, and we have no further tow assets that we can shut down or would just leave us long in flake, which doesn't make much sense for us. Second, we -- since we have the best cost position in the industry, we have every intention of maintaining our market share outside of China. So when these competitors are trying to gain share from us, which obviously they have done, it simply results in lower prices and therefore lower earnings and cash flow for everyone. Third, we're committed to being the leading supplier to our customers based on the strength that we have in our quality, in our reliability, our unique innovation capabilities and the strength of our asset base to supply our customers. So as we look at 2016, we do expect earnings are going to be down due to this price pressure as these contract discussions have now started early, and we're seeing this behavior from our competitors. And it's likely we'll be down 10% to 20% before you include the cost actions we just announced. But it's early, and so we're going to have to see how all these contract discussions play out for the rest of the year and kind of how it nets out, and then we'll keep you updated. When I look beyond 2017, and this is quite important, many of these new contracts are going to be multiyear contracts, providing price and supply stability for our customers. You would also think that, given how this is all playing out and not really working out very well for anyone, that our competitors are going to have to start looking at their cost positions like we did and think about rationalizing high-cost assets that they all certainly have. And we'll just have to see what they choose to do. I would also note that we're not just sitting around waiting for what's going to happen in the tow business. Eastman's been the innovator for 90 years in cellulosics. We've innovated a huge range of new products over the years, and you've seen those great results we've had in AFP and AM. And so as we saw these things start to develop all the way back in 2014, and we knew that we had to accelerate our innovation efforts for new applications in cellulosics, and we've been doing that as ways to load these assets in new applications. It's obviously still early when it comes to growth and innovation, but I've been incredibly impressed by our teams and how they've raised to that challenge, and we have a number of great projects going forward here, developing new applications that'll help in the long term. So when I look at the Fibers challenges that we have and include it, I'm still confident we can do 8% to 12% earnings growth next year when I consider the companywide cost actions we're going to take, as well as doing everything we can to reduce cost in Fibers directly, and the growth that I expect in the other 3 segments relative to this year as well as our ability to deploy our free cash flow."

And some people responded, and we're defending. And so I think that that's -- that horse has left the barn as far as 2017 goes. We're going to see prices come down at our large customers. But I do think that the positive side of this story is they also put a high value on stability and security of supply and are looking for long-term commitments in contracts with suppliers that are committed to being in the industry for the long term. And we stand out as the most committed given our integration and scale, so that, I think, will work well for us as we try to maintain our market share position.

On the outlook for propane and propylene, because you really -- what really matters is the cracking spread relative to propylene and ethylene, our view is the market is already reconnecting propane to global values with all the export capacity that's readily available in the U.S. So I think you're seeing that now with how propane prices improved through second quarter. And even as oil has come off recently, you've seen propane prices follow it down. So it just depends on your view on oil, and you can get a view of what you think propane's going to do next year. The bigger question is what I already discussed, which is what are ethylene and propylene prices going to do, especially ethylene as they've been stranded and disconnected? I mean, it's really significant when you think about ethylene in Asia in the mid-$0.40 range, and we're in the mid- to high $0.20 range in ethylene times 700 million pounds of ethylene that we sell.

Certainly, we're committed to driving our portfolio towards specialty as hard as we possibly can, and you do that through multiple things. We've done, I think, some excellent acquisitions, large ones like Solutia and Taminco and some bolt-ons as well. And we paid reasonable prices for them and are going to get attractive ROICs relative to where the average cost of capital. So -- and frankly, those acquisitions were intentional. We always knew we had challenges in fibers and olefins at some point in the future. We intentionally chose not to build crackers and PDH units because we were convinced 5 years ago that, that industry would overbuild. And we were intentionally diversifying our portfolio with the strength of the cash that we had at the time in olefins and fibers into more attractive long-term markets where we can innovate. So I think that part of the strategy is great and on track. And of course, we've always been a disciplined seller of underperforming businesses. We've sold off $3.5 billion of revenue from PET to polyolefins, et cetera, in the past, and we're trying to get rid of more of it now in this current process on the bulk ethylene and some other products. So we're doing everything within our control. Unfortunately, I've said this before, we're out of the M&A market as a tool to sort of further diversify our portfolio at this moment in time. I think the valuations are way too high in the market that are being paid right now, 15x anything, it seems. It's hard to get an ROIC at an acceptable level, and we still -- we're old-fashioned that way. We still believe in an unlevered return on capital even if that is close to free. And so we don't think that's value creating for our shareholders. We're not going to do that. What we are going to do is focus on innovation and driving innovative growth across our portfolio. We've been doing it for a long time as heritage Eastman, and we're showing you excellent proof points about how we're doing it in the acquisitions, from interlayers to Crystex to performance films, and/or starting to accelerate somewhat great opportunities in Taminco now that we've got under the hood there. So we're going to do that. We're going to take out cost as much as we possibly can but not cut our innovation programs. That's a core choice for us. And as Curt mentioned, we've got one of the best free cash flows in the industry, and we'll be repurchasing shares as aggressively as we can but also maintaining our credit rating."

We're assuming that the world stays similar to the way it is today. So oil stays in the $40s, economy continues to grow slowly, and there's a modest improvement in oil prices next year relative to this year but not anything material. And with those conditions, we believe Chemical Intermediates can grow earnings over this year. You have to remember that you got a net $0.30 a share tailwind with the hedge; when we back out currency, that's $0.40 of propane hedges coming off and a $0.10 headwind in currency, net $0.30. And a lot of that tailwind flows into Chemical Intermediates, 80% roughly. So you've got that tailwind, and you've got what we think is a bottoming-out situation right now in pricing and behavior by our competitors. And so we're not assuming some dramatic recovery next year."

So our cost reductions are not -- we have a very bright line where we're not going to cross that, but we are going to put our -- push our cost reductions to the limit. And I'd also note, we are already very low-cost, and we already stretched our functional scale capability tremendously with the large number of acquisitions we've done. So we feel good about where we are, but you can always push for more, and that's what we're going to do.

I think the C3 chain -- I think we've talked about it to some degree already, which is propylene prices seem to have stabilized right now, but they're not improving as oil improved as much as propane did. So you've seen some compression in that spread. And if you look at it, year-over-year, obviously, there's tremendous compression in propylene-to-propane spread versus a year ago in the second quarter as well as how we view the next couple of quarters. But I think that, over time, it will go back to a more normal relationship. Propylene is a little bit artificially depressed by all the excess supply of PDH out there. But end of the day, propylene price is going to get set out of Asia, particularly probably China, and it's going to either be PDH, methanol or olefins or naphtha. All of them are connected to oil. So once we get enough derivative capacity out there to turn all this propylene into something, I think you start getting back to some more normal relationships of propylene to propane with where oil turns out to be."

So I thought I'll have a lot more time to sort of grow the specialties relative to those 2 segments. But I do think we're doing everything we can, and we're cutting costs aggressively to offset the margin compression we're facing in Fibers and CI as much as we can. And I think oil will recover to some degree at some point, and that'll give us a big tailwind relative to some of these businesses. So I think this is a really tough year for us obviously, not happy about it. We're doing everything we can on every front to make it as good as possible. But right now, we got to organically grow. We got to divest what we can and return share to -- returning cash to shareholders.

So in regards to the shape of the curve, we are definitely the lowest-cost player. And to answer your question, the curve has flattened out a bit because while we're based on coal, our competitors are based on natural gas and methanol, that drives our cost structure. And certainly, those prices have come down. So in this year, it's feeling a little bit sort of flattened out relative to the past. As you look forward, coal's going to probably stay pretty low in the U.S., and natural gas prices are already moving up, and methanol prices will certainly move up with oil as well. So I think the curve is actually going to steepen relative to us from this year going forward is our view of sort of how that cost curve's changed and is going to go back to being steeper as we move forward. I'm not going to get into details of the steepness of the curve. What I can tell you, though, is there's plenty of high-cost assets out there that are discrete stand-alone assets.

I'll begin my comments by reviewing our strategic highlights for the third quarter and the first 9 months of 2016. We continue to upgrade the quality of our product mix by growing high-margin specialty product lines, the key component of our winning strategy. And I have increasing confidence about the breadth and depth of our innovation portfolio, which is significantly more compelling today than it was 3 years ago. 
One of our recent innovation successes is within our tire resins platform in the Additives & Functional Products segment. Tire manufacturers face a significant challenge in improving fuel efficiency while maintaining traction safety. Eastman is quickly -- uniquely qualified to meet this challenge. We are the world leader in resin technology chemistry, and I'm pleased to report that we have gained commercial approval with a major tire producer for 2 new proprietary products and are in the process of sampling a full range of resins with selected innovation partners. 
So far this year, the tire resins platform has delivered approximately 20% volume growth over 2015, with margins above the corporate average. This is a great example of revenue synergy from Solutia acquisition, combining a strong market-connected application development capability with our resin technology platform. 
Moving next to our capital projects to support our specialty growth. We are leveraging our unique innovation capabilities and investing for long-term growth where it counts. From Tritan to interlayers to Crystex, we're the world leader in both process technology and product offerings and are winning through our innovation platforms. We're walking the talk with our investments in growth in  specialty products and seeing the results. 
We are, therefore, driving hard to complete these capital projects to support our growth. All 3 of these projects are on target to finish on or well below budget, which demonstrates our competitive advantage through best-in-class engineering, construction and operational capabilities. In a slow-growth world, we are creating our own growth and investing capital smartly. 
We also proved we can drive innovation while managing costs aggressively. We remain well on track with our cost-reduction efforts to deliver $100 million to the bottom line in 2016 without sacrificing our investment in long-term growth initiatives. These efforts include implementation of hundreds of projects across our global footprint. 
One example is the successful initiative recently completed by our process control team. We were able to utilize a plant loader program associated with our larger -- largest cracker in Longview, Texas. The initiative increased feed efficiency, saving almost $2 million in costs. This is a great example of how our significant scale and integration in our 2 largest sites provide us a unique competitive advantage, where we have dedicated experts in a wide range of specialized operational disciplines. 
We also leverage these experts across the globe to optimize performance in the smaller manufacturing sites from our acquisitions to our sites we've had for a long time. In addition, we remain on track to execute our second cost-reduction initiative this quarter, which we expect will deliver an additional $100 million to the bottom line in 2017. 
Productivity is a core capability to Eastman. Over the past 5 years, we removed almost $700 million in costs to offset inflation and deliver results to the bottom line while maintaining our commitment to quality, reliability and safety. We are continuing to innovate throughout our enterprise, on product development and how we think about manufacturing and our approach to productivity across all our functions. All of these areas will contribute to our strong growth going forward. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Curt to discuss corporate and segment results."

Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with our third quarter results on Slide 4.

Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with our third quarter results on Slide 4. Overall sales revenue decreased primarily due to lower selling prices and lower Fibers sales volumes more than offsetting higher sales volume in all other segments. 
Our operating earnings declined as an increase in Advanced Materials was more than offset by declines in the other segments. Despite the business -- challenging business environment, our operating margin was above 18%. Adjusted earnings per share was $1.86 for the quarter as actions we took led to both operating earnings and taxes coming in better than expected. 
Moving next to the segment results and starting with Advanced Materials on Slide 5, which delivered another quarter of impressive growth driven by our innovation platforms. Third quarter sales revenue increased due to double-digit volume growth of premium products. Eastman Tritan copolyester once again had a record volume quarter as we continue to lead in consumer durables and housewares. 
Saflex acoustic interlayers continued their strong growth this year as applications have expanded to more windows -- from the windows to the side windows and the sunroof as well as expanded to more models. And performance films volumes were strong this quarter due to an excellent new channel strategy in North America and China. The volume and mix improvement was partially offset by lower selling prices, primarily for core copolyesters attributed to lower raw material costs. 
Operating earnings were up 22% or $25 million, primarily driven by higher sales volume and improved product mix of premium products as well as lower unit costs due to higher capacity utilization. Operating margins for the quarter increased by approximately 350 basis points to over 22%. 
As we look ahead to the fourth quarter, we are expecting normal seasonal decline in volume. With that said, we expect Advanced Materials will deliver low double-digit earnings growth for the full year of 2016 and anticipate this business can deliver -- continue to deliver strong growth again in 2017. We are delivering compelling proof of our ability to drive growth through innovation even in a difficult macro environment. 
Now to Additives & Functional Products on Slide 6. Sales revenue declined primarily due to lower selling prices attributed to lower raw material costs, partially offset by higher sales volume. Operating earnings decreased primarily due to lower selling prices more than offsetting lower raw material costs and higher sales volume. And the operating margin remained solid at over 21%. For full year 2016, we continue to expect higher volumes and expect prices to have mostly stabilized. 
One other item that I thought would be useful as you analyze this segment this year. We have been operating under a new organizational structure for a couple of quarters now, which, if you recall, was some major product moves between Additives & Functional Products and Chemical Intermediates. As we analyze how resources and costs are flowing, that's coming out a little different than expected in our historical recast. 
As you consider year-over-year comps, about $20 million more costs are flowing through Additives & Functional Products in 2016 than what was reflected in the $660 million recasted view for them in 2015 while approximately $20 million less is flowing to Chemical Intermediates. Putting it all together, Additives & Functional Products remains on track with our previous expectations for full year earnings to be somewhat down, which would be a solid result in the current business climate. And as pricing stabilizes, we expect solid earnings growth next year through market volume growth and our innovation effort. 
Now to Fibers on Slide 7. Third quarter revenue, volume and earnings were in line with our expectations. Sales revenue decreased primarily due to lower sales volume and lower selling prices particularly for acetate tow. Lower acetate tow sales volume was primarily due to reduced sales into China. Operating earnings declined due to lower sales volume. The lower selling prices were offset by recent actions we took to reduce raw material costs and actions to reduce operating costs. As a result, operating margins held at approximately 32%. 
Our full year outlook has not changed as we continue to expect second half earnings to be similar to first half, which includes tow volumes being down approximately 10% for the year. I'll also mention that we continued contract negotiations for 2017 and anticipate earnings for the segment to be down roughly 20% next year. We remain confident in our long-term position and strongly believe that Fibers will continue to be a valuable business for Eastman going forward. 
I'll finish up the segment review with Chemical Intermediates on Slide 8. Sales revenue decreased due to lower selling prices. We attributed these lower selling prices to continued competitive pressures due to lower oil prices and weak demand in Asia Pacific. Operating earnings declined primarily due to lower selling prices more than offsetting lower raw material and energy costs and lower hedge costs. During the quarter, we saw some modest improvement in the overall business environment impacting Chemical Intermediates and now expecting earnings in the back half of the year to be slightly higher than the first half, and we expect this improvement to continue into next year. 
Lastly, I'll give you a quick update on our process for divesting our excess ethylene capacity and potentially certain commodity olefin product lines. We continue our discussions with potential partners or parties and now anticipate this process will carry into next year, though I'll add that executing a transaction in this current environment remains challenging. 
On Slide 9, I'll transition to an overview of our cash flows or other financial highlights for the second quarter (sic) [ third quarter ]. We continue to do an excellent job of generating cash with third quarter operating cash flow of $450 million. We contributed $50 million to our U.S. pension plans in the quarter. Capital expenditures totaled $141 million. We continue to manage the pace of capital spending with the current economic environment while maintaining growth investments and continue to expect full year capital expenditures to be between $600 million and $625 million. 
Free cash flow for the quarter was a strong $309 million. And during the quarter, we reduced net debt by over $160 million, paid our second quarter dividend of $68 million and repurchased $75 million of our shares. Through 9 months of 2016, we have reduced debt by $400 million and returned almost $325 million to our stockholders. 
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was just over 21% as we are benefiting from foreign tax credits and other positive tax attributes. We expect our full year tax rate will be between 22% and 23%, which is better than previous expectations, reflecting the continued benefits of our improved -- improvement in business operations. We continue to look for every opportunity to reduce costs, including taxes, from both an earnings and cash flow standpoint. This quarter was another great example of our tax team finding such opportunities, including amending previously filed tax returns.  And lastly, we remain on track to generate more than $900 million of free cash flow for this year, which is a very strong performance in the current environment. 
With that, I'll turn it back over to Mark."

On Page 10, we've talked a lot about the benefits of our portfolio transformation and how that contributes to more consistent earnings growth and strong free cash flow generation. You can see that our portfolio transformation has been a key",845,"Thanks, Curt. On Page 10, we've talked a lot about the benefits of our portfolio transformation and how that contributes to more consistent earnings growth and strong free cash flow generation. You can see that our portfolio transformation has been a key element to delivering strong earnings for quite some time. 
Over the last 6 years, we have taken decisive actions to improve our portfolio through acquiring attractive specialty businesses and divesting underperforming businesses. And we acquired these specialty companies at reasonable valuations with very attractive synergies that we've delivered. Organically, we have grown our volume and, more importantly, upgraded our mix. This is both within our heritage businesses and within the acquired businesses through great efforts in our innovation programs and through our commercial excellence. 
As a result of these efforts, you can see a very different story from who we were before versus today. We have improved the earnings mix across segments significantly. In 2010, Fibers and Chemical Intermediates were roughly 60% of the corporate earnings. Today, that percentage is closer to 30%. For 2016, we expect that the combination of Advanced Materials and Additives & Functional Products will represent approximately 70% of our earnings. And even in this environment, our EPS CAGR will still be roughly 11% from 2010 to '16. 
We also dramatically improved our free cash flow, almost tripling it from 2010 to 2016. Both improvements in our core businesses and adding the strong free cash flow generation from our acquisitions have substantially upgraded the quality of our portfolio. And we are still investing capital to deliver long-term growth in our specialty businesses while we generate one of the strongest free cash flows in this industry. 
On Slide 11, I'll discuss our 2016 outlook. We're doing a great job of executing our strategy in a challenging global business environment. Strong growth of high-value, innovative products continue as we benefit from leading positions in our attractive niche markets. We're seeing the benefits of scale and integration translating to growth in earnings, and we continue to invest in innovation and product development so that we can sustain our momentum into the coming years. We're also seeing the benefit of acquisition synergies in both costs and revenue. 
At the same time, we're achieving our cost-reduction goals. I can't say enough about how -- our Eastman employees globally who made this possible. As I mentioned earlier, productivity is in the DNA of Eastman, and I remain very confident we will achieve our cost-reduction targets for 2017. In addition, we are using all lines of the income statement to support our performance this year, including lower tax rates. All these actions are helping to offset the challenges from low oil, sluggish global GDP growth and the challenges we face in Fibers. 
Putting all this together, our outlook for adjusted full year 2016 earnings per share has improved to between $6.70 and $6.80, which I consider to be a solid result given our challenges. We also continue to expect strong free cash flow this year above $900 million. And we are creating value for our stakeholders with our balanced and disciplined allocation of this cash, increasing our dividend, increasing share repurchases and continued delevering. 
With this momentum in mind, I'll make a few comments about 2017. On the last call, I indicated we have confidence that we can get back on track for EPS growth in the 8% to 12% range in 2017, and we continue to be confident. As we look at it, we expect growth and innovation-driven mix improvement in Advanced Materials and Functional Products cost-reduction actions to contribute about $0.50 per share, the net of propane and currency hedges continued roll off in 2017 to contribute about $0.30 per share, an increase in the level of share repurchases while maintaining a balanced approach with deleveraging and continuing to use all of the lines of the income statement to contribute to EPS growth. These would more than offset the roughly $0.30 per share headwind from Fibers and the preproduction expenses from our new specialty plants. The combination of these factors will get us to EPS growth in the 8% to 12% range. 
I would also note that we don't need the world to get much better to achieve this growth. And if things get better, there is upside. We'll talk to more -- more to you about the outlook for 2017 in our fourth quarter call in January, but I believe it's important now for you to understand why we are confident about delivering strong earnings growth and strong free cash flow in 2017. 
This has been a tough year, and I'm proud of our employees around the world who have maintained focus and positioned us for growth going forward. I'm confident that 2017 will be a better year for Eastman. Most importantly, I believe that we are building one of the world's leading specialty companies to deliver long-term sustainable growth in a world where we -- where you need to create your own growth. 
With that, I'll turn it back over to Greg."

As Mark mentioned [ph] earlier, and if I could -- Eastman has one of the best portfolios, I think, that can generate cash in the industry. And you're seeing that in our results, and also, you'll see that next year. We do expect higher free cash flows",279,"Yes. As Mark mentioned [ph] earlier, and if I could -- Eastman has one of the best portfolios, I think, that can generate cash in the industry. And you're seeing that in our results, and also, you'll see that next year. We do expect higher free cash flows next year as we see operating earnings growth as well as we'll see a modest decline in our CapEx. A couple of factors to think about when you -- when I'm  looking at 2017 cash flows is we'll be watching what kind of raw material environment we're facing. If we expect higher raws, as you know, that's going to give us some challenges in working capital that we'll try to offset. I also am expecting some higher cash taxes next year as we have now fully utilized the NOLs as part of the Solutia transaction as well as there's a phaseout of bonus depreciation for manufacturers like Eastman. So putting it all together though, we're going to generate over free -- free cash flow over $900 million. With the earnings outlook that Mark talked about, I won't be surprised if we see free cash flow approaching $1 billion. The allocation, what you'll see is still a balance across the different buckets that we have. You know our disciplined and balanced approach to capital allocation. But what you'll see is some more balanced approach to deleveraging and share repurchases with that free cash flow. So if you think about deleveraging, it was the predominant use of cash flow these last couple of years. That will moderate to be more balanced. And so you'll see share repurchase probably in excess of $300 million."

We saw that our competitors, especially Asians, setting price on a lot of these products on a global basis. We're starting to hit their cost positions. And as oil strengthened and their raw material costs, who are often -- I mean, purchased propylene and ethylene was going up, they would face pressure to increase prices, and that's what we're seeing. So it's very encouraging to actually see prices go up for once. It's been a long time. We do expect that momentum to continue as we go through the fourth quarter and carry into next year. But obviously, that will depend a bit on the raw material environment, so we'll have to see where oil and olefin prices go. But we're happy to see the change in direction and some traction right now."

So -- and the growth rates in there largely has just been fantastic, so we need to get that plant up to keep our growth. In regards to Advanced Materials, they're just having a phenomenal year like they had a phenomenal year last year, and it's really proof of our strategy we have been talking about for the last 5 years. We said we're going to drive growth through innovation, and that's what we're doing. And Tritan and heads-up display and acoustic interlayers and our performance films business, all delivering double-digit growth and driving not just the sort of overall volume growth but the mix upgrade with all those products growing at such high rates with above-segment and above-company average margins. So it's just a good story. It's really -- very little of it is a raw material tailwind in what's driving the results, which gives us confidence that it will sustain going forward. And obviously, third quarter was a quarter where everything just ran pretty well. We've had good volume, good mix, the plants ran incredibly well. One of the challenges in this kind of businesses where making such a physical product is you have yield and quality issues, and we just had clean quarter in how we ran the plants."

So first of all, this portfolio is a great set of portfolio of specialty businesses, tremendous additives that add a lot of functionality across our customers in coatings, tires, adhesives and crop, et cetera. This is a great business of unique additives. So we view it as a business that will continue to grow. As you look at the pricing, which I think is the key question and how it's come off, prices have really stabilized since the second quarter. So we did a great job of holding onto raw material value in the beginning of last year starting to giving some back in third quarter but really started giving it back in the fourth quarter and the first quarter of this year as we decided to share value with our customers. But those prices have stabilized. We really didn't have much sequential decline in prices at all from second quarter into the third quarter this year, and we expect the same stability as we go into the fourth you. And you'll see that even on the year-over-year basis, January as you see the trends in the fourth quarter. So that feels very stable to us and appropriate, and we expect prices probably to start moving up in the coatings area especially on the olefin-related products. Specialties are a little slower prices on the way down. They're also slower on the way up. So Chemical Intermediates is starting to move on the pricing front, and we expect as we go into next year those prices on the specialty related products also start to move up with these current market conditions. So that all feels directionally correct to me. I think the important point is how you sustain these margins and continue to deliver growth over the long term. It's easy to hold onto prices when raw has dropped, but if you do that too aggressively and not share some of your customers, you really create problem with those customers being engaged in working with you on any future innovation. And I think we've struck the right balance here, and we're seeing that in the proof of our innovation successes. We're just having tremendous success throughout the AFB portfolio with innovation. Our polyester coatings is doing extremely well. We talked to you about that in the first quarter call. We've gone from 3 to 10 customers aggressively working with us on how to commercialize that product and take it to market. We're seeing success with tire resin I just told you about. We're seeing success in Aerafin olefins products I talked about in the second quarter call that go with adhesive resins. We continue to see great traction on our load coalescence. So across the portfolio, you're seeing a lot of innovation, a lot of traction. And as I said before, this is a little bit slower in getting started than Advanced Materials, but as you look at the next 3 years, you'll see all these innovation programs driving growth and mix improvements here just like we're doing in Advanced Materials. We're improving across the board we can deliver growth and innovation. We can create own growth, not waiting for the economy to get better and that's story you're going to see us deliver over the next 3 years."

And what we see right now is that pricing pressure play out into the 2017 timeframe. Our objective is [indiscernible] sort of keep the business stable. That's been our objective from the beginning. We took capacity out in the U.K. as adding capacity in China, and we also exit some capacity as well. On the pricing front, we've attempted to be as stable as it can be on the pricing. Unfortunately, we got pushed aggressively on some of our competitors trying to take share from us outside of China, and all we're trying to do is defend share and keep it stable outside of China. We're not trying to recover lost imports in China by taking share outside of China. And we think the best way to do that is to get multiyear contracts in volume and pricing place with many of our large customers, which will provide stability actually from '17 into '18 and '19 as we provide security of supply to our customers but also provide security of demand to us. I think those actions actually going to put us in the right direction as far as the things that we can do to control the outcome in this industry and our performance, and we'll just have to see how the rest of it plays out."

And we see tremendous innovation opportunities continuing out there to add more functionalities to the windows as we work with our customers in this next generation of acoustics in heads-up displays as well as other functionalities. It's just a very robust opportunity for growth. On the Additives & Functional Products side when it comes to coatings and tires, I mean, we're more balance, more balanced market from refinish or replacement tires than OEM.

We're the largest scale and now down to our largest most integrated asset as our only asset here in Tennessee flake, which is matched to our tow capacity here in Tennessee with the combined with our Korean tow capacity and China. So we're very happy about our cost position. Our competitors are based on either purchased methanol or anhydride in some cases. So some of these assets are certainly exposed to much higher cost position. They picked up some advantage with lower oil per day versus where they were. As oil goes up, those cost position is going to be less competitive relative to where we are. There are a number of high cost assets out there that can be shut down by competitors if they ever choose to do so to improve their cost position to serve their customers, and we're going to see what they choose to do.

That kind of gives you a band of what pension contributions could be like over the next 3 to 5 years. On capital, when you got the kind of assets we have, yes, every 3 to 5 years there's going to be turnarounds. What we have we do and we have a great team that does it, we try to manage the capital maintenance spend, the capital spending each year. Part of it is just resources. So yes, we're going to have some capital spend over the years, but some of the unique items we've had these last few years like some of the assets that we had to build in Texas as well as conversions to -- from coal to natural gas, there's little bit of it ahead of us.

I'll begin my comments by reviewing our strategic highlights for the third quarter and the first 9 months of 2016. We continue to upgrade the quality of our product mix by growing high-margin specialty product lines, the key component of our winning strategy. And I have increasing confidence about the breadth and depth of our innovation portfolio, which is significantly more compelling today than it was 3 years ago. 
One of our recent innovation successes is within our tire resins platform in the Additives & Functional Products segment. Tire manufacturers face a significant challenge in improving fuel efficiency while maintaining traction safety. Eastman is quickly -- uniquely qualified to meet this challenge. We are the world leader in resin technology chemistry, and I'm pleased to report that we have gained commercial approval with a major tire producer for 2 new proprietary products and are in the process of sampling a full range of resins with selected innovation partners. 
So far this year, the tire resins platform has delivered approximately 20% volume growth over 2015, with margins above the corporate average. This is a great example of revenue synergy from Solutia acquisition, combining a strong market-connected application development capability with our resin technology platform. 
Moving next to our capital projects to support our specialty growth. We are leveraging our unique innovation capabilities and investing for long-term growth where it counts. From Tritan to interlayers to Crystex, we're the world leader in both process technology and product offerings and are winning through our innovation platforms. We're walking the talk with our investments in growth in  specialty products and seeing the results. 
We are, therefore, driving hard to complete these capital projects to support our growth. All 3 of these projects are on target to finish on or well below budget, which demonstrates our competitive advantage through best-in-class engineering, construction and operational capabilities. In a slow-growth world, we are creating our own growth and investing capital smartly. 
We also proved we can drive innovation while managing costs aggressively. We remain well on track with our cost-reduction efforts to deliver $100 million to the bottom line in 2016 without sacrificing our investment in long-term growth initiatives. These efforts include implementation of hundreds of projects across our global footprint. 
One example is the successful initiative recently completed by our process control team. We were able to utilize a plant loader program associated with our larger -- largest cracker in Longview, Texas. The initiative increased feed efficiency, saving almost $2 million in costs. This is a great example of how our significant scale and integration in our 2 largest sites provide us a unique competitive advantage, where we have dedicated experts in a wide range of specialized operational disciplines. 
We also leverage these experts across the globe to optimize performance in the smaller manufacturing sites from our acquisitions to our sites we've had for a long time. In addition, we remain on track to execute our second cost-reduction initiative this quarter, which we expect will deliver an additional $100 million to the bottom line in 2017. 
Productivity is a core capability to Eastman. Over the past 5 years, we removed almost $700 million in costs to offset inflation and deliver results to the bottom line while maintaining our commitment to quality, reliability and safety. We are continuing to innovate throughout our enterprise, on product development and how we think about manufacturing and our approach to productivity across all our functions. All of these areas will contribute to our strong growth going forward. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Curt to discuss corporate and segment results."
109103,403998070,1065261,"Eastman Chemical Co., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2016",2016-10-28,"Earnings Calls","Eastman Chemical Company","Executives","Good. Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with our third quarter results on Slide 4. Overall sales revenue decreased primarily due to lower selling prices and lower Fibers sales volumes more than offsetting higher sales volume in all othe",1204,"Good. Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with our third quarter results on Slide 4. Overall sales revenue decreased primarily due to lower selling prices and lower Fibers sales volumes more than offsetting higher sales volume in all other segments. 
Our operating earnings declined as an increase in Advanced Materials was more than offset by declines in the other segments. Despite the business -- challenging business environment, our operating margin was above 18%. Adjusted earnings per share was $1.86 for the quarter as actions we took led to both operating earnings and taxes coming in better than expected. 
Moving next to the segment results and starting with Advanced Materials on Slide 5, which delivered another quarter of impressive growth driven by our innovation platforms. Third quarter sales revenue increased due to double-digit volume growth of premium products. Eastman Tritan copolyester once again had a record volume quarter as we continue to lead in consumer durables and housewares. 
Saflex acoustic interlayers continued their strong growth this year as applications have expanded to more windows -- from the windows to the side windows and the sunroof as well as expanded to more models. And performance films volumes were strong this quarter due to an excellent new channel strategy in North America and China. The volume and mix improvement was partially offset by lower selling prices, primarily for core copolyesters attributed to lower raw material costs. 
Operating earnings were up 22% or $25 million, primarily driven by higher sales volume and improved product mix of premium products as well as lower unit costs due to higher capacity utilization. Operating margins for the quarter increased by approximately 350 basis points to over 22%. 
As we look ahead to the fourth quarter, we are expecting normal seasonal decline in volume. With that said, we expect Advanced Materials will deliver low double-digit earnings growth for the full year of 2016 and anticipate this business can deliver -- continue to deliver strong growth again in 2017. We are delivering compelling proof of our ability to drive growth through innovation even in a difficult macro environment. 
Now to Additives & Functional Products on Slide 6. Sales revenue declined primarily due to lower selling prices attributed to lower raw material costs, partially offset by higher sales volume. Operating earnings decreased primarily due to lower selling prices more than offsetting lower raw material costs and higher sales volume. And the operating margin remained solid at over 21%. For full year 2016, we continue to expect higher volumes and expect prices to have mostly stabilized. 
One other item that I thought would be useful as you analyze this segment this year. We have been operating under a new organizational structure for a couple of quarters now, which, if you recall, was some major product moves between Additives & Functional Products and Chemical Intermediates. As we analyze how resources and costs are flowing, that's coming out a little different than expected in our historical recast. 
As you consider year-over-year comps, about $20 million more costs are flowing through Additives & Functional Products in 2016 than what was reflected in the $660 million recasted view for them in 2015 while approximately $20 million less is flowing to Chemical Intermediates. Putting it all together, Additives & Functional Products remains on track with our previous expectations for full year earnings to be somewhat down, which would be a solid result in the current business climate. And as pricing stabilizes, we expect solid earnings growth next year through market volume growth and our innovation effort. 
Now to Fibers on Slide 7. Third quarter revenue, volume and earnings were in line with our expectations. Sales revenue decreased primarily due to lower sales volume and lower selling prices particularly for acetate tow. Lower acetate tow sales volume was primarily due to reduced sales into China. Operating earnings declined due to lower sales volume. The lower selling prices were offset by recent actions we took to reduce raw material costs and actions to reduce operating costs. As a result, operating margins held at approximately 32%. 
Our full year outlook has not changed as we continue to expect second half earnings to be similar to first half, which includes tow volumes being down approximately 10% for the year. I'll also mention that we continued contract negotiations for 2017 and anticipate earnings for the segment to be down roughly 20% next year. We remain confident in our long-term position and strongly believe that Fibers will continue to be a valuable business for Eastman going forward. 
I'll finish up the segment review with Chemical Intermediates on Slide 8. Sales revenue decreased due to lower selling prices. We attributed these lower selling prices to continued competitive pressures due to lower oil prices and weak demand in Asia Pacific. Operating earnings declined primarily due to lower selling prices more than offsetting lower raw material and energy costs and lower hedge costs. During the quarter, we saw some modest improvement in the overall business environment impacting Chemical Intermediates and now expecting earnings in the back half of the year to be slightly higher than the first half, and we expect this improvement to continue into next year. 
Lastly, I'll give you a quick update on our process for divesting our excess ethylene capacity and potentially certain commodity olefin product lines. We continue our discussions with potential partners or parties and now anticipate this process will carry into next year, though I'll add that executing a transaction in this current environment remains challenging. 
On Slide 9, I'll transition to an overview of our cash flows or other financial highlights for the second quarter (sic) [ third quarter ]. We continue to do an excellent job of generating cash with third quarter operating cash flow of $450 million. We contributed $50 million to our U.S. pension plans in the quarter. Capital expenditures totaled $141 million. We continue to manage the pace of capital spending with the current economic environment while maintaining growth investments and continue to expect full year capital expenditures to be between $600 million and $625 million. 
Free cash flow for the quarter was a strong $309 million. And during the quarter, we reduced net debt by over $160 million, paid our second quarter dividend of $68 million and repurchased $75 million of our shares. Through 9 months of 2016, we have reduced debt by $400 million and returned almost $325 million to our stockholders. 
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was just over 21% as we are benefiting from foreign tax credits and other positive tax attributes. We expect our full year tax rate will be between 22% and 23%, which is better than previous expectations, reflecting the continued benefits of our improved -- improvement in business operations. We continue to look for every opportunity to reduce costs, including taxes, from both an earnings and cash flow standpoint. This quarter was another great example of our tax team finding such opportunities, including amending previously filed tax returns.  And lastly, we remain on track to generate more than $900 million of free cash flow for this year, which is a very strong performance in the current environment. 
With that, I'll turn it back over to Mark."

And we acquired these specialty companies at reasonable valuations with very attractive synergies that we've delivered. Organically, we have grown our volume and, more importantly, upgraded our mix. This is both within our heritage businesses and within the acquired businesses through great efforts in our innovation programs and through our commercial excellence. 
As a result of these efforts, you can see a very different story from who we were before versus today. We have improved the earnings mix across segments significantly. In 2010, Fibers and Chemical Intermediates were roughly 60% of the corporate earnings. Today, that percentage is closer to 30%. For 2016, we expect that the combination of Advanced Materials and Additives & Functional Products will represent approximately 70% of our earnings. And even in this environment, our EPS CAGR will still be roughly 11% from 2010 to '16. 
We also dramatically improved our free cash flow, almost tripling it from 2010 to 2016. Both improvements in our core businesses and adding the strong free cash flow generation from our acquisitions have substantially upgraded the quality of our portfolio. And we are still investing capital to deliver long-term growth in our specialty businesses while we generate one of the strongest free cash flows in this industry. 
On Slide 11, I'll discuss our 2016 outlook. We're doing a great job of executing our strategy in a challenging global business environment. Strong growth of high-value, innovative products continue as we benefit from leading positions in our attractive niche markets. We're seeing the benefits of scale and integration translating to growth in earnings, and we continue to invest in innovation and product development so that we can sustain our momentum into the coming years. We're also seeing the benefit of acquisition synergies in both costs and revenue. 
At the same time, we're achieving our cost-reduction goals. I can't say enough about how -- our Eastman employees globally who made this possible. As I mentioned earlier, productivity is in the DNA of Eastman, and I remain very confident we will achieve our cost-reduction targets for 2017. In addition, we are using all lines of the income statement to support our performance this year, including lower tax rates. All these actions are helping to offset the challenges from low oil, sluggish global GDP growth and the challenges we face in Fibers. 
Putting all this together, our outlook for adjusted full year 2016 earnings per share has improved to between $6.70 and $6.80, which I consider to be a solid result given our challenges. We also continue to expect strong free cash flow this year above $900 million. And we are creating value for our stakeholders with our balanced and disciplined allocation of this cash, increasing our dividend, increasing share repurchases and continued delevering. 
With this momentum in mind, I'll make a few comments about 2017. On the last call, I indicated we have confidence that we can get back on track for EPS growth in the 8% to 12% range in 2017, and we continue to be confident. As we look at it, we expect growth and innovation-driven mix improvement in Advanced Materials and Functional Products cost-reduction actions to contribute about $0.50 per share, the net of propane and currency hedges continued roll off in 2017 to contribute about $0.30 per share, an increase in the level of share repurchases while maintaining a balanced approach with deleveraging and continuing to use all of the lines of the income statement to contribute to EPS growth. These would more than offset the roughly $0.30 per share headwind from Fibers and the preproduction expenses from our new specialty plants. The combination of these factors will get us to EPS growth in the 8% to 12% range. 
I would also note that we don't need the world to get much better to achieve this growth. And if things get better, there is upside. We'll talk to more -- more to you about the outlook for 2017 in our fourth quarter call in January, but I believe it's important now for you to understand why we are confident about delivering strong earnings growth and strong free cash flow in 2017. 
This has been a tough year, and I'm proud of our employees around the world who have maintained focus and positioned us for growth going forward. I'm confident that 2017 will be a better year for Eastman. Most importantly, I believe that we are building one of the world's leading specialty companies to deliver long-term sustainable growth in a world where we -- where you need to create your own growth. 
With that, I'll turn it back over to Greg."

As Mark highlighted earlier and if I could, Eastman has one of the best portfolios, I think, that can generate cash in the industry. And you're seeing that in our results, and also, you'll see that next year. We do expect higher free cash flows next",277,"Yes. As Mark highlighted earlier and if I could, Eastman has one of the best portfolios, I think, that can generate cash in the industry. And you're seeing that in our results, and also, you'll see that next year. We do expect higher free cash flows next year as we see operating earnings growth as well as we'll see a modest decline in our CapEx. A couple of factors to think about when you -- when I'm  looking at 2017 cash flows is we'll be watching what kind of raw material environment we're facing. If we expect higher raws, as you know, that's going to give us some challenges in working capital that we'll try to offset. I also am expecting some higher cash taxes next year as we have now fully utilized the NOLs as part of the Solutia transaction as well as there's a phaseout of bonus depreciation for manufacturers like Eastman. So putting it all together though, we're going to generate over free -- free cash flow over $900 million. With the earnings outlook that Mark talked about, I won't be surprised if we see free cash flow approaching $1 billion. The allocation, what you'll see is still a balance across the different buckets that we have. You know our disciplined and balanced approach to capital allocation. But what you'll see is some more balanced approach to deleveraging and share repurchases with that free cash flow. So if you think about deleveraging, it was the predominant use of cash flow these last couple of years. That will moderate to be more balanced. And so you'll see share repurchase probably in excess of $300 million."

That put pressure across the globe and played out as we expected in our second quarter call. We saw that our competitors, especially Asians, setting price on a lot of these products on a global basis. We're starting to hit their cost positions. And as oil strengthened and their raw material costs, who are often -- I mean, purchased propylene and ethylene was going up, they would face pressure to increase prices, and that's what we're seeing. So it's very encouraging to actually see prices go up for once. It's been a long time. We do expect that momentum to continue as we go through the fourth quarter and carry into next year. But obviously, that will depend a bit on the raw material environment, so we'll have to see where oil and olefin prices go. But we're happy to see the change in direction and some traction right now."

So -- and the growth rates in there largely has just been fantastic, so we need to get that plant up to keep our growth. In regards to Advanced Materials, they're just having a phenomenal year like they had a phenomenal year last year, and it's really proof of our strategy we have been talking about for the last 5 years. We said we're going to drive growth through innovation, and that's what we're doing. And Tritan and heads-up display and acoustic interlayers and our performance films business, all delivering double-digit growth and driving not just the sort of overall volume growth but the mix upgrade with all those products growing at such high rates with above-segment and above-company average margins. So it's just a good story. It's really -- very little of it is a raw material tailwind in what's driving the results, which gives us confidence that it will sustain going forward. And obviously, the third quarter was a quarter where everything just ran really well. We had good volume, good mix, the plants ran incredibly well. One of the challenges in this kind of businesses, where you're making such a physical product, is you have yield and quality issues, and we just had a really clean quarter in how we ran the plants."

So first of all, this portfolio is a great set of portfolio -- of specialty businesses, tremendous additives that add a lot of functionality across our customers in coatings, tires, adhesives, in animal nutrition, crop, et cetera. It's just a great",595,"Sure. So first of all, this portfolio is a great set of portfolio -- of specialty businesses, tremendous additives that add a lot of functionality across our customers in coatings, tires, adhesives, in animal nutrition, crop, et cetera. It's just a great business of unique additives. So we view it as a business that will continue to grow. As you look at the pricing, which I think is the key question, and how it's come off, prices have really stabilized since the second quarter. So they -- we did a great job of holding on to raw material value in the beginning of last year, started giving some of them back in third quarter but really started giving it back in the fourth quarter and the first quarter of this year as we decided to share value with our customers. But those prices have stabilized, and we really didn't have much sequential decline in prices at all from second quarter into the third quarter of this year. And we expect the same sort of stability as we go into the fourth quarter. And you'll see that as -- even on a year-over-year basis in January as you see the trends in the fourth quarter. So that feels very stable to us and appropriate. As -- and we actually expect prices probably to start moving up in the coatings area, especially on the olefin-related products. The specialties are a little slower on prices on the way down. They're also slower on the way up. So Chemical Intermediates has already started to move on the pricing front, and we expect, as we go into next year, those prices on the specialty-related products will also start to move up with those -- with these current market conditions. So that all feels directionally correct to me. I think the important point is how you sustain these margins and continue to deliver growth over the long term. It's easy to hold on to prices when raw has dropped. But if you do that too aggressively and not share some with your customers, you really create a problem with those customers being engaged in working with you on any future innovation. And I think we've struck the right balance here, and we're seeing that in the proof of our innovation successes. We're just having tremendous success throughout the AFP portfolio with innovation. Our polyester coatings is doing tremendously well. We talked to you about that in the first quarter call, and we've gone from 3 to 10 customers aggressively working with us on how to commercialize that product and take it to market. We're seeing great success in the tire resins that I just told you about. We're seeing great success in Aerafin olefin products that I told you about in the second quarter call that go with the adhesive resins. We continue to see great traction in our loader coal assets. And so across the portfolio, you're seeing a lot of innovation, a lot of traction. And as I said before, this is a little bit slower in getting started than Advanced Materials, but as you look at the next 3 years, you're going to see all these innovation programs driving growth and mix improvement here, just like what we're doing in Advanced Materials. So a lot is -- we're proving, across the board, we can deliver growth and innovation. We can create our own growth. We're not waiting for the economy to get better. And that's the story you're going to see us deliver over the next 3 years."

So I'll try and be sort of brief on it now. Bottom line is you had a situation where the demand situations weakened across the globe, specifically the imports in China, and that's created pressure on pricing. And what we're seeing right now is that pricing pressure play out into the 2017 time frame. Our objective is doing what we can to sort of keep the business stable. That's been our objective from the beginning. We took capacity out in the U.K. as we added capacity in China, and we also exited some flake capacity as well. On the pricing front, we have attempted to be as stable as we can be on the pricing. Unfortunately, we got pushed pretty aggressively on some of our competitors trying to take share from us outside of China, and all we're trying to do is defend our share and keep it stable outside of China. We're not trying to recover lost imports in China by taking share outside of China. And we think the best way to do that is to get multiyear contracts with volume and price in place with many of our large customers, which will provide stability actually from '17 into '18 and '19 as we provide security of supply to our customers but also provide security of demand to us. So I think that those actions are actually going to put us in the right direction as far as the things that we can do to control the outcome in this industry and our performance, and we'll just have to see how the rest of it plays out."

Outside of China, we don't expect any changes in trends, where the markets continue to decline sort of 1% to 2% a year, which has been true for a long time. Inside China, demand in China is a complicated and opaque question. Right now, we have seen some changes in production rate, cigarette production, where they've taken it down 6% to 7%, which is great because, I think, they're just destocking primarily with those actions. You have to remember that production rates are not equal to primary consumption rates. We do expect  -- they had trouble destocking cigarettes in '15 and '16 -- I'm sorry, '15 and '14. So I think that we're actually encouraged to see them taking actions to finally address that issue like they're already addressing at the tow inventory level as well. So in some ways, I think there's progress to put this behind us. Primary demand in China..."

So in Advanced Materials, which is very OEM-driven, we are looking at that. What's been great about our success to date is we're creating a lot of our own earnings growth through mix upgrade and double-digit growth in things like acoustics and heads-up displays as well as a new channel strategy in performance films, where we're growing the whole size of the market and our share of it. So even in a slow automotive growth world, we can still deliver growth. It may not be as high as this year but still deliver growth. So I feel good about where we are there. And we see tremendous innovation opportunities continuing out there to add more functionality to the windows as we work with our customers in the next generation of acoustics and heads-up displays as well as other functionalities. So it's just a very robust opportunity for growth. On the Additives & Functional Products side, when it comes to coatings and tires, we're more balanced there. That's more of a balanced market from refinish or replacement tires than OEM. And so there, we're less exposed to sort of OEM trend rates as we are in Advanced Materials. So I think that, again, we'll have some solid growth there, and I'm not really worried about the OEM trend rates being a material issue."

One of the great things about this business is it's a consumer products business, where we have direct access to consumers and deliver a wide range of products and we have the best products in the industry. But when we picked up Solutia, their strategy of how to go to market and how to even expand the market was not that sophisticated. And so we spent a lot of time rethinking our channel strategies and figuring out how to not just go through aftermarket retail shops but develop much more compelling programs through auto dealers in the U.S., which allows us to access an entirely new set of customers that don't show up in an aftermarket tin shop, and have been incredibly successful in expanding the market and also improving the quality of how we go to market. Same thing true in China. We were doing quite well aftermarket, not as successful in the auto dealerships and had significantly improved our channel strategy to go through the auto dealerships, which is a very important channel in China, and we're seeing great success. And it's not just going to those channels but how we take the products to market, how we're positioning our value proposition versus our competitors in a more compelling way.

So on the cost curve side, there is certainly high- and low-cost assets in the integrated flake and tow components of the Fibers business. As I've said in the past, we are the lowest-cost producer. We're backward integrating coal. We have the largest scale, and we're actually now down to our largest, most integrated asset as our only asset here in Tennessee at flake, which is matched to our tow capacity here in Tennessee with -- combined with our Korean tow capacity and China. So we're very happy about our cost position. Our competitors are based on either purchased methanol or anhydride in some cases, so some of these assets are certainly exposed to much higher cost position. They picked up some advantage with lower oil today versus where they were. As oil goes up, that cost position is going to become less competitive relative to where we are. There are a number of high-cost assets out there that can be shut down by competitors, if they ever choose to do so, to improve their cost position to serve their customers, and we're going to have to see what they choose to do. As the market stabilizes, as we put in stability through these multiyear contracts, it's -- it becomes more challenging to figure out how you're going to grow earnings growth, and hopefully, they'll look at those options."

That's still what we're anticipating. Over the next couple of years, I'm looking at maybe roughly $75 million of pension contributions over the next couple of years. After that point, you kind of have to really look at what discount rates have done and how the returns have come in, whether that number needs to increase to $100 million or maybe come down to $50 million. But that kind of gives you a band of what pension contributions could be like over the next 3 to 5 years. On capital, when you got the kind of assets we have, I guess, every 3 to 5 years, there's going to be turnarounds. What we have -- we do and we have a great team that does it, we try to manage the capital -- maintenance spend and capital spend we have each year. Part of it's not only cash flow, part of it's just resources. So yes, we're going to have some capital spend over these years. But some of the unique items that we've had these last few years, like the -- some of the assets that we had to build in Texas as well as conversions to -- from natural -- coal to natural gas. There's a little bit ahead of us, but most of it's done. So I suspect our maintenance capital will be in that $300 million to $350 million range over that 5-year time period, and then we'll have growth capital on top of it to support all the attractive innovation programs that Mark talked about.

Something to keep in mind about Eastman is that we have a 90-year history of innovating when it comes to cellulosics. We started out with film, we then went into yarn, then we went into tow, then we went into plastics for things like tool handles and sunglass frames and then we took cellulosic technology into coating additives, then TVs and now into tires as another new emerging application. We know how to innovate in this space. We've done a lot more of this innovation than anyone else has ever done in creating new markets, just like we've done in polyesters, starting with polyester fiber to PET to a wide range of polyester applications. So we know how to do this. And so we're making great progress.

But I don't think there's any big, large changes that we need to make, both on the acquisition side or on significant divestiture side. We're going to continue to look at these opportunities, like the ethylene, as ways to take out pockets of volatility, but our focus and our strategy is about innovation and growth. We're driving innovation and growth. We're managing costs aggressively. We're going to continue to create value in a capital-efficient way because we're doing mix upgrades of existing assets in how we drive this innovation. We're going to generate a lot of free cash flow and buy back stock and increase the dividend and improve our balance sheet. I think it's a compelling story as it is."

I'll begin my comments by reviewing our strategic highlights for the third quarter and the first 9 months of 2016. We continue to upgrade the quality of our product mix by growing high-margin specialty product lines, a key component of our winning strategy. And I have increasing confidence about the breadth and depth of our innovation portfolio, which is significantly more compelling today than it was 3 years ago. 
One of our recent innovation successes is within our tire resins platform in the Additives & Functional Products segment. Tire manufacturers face a significant challenge in improving fuel efficiency while maintaining traction safety. Eastman is quickly -- uniquely qualified to meet this challenge. We are the world leader in resin technology chemistry, and I am pleased to report that we have gained commercial approval with a major tire producer for 2 new proprietary products and are in the process of sampling a full range of resins with selected innovation partners. 
So far this year, the tire resins platform has delivered approximately 20% volume growth over 2015, with margins above the corporate average. This is a great example of revenue synergy from Solutia acquisition, combining a strong market-connected application development capability with our resin technology platform. 
Moving next to our capital projects to support our specialty growth. We are leveraging our unique innovation capabilities and investing for long-term growth where it counts. From Tritan to interlayers to Crystex, we're the world leader in both process technology and product offerings and are winning through our innovation platforms. We're walking the talk with our investments in growth in specialty products and seeing the results. 
We are, therefore, driving hard to complete these capital projects to support our growth. All 3 of these projects are on target to finish on or well below budget, which demonstrates our competitive advantage through best-in-class engineering, construction and operational capabilities. In a slow-growth world, we are creating our own growth and investing capital smartly. 
We also are proving we can drive innovation while managing costs aggressively. We remain well on track with our cost-reduction efforts to deliver $100 million to the bottom line in 2016 without sacrificing our investment in long-term growth initiatives. These efforts include implementation of hundreds of projects across our global footprint. 
One example is the successful initiative recently completed by our process control team. We were able to utilize a plant loader program associated with our larger -- largest cracker in Longview, Texas. The initiative increased feed efficiency, saving almost $2 million in costs. This is a great example of how our significant scale and integration in our 2 largest sites provide us a unique competitive advantage, where we have dedicated experts in a wide range of specialized operational disciplines. 
We also leverage these experts across the globe to optimize performance in the smaller manufacturing sites from our acquisitions to our sites we've had for a long time. In addition, we remain on track to execute our second cost-reduction initiative this quarter, which we expect will deliver an additional $100 million to the bottom line in 2017. 
Productivity is a core capability at Eastman. Over the past 5 years, we removed almost $700 million in costs to offset inflation and deliver results to the bottom line while maintaining our commitment to quality, reliability and safety. We are continuing to innovate throughout our enterprise, on product development and how we think about manufacturing and our approach to productivity across all our functions. All of these areas will contribute to our strong growth going forward. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Curt to discuss corporate and segment results."

Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with our third quarter results on Slide 4. Overall sales revenue decreased primarily due to lower selling prices and lower Fibers sales volumes more than offsetting higher sales volume in all othe",1205,"Good. Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with our third quarter results on Slide 4. Overall sales revenue decreased primarily due to lower selling prices and lower Fibers sales volumes more than offsetting higher sales volume in all other segments. 
Our operating earnings declined as an increase in Advanced Materials was more than offset by declines in the other segments. Despite the business -- challenging business environment, our operating margin was above 18%. Adjusted earnings per share was $1.86 for the quarter as actions we took led to both operating earnings and taxes coming in better than expected. 
Moving next to the segment results and starting with Advanced Materials on Slide 5, which delivered another quarter of impressive growth driven by our innovation platforms. Third quarter sales revenue increased due to double-digit volume growth of premium products. Eastman Tritan copolyester once again had a record volume quarter as we continue to lead in consumer durables and housewares. 
Saflex acoustic interlayers continued their strong growth this year as applications have expanded to more windows -- from the windows to the side windows and the sunroof as well as expanded to more models. And performance film volumes were strong this quarter due to an excellent new channel strategy in North America and China. The volume and mix improvement was partially offset by lower selling prices, primarily for core copolyesters attributed to lower raw material costs. 
Operating earnings were up 22% or $25 million, primarily driven by higher sales volume and improved product mix of premium products as well as lower unit costs due to higher capacity utilization. Operating margins for the quarter increased by approximately 350 basis points to over 22%. 
As we look ahead to the fourth quarter, we are expecting normal seasonal decline in volume. With that said, we expect Advanced Materials will deliver low double-digit earnings growth for the full year of 2016 and anticipate this business can deliver -- continue to deliver strong growth again in 2017. We are delivering compelling proof of our ability to drive growth through innovation even in a difficult macro environment. 
Now to Additives & Functional Products on Slide 6. Sales revenue declined primarily due to lower selling prices attributed to lower raw material costs, partially offset by higher sales volume. Operating earnings decreased primarily due to lower selling prices, more than offsetting lower raw material costs and higher sales volume. And the operating margin remained solid at over 21%. For full year 2016, we continue to expect higher volumes and expect prices to have mostly stabilized. 
One other item that I thought would be useful as you analyze this segment this year. We have been operating under a new organizational structure for a couple of quarters now, which, if you recall, was some major product moves between Additives & Functional Products and Chemical Intermediates. As we analyze how resources and costs are flowing, it's coming out a little different than expected in our historical recast. 
As you consider year-over-year comps, about $20 million of more costs are flowing through Additives & Functional Products in 2016 than what was reflected in the $660 million recasted view for them in 2015 while approximately $20 million less is flowing to Chemical Intermediates. Putting it all together, Additives & Functional Products remains on track with our previous expectations for full year earnings to be somewhat down, which would be a solid result in the current business climate. And as pricing stabilizes, we expect solid earnings growth next year through market volume growth and our innovation effort. 
Now to Fibers on Slide 7. Third quarter revenue, volume and earnings were in line with our expectations. Sales revenue decreased primarily due to lower sales volume and lower selling prices particularly for acetate tow. Lower acetate tow sales volume was primarily due to reduced sales into China. Operating earnings declined due to lower sales volume. The lower selling prices were offset by recent actions we took to reduce raw material costs and actions to reduce operating costs. As a result, operating margins held at approximately 32%. 
Our full year outlook has not changed as we continue to expect second half earnings to be similar to first half, which includes tow volumes being down approximately 10% for the year. I'll also mention that we continued contract negotiations for 2017 and anticipate earnings for the segment to be down roughly 20% next year. We remain confident in our long-term position and strongly believe that Fibers will continue to be a valuable business for Eastman going forward. 
I'll finish up the segment review with Chemical Intermediates on Slide 8. Sales revenue decreased due to lower selling prices. We attributed these lower selling prices to continued competitive pressures due to lower oil prices and weak demand in Asia Pacific. Operating earnings declined primarily due to lower selling prices, more than offsetting lower raw material and energy costs and lower hedge costs. During the quarter, we saw some modest improvement in the overall business environment impacting Chemical Intermediates and now expecting earnings in the back half of the year to be slightly higher than the first half, and we expect this improvement to continue into next year. 
Lastly, I'll give you a quick update on our process for divesting our excess ethylene capacity and potentially certain commodity olefin product lines. We continue our discussions with potential partners -- or parties and now anticipate this process will carry into next year, though I'll add that executing a transaction in this current environment remains challenging. 
On Slide 9, I'll transition to an overview of our cash flows or other financial highlights for the second quarter (sic) [ third quarter ]. We continue to do an excellent job of generating cash with third quarter operating cash flow of $450 million. We contributed $50 million to our U.S. pension plans in the quarter. Capital expenditures totaled $141 million. We continue to manage the pace of capital spending with the current economic environment while maintaining growth investments and continue to expect full year capital expenditures to be between $600 million and $625 million. 
Free cash flow for the quarter was a strong $309 million. And during the quarter, we reduced net debt by over $160 million, paid our second quarter dividend of $68 million and repurchased $75 million of our shares. Through 9 months of 2016, we have reduced debt by $400 million and returned almost $325 million to our stockholders. 
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was just over 21% as we are benefiting from foreign tax credits and other positive tax attributes. We expect our full year tax rate will be between 22% and 23%, which is better than previous expectations, reflecting the continued benefits of our improved -- improvement in business operations. We continue to look for every opportunity to reduce costs, including taxes, from both an earnings and cash flow standpoint. This quarter was another great example of our tax team finding such opportunities, including amending previously-filed tax returns.  And lastly, we remain on track to generate more than $900 million of free cash flow for this year, which is a very strong performance in the current environment. 
With that, I'll turn it back over to Mark."

On Page 10, we've talked a lot about the benefits of our portfolio transformation and how that contributes to more consistent earnings growth and strong free cash flow generation. You can see that our portfolio transformation has been a key element to delivering strong earnings for quite some time. 
Over the last 6 years, we have taken decisive actions to improve our portfolio through acquiring attractive specialty businesses and divesting underperforming businesses. And we acquired these specialty companies at reasonable valuations with very attractive synergies that we've delivered. Organically, we have grown our volume and, more importantly, upgraded our mix. This is both within our heritage businesses and within the acquired businesses through great efforts in our innovation programs and through our commercial excellence. 
As a result of these efforts, you can see a very different story from who we were before versus today. We have improved the earnings mix across segments significantly. In 2010, Fibers and Chemical Intermediates were roughly 60% of the corporate earnings. Today, that percentage is closer to 30%. For 2016, we expect that the combination of Advanced Materials and Additives & Functional Products will represent approximately 70% of our earnings. And even in this environment, our EPS CAGR will still be roughly 11% from 2010 to '16. 
We also dramatically improved our free cash flow, almost tripling it from 2010 to 2016. Both improvements in our core businesses and adding the strong free cash flow generation from our acquisitions have substantially upgraded the quality of our portfolio. And we are still investing capital to deliver long-term growth in our specialty businesses while we generate one of the strongest free cash flows in this industry. 
On Slide 11, I'll discuss our 2016 outlook. We're doing a great job of executing our strategy in a challenging global business environment. Strong growth of high-value, innovative products continue as we benefit from leading positions in our attractive niche markets. We're seeing the benefits of scale and integration translating to growth in earnings, and we continue to invest in innovation and product development so that we can sustain our momentum into the coming years. We're also seeing the benefit of acquisition synergies in both costs and revenue. 
At the same time, we're achieving our cost-reduction goals. I can't say enough about how -- our Eastman employees globally who made this possible. As I mentioned earlier, productivity is in the DNA of Eastman, and I remain very confident we will achieve our cost-reduction targets for 2017. In addition, we are using all lines of the income statement to support our performance this year, including lower tax rates. All of these actions are helping to offset the challenges from low oil, sluggish global GDP growth and the challenges we face in Fibers. 
Putting all this together, our outlook for adjusted full year 2016 earnings per share has improved to between $6.70 and $6.80, which I consider to be a solid result given our challenges. We also continue to expect strong free cash flow this year above $900 million. And we are creating value for our stakeholders with our balanced and disciplined allocation of this cash, increasing our dividend, increasing share repurchases and continued delevering. 
With this momentum in mind, I'll make a few comments about 2017. On the last call, I indicated we have confidence that we can get back on track for EPS growth in the 8% to 12% range in 2017, and we continue to be confident. As we look at it, we expect growth and innovation-driven mix improvement in Advanced Materials and Functional Products; cost-reduction actions contribute about $0.50 per share; the net of propane and currency hedges continue to roll off in 2017 to contribute about $0.30 per share; an increase in the level of share repurchases while maintaining a balanced approach with deleveraging; and continuing to use all of the lines of the income statement to contribute to EPS growth. These would more than offset the roughly $0.30 per share headwind from Fibers and the preproduction expenses from our new specialty plants. The combination of these factors will get us to EPS growth in the 8% to 12% range. 
I would also note that we don't need the world to get much better to achieve this growth. And if things get better, there is upside. We'll talk to more -- more to you about the outlook for 2017 in our fourth quarter call in January, but I believe it's important now for you to understand why we are confident about delivering strong earnings growth and strong free cash flow in 2017. 
This has been a tough year, and I'm proud of our employees around the world who have maintained focus and positioned us for growth going forward. I'm confident that 2017 will be a better year for Eastman. Most importantly, I believe that we are building one of the world's leading specialty companies to deliver long-term sustainable growth in a world where we -- where you need to create your own growth. 
With that, I'll turn it back over to Greg."

As Mark highlighted earlier and if I could, Eastman has one of the best portfolios, I think, that can generate cash in the industry. And you're seeing that in our results, and quite obviously, you'll see that next year. We do expect higher free cash",278,"Yes. As Mark highlighted earlier and if I could, Eastman has one of the best portfolios, I think, that can generate cash in the industry. And you're seeing that in our results, and quite obviously, you'll see that next year. We do expect higher free cash flows next year as we see operating earnings grow, as well as we'll see a modest decline in our CapEx. A couple of factors to think about when you -- when I'm looking at 2017 cash flows is we'll be watching what kind of raw material environment we're facing. If we expect higher raws, as you know, that's going to give us some challenges in working capital that we'll try to offset. I also am expecting some higher cash taxes next year as we have now fully utilized the NOLs as part of the Solutia transaction as well as there's a phaseout of bonus depreciation for manufacturers like Eastman. So putting it all together though, we're going to generate over free -- free cash flow over $900 million. With the earnings outlook that Mark talked about, I wouldn't be surprised if we see free cash flow approaching $1 billion. The allocation, what you'll see is still a balance across the different buckets that we have. You know our disciplined and balanced approach to capital allocation. But what you'll see is some more balanced approach to deleveraging and share repurchases with that free cash flow. So if you think about deleveraging, it was the predominant use of cash flow these last couple of years. That will moderate to be more balanced. And so you'll see share repurchase probably in excess of $300 million."

We are seeing a traction in getting price increases in September and into October as the propylene and ethylene markets have strengthened. That put pressure across the globe and played out as we expected in our second quarter call. We saw that our competitors, especially Asians, setting price on a lot of these products on a global basis, were starting to hit their cost positions. And as oil strengthened and their raw material costs, who are often -- I mean, purchase propylene and ethylene was going up, they would face pressure to increase prices, and that's what we're seeing. So it's very encouraging to actually see prices go up for once. It's been a long time. We do expect that momentum to continue as we go through the fourth quarter and carry into next year. But obviously, that will depend a bit on the raw material environment, so we'll have to see where oil and olefin prices go. But we're happy to see the change in direction and some traction right now."

So -- and the growth rates in there largely [ph] has just been fantastic, so we need to get that plant up to keep our growth. In regards to Advanced Materials, they're just having a phenomenal year like they had a phenomenal year last year, and it's really proof of our strategy we have been talking about for the last 5 years. We said we're going to drive growth through innovation, and that's what we're doing. In Tritan and heads-up display and acoustic interlayers and our performance films business, all delivering double-digit growth and driving not just the sort of overall volume growth but the mix upgrade with all those products growing at such high rates with above-segment and above-company average margins. So it's just a good story. It's really -- very little of it is a raw material tailwind in what's driving the results, which gives us confidence that it will sustain going forward. And obviously, third quarter was a quarter where everything just ran really well. We had good volume, good mix, the plants ran incredibly well. One of the challenges in these kind of businesses, where you're making such a physical product, is you have yield and quality issues, and we just had a really clean quarter in how we ran the plants."

So first of all, this portfolio is a great set of portfolio -- of specialty businesses, tremendous additives that add a lot of functionality across our customers in coatings, tires, adhesives, and animal nutrition, crop, et cetera.

So first of all, this portfolio is a great set of portfolio -- of specialty businesses, tremendous additives that add a lot of functionality across our customers in coatings, tires, adhesives, and animal nutrition, crop, et cetera. It's just a great business of unique additives. So we view it as a business that will continue to grow. As you look at the pricing, which I think is the key question, and how it's come off, prices have really stabilized since the second quarter. So they -- we did a great job of holding on to raw material value in the beginning of last year, started giving some of it back in third quarter but really started giving it back in the fourth quarter and the first quarter of this year as we decided to share value with our customers. But those prices have stabilized, and we really didn't have much sequential decline in prices at all from second quarter into the third quarter of this year. And we expect the same sort of stability as we go into the fourth quarter. And you'll see that as -- even on a year-over-year basis in January as you see the trends in the fourth quarter. So that feels very stable to us and appropriate. As -- and we actually expect prices probably to start moving up in the coatings area, especially on the olefin-related products. The specialties are a little slower on prices on the way down. They're also slower on the way up. So Chemical Intermediates has already started to move on the pricing front, and we expect, as we go into next year, those prices on the specialty-related products will also start to move up with those -- with these current market conditions. So that all feels directionally correct to me. I think the important point is how you sustain these margins and continue to deliver growth over the long term. It's easy to hold on to prices when raws drop. But if you do that too aggressively and not share some of it with your customers, you really create a problem with those customers being engaged in working with you on any future innovation. And I think we've struck the right balance here, and we're seeing that in the proof of our innovation successes. We're just having tremendous success throughout the AFP portfolio with innovation. Our polyester coatings is doing tremendously well. We talked to you about that in the first quarter call, and we've gone from 3 to 10 customers aggressively working with us on how to commercialize that product and take it to market. We're seeing great success in the tire resins that I just told you about. We're seeing great success in the Aerafin olefin products that I told you about in the second quarter call that go with the adhesive resins. We continue to see great traction in our loader coal assets. And so across the portfolio, you're seeing a lot of innovation, a lot of traction. And as I said before, this is a little bit slower in getting started than Advanced Materials, but as you look at the next 3 years, you're going to see all these innovation programs driving growth and mix improvement here, just like what we're doing in Advanced Materials. So the love is [ph] -- we're proving, across the board, we can deliver growth and innovation. We can create our own growth. We're not waiting for the economy to get better. And that's the story you're going to see us deliver over the next 3 years."

So I'll try and be sort of brief on it now. Bottom line is you had a situation where the demand situation weakened across the globe, specifically the imports in China, and that's created pressure on pricing. And what we're seeing right now is that pricing pressure play out into the 2017 time frame. Our objective is doing what we can to sort of keep the business stable. That's been our objective from the beginning. We took capacity out in the U.K. as we added capacity in China, and we also exited some flake capacity as well. On the pricing front, we have attempted to be as stable as we can be on the pricing. Unfortunately, we got pushed pretty aggressively on some of our competitors trying to take share from us outside of China, and all we're trying to do is defend our share and keep it stable outside of China. We're not trying to recover lost imports in China by taking share outside of China. And we think the best way to do that is to get multiyear contracts on volume and price in place with many of our large customers, which will provide stability actually from '17 into '18 and '19 as we provide security of supply to our customers but also provide security of demand to us. So I think that those actions are actually going to put us in the right direction as far as the things that we can do to control the outcome in this industry and our performance, and we'll just have to see how the rest of it plays out."

So in Advanced Materials, which is very OEM-driven, we are looking at that. What's been great about our success to date is we're creating a lot of our own earnings growth through mix upgrade and double-digit growth in things like acoustics and heads-up display as well as a new channel strategy in performance films, where we're growing the whole size of the market and our share of it. So even in a slow automotive growth world, we can still deliver growth. It may not be as high as this year but still deliver growth. So I feel good about where we are there. And we see tremendous innovation opportunities continuing out there to add more functionality to the windows as we work with our customers in next generation of acoustics and heads-up display as well as other functionality. So it's just a very robust opportunity for growth. On the Additives & Functional Products side, when it comes to coatings and tires, we're more balanced through that. It's more of a balanced market from refinish or replacement tires than OEM. And so there, we're less exposed to sort of OEM trend rates as we are in Advanced Materials. So I think that, again, we'll have some solid growth there, and I'm not really worried about the OEM trend rates being a material issue."

One of the great things about this business is it's a consumer products business, where we have direct access to consumers and deliver a wide range of products and we have the best products in the industry. But when we picked up Solutia, their strategy of how to go to market and how to even expand the market was not that sophisticated. And so we spent a lot of time rethinking our channel strategies and figuring out how to not just go through aftermarket retail shops but develop much more compelling programs through auto dealers in the U.S., which allows us to access an entirely new set of customers that don't show up in an aftermarket tin shop, and have been incredibly successful in expanding the market and also improving the quality of how we go to market. Same thing true in China. We were doing quite well aftermarket, not as successful in the auto dealerships and had significantly improved our channel strategy to go through the auto dealerships, which is a very important channel in China, and we're seeing great success. And it's not just going to those channels but how we take the products to market, how we're positioning our value proposition versus our competitors in a more compelling way.

So we're very happy about our cost position. Our competitors are based on either purchased methanol or anhydride in some cases, so some of these assets are certainly exposed to much higher cost position. They picked up some advantage with lower oil today versus where they were. As oil goes up, that cost position is going to become less competitive relative to where we are. There are a number of high-cost assets out there that can be shut down by competitors, if they ever choose to do so, to improve their cost position to serve their customers, and we're going to have to see what they choose to do. As the market stabilizes, as we put in stability through these multiyear contracts, it's -- it becomes more challenging to figure out how you're going to grow earnings growth, and hopefully, they'll look at those options."

That's still what we're anticipating. Over the next couple of years, I'm looking at maybe roughly $75 million of pension contributions over the next couple of years. After that point, you kind of have to really look at what discount rates have done and how the returns have come in, to whether that number needs to increase to $100 million or maybe come down to $50 million. But that kind of gives you a band of what pension contributions could be like over the next 3 years to 5 years. On capital, when you got the kind of assets we have, yes, every 3 years to 5 years, there's going to be turnarounds. What we have -- we do and we have a great team that does it, we try to manage to capital -- maintenance spend to capital spend we have each year. Part of it's not only cash flow, part of it's just resources. So yes, we're going to have some capital spend over these years. But some of the unique items that we've had these last few years, like the -- some of the assets that we had to build in Texas as well as conversions to -- from natural -- coal to natural gas. There's a little bit ahead of us yet, but most of it's done. So I suspect our maintenance capital will be in that $300 million to $350 million range over that 5-year time period, and then we'll have growth capital on top of it to support all the attractive innovation programs that Mark talked about.

We know how to innovate in this space. We've done a lot more of this innovation than anyone else has ever done in creating new markets, just like we've done in polyesters, starting with polyester fiber to PET to a wide range of polyester applications.

I'll begin my comments by reviewing our strategic highlights for the third quarter and the first 9 months of 2016. We continue to upgrade the quality of our product mix by growing high-margin specialty product lines, a key component of our winning strategy. And I have increasing confidence about the breadth and depth of our innovation portfolio, which is significantly more compelling today than it was 3 years ago. 
One of our recent innovation successes is within our tire resins platform in the Additives & Functional Products segment. Tire manufacturers face a significant challenge in improving fuel efficiency while maintaining traction safety. Eastman is quickly -- uniquely qualified to meet this challenge. We are the world leader in resin technology chemistry, and I am pleased to report that we have gained commercial approval with a major tire producer for 2 new proprietary products and are in the process of sampling a full range of resins with selected innovation partners. 
So far this year, the tire resins platform has delivered approximately 20% volume growth over 2015, with margins above the corporate average. This is a great example of revenue synergy from Solutia acquisition, combining a strong market-connected application development capability with our resin technology platform. 
Moving next to our capital projects to support our specialty growth. We are leveraging our unique innovation capabilities and investing for long-term growth where it counts. From Tritan to interlayers to Crystex, we're the world leader in both process technology and product offerings and are winning through our innovation platforms. We're walking the talk with our investments in growth in specialty products and seeing the results. 
We are, therefore, driving hard to complete these capital projects to support our growth. All 3 of these projects are on target to finish on or well below budget, which demonstrates our competitive advantage through best-in-class engineering, construction and operational capabilities. In a slow-growth world, we are creating our own growth and investing capital smartly. 
We also are proving we can drive innovation while managing costs aggressively. We remain well on track with our cost-reduction efforts to deliver $100 million to the bottom line in 2016 without sacrificing our investment in long-term growth initiatives. These efforts include implementation of hundreds of projects across our global footprint. 
One example is the successful initiative recently completed by our process control team. We were able to utilize a plant loader program associated with our larger -- largest cracker in Longview, Texas. The initiative increased feed efficiency, saving almost $2 million in costs. This is a great example of how our significant scale and integration in our 2 largest sites provide us a unique competitive advantage, where we have dedicated experts in a wide range of specialized operational disciplines. 
We also leverage these experts across the globe to optimize performance in the smaller manufacturing sites from our acquisitions to our sites we've had for a long time. In addition, we remain on track to execute our second cost-reduction initiative this quarter, which we expect will deliver an additional $100 million to the bottom line in 2017. 
Productivity is a core capability at Eastman. Over the past 5 years, we removed almost $700 million in costs to offset inflation and deliver results to the bottom line while maintaining our commitment to quality, reliability and safety. We are continuing to innovate throughout our enterprise, on product development and how we think about manufacturing and our approach to productivity across all our functions. All of these areas will contribute to our strong growth going forward. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Curt to discuss corporate and segment results."

Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with our third quarter results on Slide 4. Overall sales revenue decreased primarily due to lower selling prices and lower Fibers sales volumes more than offsetting higher sales volume in all othe",1205,"Good. Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with our third quarter results on Slide 4. Overall sales revenue decreased primarily due to lower selling prices and lower Fibers sales volumes more than offsetting higher sales volume in all other segments. 
Our operating earnings declined as an increase in Advanced Materials was more than offset by declines in the other segments. Despite the business -- challenging business environment, our operating margin was above 18%. Adjusted earnings per share was $1.86 for the quarter as actions we took led to both operating earnings and taxes coming in better than expected. 
Moving next to the segment results and starting with Advanced Materials on Slide 5, which delivered another quarter of impressive growth driven by our innovation platforms. Third quarter sales revenue increased due to double-digit volume growth of premium products. Eastman Tritan copolyester once again had a record volume quarter as we continue to lead in consumer durables and housewares. 
Saflex acoustic interlayers continued their strong growth this year as applications have expanded to more windows -- from the windows to the side windows and the sunroof as well as expanded to more models. And performance film volumes were strong this quarter due to an excellent new channel strategy in North America and China. The volume and mix improvement was partially offset by lower selling prices, primarily for core copolyesters attributed to lower raw material costs. 
Operating earnings were up 22% or $25 million, primarily driven by higher sales volume and improved product mix of premium products as well as lower unit costs due to higher capacity utilization. Operating margins for the quarter increased by approximately 350 basis points to over 22%. 
As we look ahead to the fourth quarter, we are expecting normal seasonal decline in volume. With that said, we expect Advanced Materials will deliver low double-digit earnings growth for the full year of 2016 and anticipate this business can deliver -- continue to deliver strong growth again in 2017. We are delivering compelling proof of our ability to drive growth through innovation even in a difficult macro environment. 
Now to Additives & Functional Products on Slide 6. Sales revenue declined primarily due to lower selling prices attributed to lower raw material costs, partially offset by higher sales volume. Operating earnings decreased primarily due to lower selling prices, more than offsetting lower raw material costs and higher sales volume. And the operating margin remained solid at over 21%. For full year 2016, we continue to expect higher volumes and expect prices to have mostly stabilized. 
One other item that I thought would be useful as you analyze this segment this year. We have been operating under a new organizational structure for a couple of quarters now, which, if you recall, was some major product moves between Additives & Functional Products and Chemical Intermediates. As we analyze how resources and costs are flowing, it's coming out a little different than expected in our historical recast. 
As you consider year-over-year comps, about $20 million of more costs are flowing through Additives & Functional Products in 2016 than what was reflected in the $660 million recasted view for them in 2015 while approximately $20 million less is flowing to Chemical Intermediates. Putting it all together, Additives & Functional Products remains on track with our previous expectations for full year earnings to be somewhat down, which would be a solid result in the current business climate. And as pricing stabilizes, we expect solid earnings growth next year through market volume growth and our innovation effort. 
Now to Fibers on Slide 7. Third quarter revenue, volume and earnings were in line with our expectations. Sales revenue decreased primarily due to lower sales volume and lower selling prices particularly for acetate tow. Lower acetate tow sales volume was primarily due to reduced sales into China. Operating earnings declined due to lower sales volume. The lower selling prices were offset by recent actions we took to reduce raw material costs and actions to reduce operating costs. As a result, operating margins held at approximately 32%. 
Our full year outlook has not changed as we continue to expect second half earnings to be similar to first half, which includes tow volumes being down approximately 10% for the year. I'll also mention that we continued contract negotiations for 2017 and anticipate earnings for the segment to be down roughly 20% next year. We remain confident in our long-term position and strongly believe that Fibers will continue to be a valuable business for Eastman going forward. 
I'll finish up the segment review with Chemical Intermediates on Slide 8. Sales revenue decreased due to lower selling prices. We attributed these lower selling prices to continued competitive pressures due to lower oil prices and weak demand in Asia Pacific. Operating earnings declined primarily due to lower selling prices, more than offsetting lower raw material and energy costs and lower hedge costs. During the quarter, we saw some modest improvement in the overall business environment impacting Chemical Intermediates and now expecting earnings in the back half of the year to be slightly higher than the first half, and we expect this improvement to continue into next year. 
Lastly, I'll give you a quick update on our process for divesting our excess ethylene capacity and potentially certain commodity olefin product lines. We continue our discussions with potential partners -- or parties and now anticipate this process will carry into next year, though I'll add that executing a transaction in this current environment remains challenging. 
On Slide 9, I'll transition to an overview of our cash flows or other financial highlights for the second quarter (sic) [ third quarter ]. We continue to do an excellent job of generating cash with third quarter operating cash flow of $450 million. We contributed $50 million to our U.S. pension plans in the quarter. Capital expenditures totaled $141 million. We continue to manage the pace of capital spending with the current economic environment while maintaining growth investments and continue to expect full year capital expenditures to be between $600 million and $625 million. 
Free cash flow for the quarter was a strong $309 million. And during the quarter, we reduced net debt by over $160 million, paid our second quarter dividend of $68 million and repurchased $75 million of our shares. Through 9 months of 2016, we have reduced debt by $400 million and returned almost $325 million to our stockholders. 
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was just over 21% as we are benefiting from foreign tax credits and other positive tax attributes. We expect our full year tax rate will be between 22% and 23%, which is better than previous expectations, reflecting the continued benefits of our improved -- improvement in business operations. We continue to look for every opportunity to reduce costs, including taxes, from both an earnings and cash flow standpoint. This quarter was another great example of our tax team finding such opportunities, including amending previously-filed tax returns.  And lastly, we remain on track to generate more than $900 million of free cash flow for this year, which is a very strong performance in the current environment. 
With that, I'll turn it back over to Mark."

On Page 10, we've talked a lot about the benefits of our portfolio transformation and how that contributes to more consistent earnings growth and strong free cash flow generation.

On Page 10, we've talked a lot about the benefits of our portfolio transformation and how that contributes to more consistent earnings growth and strong free cash flow generation. You can see that our portfolio transformation has been a key element to delivering strong earnings for quite some time. 
Over the last 6 years, we have taken decisive actions to improve our portfolio through acquiring attractive specialty businesses and divesting underperforming businesses. And we acquired these specialty companies at reasonable valuations with very attractive synergies that we've delivered. Organically, we have grown our volume and, more importantly, upgraded our mix. This is both within our heritage businesses and within the acquired businesses through great efforts in our innovation programs and through our commercial excellence. 
As a result of these efforts, you can see a very different story from who we were before versus today. We have improved the earnings mix across segments significantly. In 2010, Fibers and Chemical Intermediates were roughly 60% of the corporate earnings. Today, that percentage is closer to 30%. For 2016, we expect that the combination of Advanced Materials and Additives & Functional Products will represent approximately 70% of our earnings. And even in this environment, our EPS CAGR will still be roughly 11% from 2010 to '16. 
We also dramatically improved our free cash flow, almost tripling it from 2010 to 2016. Both improvements in our core businesses and adding the strong free cash flow generation from our acquisitions have substantially upgraded the quality of our portfolio. And we are still investing capital to deliver long-term growth in our specialty businesses while we generate one of the strongest free cash flows in this industry. 
On Slide 11, I'll discuss our 2016 outlook. We're doing a great job of executing our strategy in a challenging global business environment. Strong growth of high-value, innovative products continue as we benefit from leading positions in our attractive niche markets. We're seeing the benefits of scale and integration translating to growth in earnings, and we continue to invest in innovation and product development so that we can sustain our momentum into the coming years. We're also seeing the benefit of acquisition synergies in both costs and revenue. 
At the same time, we're achieving our cost-reduction goals. I can't say enough about how -- our Eastman employees globally who made this possible. As I mentioned earlier, productivity is in the DNA of Eastman, and I remain very confident we will achieve our cost-reduction targets for 2017. In addition, we are using all lines of the income statement to support our performance this year, including lower tax rates. All of these actions are helping to offset the challenges from low oil, sluggish global GDP growth and the challenges we face in Fibers. 
Putting all this together, our outlook for adjusted full year 2016 earnings per share has improved to between $6.70 and $6.80, which I consider to be a solid result given our challenges. We also continue to expect strong free cash flow this year above $900 million. And we are creating value for our stakeholders with our balanced and disciplined allocation of this cash, increasing our dividend, increasing share repurchases and continued delevering. 
With this momentum in mind, I'll make a few comments about 2017. On the last call, I indicated we have confidence that we can get back on track for EPS growth in the 8% to 12% range in 2017, and we continue to be confident. As we look at it, we expect growth and innovation-driven mix improvement in Advanced Materials and Functional Products; cost-reduction actions contribute about $0.50 per share; the net of propane and currency hedges continue to roll off in 2017 to contribute about $0.30 per share; an increase in the level of share repurchases while maintaining a balanced approach with deleveraging; and continuing to use all of the lines of the income statement to contribute to EPS growth. These would more than offset the roughly $0.30 per share headwind from Fibers and the preproduction expenses from our new specialty plants. The combination of these factors will get us to EPS growth in the 8% to 12% range. 
I would also note that we don't need the world to get much better to achieve this growth. And if things get better, there is upside. We'll talk to more -- more to you about the outlook for 2017 in our fourth quarter call in January, but I believe it's important now for you to understand why we are confident about delivering strong earnings growth and strong free cash flow in 2017. 
This has been a tough year, and I'm proud of our employees around the world who have maintained focus and positioned us for growth going forward. I'm confident that 2017 will be a better year for Eastman.

As Mark highlighted earlier and if I could, Eastman has one of the best portfolios, I think, that can generate cash in the industry. And you're seeing that in our results, and quite obviously, you'll see that next year. We do expect higher free cash",278,"Yes. As Mark highlighted earlier and if I could, Eastman has one of the best portfolios, I think, that can generate cash in the industry. And you're seeing that in our results, and quite obviously, you'll see that next year. We do expect higher free cash flows next year as we see operating earnings grow, as well as we'll see a modest decline in our CapEx. A couple of factors to think about when you -- when I'm looking at 2017 cash flows is we'll be watching what kind of raw material environment we're facing. If we expect higher raws, as you know, that's going to give us some challenges in working capital that we'll try to offset. I also am expecting some higher cash taxes next year as we have now fully utilized the NOLs as part of the Solutia transaction as well as there's a phaseout of bonus depreciation for manufacturers like Eastman. So putting it all together though, we're going to generate over free -- free cash flow over $900 million. With the earnings outlook that Mark talked about, I wouldn't be surprised if we see free cash flow approaching $1 billion. The allocation, what you'll see is still a balance across the different buckets that we have. You know our disciplined and balanced approach to capital allocation. But what you'll see is some more balanced approach to deleveraging and share repurchases with that free cash flow. So if you think about deleveraging, it was the predominant use of cash flow these last couple of years. That will moderate to be more balanced. And so you'll see share repurchase probably in excess of $300 million."

We are seeing a traction in getting price increases in September and into October as the propylene and ethylene markets have strengthened. That put pressure across the globe and played out as we expected in our second quarter call. We saw that our competitors, especially Asians, setting price on a lot of these products on a global basis, were starting to hit their cost positions. And as oil strengthened and their raw material costs, who are often -- I mean, purchase propylene and ethylene was going up, they would face pressure to increase prices, and that's what we're seeing. So it's very encouraging to actually see prices go up for once. It's been a long time. We do expect that momentum to continue as we go through the fourth quarter and carry into next year. But obviously, that will depend a bit on the raw material environment, so we'll have to see where oil and olefin prices go.

So -- and the growth rates in there largely [ph] has just been fantastic, so we need to get that plant up to keep our growth. In regards to Advanced Materials, they're just having a phenomenal year like they had a phenomenal year last year, and it's really proof of our strategy we have been talking about for the last 5 years. We said we're going to drive growth through innovation, and that's what we're doing. In Tritan and heads-up display and acoustic interlayers and our performance films business, all delivering double-digit growth and driving not just the sort of overall volume growth but the mix upgrade with all those products growing at such high rates with above-segment and above-company average margins. So it's just a good story. It's really -- very little of it is a raw material tailwind in what's driving the results, which gives us confidence that it will sustain going forward. And obviously, third quarter was a quarter where everything just ran really well. We had good volume, good mix, the plants ran incredibly well. One of the challenges in these kind of businesses, where you're making such a physical product, is you have yield and quality issues, and we just had a really clean quarter in how we ran the plants."

So first of all, this portfolio is a great set of portfolio -- of specialty businesses, tremendous additives that add a lot of functionality across our customers in coatings, tires, adhesives, and animal nutrition, crop, et cetera. It's just a great",598,"Sure. So first of all, this portfolio is a great set of portfolio -- of specialty businesses, tremendous additives that add a lot of functionality across our customers in coatings, tires, adhesives, and animal nutrition, crop, et cetera. It's just a great business of unique additives. So we view it as a business that will continue to grow. As you look at the pricing, which I think is the key question, and how it's come off, prices have really stabilized since the second quarter. So they -- we did a great job of holding on to raw material value in the beginning of last year, started giving some of it back in third quarter but really started giving it back in the fourth quarter and the first quarter of this year as we decided to share value with our customers. But those prices have stabilized, and we really didn't have much sequential decline in prices at all from second quarter into the third quarter of this year. And we expect the same sort of stability as we go into the fourth quarter. And you'll see that as -- even on a year-over-year basis in January as you see the trends in the fourth quarter. So that feels very stable to us and appropriate. As -- and we actually expect prices probably to start moving up in the coatings area, especially on the olefin-related products. The specialties are a little slower on prices on the way down. They're also slower on the way up. So Chemical Intermediates has already started to move on the pricing front, and we expect, as we go into next year, those prices on the specialty-related products will also start to move up with those -- with these current market conditions. So that all feels directionally correct to me. I think the important point is how you sustain these margins and continue to deliver growth over the long term. It's easy to hold on to prices when raws drop. But if you do that too aggressively and not share some of it with your customers, you really create a problem with those customers being engaged in working with you on any future innovation. And I think we've struck the right balance here, and we're seeing that in the proof of our innovation successes. We're just having tremendous success throughout the AFP portfolio with innovation. Our polyester coatings is doing tremendously well. We talked to you about that in the first quarter call, and we've gone from 3 to 10 customers aggressively working with us on how to commercialize that product and take it to market. We're seeing great success in the tire resins that I just told you about. We're seeing great success in the Aerafin olefin products that I told you about in the second quarter call that go with the adhesive resins. We continue to see great traction in our loader coal assets. And so across the portfolio, you're seeing a lot of innovation, a lot of traction. And as I said before, this is a little bit slower in getting started than Advanced Materials, but as you look at the next 3 years, you're going to see all these innovation programs driving growth and mix improvement here, just like what we're doing in Advanced Materials. So the love is [ph] -- we're proving, across the board, we can deliver growth and innovation. We can create our own growth. We're not waiting for the economy to get better. And that's the story you're going to see us deliver over the next 3 years."

So I'll try and be sort of brief on it now. Bottom line is you had a situation where the demand situation weakened across the globe, specifically the imports in China, and that's created pressure on pricing. And what we're seeing right now is that pricing pressure play out into the 2017 time frame. Our objective is doing what we can to sort of keep the business stable. That's been our objective from the beginning. We took capacity out in the U.K. as we added capacity in China, and we also exited some flake capacity as well. On the pricing front, we have attempted to be as stable as we can be on the pricing. Unfortunately, we got pushed pretty aggressively on some of our competitors trying to take share from us outside of China, and all we're trying to do is defend our share and keep it stable outside of China. We're not trying to recover lost imports in China by taking share outside of China. And we think the best way to do that is to get multiyear contracts on volume and price in place with many of our large customers, which will provide stability actually from '17 into '18 and '19 as we provide security of supply to our customers but also provide security of demand to us. So I think that those actions are actually going to put us in the right direction as far as the things that we can do to control the outcome in this industry and our performance, and we'll just have to see how the rest of it plays out."

So in Advanced Materials, which is very OEM-driven, we are looking at that. What's been great about our success to date is we're creating a lot of our own earnings growth through mix upgrade and double-digit growth in things like acoustics and heads-up display as well as a new channel strategy in performance films, where we're growing the whole size of the market and our share of it. So even in a slow automotive growth world, we can still deliver growth. It may not be as high as this year but still deliver growth. So I feel good about where we are there. And we see tremendous innovation opportunities continuing out there to add more functionality to the windows as we work with our customers in next generation of acoustics and heads-up display as well as other functionality. So it's just a very robust opportunity for growth. On the Additives & Functional Products side, when it comes to coatings and tires, we're more balanced through that. It's more of a balanced market from refinish or replacement tires than OEM. And so there, we're less exposed to sort of OEM trend rates as we are in Advanced Materials. So I think that, again, we'll have some solid growth there, and I'm not really worried about the OEM trend rates being a material issue."

One of the great things about this business is it's a consumer products business, where we have direct access to consumers and deliver a wide range of products and we have the best products in the industry. But when we picked up Solutia, their strategy of how to go to market and how to even expand the market was not that sophisticated. And so we spent a lot of time rethinking our channel strategies and figuring out how to not just go through aftermarket retail shops but develop much more compelling programs through auto dealers in the U.S., which allows us to access an entirely new set of customers that don't show up in an aftermarket tin shop, and have been incredibly successful in expanding the market and also improving the quality of how we go to market. Same thing true in China. We were doing quite well aftermarket, not as successful in the auto dealerships and had significantly improved our channel strategy to go through the auto dealerships, which is a very important channel in China, and we're seeing great success. And it's not just going to those channels but how we take the products to market, how we're positioning our value proposition versus our competitors in a more compelling way.

So we're very happy about our cost position. Our competitors are based on either purchased methanol or anhydride in some cases, so some of these assets are certainly exposed to much higher cost position. They picked up some advantage with lower oil today versus where they were. As oil goes up, that cost position is going to become less competitive relative to where we are. There are a number of high-cost assets out there that can be shut down by competitors, if they ever choose to do so, to improve their cost position to serve their customers, and we're going to have to see what they choose to do. As the market stabilizes, as we put in stability through these multiyear contracts, it's -- it becomes more challenging to figure out how you're going to grow earnings growth, and hopefully, they'll look at those options."

That's still what we're anticipating. Over the next couple of years, I'm looking at maybe roughly $75 million of pension contributions over the next couple of years. After that point, you kind of have to really look at what discount rates have done and how the returns have come in, to whether that number needs to increase to $100 million or maybe come down to $50 million. But that kind of gives you a band of what pension contributions could be like over the next 3 years to 5 years. On capital, when you got the kind of assets we have, yes, every 3 years to 5 years, there's going to be turnarounds. What we have -- we do and we have a great team that does it, we try to manage to capital -- maintenance spend to capital spend we have each year. Part of it's not only cash flow, part of it's just resources. So yes, we're going to have some capital spend over these years. But some of the unique items that we've had these last few years, like the -- some of the assets that we had to build in Texas as well as conversions to -- from natural -- coal to natural gas. There's a little bit ahead of us yet, but most of it's done. So I suspect our maintenance capital will be in that $300 million to $350 million range over that 5-year time period, and then we'll have growth capital on top of it to support all the attractive innovation programs that Mark talked about.

We know how to innovate in this space. We've done a lot more of this innovation than anyone else has ever done in creating new markets, just like we've done in polyesters, starting with polyester fiber to PET to a wide range of polyester applications.
