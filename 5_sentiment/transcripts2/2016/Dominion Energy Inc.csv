267105,321990037,924118,"Dominion Midstream Partners, LP, Dominion Resources, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 01, 2016",2016-02-01,"Earnings Calls","Dominion Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you. This morning, Dominion Resources and Questar Corporation announced a definitive agreement to combine. Dominion will pay Questar shareholders $25 per common share in cash plus the assumption of $1.6 billion in debt. For a total enterprise value",658,"Thank you. This morning, Dominion Resources and Questar Corporation announced a definitive agreement to combine. Dominion will pay Questar shareholders $25 per common share in cash plus the assumption of $1.6 billion in debt. For a total enterprise value of $6 billion. Assumed [indiscernible] of all required regulatory approvals, the company expects to close the transaction by the end of this year. 
We're very excited about adding Questar to the Dominion portfolio of company. This agreement is a combination of premium, integrated asset profiles and is well-aligned with Dominion's existing strategic focus and core energy infrastructure operations. These high-performing regulated assets will provide enhanced scale and diversification into constructive regulatory jurisdictions. 
Furthermore, the value to Dominion's investors from the transaction does not require a significant levering of our balance sheet. The permanent financing will feature an equity component from both Dominion Resources and Dominion Midstream Partners and will be supportive of management's commitment to our existing credit ratings targets. 
The transaction is consistent with our announced growth strategy. Specifically, the acquisition in development are reasonably valued, regulated MLP qualifying assets with stable, long-term cash profiles. And in addition, in the case of Questar, a fast-growing, regulated gas distribution company in states that have a strong pro-business environment. We think it is an ideal combination for both Dominion shareholders, Dominion Midstream unitholders and Questar shareholders and all of our employees. 
Questar has a long history of doing business with integrity and honesty and a strong commitment to its employees and the communities they serve. It is a very well-managed company, with strong commitment to safety, ethics and excellence, which are core values shared by the employees of Dominion. As part of the Dominion team, Questar's customers can also count on the continuation of the high-quality service they have enjoyed. 
Questar's operations feature an excellent business risk profile. Margins at its gas utility had been derisked through constructive regulation including revenue decoupling, weather normalization -- in infrastructure replacement rather, and gas cost pass through, elements that we also share in Dominion East Ohio. 
Its pipeline operations feature long-term contracts with creditworthy counterparties. Its regulated gas supply business has operated in our commission approved cost of service model for 35 years. 
Utah is one of the fastest-growing states in the country and is annually ranked among the best states in which to do business. We've already committed approximately $1 billion in solar projects in Utah which are under long-term contracts to electric utilities. 
Questar provides enhanced and geographic diversity to Dominion's natural gas operations. This is illustrated with the system map shown on Slide 8. While our Dominion transition system is known as the hub of the mid-Atlantic, the Questar system is called the hub of the Rockies. And the principal source of gas supply to the Western states. We believe the value of the system will increase overtime as illustrated on Slide 9. As Utah and the surrounding Western states seek to comply with the requirements of the EPA's Clean Power Plan as well as meet state-mandated renewable portfolio standards. 
Compliance is highly likely to result in an increased reliance on low emission, gas-fired generation. The transaction also provides significant benefits to Dominion's investors. It would be immediately accretive to earnings per share with limited impact on our balance sheet. It provides a significant addition to Dominion's inventory of top quality, low risk MLP-eligible assets. We intend to finance a portion of the acquisition through a contribution of Questar pipeline to Dominion Midstream Partners, taking advantage of the MLP's lower cost of capital and diversifying our credit funding sources. DM investors will benefit significantly as the acquisition will add over $425 million of EBITDA to Dominion's already extensive inventory of high-quality MLP-eligible regulated assets. 
We're very excited about this morning's announcement. I will be back in a few minutes to update you on our growth plans and take your questions. But now, I'll turn the call over to Mark McGettrick."
267105,321990037,924118,"Dominion Midstream Partners, LP, Dominion Resources, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 01, 2016",2016-02-01,"Earnings Calls","Dominion Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you and good afternoon. For those of you not familiar with Questar Corporation, we've summarized their business profile on Slide 13. Questar was a regulated, Rockies state, integrated natural gas company headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah. Its",1406,"Thank you and good afternoon. For those of you not familiar with Questar Corporation, we've summarized their business profile on Slide 13. 
Questar was a regulated, Rockies state, integrated natural gas company headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah. Its operations consist of 3 primary business segments. 
Questar Gas is a regulated local distribution company serving about 1 million customers in Utah, Wyoming and Idaho. Customer growth has averaged 2.5%, which is well above industry averages. Authorized ROEs are 9.5% to 9.85%, on a $1.1 billion rate base, with a 52% equity component. 
The Questar pipeline is a FERC-regulated transportation storage system, strategically located to deliver gas to the Western region of the country. Its operating assets consist of 2,700 miles of pipeline and 56 billion cubic feet of storage capacity operating under long-term fixed fee contracts with creditworthy counterparties. Authorized ROEs range from 11.4% to 13% and rate base is about $950 million. 
The regulated gas supply business is operating under a regulated cost of service plus return model for 35 years. Its $600 million rate base is 100% equity capitalized with a 2015 average realized return of 17%. While the pipeline system and the regulated gas supply business are MLP eligible. 
Slide 14 shows the pro forma business profile of the combined company's regulated gas infrastructure businesses. The acquisition increases or LTC rate base by nearly half as the number of customers by more than 75%. It increases our pipeline rate base by approximately 25% and our pipeline network of 1/3. 
The impact on Dominion's EBITDA mix is shown on Slide 15. While we're roughly 90% regulated, the Questar acquisition improves the balance electric and gas operations. 
Questar Corporation will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Dominion Resources. Upon completion of the acquisition, around the first of next year, Questar pipeline will be contributing to the Dominion Midstream Partners, probably in 2 steps. Slide 16 updates our planned drop schedule for DM from last year's analyst meeting. 
The first contribution of Questar pipeline will provide sufficient coverage for Dominion Midstream to meet its 2017 distribution growth targets, which remain at 22% per year. 
The second drop will include remaining investment in Questar pipeline, which along with the small portion of the Cove Point asset will fulfill our distribution growth for 2018. Any future drop of regulated gas supply assets will only be done in consultation with state regulators. This will allow Dominion to keep its investment in the Blue Racer joint venture at the parent till 2020 or later, enhancing its value in the future contribution due to its strong, organic growth and reduce the Cove Point EBITDA drop into DM in 2018 while maintaining our 22% distribution growth. 
Questar pipeline business is a perfect match for the stable, long-term, regulated cash flow profile of Dominion Midstream Partners. 
Slide 17 highlights our financing plan and the impact of Questar in our expected EPS growth rate. The value to Dominion for this acquisition does not depend on any significant delevering of our balance sheet. We intend to prudently finance this transaction in line with our previously stated credit rating targets using a combination of equity, mandatory convertibles and debt at Dominion in addition to equity at Dominion Midstream to finance the drop of the pipeline business. 
As a reminder, we still do not need or do not plan to need any equity at Dominion Midstream in 2016. 
The acquisition is immediately accretive to Dominion's earnings per share and will support our 2017 growth target while allowing us to achieve or even exceed the top end of our growth target for 2018. 
As Tom Farrell mentioned earlier, we are excited about this transaction, the value it creates for Dominion shareholders and Dominion Midstream unitholders and the opportunity it provides to continue to grow our gas infrastructure business. 
We will take your questions in a few minutes. But first I want to review our results for 2015 and our earnings guidance for 2016. 
Dominion Resources reported operating earnings of $0.70 per share for the fourth quarter of 2015, which was below our guidance range of $0.85 to $0.95 per share. The extremely violent [ph] weather in December, the timing of our planned format restructuring and the higher-than-expected effective tax rate due to bonus depreciation were the primary factors to drive earnings below the range. While we have discussed our sensitivity to weather in prior calls, never has it had a kind of impact that we saw in December. Slide 20 shows the cumulative temperature deviation from normal for each December over the last 50 years. The value for December 2015 is highlighted in red in the upper right-hand corner. Not only was this the warmest December in the last 50 years, it was nearly twice as warm as the previous record experienced in 1984. Our analysis indicates the warm temperatures accounted for $0.08 to $0.10 per share during the fourth quarter. 
Bonus depreciation will be a significant positive to our long-term cash position. But unfortunately, since the new low is retroactive back to January 1, it did not allow us to take $0.03 per share primarily from tax reductions anticipated in the fourth quarter guidance. 
And finally, although we did not complete the planned farm out restructuring last quarter, we do anticipate completing a new farm out opportunity during calendar year 2016. The earnings [indiscernible] in the fourth quarter also calls full year 2015 operating earnings per share to be below our guidance range of $3.50 to $3.85 per share. 
GAAP earnings were $3.20 for the year. The principal differences between gas and operating earnings were charges associated with the [indiscernible] legislation and active [indiscernible] that require the write-off of Ginnie Power prior period deferred fuel costs and charges associated with future ash pond closures. The reconciliation of operating earnings, the reported earnings can be found on Schedule 2 of the Earnings Release Kit. 
For the fourth quarter of 2015, Dominion Midstream Partners produced adjusted EBITDA of $23.6 million and distributable cash flow of $24.7 million, all consistent with management's expectations. 
On January 21, Dominion Midstream Board of Directors declared a distribution of $0.2135 per unit payable on February 15 to unitholders of record on February 5. This distribution represent a 7% increase over last [indiscernible] payment and its consistent with our plan to achieve 22% annual distribution growth for LP units. 
Moving to cash flow and treasury activities at Dominion. Fund from operations were $4.5 billion 2015. Debt commercial paper and letters of credit outstanding at the end of the year were $3.1 billion. We had $4.5 billion of credit facilities at the time taking into account cash and short-term investments ended the year with liquidity of $1.4 billion. 
In January, we have increased our primary credit facility by $1 billion, taking our total credit lines to $5.5 billion. For statements of cash flow and liquidity, please see Pages 13 and 24 of the Earnings Release Kit. 
As mentioned earlier, an extension of bonus depreciation was included in the recent scheduled spending authorization. Dominion expects to be a significant cash beneficiary of bonus depreciations because of our large capital progression. We anticipate a $2.5 billion cash flow benefit over the next several years. 
And wrapping up our financing update. We would like to remind everyone that Dominion's Board of Directors authorized an 8.1% dividend increase in December for 2016. The dividend [ph] annual rate is $2.80 per share. 
Now for the earnings guidance for 2016. Dominion's operating's guidance are $3.60 to $4 per share for 2016. The midpoint of this range is 10% above the $3.44 earned in 2015. Positive drivers for this increase are revenues from our growth projects, lower capacity expenses, higher capacity [indiscernible] revenues, investment tax credits from our solar facilities. Offsetting factors include higher DD&A expenses, increased costs and share dilution of the conversion of the mandatory convertible units. 
Dominion's operating guidance for the first quarter of 2016 is $0.90 to $1.05 per share, compared to $0.99 per share for the first quarter of 2015. The midpoint of this range represents a 5% increase over the weather normalized $0.93 per share for the first quarter of 2015. 
In hedging, you can find our hedge positions on Page 26 of the Earnings Release Kit. As of mid-January, we have hedged 91% of our expected 2016 production in Millstone and 6% of our expected 2017 production. 
I will now turn the call back to Tom Farrell."

Construction of the 1,358-megawatt combined cycle facility in Brunswick County was about 96% completed year-end. There are around 450 workers on site. All major equipment has been installed and all 3 combustion turbines were successfully fired on natural gas during December. The facility is on time and on budget with an expected mid-2016 commercial operation date. 
The hearing on our request for CPCN and rate writer for the proposed 1,588-megawatt Greensville County project was held on January 12. A decision from the State Corporation Commission is expected in April. The 3 on 1 combined facility is expected to achieve commercial operation in December 2018. 
We continue to execute on our merchant solar strategy. Dominion completed 8 projects in 2015, totaling 171 megawatts in California, Utah and Georgia. Our projects for 2016 include 530 megawatts from 2 joint ventures located in Utah. These projects are under long-term PPAs and are expected to be in service in the third quarter. 
In November, Dominion acquired an 80-megawatts project to be constructed in Virginia's Eastern shore, supported by a PPA with Amazon and scheduled for operations in the fourth quarter of this year. In December and January, Dominion closed on our agreement for the sale of a 33% interest in 425 megawatts of our solar portfolio to SunEdison for approximately $300 million. 
We have a number of Electric Transmission projects at the various stages of regulatory approval and construction. During the fourth quarter, $398 million of transmission assets are placed into service, bringing the full-year total to a record $1 billion. 
Progress on our gross plan for Dominion Energy continues as well. We have continued to work for the commencement of construction on the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and the related supply Heather [ph] project. We made formal FERC filings for these products in September. Surveying and pipeline engineering is now over 90% complete. We have also contracted for about 70% of the project materials. The plan to begin construction on both projects in the fourth quarter of this year and begin operations in November 2018. 
Now an update on our Cove Point Liquefaction Project. Overall, the project is approximately 56% complete as of year-end and there are about 1,600 workers on site. Engineering is 97% complete and all 34 of the construction packages have been approved by FERC. The project continues to be on time and on budget for a late 2017 in-service state. 
We also have 13 energy growth projects underway, with $1.2 billion of investments to move more than 2 billion cubic feet per day for customers by the end of 2018. [indiscernible] project in South Carolina was placed into service in December and Western Access 2 project was placed into service in January. In the fourth quarter, we received FERC approval for 4 pipeline expansion projects planned to be in service later this year or early next. 
So to summarize. We are very excited about our combination with Questar Corporation. It will be a premium, quality addition to Dominion and Dominion Midstream's portfolio. The combination provides geographic diversification for natural gas operation and provides opportunities for future expansion. The transaction is consistent with Dominion and Dominion Midstream's strategic focus on regulated energy infrastructure businesses with MLP-qualifying assets. The transaction is immediately accretive to Dominion's earnings and provides a substantial addition for our inventory of MLB -- MLP-eligible operations.

We have a bridge facility for all the financing. As part of that bridge facility, we have for a term loan commitment that extends well beyond closing that gives us significant flexibility for the MLP and when we might drop that. Right now, we said in the script that we have no plans and no need to have a drop into DM to the end of 2016 and the equity that we would use from the pipeline drop in '17 is consistent with what we've said with the EBITDA drop all the way back to February for the distribution growth go 22% in 2017.

As you know, we've added a portion of the [indiscernible] pipeline to our portfolio. We added the Carolina Gas Transmission system. We are particularly attracted to Questar's assets partially because of the pipeline. We're perfectly happy to -- with the LDC, which is one of the fastest-growing LDCs in the country, Utah's often been ranked as the #1 state in which to do business and the Questar gas is a fast-growing LDC. And it has very similar attributes to ease up our gas. But it was the MLP eligible assets that particularly caught our attention. And after we took a hard look at Clean Power Plan goals or targets that the EPA has imposed, so this pipeline is going to have a lot of growth opportunities in the very well run, active community, safety-conscious workforce at the LDC. So I wouldn't -- we're not looking all over the place kind of buying anything. We're looking for, as we've said from the beginning, MLP-eligible assets, this takes care of -- we don't need anything. We have -- with this -- '16 is already taken care of. This takes care of '17 and part of '18, Blue Racer, if it drops, will be in the 2020 some time. So Dominion Midstream Partners has now available to it a long, long runway of contracted, long-term gas infrastructure assets with 0 commodity risk. So I think it's a tremendous acquisition also for the purpose of Dominion Midstream Partners or unitholders.

267105,321990037,924182,"Dominion Midstream Partners, LP, Dominion Resources, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 01, 2016",2016-02-01,"Earnings Calls","Dominion Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you.This morning, Dominion Resources and Questar Corporation announced a definitive agreement to combine.

This morning, Dominion Resources and Questar Corporation announced a definitive agreement to combine. Dominion will pay Questar shareholders $25 per common share in cash, plus the assumption of $1.6 billion in debt, for a total enterprise value of $6 billion. Assumed foreseen of all required regulatory approvals, the companies expect to close the transaction by the end of this year.
We are very excited about adding Questar to the Dominion portfolio of companies. This agreement is a combination of premium, integrated asset profiles; and is well aligned with Dominion's existing strategic focus and core energy infrastructure operations. Its high-performing regulated assets will provide enhanced scale and diversification into constructive regulatory jurisdictions. Furthermore, the value to Dominion's investors from the transaction does not require a significant levering of our balance sheet. The permanent financing will feature an equity component from both Dominion Resources and Dominion Midstream Partners and will be supportive of management's commitment to our existing credit ratings targets.
The transaction is consistent with our announced growth strategy: specifically the acquisition and development of reasonably valued, regulated MLP qualifying assets with stable long-term cash profiles; and in addition, in the case of Questar, a fast-growing, regulated gas distribution company in states that have a strong pro-business environment. We think it is an ideal combination for both Dominion shareholders, Dominion Midstream unitholders and Questar shareholders and all of our employees. Questar has a long history of doing business with integrity and honesty and a strong commitment to its employees and the communities they serve. It is a very well-managed company with strong commitment to safety, ethics and excellence, which are core values shared by the employees of Dominion. As part of the Dominion team, Questar's customers can also count on a continuation of the high-quality service they have enjoyed.
Questar's operations feature an excellent business risk profile. Margins at its gas utility have been derisked through constructive regulation, including revenue decoupling, weather normalization, an infrastructure replacement rider and gas costs pass-through, elements that we also share in Dominion East Ohio. Its pipeline operations feature long-term contracts with creditworthy counterparties. Its regulated gas supply business has operated on a commission-approved cost of service model for 35 years.
Utah is one of the fastest-growing states in the country and is annually ranked among the best states in which to do business. We've already committed approximately $1 billion in solar projects in Utah which are on long-term contracts to electric utilities.
Questar provides enhanced geographic diversity to Dominion's natural gas operations. This is illustrated with the system map shown on Slide 8. While our Dominion transition system is known as the hub of the mid-Atlantic, the Questar system is called the hub of the Rockies and a principal source of gas supply to the Western states. We believe the value of the system will increase over time, as illustrated on Slide 9, as Utah and the surrounding Western states seek to comply with the requirements of the EPA's Clean Power Plan as well as meet state-mandated renewable portfolio standards. Compliance is highly likely to result in an increased reliance on low-emission, gas-fired generation.
The transaction also provides significant benefits to Dominion's investors. It will be immediately accretive to earnings per share, with limited impact on our balance sheet. It provides a significant addition to Dominion's inventory of top-quality, low-risk MLP-eligible assets. We intend to finance a portion of the acquisition through a contribution of Questar pipeline to Dominion Midstream Partners, taking advantage of the MLP's lower cost of capital and diversifying our equity funding sources. DM investors will benefit significantly, as the acquisition will add over $425 million of EBITDA to Dominion's already extensive inventory of high-quality MLP-eligible regulated assets.
We're very excited about this morning's announcement. I will be back in a few minutes to update you on our growth plans and take your questions, but now I'll turn the call over to Mark McGettrick."
267105,321990037,924182,"Dominion Midstream Partners, LP, Dominion Resources, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 01, 2016",2016-02-01,"Earnings Calls","Dominion Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you. And good afternoon.For those of you not familiar with Questar Corporation, we have summarized their business profile on Slide 13. Questar is a regulated, Rockies-based integrated natural gas company headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah. Its",1407,"Thank you. And good afternoon.
For those of you not familiar with Questar Corporation, we have summarized their business profile on Slide 13. Questar is a regulated, Rockies-based integrated natural gas company headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah. Its operations consist of 3 primary business segments.
Questar Gas is a regulated local distribution company serving about 1 million customers in Utah, Wyoming and Idaho. Customer growth has averaged 2.5%, which is well above industry averages. Authorized ROEs are 9.5% to 9.85% on a $1.1 billion rate base, with a 52% equity component. Questar Pipeline is a FERC-regulated transportation and storage system strategically located to deliver gas to the Western region of the country. Its operating assets consist of 2,700 miles of pipeline and 56 billion cubic feet of storage capacity operating under long-term fixed-fee contracts with its creditworthy counterparties. Authorized ROEs range from 11.4% to 13%, and rate base is about $950 million.
The regulated gas supply business has been operating under a regulated ""cost of service plus return"" model for 35 years. Its $600 million rate base is 100% equity capitalized, with a 2015 average realized return of 17%. Both the pipeline system and the regulated gas supply business are MLP eligible.
Slide 14 shows the pro forma business profile of the combined companies' regulated gas infrastructure businesses. The acquisition increases our LDC rate base by nearly half and the number of customers by more than 75%. It increases our pipeline rate base by approximately 25% and our pipeline network 1/3. The impact on Dominion's EBITDA mix is shown on Slide 15. While remaining roughly 90% regulated, the Questar acquisition improves the balance electric and gas operations.
Questar Corporation will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Dominion Resources. Upon completion of the acquisition around the 1st of next year, Questar Pipeline will be contributive to Dominion Midstream Partners probably in 2 steps. Slide 16 updates our planned drop schedule for DM from last year's analyst meeting. The first contribution of Questar Pipeline will provide sufficient coverage for Dominion Midstream to meet its 2017 distribution growth targets, which remain at 22% per year. The second drop will include the remaining investment in Questar Pipeline, which along with a small portion of the Cove Point asset will fulfill our distribution growth for 2018. Any future drop of regulated gas supply assets will only be done in consultation with state regulators. This will allow Dominion to keep its investment in the Blue Racer joint venture at the parent till 2020 or later, enhancing its value and the future contribution due to its strong organic growth; and reduce the Cove Point EBITDA drop into DM in 2018 while maintaining our 22% distribution growth. The Questar Pipeline business is a perfect match for the stable long-term regulated cash flow profile of Dominion Midstream Partners.
Slide 17 highlights our financing plan and the impact of Questar on our expected EPS growth rate. Value to Dominion from this acquisition does not depend on any significant levering of our balance sheets. We intend to prudently finance this transaction in line with our previously stated credit rating targets using a combination of equity, mandatory convertibles and debt at Dominion; in addition to equity at Dominion Midstream to finance the drop of the pipeline business. As a reminder, we still do not need or do not plan to need any equity at Dominion Midstream in 2016.
The acquisition is immediately accretive to Dominion's earnings per share and will support our 2017 growth target while allowing us to achieve or even exceed the top end of our growth target for 2018. As Tom Farrell mentioned earlier, we are excited about this transaction, the value it creates for Dominion shareholders and Dominion Midstream unitholders and the opportunity it provides to continue to grow our gas infrastructure business.
We will take your questions in a few minutes, but first I want to review our results for 2015 and our earnings guidance for 2016.
Dominion Resources reported operating earnings of $0.70 per share for the fourth quarter of 2015, which was below our guidance range of $0.85 to $0.95 per share. Extremely violent weather in December, the timing of a planned farm-out restructuring and a higher-than-expected effective tax rate due to bonus depreciation were the primary factors to drive earnings below the range.
While we have discussed our sensitivity to weather in prior calls, never has it had the kind of impact that we saw in December. Slide 20 shows the cumulative temperature deviation from normal for each December over the last 50 years. The value for December 2015 is highlighted in red in the upper right-hand corner. Not only was this the warmest December in the last 50 years, it was nearly twice as warm as the previous record experienced in 1984. Our analysis indicates that warm temperatures accounted for $0.08 to $0.10 per share during the fourth quarter. Bonus depreciation will be a significant positive to our long-term cash position, but unfortunately, since the new law is retroactive back to January 1, it did not allow us to take $0.03 per share primarily from tax deductions anticipated in the fourth quarter guidance. And finally, although we did not complete the planned farm-out restructuring last quarter, we do anticipate completing a new farm-out opportunity during calendar year 2016.
The earnings shortfall in the fourth quarter also caused full year of 2015 operating earnings per share to be below our guidance range of $3.50 to $3.85 per share. GAAP earnings were $3.20 for the year. The principal differences between GAAP and the operating earnings were charges associated with the Virginia legislation enacted in February that required the write-off of Virginia Power prior-period deferred fuel costs and charges associated with future ash pond closures. A reconciliation of operating earnings to reported earnings can be found on Schedule 2 of the Earnings Release Kit.
For the fourth quarter of 2015, Dominion Midstream Partners produced adjusted EBITDA of $23.6 million and distributable cash flow of $24.7 million, all consistent with management's expectations. On January 21, Dominion Midstream's Board of Directors declared a distribution of $0.2135 per unit, payable on February 15 to unitholders of record on February 5. This distribution represents a 7% increase over last quarter's payment and is consistent with our plan to achieve 22% annual distribution growth for LP units.
Moving to cash flow and treasury activities at Dominion. Fund from operations were $4.5 billion in 2015. Net commercial paper and letters of credit outstanding at the end of the year were $3.1 billion. We had $4.5 billion of credit facilities at the time, taking into account that cash and short-term investments ended the year with liquidity of $1.4 billion. In January, we have increased our primary credit facility by $1 billion, taking our total credit lines to $5.5 billion. For statements of cash flow and liquidity, please see Pages 13 and 24 of the Earnings Release Kit.
As I mentioned earlier, an extension of bonus depreciation was included in the recent scheduled spending authorization. Dominion expects to be a significant cash beneficiary of bonus depreciations because of our large capital [indiscernible]. We anticipate a $2.5 billion cash flow benefit over the next several years.
Wrapping up our financing update, we would like to remind everyone that Dominion's Board of Directors authorized an 8.1% dividend increase in December for 2016. The dividend annual rate is $2.80 per share.
Now for earnings guidance for 2016.
Dominion's operating earnings guidance is $3.60 to $4 per share for 2016. The midpoint of this range is 10% above the $3.44 earned in 2015. Positive drivers for this increase are revenues from our growth projects, lower capacity expenses, higher capacity performance revenues and investment tax credits from our solar facilities. Offsetting factors include higher DD&A expenses, increased costs and share dilution from the conversion of the mandatory convertible units.
Dominion's operating earnings guidance for the first quarter of 2016 is $0.90 to $1.05 per share compared to $0.99 per share for the first quarter of 2015. The midpoint of this range represents a 5% increase over the weather-normalized $0.93 per share for the first quarter of 2015.
As to hedging, you can find our hedge positions on Page 26 of the Earnings Release Kit. As of mid-January, we have hedged 91% of our expected 2016 production at Millstone and 6% of our expected 2017 production.
I will now turn the call back to Tom Farrell."

Construction of the 1,358-megawatt combined-cycle facility in Brunswick County was about 96% complete at year-end. There are around 450 workers on site. All major equipment has been installed, and all 3 combustion turbines were successfully fired on natural gas during December. The facility is on time and on budget, with an expected mid-2016 commercial operation date. The hearing on our request for CPCN and rate rider for the proposed 1,588-megawatt Greensville County project was held on January 12. A decision from the State Corporation Commission is expected in April. The 3-on-1 combined-cycle facility is expected to achieve commercial operation in December 2018.
We continue to execute on our merchant solar strategy. Dominion completed 8 projects in 2015 totaling 171 megawatts in California, Utah and Georgia. Our projects for 2016 include 530 megawatts from 2 joint ventures located in Utah. These projects are under long-term PPAs and are expected to be in service in the third quarter.
In November, Dominion acquired an 80-megawatt project to be constructed on Virginia's eastern shore, supported by a PPA with Amazon and scheduled for operations in the fourth quarter of this year. In December -- in January, Dominion closed on our agreement for the sale of a 33% interest in 425 megawatts of our solar portfolio to SunEdison for approximately $300 million. 
We have a number of electric transmission projects at the various stages of regulatory approval and construction. During the fourth quarter, $398 million of transmission assets were placed into service, bringing the full year total to a record $1 billion. Progress on our growth plan for Dominion Energy continues as well. We have continued to work for the commencement of construction on the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and the related Supply Header Project. We made formal FERC filings for these products in September. Surveying and pipeline engineering is now over 90% complete. We've also contracted for about 70% of the project materials. We plan to begin construction on both projects in the fourth quarter of this year and begin operations in November 2018.
Now an update on our Cove Point liquefaction project. Overall, the project is approximately 56% complete as of year-end, and there are about 1,600 workers on site. Engineering is 97% complete, and all 34 of the construction packages have been approved by FERC. The project continues to be on time and on budget for a late 2017 in-service state.
We also have 13 energy growth projects underway, with $1.2 billion of investments to move more than 2 billion cubic feet per day for customers by the end of 2018. The Edgemoor project in South Carolina was placed into service in December, and Western Access II project was placed into service in January. In the fourth quarter, we received FERC approval for 4 pipeline expansion projects planned to be in service later this year or early next.
So to summarize. We are very excited about our combination with Questar Corporation. It will be a premium-quality addition to Dominion and Dominion Midstream's portfolio. The combination provides geographic diversification for natural gas operation and provides opportunities for future expansion. The transaction is consistent with Dominion and Dominion Midstream's strategic focus on regulated energy infrastructure businesses with MLP-qualifying assets. The transaction is immediately accretive to Dominion's earnings and provides a substantial addition for our inventory of MLB -- MLP-eligible operations.
Thank you, and we are ready to take your questions."

This is how we view this currently: Again, market conditions could change, but we expect to issue about $1.5 billion of incremental DRI debt to support the transaction. We also anticipate issuing about $0.5 billion of Dominion equity. We'll do that either through a dribble or a block trade sometime between now and when we anticipate closing on the transaction. And then the remainder, the takeout will be a combination of mandatory convertibles at Dominion, which has been a very popular financing vehicle for us with investors; and a drop into DM to support the 2017 EBITDA growth and distribution growth from a portion of the pipeline. We have a bridge facility for all the financing. And as part of that bridge facility, we have a term loan commitment that extends well beyond closing. That gives us significant flexibility for the MLP and when we might drop that. Right now, we said in the script that we have no plans and no need to have a drop into DM in 2016. And the equity that we would use from the pipeline drop in '17 is consistent with what we've said with this EBITDA drop all the way back to February for the distribution growth to go 22% in 2017. So again, $1.5 billion or so DRI debt, $0.5 billion DRI equity and then the remainder a combination of mandatory convertibles at Dominion and MLP drop proceeds."

We are very confident that -- when we decide to come to market to support the 2017 drop, that we can either do that in a private placement based on what we've been told by our holders or in overnight transactions. So we're quite confident we can place effort needed to support the drop, and as we get closer, we'll determine what size of mandatory convertible versus what size of MLP drop proceeds will be needed to fund the transaction. Keep in mind again now we have a term loan commitment well beyond closing that gives us tremendous flexibility on when we would make a DM drop in 2017."

As you know, we added a portion of the airport Viracord [ph] pipeline to our portfolio. We added the Carolina Gas Transmission system. We are particularly attracted to Questar's assets partially because of the pipeline. We're perfectly happy to -- with the LDC, which is one of the fastest-growing LDCs in the country. Utah has often been ranked as the #1 state in which to do business. And the Questar Gas is a fast-growing LDC and it has very similar attributes to East Ohio gas, but it was the MLP-eligible assets that particularly caught our attention and after we took a hard look at the region's Clean Power Plan goals or targets that the EPA has imposed. So this is a pipeline that's going to have a lot of growth opportunities; and a very well-run, ""active in the community,"" safety-conscious workforce at the LDC. So I wouldn't -- we're not looking all over the place to kind of buy anything. We're looking for, as we've said from the beginning, MLP-eligible assets. This takes care of -- we don't need anything.

What's particularly interesting about Questar, in addition to its -- the culture of the company which very closely matches our own, is the hub concept. Dominion -- our transmission system is the hub of the mid-Atlantic, almost every -- well, every pipeline that comes into the Northeast hits our system somewhere. We move gas from the West, from the South of Canada. All of it have mixes through our system and then is redeployed to the East through our system and some of -- and other systems. Questar Pipeline provides that same service for the Northwest United States and a large chunk of California. Almost 1/3 of the gas in the Western states goes through this pipeline system. So we're familiar with hubs. We see tremendous value in the hub system. And we think there's a lot of opportunity for growth through what will become, we hope, soon Dominion-Questar."

Second, that we knew in '16 that we had a very large solar ITC number and we hadn't really determined what we were going to do in '17 because the tax credit is going to go right away. So that's we were looking at other drivers to help that. Third is that, because of the capacity performance assumption that we have in the end of 2016 versus '17, the number is better for us in '16 than it is '17 in the original assumptions. And then there's a few other items that drove us on the downside there, but if it was anything, one single thing that was really large was just a lot of assumptions that we made for the February meeting; that market conditions have challenged that, and so this offered a good opportunity to kind of make sure we could stay on track."

Today's call will cover this morning's announcement of Dominion's agreement to combine with Questar Corporation, as well as our earnings for 2015 and guidance for 2016. This combined call will replace the earnings call we had originally scheduled for this Thursday. During this call, we will refer to certain schedules included in this morning's earnings releases and pages from our Earnings Release Kit. Schedules in the Earnings Release Kit are intended to answer the more detailed questions pertaining to operating statistics and accounting. Investor relations will be available after the call for any clarification of these schedules. If you've not done so, I encourage you to visit the Investor Relations page on our websites, register for email alerts and view our fourth quarter earnings documents.

And now for the usual cautionary language. The earnings releases and other matters that will be discussed on the call today may contain forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings, including our most recent annual reports on Form 10-K and our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, for a discussion of factors that may cause results to differ from management's projections, forecasts, estimates and expectations. Also on this call, we will discuss some measures of our company's performance that differ from those recognized by GAAP. Reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures we are able to calculate and report are contained in the Earnings Release Kit and Dominion Midstream's press release.
Joining us on the call this afternoon are our Chairman and CEO, Tom Farrell; our CFO, Mark McGettrick; and other members of our management team. Tom will provide an overview of our agreement with Questar and the strategic rationale behind it. Mark will cover the combined company profile and our planned financing of the transaction. After that discussion, we will move on to our earnings results for the fourth quarter and full year 2015, plus Dominion's guidance for the first quarter and full year 2016 and progress on our growth plans. We will then take your questions.

267105,321990037,924272,"Dominion Midstream Partners, LP, Dominion Resources, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 01, 2016",2016-02-01,"Earnings Calls","Dominion Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you.This morning, Dominion Resources and Questar Corporation announced a definitive agreement to combine.

This morning, Dominion Resources and Questar Corporation announced a definitive agreement to combine. Dominion will pay Questar shareholders $25 per common share in cash, plus the assumption of $1.6 billion in debt, for a total enterprise value of $6 billion. Assumed receipt [ph] of all required regulatory approvals, the companies expect to close the transaction by the end of this year.
We are very excited about adding Questar to the Dominion portfolio of companies. This agreement is a combination of premium, integrated asset profiles and is well aligned with Dominion's existing strategic focus and core energy infrastructure operations. These high-performing regulated assets will provide enhanced scale and diversification into constructive regulatory jurisdictions. 
Furthermore, the value to Dominion's investors from the transaction does not require a significant levering of our balance sheet. The permanent financing will feature an equity component from both Dominion Resources and Dominion Midstream Partners and will be supportive of management's commitment to our existing credit ratings targets.
The transaction is consistent with our announced growth strategy, specifically the acquisition and development of reasonably valued, regulated MLP qualifying assets with stable long-term cash profiles. And in addition, in the case of Questar, a fast-growing, regulated gas distribution company in states that have a strong pro-business environment. We think it is an ideal combination for both Dominion shareholders, Dominion Midstream unitholders and Questar shareholders and all of our employees. 
Questar has a long history of doing business with integrity and honesty and a strong commitment to its employees and the communities they serve. It is a very well-managed company with a strong commitment to safety, ethics and excellence, which are core values shared by the employees of Dominion. As part of the Dominion team, Questar's customers can also count on a continuation of the high-quality service they have enjoyed.
Questar's operations feature an excellent business risk profile. Margins at its gas utility have been derisked through constructive regulation, including revenue decoupling, weather normalization, an infrastructure replacement rider and gas cost pass-through, elements that we also share in Dominion East Ohio. Its pipeline operations feature long-term contracts with creditworthy counterparties. Its regulated gas supply business has operated under a commission-approved cost of service model for 35 years.
Utah is one of the fastest-growing states in the country and is annually ranked among the best states in which to do business. We've already committed approximately $1 billion in solar projects in Utah, which are under long-term contracts to electric utilities.
Questar provides enhanced geographic diversity to Dominion's natural gas operations. This is illustrated with the system map shown on Slide 8. While our Dominion transmission system is known as the hub of the mid-Atlantic, the Questar system is called the hub of the Rockies and a principal source of gas supply to the Western states. We believe the value of the system will increase over time, as illustrated on Slide 9, as Utah and the surrounding Western states seek to comply with the requirements of the EPA's Clean Power Plan, as well as meet state-mandated renewable portfolio standards. Compliance is highly likely to result in an increased reliance on low-emission, gas-fired generation.
The transaction also provides significant benefits to Dominion's investors. It will be immediately accretive to earnings per share, with limited impact on our balance sheet. It provides a significant addition to Dominion's inventory of top-quality, low-risk MLP-eligible assets. We intend to finance a portion of the acquisition through a contribution of Questar pipeline to Dominion Midstream Partners, taking advantage of the MLP's lower cost of capital and diversifying our equity funding sources. DM investors will benefit significantly, as the acquisition will add over $425 million of EBITDA to Dominion's already extensive inventory of high-quality MLP-eligible regulated assets.
We're very excited about this morning's announcement. I will be back in a few minutes to update you on our growth plans and take your questions. But now I'll turn the call over to Mark McGettrick."
267105,321990037,924272,"Dominion Midstream Partners, LP, Dominion Resources, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 01, 2016",2016-02-01,"Earnings Calls","Dominion Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you. And good afternoon.For those of you not familiar with Questar Corporation, we have summarized their business profile on Slide 13. Questar is a regulated, Rockies-based integrated natural gas company headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah. Its",1404,"Thank you. And good afternoon.
For those of you not familiar with Questar Corporation, we have summarized their business profile on Slide 13. Questar is a regulated, Rockies-based integrated natural gas company headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah. Its operations consist of 3 primary business segments.
Questar Gas is a regulated local distribution company, serving about 1 million customers in Utah, Wyoming and Idaho. Customer growth has averaged 2.5%, which is well above industry averages. Authorized ROEs are 9.5% to 9.85% on a $1.1 billion rate base with a 52% equity component. 
Questar Pipeline is a FERC-regulated transportation and storage system, strategically located to deliver gas to the Western region of the country. Its operating assets consist of 2,700 miles of pipeline and 56 billion cubic feet of storage capacity, operating under long-term fixed-fee contracts with creditworthy counterparties. Authorized ROEs range from 11.4% to 13%, and rate base is about $950 million.
The Regulated Gas Supply business has been operating under a regulated cost of service plus return model for 35 years. Its $600 million rate base is 100% equity capitalized, with a 2015 average realized return of 17%. Both the pipeline system and the Regulated Gas Supply business are MLP eligible.
Slide 14 shows the pro forma business profile of the combined companies' regulated gas infrastructure businesses. The acquisition increases our LDC rate base by nearly half and the number of customers by more than 75%. It increases our pipeline rate base by approximately 25% and our pipeline network by 1/3. 
The impact on Dominion's EBITDA mix is shown on Slide 15. While remaining roughly 90% regulated, the Questar acquisition improves the balance between electric and gas operations.
Questar Corporation will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Dominion Resources. Upon completion of the acquisition, around the 1st of next year, Questar Pipeline will be contributive to Dominion Midstream Partners probably in 2 steps. 
Slide 16 updates our planned drop schedule for DM from last year's analyst meeting. The first contribution of Questar Pipeline will provide sufficient coverage for Dominion Midstream to meet its 2017 distribution growth targets, which remain at 22% per year. The second drop will include the remaining investment in Questar Pipeline, which along with a small portion of the Cove Point asset, will fulfill our distribution growth for 2018. 
Any future drop of regulated gas supply assets will only be done in consultation with state regulators. This will allow Dominion to keep its investment in the Blue Racer joint venture at the parent till 2020 or later, enhancing its value and the future contribution due to its strong organic growth, and reduce the Cove Point EBITDA drop into DM in 2018, while maintaining our 22% distribution growth. Questar Pipeline business is a perfect match for the stable long-term regulated cash flow profile of Dominion Midstream Partners.
Slide 17 highlights our financing plan and the impact of Questar on our expected EPS growth rate. Value to Dominion from this acquisition does not depend on any significant levering of our balance sheet. We intend to prudently finance this transaction in line with our previously stated credit rating targets, using a combination of equity, mandatory convertibles and debt at Dominion, in addition to equity at Dominion Midstream to finance the drop of the pipeline business. As a reminder, we still do not need or do not plan to need any equity at Dominion Midstream in 2016.
The acquisition is immediately accretive to Dominion's earnings per share and will support the 2017 growth target, while allowing us to achieve or even exceed the top end of our growth target for 2018. As Tom Farrell mentioned earlier, we are excited about this transaction, the value it creates for Dominion shareholders and Dominion Midstream unitholders, and the opportunity it provides to continue to grow our gas infrastructure business.
We will take your questions in a few minutes, but first I want to review our results for 2015 and our earnings guidance for 2016.
Dominion Resources reported operating earnings of $0.70 per share for the fourth quarter of 2015, which was below our guidance range of $0.85 to $0.95 per share. Extremely mild weather in December, the timing of a planned farm-out restructuring and a higher-than-expected effective tax rate due to bonus depreciation were the primary factors to drive earnings below the range.
While we have discussed our sensitivity to weather in prior calls, never has it had the kind of impact that we saw in December. Slide 20 shows the cumulative temperature deviation from normal for each December over the last 50 years. The value for December 2015 is highlighted in red in the upper right-hand corner. Not only was this the warmest December in the last 50 years, it was nearly twice as warm as the previous record experienced in 1984. Our analysis indicates the warm temperatures accounted for $0.08 to $0.10 per share during the fourth quarter. 
Bonus depreciation will be a significant positive to our long-term cash position, but unfortunately, since the new law was retroactive back to January 1, it did not allow us to take $0.03 per share primarily from tax deductions anticipated in fourth quarter guidance. And finally, although we did not complete a planned farm-out restructuring last quarter, we do anticipate completing a new farm-out opportunity during calendar year 2016.
The earnings shortfall in the fourth quarter also caused full year 2015 operating earnings per share to be below our guidance range of $3.50 to $3.85 per share. 
GAAP earnings were $3.20 for the year. The principal differences between GAAP and operating earnings were charges associated with the Virginia legislation enacted in February that required the write-off of Virginia Power prior-period deferred fuel costs and charges associated with future ash pond closures. A reconciliation of operating earnings to reported earnings can be found on Schedule 2 of the Earnings Release Kit.
For the fourth quarter of 2015, Dominion Midstream Partners produced adjusted EBITDA of $23.6 million and distributable cash flow of $24.7 million, all consistent with management's expectations. On January 21, Dominion Midstream's Board of Directors declared a distribution of $0.2135 per unit, payable on February 15 to unitholders of record on February 5. This distribution represents a 7% increase over last quarter's payment and is consistent with our plan to achieve 22% annual distribution growth for LP units.
Moving to cash flow and treasury activities at Dominion. Funds from operations were $4.5 billion in 2015. Net commercial paper and letters of credit outstanding at the end of the year were $3.1 billion. We had $4.5 billion of credit facilities at the time. Taking into account cash and short-term investments, ended the year with liquidity of $1.4 billion. In January, we have increased our primary credit facility by $1 billion, taking our total credit lines to $5.5 billion. For statements of cash flow and liquidity, please see Pages 13 and 24 of the Earnings Release Kit.
As I mentioned earlier, an extension of bonus depreciation was included in the recent federal spending authorization. Dominion expects to be a significant cash beneficiary of bonus depreciations, because of our large capital programs. We anticipate a $2.5 billion cash flow benefit over the next several years.
Wrapping up our financing update, we would like to remind everyone that Dominion's Board of Directors authorized an 8.1% dividend increase in December for 2016. The new annual rate is $2.80 per share.
Now for earnings guidance for 2016. Dominion's operating earnings guidance is $3.60 to $4 per share for 2016. The midpoint of this range is 10% above the $3.44 earned in 2015. Positive drivers for this increase are revenues from our growth projects, lower capacity expenses, higher capacity of performance revenues and investment tax credits from our solar facilities. Offsetting factors include higher DD&A expenses, increased costs and share dilution from the conversion of the mandatory convertible units.
Dominion's operating earnings guidance for the first quarter of 2016 is $0.90 to $1.05 per share compared to $0.99 per share for the first quarter of 2015. The midpoint of this range represents a 5% increase over the weather-normalized $0.93 per share for the first quarter of 2015.
As to hedging, you can find our hedge positions on Page 26 of the Earnings Release Kit. As of mid-January, we have hedged 91% of our expected 2016 production at Millstone and 6% of our expected 2017 production.
I will now turn the call back to Tom Farrell."

Construction of the 1,358-megawatt combined-cycle facility in Brunswick County was about 96% complete at year-end. There are around 450 workers on site. All major equipment has been installed, and all 3 combustion turbines were successfully fired on natural gas during December. The facility is on time and on budget with an expected mid-2016 commercial operation date. 
The hearing on our request for a CPCN and rate rider for the proposed 1,588-megawatt Greensville County project was held on January 12. A decision from the State Corporation Commission is expected in April. This 3-on-1 combined-cycle facility is expected to achieve commercial operation in December 2018.
We continue to execute on our merchant solar strategy. Dominion completed 8 projects in 2015, totaling 171 megawatts in California, Utah and Georgia. Our projects for 2016 include 530 megawatts from 2 joint ventures located in Utah. These projects are under long-term PPAs and are expected to be in service in the third quarter.
In November, Dominion acquired an 80-megawatt project to be constructed on Virginia's eastern shore, supported by a PPA with Amazon and scheduled for operations in the fourth quarter of this year. In December -- in January, Dominion closed on our agreement for the sale of a 33% interest in 425 megawatts of our solar portfolio to SunEdison for approximately $300 million. 
We have a number of electric transmission projects at various stages of regulatory approval and construction. During the fourth quarter, $398 million of transmission assets were placed into service, bringing the full year total to a record $1 billion. 
Progress on our growth plan for Dominion Energy continues as well. We are continued to work for the commencement of construction on the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and the related Supply Header Project. We made formal FERC filings for these projects in September. Surveying and pipeline engineering is now over 90% complete. We have also contracted for about 70% of the project materials. We plan to begin construction on both projects in the fourth quarter of this year and begin operations in November 2018.
Now an update on our Cove Point liquefaction project. Overall, the project is approximately 56% complete as of year-end, and there are about 1,600 workers on site. Engineering is 97% complete. And all 34 of the construction packages have been approved by FERC. The project continues to be on time and on budget for a late 2017 in-service date.
We also have 13 energy growth projects underway, with $1.2 billion of investments to move more than 2 billion cubic feet per day for customers by the end of 2018. The Edgemoor project in South Carolina was placed into service in December, and the Western Access II project was placed into service in January. In the fourth quarter, we received FERC approval for 4 pipeline expansion projects planned to be in service later this year or early next.
So to summarize. We are very excited about our combination with Questar Corporation. It will be a premium-quality addition to Dominion and Dominion Midstream's portfolio. The combination provides geographic diversification for our natural gas operation and provides opportunities for future expansion. The transaction is consistent with Dominion and Dominion Midstream's strategic focus on regulated energy infrastructure businesses with MLP-qualifying assets. The transaction is immediately accretive to Dominion's earnings and provides a substantial addition to our inventory of MLB -- MLP-eligible operations.

We didn't have a slide on it, but I think that's an important question. We appreciate you asking it. This is how we view this currently, again, market conditions could change. But we expect to issue about $1.5 billion of incremental DRI debt to support the transaction. We also anticipate issuing about $0.5 billion of Dominion equity. We'll do that either through a dribble or a block trade sometime between now and when we anticipate closing on the transaction. And then the remainder, the takeout will be a combination of mandatory convertibles at Dominion, which has been a very popular financing vehicle for us with investors, and a drop into DM to support the 2017 EBITDA growth and distribution growth from a portion of the pipeline. We have a bridge facility for all the financing. And as part of that bridge facility, we have a term loan commitment that extends well beyond closing, that gives us significant flexibility for the MLP and when we might drop that. Right now, we said in the script that we have no plans and no need to have a drop into DM in 2016. And the equity that we would use from the pipeline drop in '17 is consistent with what we've said with this EBITDA drop all the way back to February for the distribution growth to go to 22% in 2017. So again, $1.5 billion or so of DRI debt, $0.5 billion DRI equity, and then the remainder a combination of mandatory convertibles at Dominion and MLP drop proceeds."

We are very confident that when we decide to come to market to support the 2017 drop, that we can either do that in a private placement, based on what we've been told by our holders, or in overnight transactions. So we're quite confident we can place the needs [ph] to support the drop.

We view that as a gas reserve business similar to what many other companies are trying to get in their rate base, which they've had for 35 years.

What we've said since our investor conference in February, that we will be actively looking for assets to add to our MLP. We -- and we have been doing that. As you know, we added a portion of the Iroquois pipeline to our portfolio. We added the Carolina Gas Transmission system. We were particularly attracted to Questar's assets, largely because of the pipeline. We're perfectly happy to -- with the LDC, which is one of the fastest-growing LDCs in the country. Utah has often been ranked as the #1 state in which to do business. And the Questar Gas is a fast-growing LDC. And it has very similar attributes to East Ohio gas. But it was the MLP-eligible assets that particularly caught our attention. And after we took a hard look at the region's Clean Power Plan goals or targets that the EPA has imposed. So this is a pipeline that's going to have a lot of growth opportunities, and a very well-run, active in the community, safety-conscious workforce at the LDC. So I wouldn't -- we're not looking all over the place, trying to buy anything. We're looking for, as we've said from the beginning, MLP-eligible assets. This takes care of -- we don't need anything. We have -- with this, '16 is already taken care of. This takes care of '17, part of '18. Blue Racer, if it's dropped, will be in the 2020s, sometime. So Dominion Midstream Partners has now available to it a long, long runway of contracted long-term gas infrastructure assets with 0 commodity risk in them.

During this call, we will refer to certain schedules included in this morning's earnings releases and pages from our Earnings Release Kit. Schedules in the Earnings Release Kit are intended to answer the more detailed questions pertaining to operating statistics and accounting. Investor Relations will be available after the call for any clarification of these schedules. If you've not done so, I encourage you to visit the Investor Relations page on our website, register for e-mail alerts and view our first quarter earnings document. Our website addresses are dom.com and dommidstream.com. In addition to the Earnings Release Kit, we have included a slide presentation on our website that will follow this morning's discussion. 
So now for the usual cautionary language. The earnings releases and other matters that will be discussed on the call today may contain forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings, including our most recent annual reports on Form 10-K and our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, for a discussion of factors that may cause results to differ from management's projections, forecasts and estimates and expectations. 
Also on this call we will discuss some measures of our companies' performance that differ from those recognized by GAAP. Reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures we are able to calculate and report are contained in the Earnings Release Kit and Dominion Midstream's press release. 
Joining us on the call this morning are our CEO, Tom Farrell; our CFO, Mark McGettrick; and other members of our management team. Mark will discuss our earnings results for the first quarter and Dominion's earnings guidance for the second quarter and full year 2016. Tom will review our operating and regulatory activities and review the progress we have made on our growth plans.

Dominion Resources reported operating earnings of $0.96 per share for the first quarter of 2016, landing in the middle of our guidance range of $0.90 to $1.05 per share. Earnings drivers were as expected, with the exception of slightly milde",1206,"Good morning. Dominion Resources reported operating earnings of $0.96 per share for the first quarter of 2016, landing in the middle of our guidance range of $0.90 to $1.05 per share. Earnings drivers were as expected, with the exception of slightly milder weather, which was $0.03 per share lower than normal. 
GAAP earnings were $0.88 per share for the first quarter. The principal difference between GAAP and operating earnings was the charge relating to an organizational restructuring across our company, made to improve the efficiency of our reporting structure. This onetime staffing charge will support lower labor expenses in the future. The reconciliation of operating earnings to reported earnings can be found on Schedule 2 of the Earnings Release Kit.
Moving to results by operating segment. At Dominion Virginia Power, EBITDA for the first quarter was $385 million, which was in the lower half of its guidance range. Kilowatt-hour sales were mostly below expectations, primarily due to mild weather. 
Dominion Generation produced EBITDA of $610 million in the first quarter, which was in the middle of its guidance range. Lower operating expenses offset lower merchant margins and lower-than-expected kilowatt-hour sales at Virginia Power. 
First quarter EBITDA for Dominion Energy was $377 million, which was in the upper half of its guidance range. Lower operating expenses were the principal driver of the strong results. 
On a consolidated basis, interest expenses and income taxes were in line with our expectations. Overall, we are pleased with the performance of each of our operating segments.
For the first quarter 2016, Dominion Midstream Partners produced adjusted EBITDA of $24.9 million, more than double the level produced in the first quarter of last year. Distributable cash flow increased 71% to $20.3 million, which was consistent with management's expectations. Because of our strong cash position, we elected to accelerate certain planned maintenance activities at Dominion Carolina Gas that led to higher expenses in the first quarter that will not appear in future periods. 
On April 19, Dominion Midstream's Board of Directors declared a distribution of $0.2245 per unit payable on May 13. This distribution represents a 5.2% increase over last quarter's payment and is consistent with our plan to achieve 22% annual distribution growth for LP units.
In the next few days, we are planning to file with the SEC aftermarket issuance program for up to $150 million in DM common units. As a reminder, we do not need to access the markets to fund Dominion Midstream's 2016 distribution growth. However, should we decide to utilize this program, it would improve the trading liquidity of DM units, something that many of our investors have asked us about.
Moving to cash flow and treasury activities at Dominion. Funds from operations were $1.1 billion for the first 3 months of the year. Commercial paper and letters of credit outstanding at the end of the quarter was $3.1 billion. We have $5.5 billion of credit facilities, and taking into account cash and short-term investments, ended the quarter with liquidity of $2.6 billion. For statements on cash flow and liquidity, please see Pages 14 and 25 of the Earnings Release Kit.
Our public financing activities so far this year have included $750 million of senior notes at [indiscernible] and $550 million of Junior subordinated notes, which were remarketed at the Dominion Resources level. This remarketing was related to the conversion of common equity of the first tranche of mandatory convertible units issued in 2013. The remaining $550 million tranche will be remarketed later this quarter. 
In addition, we raised $750 million of common equity through a block sale in April. $500 million for that sale has been earmarked for the Questar acquisition, while the remainder was for general corporate financing needs. We have a number of debt financing planned for the remainder of the year, including issuances at Dominion, Dominion Gas Holdings and VEPCO. In addition, you should expect us to issue incremental mandatory convertible units to support the Questar transaction as we outlined on our year-end earnings call.
Looking ahead to the second quarter. Dominion's operating earnings guidance is $0.65 to $0.75 per share compared to operating earnings of $0.73 per share for the second quarter of 2015. Positive earnings drivers for the quarter compared to last year are higher revenues from our growth projects, lower capacity expense and an increase in solar-related investment tax credits. Negative drivers for the quarter are refueling outages at Millstone, a return to normal weather and share dilution. 
Dominion's operating earnings guidance for the year remains $3.60 to $4 per share. Combining 2016 actual results for the first quarter, the second quarter guidance produces year-to-date results that are $0.06 per share below last year's. Because of this shake to earnings, we wanted to highlight the earnings drivers in the second half of 2016, which will allow us to achieve our annual guidance range.
Slide 8 shows 2015's 6 months actual results of $1.72 per share and the $0.06 per share projected decline for the first half of this year, primarily due to last year's weather and this years Millstone outage. However, we have some very significant growth drivers the last 6 months of this year.
First, we expect to return to normal weather, which will allow us to pick up $0.09 to last year's results. If you recall, the weather in the fourth quarter of last year was extremely mild. We also will not have a Millstone refueling outage this fall which picks up $0.07  for us. The combined benefits of higher capacity performance revenues and a lower payment [indiscernible] generators add $0.16 per share to year-over-year results. The majority of the benefit comes from capacity performance payments based on last year's option results and will begin this summer. Also as we have said previously, we're constructing more solar projects this year, which produces an incremental $0.04 per share for the period. And finally, our restructuring changes in normal growth produced $0.02 and $0.04 per share, respectively, of higher earnings for the 6-month period. We hope this breakdown of our growth in the second half of this year provides clarity to achieving our 2016 guidance.
As to hedging, you can find our hedge positions on Page 27 of the Earnings Release Kit. As of mid-April, we are hedged 93% of our expected 2016 production at Millstone and 8% of our expected 2017 production. 
Regarding Millstone, I would like to point out that multiple New England states, including Connecticut, have been discussing longer-term RFPs in them maintaining fuel diversity environmental benefits. I do not want to speculate on the outcome of these legislative discussions, but we will be an active participant in any future solicitations. 
So let me summarize my financial review. Operating earnings were $0.96 per share for the first quarter of 2016, which was in the middle of our guidance range. Operating results for Dominion Midstream Partners were in line with management's expectations, and adjusted EBITDA was more than double the level of last year's first quarter. And finally, Dominion's operating earnings guidance for the second quarter of 2016 is $0.65 to $0.75 per share, and our operating earnings guidance through the year remains $3.60 to $4 per share. 
I will now turn the call over to Tom Farrell."

Strong operational and safety performance continued in the first quarter. Dominion was ranked #1 safety among electric utilities in the Southeast. [indiscernible] reportables for each of our business units were roughly 1/2 the level recorded",1337,"Good morning. Strong operational and safety performance continued in the first quarter. Dominion was ranked #1 safety among electric utilities in the Southeast. [indiscernible] reportables for each of our business units were roughly 1/2 the level recorded last year, and last year had tied an all-time company record. In fact, excluding contractor-related incidents, Dominion Generation had 0 OSHA recordables in the first quarter. 
Our nuclear fleet continues to operate very well. The net capacity factor of our 6 units was 96.2% for the first 3 months of the year. The contribution of the Warren County car stations helped our regulated power generation group achieved record net generation during the first quarter. 
North Anna Unit 2 completed a 512 consecutive day ramp when it came offline in March for its scheduled refueling. This break or break a run was a record for the unit. As Mark noted in our second quarter guidance, Millstone Unit 3 is currently in the plant refueling outage and is on plan to return to service this month. 
Now for an update on our growth plans. The 1,358-megawatt Brunswick County Power Station began commercial operations last week, completing a construction schedule that begun August of 2013 and was completed ahead of time and under budget. At the height of the construction, the station had more than 1,500 workers on site. Brunswick Power Station is anticipated at 43 employees and an annual payroll of about $7.5 million. In the first full year of the station's operation, the fuel savings had been estimated to be nearly $100 million. Those fuel savings will continue over the life of plant, and the station is expected to save consumers over $1 billion.
Development and engineering continues on our next-generation construction project with 1,588-megawatt Greensville County three-on-one combined cycle power station. On March 29, Virginia State Corporation Commission approved the CPCN and rate rider for the Greenfield project. Major contracts have been executed, including the combustion turbine supply agreement with power systems and the EPC agreement with Fluor. These are the same organizations that just completed the Brunswick County plant located about 5 miles away. We expect receiving air permit from the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality by the end of this quarter. $1.3 billion project is expected to achieve commercial operations in late 2018.
Construction on our 2 large contracted solar projects, Four Brothers and Three Cedars in Utah, continues on time and on budget. Dominion is currently overseeing the construction, and both projets are expected to be in-service during the fall of this year. 
Construction of the 80-megawatt solar facility in Virginia's Eastern shore also commenced during the first quarter and is expected to be complete in the fourth quarter of this year. The output from the Eastern shore facility is under contract with Amazon.
We are also working on a number of regulated solar projects within the state of Virginia. A hearing on the application with Virginia State Corporation Commission for the construction of 3 solar facilities within the state was held in March and the ruling is expected by July 1. If approved, these facilities totaling 56 megawatts would be in-service by late this year. 
Today, we will be filing with State Corporation Commission for a CPCN for 20 megawatts [indiscernible] facility at the site of our Remington Power Station. The output facility will be sold to the Commonwealth of Virginia and renewable energy credits will be sold to Microsoft, who will retire them. 
We have a number of electric transmission projects at various stages of regulatory approval and construction. 3 of these were completed in the first quarter, including Phase I that allowed the Pleasant View 500 KB rebuilt. We expect to place approximately $650 million of new transmission assets into service this year. 
An application for Phase I our strategic program was filed with State Corporation Commission in December. The filing, which includes a cost benefit analysis, covers 400 miles of distribution lines to be converted by August of this year at a cost of $140 million. 
Progress on our growth plan for Dominion Energy continues as well. Our Cove Point liquefaction project is approximately 64% complete and there are about 1,600 workers on site. Engineering is 99% complete, and 98% of the engineered equipment has been procured. The project continues on time and on budget for a late 2017 in-service date. 
We are continuing to work toward the commencement of construction on the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and the related Supply Header Project. We made the formal FERC filings for these projects last September. In March, after extensive consultation with stakeholders, we provided information to FERC on a route alternative to address agency and public input and to avoid more sensitive areas in the national force. Just this week, we received the supplemental notice of intent to prepare environmental impact statement as modified to include the rework. This is a very positive development, and we are pleased with our progress at FERC. We anticipate getting a FERC order to allow us to begin construction by mid-2017. Surveying pipeline engineering is nearly complete and will be furnished -- finished this year. Material [indiscernible] is now over 70% complete, and we expect to finish the construction contract this quarter. We have modified the sequence of construction with our contractors. As a result, the modest delay in permit will not delay the completion of the Atlantic Coast Pipeline or the supply header scheduled in late 2018. 
We had 1 pipeline project online in December in South Carolina, [indiscernible] 45,000 dekatherms per day, and Western Access II went online in January with 450,000 dekatherms per day capacity. 
We currently have an additional 11 pipeline growth projects underway, with $1 billion of investment to move more than 1.5 billion cubic feet per day for customers by the end of 2018. The majority of these projects are demand-driven, moving gas engines power generation for local distribution companies.
Turning to our farmout activity, we have enjoyed significant success with our Marcellus and Utica acreage farmout program, which began in 2013. Our current focus is on the portfolio of remaining Utica acreage packages and the prospect of restructuring the previously completed transactions. While many producers are pulling back near-term drilling plans, there remain significant interest in several areas throughout our farmout program. We are currently in discussions with multiple cohorts and expect to again realize significant value later this year. 
On March 31, Dominion filed its base rate case for our North Carolina service territory, seeking approval of $51.1 million increase in base rate revenues based on a 10.5% return on equity. Most of the proposed increase is expected to be offset by reductions in the fuel factor in a 2-year rider to refund excess deferred income taxes. The company has requested to implement the new rates on a temporary basis on November 1, with permanent rates being in effect on January 1. 
Finally, I want to update you on our pending merger with Questar Corporation. Hart-Scott Rodino clearance for the Questar transaction was received on February 22, and their shareholder vote is scheduled for May 12. Merger applications were filed with the Utah and Wyoming Public Service Commissions, and notice was provided to the Idaho Commission. Technical conferences were completed last week, and discovery is underway. Utah hearing scheduled for August 22, and the Wyoming hearing is scheduled for September 14. We expect to close the transaction later this year.
So to summarize, our business has delivered strong operating and exceptional safety performance in the first quarter. The Brunswick County Power Station is now complete and in-service, ahead of time and under budget. The Greensville County project has been approved, and site preparation is underway. We continue to work toward FERC approval in the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and the Supply Header Project. Construction of the Cove Point liquefaction project is on time and on budget. And we are working towards the successful close of our combination with Questar Corporation later this year. 
Thank you, and we are ready to take questions."

And if you add on top of that the Millstone capacity in '17 over '16, we'll actually have increased our total income associated with capacity from '16 to '17 when you combine those 3 together. But we were very, very large beneficiary. And as you referenced, year-over-year, $0.16 for capacity performance, it's $0.14 in the last 6 months, and there's about $0.02 worth of incremental rolloff of notes in the last 6 months. That brings you to your $0.16 total."

I believe Connecticut's legislature finishes their work today. But I think this is part of a dialogue that's going on all through New England and that's going to continue. It's going on in Massachusetts, it's happening in Maine, it's happening in New Hampshire, on how to deal with the carbon rules and existing carbon-free generation, of which Millstone, obviously, is the largest asset in New England. It provides half of Connecticut's power when both units are operating in these normal operations. And Connecticut has very little prospect to complying with carbon rules if Millstone were to shut down at some point. So I think the legislature political hierarchy in Connecticut is aware of that. We are following the legislation, obviously, closely. But I think it's part of an overall dialogue that will take place over the next few months in New England, generally, about how to protect these assets, of which I guess there are 2 left that are still that going to be running, Seabrook and Millstone, which is about 2x the size of Seabrook."

Dominion Resources reported operating earnings of $0.96 per share for the first quarter of 2016, landing in the middle of our guidance range of $0.90 to $1.05 per share. Earnings drivers were as expected, with the exception of slightly milde",1211,"Good morning. Dominion Resources reported operating earnings of $0.96 per share for the first quarter of 2016, landing in the middle of our guidance range of $0.90 to $1.05 per share. Earnings drivers were as expected, with the exception of slightly milder weather, which was $0.03 per share lower than normal. 
GAAP earnings were $0.88 per share for the first quarter. The principal difference between GAAP and operating earnings was a charge relating to an organizational restructuring across our company made to improve the efficiency of our reporting structure. This onetime staffing charge will support lower labor expenses in the future. A reconciliation of operating earnings to reported earnings can be found on Schedule 2 of the Earnings Release Kit.
Moving to results by operating segment. At Dominion Virginia Power, EBITDA for the first quarter was $385 million, which was in the lower half of its guidance range. Kilowatt-hour sales were modestly below expectations, primarily due to mild weather. 
Dominion Generation produced EBITDA of $610 million in the first quarter, which was in the middle of its guidance range. Lower operating expenses offset lower merchant margins and lower-than-expected kilowatt-hour sales at Virginia Power. 
First quarter EBITDA for Dominion Energy was $377 million, which was in the upper half of its guidance range. Lower operating expenses were the principal driver of the strong results. 
On a consolidated basis, interest expenses and income taxes were in line with our expectations. Overall, we are pleased with the performance of each of our operating segments.
For the first quarter of 2016, Dominion Midstream Partners produced adjusted EBITDA of $24.9 million, more than double the level produced in the first quarter of last year. Distributable cash flow increased 71% to $20.3 million, which was consistent with management's expectations. Because of our strong cash position, we elected to accelerate certain planned maintenance activities at Dominion Carolina Gas that led to higher expenses in the first quarter that will not appear in future periods. 
On April 19, Dominion Midstream's Board of Directors declared a distribution of $0.2245 per unit payable on May 13. This distribution represents a 5.2% increase over last quarter's payment and is consistent with our plan to achieve 22% annual distribution growth for LP units.
In the next few days, we are planning to file with the SEC for an aftermarket issuance program for up to $150 million in DM common units. As a reminder, we do not need to access the markets to fund Dominion Midstream's 2016 distribution growth. However, should we decide to utilize this program, it would improve the trading liquidity of DM units, something that many of our investors have asked us about.
Moving to cash flow and treasury activities at Dominion. Funds from operations were $1.1 billion for the first 3 months of the year. Commercial paper and letters of credit outstanding at the end of the quarter was $3.1 billion. We have $5.5 billion of credit facilities, and taking into account cash and short-term investments, ended the quarter with liquidity of $2.6 billion. For statements of cash flow and liquidity, please see Pages 14 and 25 of the Earnings Release Kit.
Our public financing activities so far this year have included $750 million of senior notes at VEPCO and $550 million of junior subordinated notes, which were remarketed at the Dominion Resources level. This remarketing was related to the conversion of common equity of the first tranche of mandatory convertible units issued in 2013. The remaining $550 million tranche will be remarketed later this quarter. 
In addition, we raised $750 million of common equity through a block sale in April. $500 million from that sale has been earmarked for the Questar acquisition, while the remainder was for general corporate financing needs. We have a number of debt financing planned for the remainder of the year, including issuances at Dominion, Dominion Gas Holdings and VEPCO. In addition, you should expect us to issue incremental mandatory convertible units to support the Questar transaction, as we outlined on our year-end earnings call.
Looking ahead to the second quarter. Dominion's operating earnings guidance is $0.65 to $0.75 per share compared to operating earnings of $0.73 per share for the second quarter of 2015. Positive earnings drivers for the quarter compared to last year are higher revenues from our growth projects, lower capacity expense and an increase in solar-related investment tax credits. Negative drivers for the quarter are refueling outage at Millstone, a return to normal weather and share dilution. 
Dominion's operating earnings guidance for the year remains: $3.60 to $4 per share. Combining 2016 actual results for the first quarter, the second quarter guidance produces year-to-date results that are $0.06 per share below last year's. Because of this shave to earnings, we wanted to highlight the earnings drivers in the second half of 2016, which will allow us to achieve our annual guidance range.
Slide 8 shows 2015's 6 months actual results of $1.72 per share and the $0.06 per share projected decline for the first half of this year, primarily due to last year's weather and this year's Millstone outage. However, we have some very significant growth drivers the last 6 months of this year.
First, we expect to return to normal weather, which will allow us to pick up $0.09 to last year's results. If you recall, the weather in the fourth quarter of last year was extremely mild. We also will not have a Millstone refueling outage this fall, which picks up $0.07  for us. The combined benefits of higher capacity performance revenues and lower payment to nonutility generators add $0.16 per share to the year-over-year results. A majority of the benefit comes from capacity performance payments based on last year's auction results and will begin this summer. Also, as we have said previously, we're constructing more solar projects this year, which produces an incremental $0.04 per share for the period. And finally, our restructuring changes and normal growth produce $0.02 and $0.04 per share, respectively, of higher earnings for the 6-month period. We hope this breakdown of our growth in the second half of this year provides clarity to achieving our 2016 guidance.
As to hedging, you can find our hedge positions on Page 27 of the Earnings Release Kit. As of mid-April, we are hedged 93% of our expected 2016 production at Millstone and 8% of our expected 2017 production. 
Regarding Millstone, I would like to point out that multiple New England states, including Connecticut, have been discussing longer-term RFPs aimed at maintaining fuel diversity and environmental benefits. I do not want to speculate on the outcome of these legislative discussions, but we will be an active participant in any future solicitations. 
So let me summarize my financial review. Operating earnings were $0.96 per share for the first quarter of 2016, which was in the middle of our guidance range. Operating results for Dominion Midstream Partners were in line with management's expectations, and adjusted EBITDA was more than double the level of last year's first quarter. And finally, Dominion's operating earnings guidance for the second quarter of 2016 is $0.65 to $0.75 per share, and our operating earnings guidance for the year remains, $3.60 to $4 per share. 
I will now turn the call over to Tom Farrell."

Dominion was ranked #1 in safety among electric utilities in the Southeast. OSHA recordables for each of our business units were roughly 1/2 the level recorded last year, and last year had tied an all-time company record. In fact, excluding contractor-related incidents, Dominion Generation had 0 OSHA recordables in the first quarter. 
Our nuclear fleet continues to operate very well. The net capacity factor of our 6 units was 96.2% for the first 3 months of the year. The contribution of the Warren County power station helped our regulated power generation group achieve record net generation during the first quarter. 
North Anna Unit 2 completed a 512-consecutive-day run when it came offline in March for its scheduled refueling. This record-breaker run was a record for the unit. As Mark noted in our second quarter guidance, Millstone Unit 3 is currently in a planned refueling outage and is on plan to return to service this month. 
Now for an update on our growth plans. The 1,358-megawatt Brunswick County Power Station began commercial operations last week, completing a construction schedule that began in August of 2013 and was completed ahead of time and under budget. At the height of the construction, the station had more than 1,500 workers on site. Brunswick Power Station is anticipated to have 43 employees and an annual payroll of about $7.5 million. In the first full year of the station's operation, the fuel savings have been estimated to be nearly $100 million. Those fuel savings will continue over the life of the plant, and the station is expected to save consumers over $1 billion.
Development and engineering continues on our next-generation construction project with 1,588-megawatt Greensville County 3-on-1 combined cycle power station. On March 29, the Virginia State Corporation Commission approved the CPCN and rate rider for the Greensville project. Major contracts have been executed, including the combustion turbine supply agreement with MH Power Systems and the EPC agreement with Fluor. These are the same organizations that just completed the Brunswick County plant located about 5 miles away. We expect to receive the air permit from the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality by the end of this quarter. The $1.3 billion project is expected to achieve commercial operations in late 2018.
Construction on our 2 large contracted solar projects, Four Brothers and Three Cedars in Utah, continues on time and on budget. Dominion is currently overseeing the construction, and both projects are expected to be in service during the fall of this year. 
Construction of the 80-megawatt solar facility in Virginia's Eastern Shore also commenced during the first quarter and is expected to be complete in the fourth quarter of this year. The output from the Eastern Shore facility is under contract with Amazon.
We are also working on a number of regulated solar projects within the state of Virginia. A hearing on the application with Virginia State Corporation Commission for the construction of 3 solar facilities within the state was held in March and a ruling is expected by July 1. If approved, these facilities totaling 56 megawatts would be in service by late this year. 
Today, we will be filing with the State Corporation Commission for a CPCN for a 20-megawatt solar facility at the site of our Remington Power Station. The output from the facility will be sold to the Commonwealth of Virginia and the renewable energy credits will be sold to Microsoft, who will retire them. 
We have a number of electric transmission projects at various stages of regulatory approval and construction. Three of these were completed in the first quarter, including Phase 1 of the Loudoun-Pleasant View 500 kV rebuild. We expect to place approximately $650 million of new transmission assets into service this year. 
An application for Phase 1 our strategic underground program was filed with the State Corporation Commission in December. The filing, which includes a cost benefit analysis, covers 400 miles of distribution lines to be converted by August of this year at a cost of $140 million. 
Progress on our growth plan for Dominion Energy continues as well. Our Cove Point liquefaction project is approximately 64% complete, and there are about 1,600 workers on site. Engineering is 99% complete and 98% of the engineered equipment has been procured. The project continues on time and on budget for a late 2017 in-service date. 
We are continuing to work toward the commencement of construction on the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and the related Supply Header Project. We made the formal FERC filings for these projects last September. In March, after extensive consultation with stakeholders, we provided information to FERC on a route alternative to address agency and public input and to avoid more sensitive areas in the national force. Just this week, we received a supplemental notice of intent to prepare an environmental impact statement that is modified to include the reroute. This is a very positive development, and we are pleased with our progress at FERC. We anticipate getting a FERC order to allow us to begin construction by mid-2017. Surveying and pipeline engineering is nearly complete and will be furnished -- finished this year. Material procurement is now over 70% complete, and we expect to finish the construction contracts this quarter. We have modified the sequence of construction with our contractors. As a result, the modest delay in permitting will not delay the completion of the Atlantic Coast Pipeline or the Supply Header scheduled in late 2018. 
We had one pipeline project online in December in South Carolina, flowing 45,000 dekatherms per day, and Western Access II went online in January with 450,000 dekatherms per day capacity. 
We currently have an additional 11 pipeline growth projects underway, with $1 billion of investment to move more than 1.5 billion cubic feet per day for customers by the end of 2018. The majority of these projects are demand-driven, moving gas to end-use power generation for local distribution companies.
Turning to our farmout activity. We have enjoyed significant success with our Marcellus and Utica acreage farmout program, which began in 2013. Our current focus is on the portfolio of remaining Utica acreage packages and the prospect of restructuring our previously completed transactions. While many producers are pulling back near-term drilling plans, there remains significant interest in several areas throughout our farmout program. We are currently in discussions with multiple cohorts and expect to again realize significant value later this year. 
On March 31, Dominion filed its base rate case for our North Carolina service territory, seeking approval of a $51.1 million increase in base rate revenues based on a 10.5% return on equity. Most of the proposed increase is expected to be offset by reductions in the fuel factor and a 2-year rider to refund excess deferred income taxes. The company has requested to implement the new rates on a temporary basis on November 1, with permanent rates to be in effect on January 1. 
Finally, I want to update you on our pending merger with Questar Corporation. Hart-Scott-Rodino clearance for the Questar transaction was received on February 22, and their shareholder vote is scheduled for May 12. Merger applications were filed with the Utah and Wyoming Public Service Commissions, and notice was provided to the Idaho Commission. Technical conferences were completed last week and discovery is underway. The Utah hearing is scheduled for August 22, and the Wyoming hearing is scheduled for September 14. We expect to close the transaction later this year.
So to summarize, our business has delivered strong operating and exceptional safety performance in the first quarter. The Brunswick County Power Station is now complete and in service, ahead of time and under budget. The Greensville County project has been approved and site preparation is underway. We continue to work toward FERC approval for the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and the Supply Header Project. Construction of the Cove Point liquefaction project is on time and on budget. And we are working towards the successful close of our combination with Questar Corporation later this year. 
Thank you, and we are ready to take questions."

I believe Connecticut's legislature finishes their work today. But I think this is part of a dialogue that's going on all through New England, and that's going to continue. It's going on in Massachusetts, it's happening in Maine, it's happening in New Hampshire, on how to deal with the carbon rules and existing carbon-free generation, of which Millstone, obviously, is the largest asset in New England. It provides half of Connecticut's power when both units are operating and in its normal operations. And Connecticut has very little prospect of complying with carbon rules if Millstone were to shut down at some point. So I think the legislature, the political hierarchy in Connecticut is aware of that. We're following the legislation, obviously, closely. But I think it's part of an overall dialogue that will take place over the next few months in New England, generally, about how to protect these assets, of which, I guess, there are only 2 left that are still going to be running, Seabrook and Millstone, which is about 2x the size of Seabrook."

And so you'll see a full year's benefit in 2017 and a partial benefit in 2016. In terms of ongoing O&M, we're targeting a flat to CPI growth on O&M going forward. It'll probably be different year-by-year, and the only thing that would change on that of significance would be the outage period for Millstone, where you might have 2 outages versus 1 in a given year.

The earnings releases and other matters that will be discussed on the call today may contain forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings, including our most recent annual reports on Form 10-K and our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, for a discussion of factors that may cause results to differ from management's projections, forecasts, estimates and expectations. 
Also, on this call, we will discuss some measures of our companies' performance that differ from those recognized by GAAP. Reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures we are able to calculate and report are contained in the Earnings Release Kit and Dominion Midstream's press release. 
Joining us on the call this morning are our CEO, Tom Farrell; our CFO, Mark McGettrick; and other members of our management team. Mark will discuss our earnings results for the first quarter and Dominion's earnings guidance for the second quarter and full year 2016.

Earnings drivers were as expected, with the exception of slightly milde",1211,"Good morning. Dominion Resources reported operating earnings of $0.96 per share for the first quarter of 2016, landing in the middle of our guidance range of $0.90 to $1.05 per share. Earnings drivers were as expected, with the exception of slightly milder weather, which was $0.03 per share lower than normal. 
GAAP earnings were $0.88 per share for the first quarter. The principal difference between GAAP and operating earnings was a charge relating to an organizational restructuring across our company made to improve the efficiency of our reporting structure. This onetime staffing charge will support lower labor expenses in the future. The reconciliation of operating earnings to reported earnings can be found on Schedule 2 of the Earnings Release Kit.
Moving to results by operating segment. At Dominion Virginia Power, EBITDA for the first quarter was $385 million, which was in the lower half of its guidance range. Kilowatt-hour sales were modestly below expectations, primarily due to mild weather. 
Dominion Generation produced EBITDA of $610 million in the first quarter, which was in the middle of its guidance range. Lower operating expenses offset lower merchant margins and lower-than-expected kilowatt-hour sales at Virginia Power. 
First quarter EBITDA for Dominion Energy was $377 million, which was in the upper half of its guidance range. Lower operating expenses were the principal driver of the strong results. 
On a consolidated basis, interest expenses and income taxes were in line with our expectations. Overall, we are pleased with the performance of each of our operating segments.
For the first quarter of 2016, Dominion Midstream Partners produced adjusted EBITDA of $24.9 million, more than double the level produced in the first quarter of last year. Distributable cash flow increased 71% to $20.3 million, which was consistent with management's expectations. Because of our strong cash position, we elected to accelerate certain planned maintenance activities at Dominion Carolina Gas that led to higher expenses in the first quarter that will not appear in future periods. 
On April 19, Dominion Midstream's Board of Directors declared a distribution of $0.2245 per unit payable on May 13. This distribution represents a 5.2% increase over last quarter's payment and is consistent with our plan to achieve 22% annual distribution growth for LP units.
In the next few days, we are planning to file with the SEC for an aftermarket issuance program for up to $150 million in DM common units. As a reminder, we do not need to access the markets to fund Dominion Midstream's 2016 distribution growth. However, should we decide to utilize this program, it would improve the trading liquidity of DM units, something that many of our investors have asked us about.
Moving to cash flow and treasury activities at Dominion. Funds from operations were $1.1 billion for the first 3 months of the year. Commercial paper and letters of credit outstanding at the end of the quarter were $3.1 billion. We have $5.5 billion of credit facilities, and taking into account cash and short-term investments, ended the quarter with liquidity of $2.6 billion. For statements of cash flow and liquidity, please see Pages 14 and 25 of the Earnings Release Kit.
Our public financing activities so far this year have included $750 million of senior notes at VEPCO and $550 million of junior subordinated notes, which were remarketed at the Dominion Resources level. This remarketing was related to the conversion of common equity of the first tranche of mandatory convertible units issued in 2013. The remaining $550 million tranche will be remarketed later this quarter. 
In addition, we raised $750 million of common equity through a block sale in April. $500 million from that sale has been earmarked for the Questar acquisition, while the remainder was for general corporate financing needs. We have a number of debt financing planned for the remainder of the year, including issuances at Dominion, Dominion Gas Holdings and VEPCO. In addition, you should expect us to issue incremental mandatory convertible units to support the Questar transaction, as we outlined on our year-end earnings call.
Looking ahead to the second quarter. Dominion's operating earnings guidance is $0.65 to $0.75 per share compared to operating earnings of $0.73 per share for the second quarter of 2015. Positive earnings drivers for the quarter compared to last year are higher revenues from our growth projects, lower capacity expense and an increase in solar-related investment tax credits. Negative drivers for the quarter are refueling outage at Millstone, a return to normal weather and share dilution. 
Dominion's operating earnings guidance for the year remains: $3.60 to $4 per share. Combining 2016 actual results for the first quarter, the second quarter guidance produces year-to-date results that are $0.06 per share below last year's. Because of this shave to earnings, we wanted to highlight the earnings drivers in the second half of 2016, which will allow us to achieve our annual guidance range.
Slide 8 shows 2015's 6 months actual results of $1.72 per share and the $0.06 per share projected decline for the first half of this year, primarily due to last year's weather and this year's Millstone outage. However, we have some very significant growth drivers the last 6 months of this year.
First, we expect to return to normal weather, which will allow us to pick up $0.09 to last year's results. If you recall, the weather in the fourth quarter of last year was extremely mild. We also will not have a Millstone refueling outage this fall, which picks up $0.07  for us. The combined benefits of higher capacity performance revenues and lower payment to nonutility generators add $0.16 per share to the year-over-year results. A majority of the benefit comes from capacity performance payments based on last year's auction results and will begin this summer. Also, as we have said previously, we're constructing more solar projects this year, which produces an incremental $0.04 per share for the period. And finally, our restructuring changes and normal growth produce $0.02 and $0.04 per share, respectively, of higher earnings for the 6-month period. We hope this breakdown of our growth in the second half of this year provides clarity to achieving our 2016 guidance.
As to hedging, you can find our hedge positions on Page 27 of the Earnings Release Kit. As of mid-April, we are hedged 93% of our expected 2016 production at Millstone and 8% of our expected 2017 production. 
Regarding Millstone, I would like to point out that multiple New England states, including Connecticut, have been discussing longer-term RFPs aimed at maintaining fuel diversity and environmental benefits. I do not want to speculate on the outcome of these legislative discussions, but we will be an active participant in any future solicitations. 
So let me summarize my financial review. Operating earnings were $0.96 per share for the first quarter of 2016, which was in the middle of our guidance range. Operating results for Dominion Midstream Partners were in line with management's expectations, and adjusted EBITDA was more than double the level of last year's first quarter. And finally, Dominion's operating earnings guidance for the second quarter of 2016 is $0.65 to $0.75 per share, and our operating earnings guidance for the year remains, $3.60 to $4 per share. 
I will now turn the call over to Tom Farrell."

Dominion was ranked #1 in safety among electric utilities in the Southeast. OSHA recordables for each of our business units were roughly 1/2 the level recorded last year, and last year had tied an all-time company record. In fact, excluding contractor-related incidents, Dominion Generation had 0 OSHA recordables in the first quarter. 
Our nuclear fleet continues to operate very well. The net capacity factor of our 6 units was 96.2% for the first 3 months of the year. The contribution of the Warren County power station helped our regulated power generation group achieve record net generation during the first quarter. 
North Anna Unit 2 completed a 512-consecutive-day run when it came offline in March for its scheduled refueling. This record-breaker run was a record for the unit. As Mark noted in our second quarter guidance, Millstone Unit 3 is currently in a planned refueling outage and is on plan to return to service this month. 
Now for an update on our growth plans. The 1,358-megawatt Brunswick County Power Station began commercial operations last week, completing a construction schedule that began in August of 2013 and was completed ahead of time and under budget. At the height of the construction, the station had more than 1,500 workers on site. Brunswick Power Station is anticipated to have 43 employees and an annual payroll of about $7.5 million. In the first full year of the station's operation, the fuel savings have been estimated to be nearly $100 million. Those fuel savings will continue over the life of the plant, and the station is expected to save consumers over $1 billion.
Development and engineering continues on our next-generation construction project with 1,588-megawatt Greensville County 3-on-1 combined cycle power station. On March 29, the Virginia State Corporation Commission approved the CPCN and rate rider for the Greensville project. Major contracts have been executed, including the combustion turbine supply agreement with MH Power Systems and the EPC agreement with Fluor. These are the same organizations that just completed the Brunswick County plant located about 5 miles away. We expect to receive the air permit from the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality by the end of this quarter. The $1.3 billion project is expected to achieve commercial operations in late 2018.
Construction on our 2 large contracted solar projects, Four Brothers and Three Cedars in Utah, continues on time and on budget. Dominion is currently overseeing the construction, and both projects are expected to be in service during the fall of this year. 
Construction of the 80-megawatt solar facility in Virginia's Eastern Shore also commenced during the first quarter and is expected to be complete in the fourth quarter of this year. The output from the Eastern Shore facility is under contract with Amazon.
We are also working on a number of regulated solar projects within the state of Virginia. A hearing on the application with Virginia State Corporation Commission for the construction of 3 solar facilities within the state was held in March and a ruling is expected by July 1. If approved, these facilities totaling 56 megawatts would be in service by late this year. 
Today, we will be filing with the State Corporation Commission for a CPCN for a 20-megawatt solar facility at the site of our Remington Power Station. The output from the facility will be sold to the Commonwealth of Virginia and the renewable energy credits will be sold to Microsoft, who will retire them. 
We have a number of electric transmission projects at various stages of regulatory approval and construction. Three of these were completed in the first quarter, including Phase 1 of the Loudoun-Pleasant View 500 kV rebuild. We expect to place approximately $650 million of new transmission assets into service this year. 
An application for Phase 1 of our strategic underground program was filed with the State Corporation Commission in December. The filing, which includes a cost benefit analysis, covers 400 miles of distribution lines to be converted by August of this year at a cost of $140 million. 
Progress on our growth plan for Dominion Energy continues as well. Our Cove Point liquefaction project is approximately 64% complete, and there are about 1,600 workers on site. Engineering is 99% complete and 98% of the engineered equipment has been procured. The project continues on time and on budget for a late 2017 in-service date. 
We are continuing to work toward the commencement of construction on the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and the related Supply Header Project. We made the formal FERC filings for these projects last September. In March, after extensive consultation with stakeholders, we provided information to FERC on a route alternative to address agency and public input and to avoid more sensitive areas in the national force. Just this week, we received a supplemental notice of intent to prepare an environmental impact statement that is modified to include the reroute. This is a very positive development, and we are pleased with our progress at FERC. We anticipate getting a FERC order to allow us to begin construction by mid-2017. Surveying and pipeline engineering is nearly complete and will be furnished -- finished this year. Material procurement is now over 70% complete, and we expect to finish the construction contracts this quarter. We have modified the sequence of construction with our contractors. As a result, the modest delay in permitting will not delay the completion of the Atlantic Coast Pipeline or the Supply Header scheduled in late 2018. 
We had one pipeline project online in December in South Carolina, flowing 45,000 dekatherms per day, and Western Access II went online in January with 450,000 dekatherms per day capacity. 
We currently have an additional 11 pipeline growth projects underway, with $1 billion of investment to move more than 1.5 billion cubic feet per day for customers by the end of 2018. The majority of these projects are demand-driven, moving gas to end-use power generation for local distribution companies.
Turning to our farmout activity. We have enjoyed significant success with our Marcellus and Utica acreage farmout program, which began in 2013. Our current focus is on the portfolio of remaining Utica acreage packages and the prospect of restructuring a previously completed transaction. While many producers are pulling back near-term drilling plans, there remains significant interest in several areas throughout our farmout program. We are currently in discussions with multiple cohorts and expect to again realize significant value later this year. 
On March 31, Dominion filed its base rate case for our North Carolina service territory, seeking approval of a $51.1 million increase in base rate revenues based on a 10.5% return on equity. Most of the proposed increase is expected to be offset by reductions in the fuel factor in a 2-year rider to refund excess deferred income taxes. The company has requested to implement the new rates on a temporary basis on November 1, with permanent rates to be in effect on January 1. 
Finally, I want to update you on our pending merger with Questar Corporation. Hart-Scott-Rodino clearance for the Questar transaction was received on February 22, and their shareholder vote is scheduled for May 12. Merger applications were filed with the Utah and Wyoming Public Service Commissions, and notice was provided to the Idaho Commission. Technical conferences were completed last week and discovery is underway. The Utah hearing is scheduled for August 22, and the Wyoming hearing is scheduled for September 14. We expect to close the transaction later this year.
So to summarize, our business has delivered strong operating and exceptional safety performance in the first quarter. The Brunswick County Power Station is now complete and in service, ahead of time and under budget. The Greensville County project has been approved's and site preparation is underway. We continue to work toward FERC approval for the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and the Supply Header Project. Construction of the Cove Point liquefaction project is on time and on budget. And we are working towards the successful close of our combination with Questar Corporation later this year. 
Thank you, and we are ready to take questions."

The program that was referenced was really an effort across all the businesses and the corporate support areas to drive decision-making to a lower level, eliminate layers of management, increase management control and make the decision-making really more efficient by having those fewer layers. So that was the focus. We took a charge of about $70 million pretax. I think it's $43 million after tax. And those labor costs will be recouped as the employees move on. And so you'll see a full year's benefit in 2017 and a partial benefit in 2016. In terms of ongoing O&M, we're targeting a flat to CPI growth on O&M going forward. It'll probably be different year-by-year, and the only thing that would change on that of significance would be the outage period for Millstone, where you might have 2 outages versus 1 in a given year.

Please refer to our SEC filings, including our most recent annual reports on Form 10-K and our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, for a discussion of factors that may cause results to differ from management's projections, forecasts, estimates and expectations.

Dominion Resources reported operating earnings of $0.71 per share for the second quarter of 2016, finishing in the upper half of our guidance range of $0.65 to $0.75 per share. Operating earnings would have been at the top of our guidance range were it not for the impact of milder-than-normal weather and higher storm restoration costs. 
GAAP earnings were $0.73 per share for the second quarter. The principal difference between GAAP and operating earnings was a gain related to our investments in nuclear decommissioning trust funds. A reconciliation of operating earnings to reported earnings can be found on Schedule 2 of the Earnings Release Kit. 
Moving to results by operating segment. At Dominion Virginia Power, EBITDA for the second quarter was $363 million, which was in the lower half of its guidance range. Negative drivers for the quarter were higher major storm restoration costs and lower kilowatt-hour sales, primarily due to mild weather. These were partially offset by growth in rate base and lower operating expenses. 
Dominion Generation produced EBITDA of $509 million in the second quarter, which was in the upper half of its guidance range. Lower operating expenses and higher rider revenues offset lower-than-expected kilowatt-hour sales at Virginia Power. 
Second quarter EBITDA for Dominion Energy was $336 million, which was near the top of its guidance range. Lower operating expenses were the principal driver of the strong results. 
On a consolidated basis, interest expenses and income taxes were in line with our expectations. Overall, we were pleased with the performance of each of our operating segments. 
For the second quarter of 2016, Dominion Midstream Partners produced adjusted EBITDA of $27.2 million, 37% higher than the level produced in the second quarter of last year. Distributable cash flow increased 31% to $23.8 million, which was consistent with management's expectations. 
On July 22, Dominion Midstream's Board of Directors declared a distribution of $0.2355 per unit payable on August 15. This distribution represents a 5% increase over last quarter's payment and is consistent with our plan to achieve 22% annual distribution growth for LP units. 
Now moving to the cash flow and treasury activities at Dominion. Funds from operations were $2 billion for the first 6 months of the year. We have $5.5 billion of credit facilities, and taking into account restricted cash and short-term investments, we ended the quarter with liquidity of $2.8 billion. 
For statements of cash flow and liquidity, please see Pages 14 and 25 of the Earnings Release Kit. 
During the second quarter, we completed a number of financing transactions to support our growth plan and cover the acquisition of Questar. Slide 6 highlights our recent financing activities. We have a few debt financings planned for the remainder of the year, including issuances at Dominion and VEPCO. In addition, you should expect us to issue incremental mandatory convertible units to support the Questar transaction. 
Looking ahead to the third quarter, Dominion's operating earnings guidance is $0.95 to $1.10 per share. The midpoint of that range is unchanged from the operating earnings of $1.03 per share for the third quarter of 2015. Positive earnings drivers for the quarter compared to last year are higher revenues from our growth projects and lower capacity expenses for Virginia Power. Negative drivers for the quarter compared to last year include the absence of a farm-out agreement and a higher share count. Dominion's operating earnings guidance for the year remains $3.60 to $4 per share. 
Slide 8 is an update of a slide we showed last quarter, which highlights the earnings drivers in the fourth quarter of 2016, which will allow us to achieve our annual guidance range. The chart begins as our actual operating earnings for the first half of 2016 plus the midpoint of our guidance for the third quarter. The middle of the chart details the positive and negative drivers to this year's fourth quarter relative to the prior year. 
We show about $0.07 per share of year-over-year negative drivers, principally financing costs and DD&A. We did highlight about $0.47 per share of year-over-year positive drivers in the fourth quarter, including normal weather, lower capacity expenses and the absence of a Millstone outage. 
As to hedging, you can find our hedge positions on Page 27 of the Earnings Release Kit. As of mid-July, we have hedged 95% of our expected 2016 production at Millstone and 8% of our expected 2017 production. 
So let me summarize my financial review. Operating earnings were $0.71 per share for the second quarter of 2016, which was in the upper half of our guidance range. Operating results for Dominion Midstream Partners were in line with management's expectations. And finally, Dominion's operating earnings guidance for the third quarter is $0.95 to $1.10 per share, and full year earnings guidance remains $3.60 to $4 per share. 
I will now turn the call over to Tom Farrell."

All of our business units are on track to meet or exceed their safety goals for the year. 
Our nuclear fleet continues to operate well. The net capacity factor of our 6 units was 92% for the first 6 months of the year. The contribution of the Brunswick County power station helped our regulated power generation group achieve record net generation. 
Our Nuclear business unit completed 2 successful refueling outages in the second quarter. The outage at Millstone Unit 3 was completed in 34 days, and the refueling of Unit 2 at North Anna was completed in 35 days. 
Now for an update on our growth plans. The 1,358-megawatt Brunswick County power station began commercial operations in April, completing a construction schedule that began in August 2013, and was completed ahead of time and under budget. 
We have begun construction of the 1,588-megawatt Greensville County combined cycle power station. The air permit for the project was issued by the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality on June 17, and a full notice to proceed was given to Fluor that same day. 
The $1.3 billion project is expected to achieve commercial operations in late 2018. Construction on our 2 large contracted solar projects, Four Brothers and Three Cedars in Utah, continues on time and on budget. All sites are mechanically complete with grid synchronization underway. Both projects are expected to be in service this quarter. 
Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe affirmed his intention for the Commonwealth to move forward on implementing the power plant in signing Executive Order 57 in June 28. The order set up an executive branch working group to identify executive actions that could be taken to reduce carbon emissions from the electric utility sector. Continued focus on carbon reduction combined with demand for low carbon options by our customers may require significant additional low or no carbon power generation investment in Virginia. We have a number solar projects under development in the state today and continue to see demand for renewables from our customers, including data centers and military installations. 
Construction of the 80-megawatt solar facility in Virginia's Eastern Shore is underway and is expected be completed in the fourth quarter. The output from the Eastern Shore facility is under contract with our data center customer, Amazon. 
On June 30, Virginia State Corporation Commission approved 3 solar projects in Virginia. These facilities, totaling 56 megawatts, is also expected to be in service by late this year. We have filed with the state Corporation Commission for approval of an additional 20-megawatt solar facility at the site of our Remington power station to be in service next year. The output from this facility will be sold to the Commonwealth of Virginia, and the renewable energy credits will be sold to Microsoft. 
In July, we signed a lease with the Department of the Navy to develop an 18-megawatt solar facility at the Oceana Naval Air Station in Virginia Beach, and Monday filed for approval with the state Corporation Commission. The output of Oceana is under long-term contract with the Commonwealth of Virginia. If approved by the state Corporation Commission, this facility is expected to be in service by late next year. 
We have a number of electric transmission projects at various stages of regulatory approval and construction. $360 million worth of these facilities were completed in the second quarter, including our new systems operations center. We expect to place over $680 million of new transmission assets into service this year. 
An application for Phase 1 of our strategic distribution underground program was filed with the state Corporation Commission, filing which includes a cost-benefit analysis, covers 400 miles of distribution lines to be converted this year at a cost of $140 million, and SEC is expected to rule on the filing next month. 
Progress on our growth plan for Dominion Energy continues as well. Our Cove Point Liquefaction project is now 67% complete with over 1,800 construction workers offsite. Our engineering, procurement and structured contractor, IHIQ [ph], has installed well over half of 21,500 tons of structural steel required, and the piping installation is proceeding on plan. We are on schedule to have all major equipment installation on foundations by end of the year. 
Our operations staffing plan is also on schedule. The formal classroom training began in the second quarter and will continue throughout the facility commissioning. Project continues on time and on budget for a late 2017 in-service date. 
We're continuing to work toward the commencement of construction on the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and the related Supply Header projects. We made the formal FERC filings for these projects last September. In April, after submitting details of a reroute that avoids sensitive areas within the United States for service lands, we received a supplemental notice of intent to prepare an environmental impact statement. We have continued to respond to data requests, and we were quite pleased with our progress at FERC. We anticipate receiving a scheduling order very soon followed by a permit, which allows to begin construction by mid-2017. 
Surveying and pipeline engineering is nearly complete and will be finished this year. Materials procurement is now over 80% complete, and we are finalizing our detailed construction plan. We expect completion of the Atlantic Coast Pipeline Supply Header in late 2018. 
The St. Charles market access project delivering 132,000 dekatherms per day to a CPV power plant in Maryland was completed June 1, on time and on budget. We currently have 4 projects under construction for an additional 600,000 dekatherms per day to come online later this year. 
In total, we have 10 pipeline growth projects underway in addition to the Atlantic Coast Pipeline Supply Header, with $1 billion of investment to move more than 1.5 billion cubic feet per day for customers by the end of 2018. The minority -- the majority of the projects are demand driven, moving gas to end-use power generation or local distribution companies. 
Turning to our farmout activity. We have enjoyed significant success with our Marcellus and Utica acreage farmout program, which began in 2013. Our current focus is on the portfolio of remaining Utica acreage packages and the prospect of restructuring a previously completed transactions. While many producers pulled back near-term drilling plans, there remains significant interest in several areas throughout our farmout program. 
During the second quarter, we restructured a previous agreement covering 79,000 acres of Marcellus shale development rights. As part of the restructuring, parties have agreed to convey immediately a portion of the acreage to facilitate its development, resulting in the recognition of $36 million of revenue. We are currently in discussions with multiple parties and expect to realize additional value later this year. 
On March 31, Dominion filed its base rate case for our North Carolina service territory seeking approval of a $51.1 million increase to base rate revenues based on a 10.5 return on equity. The North Carolina Commission issued a procedural order in May that calls for hearings in October. We have requested to implement the proposed rates subject to refund November 1 with permanent rates becoming effective January 1 of next year. 
Finally, I want to update you on our pending merger with Questar Corporation. Questar's shareholders approved the transaction in May. Merger applications were filed with the Utah and Wyoming Public Service Commissions, and notice was provided to the Idaho Commission. 
Technical conferences were completed last quarter, and discovery is almost complete. On August 1, we filed a settlement stipulation with the Wyoming Commission related to the merger. We will file supporting testimony on August 11, and we'll present the settlement to the Wyoming Commission on September 14. 
On July 28, we filed a final testimony with the Utah Commission. The hearing before that, the Commission has scheduled for August 22. We expect to close the transaction by year-end. 
So to summarize, our business has delivered strong operating and safety performance in the second quarter with Brunswick County power stations now complete and in service, ahead of time and under budget. The Greensville County project has been approved, and construction is underway. The construction of the Cove Point Liquefaction project is on time and on budget. We continue to work toward FERC approval for the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and the Supply Header project, and we are working toward a successful close of our combination with Questar Corporation later this year. 
Thank you, and we are ready to take your questions."

Let's start with this year's ITCs based on the project that have been announced, and we talked about this on previous calls. The projects in Utah, which are very large projects, will produce between $0.30 and $0.35 of earnings from ITCs, and that range is really based on whatever the actual capital costs might be at the end. So that's a good planning range. In addition, we have one other project that we anticipate ITCs on this year in Virginia. It's a Eastern Shore project contracted with Amazon, and we would expect ITCs in a range of probably $0.06 to $0.08 from that project. So that makes up 2016. On 2017, I mentioned, if I recall on the January call that for planning purposes, we anticipate between $0.10 and $0.15 of ITCs in 2017 based on the activity that we knew of at that time. Since the first of the year, we've seen a tremendous amount of interest from a number of parties in Virginia, state government, military facilities, state centers and others to step up the generation solar build in Virginia. And I would expect that, that number for '17 are pretty easily double from that $0.10 to $0.15 and be in the $0.30 range based on the activity we know of today. Now we have not announced all the projects for 2017. But again, based on a pipeline of interest in the folks that we are discussing projects with, I would expect again ITCs in '17 probably now to range in the $0.30 range."

If you look at the first half of this year, it's been less than that. It's actually slightly down to the previous period, but the mix is pretty interesting. For example, in the second quarter, although sales were down about 1% over a similar period last year, revenues were actually right at budget at about 1% higher, and that's because residential sales were very strong in the quarter. So we still believe that 1% sales growth over the next couple of years is certainly in the realm of possibility, and that's in our planning data. We would like to see stronger commercial sales growth outside of data centers. We think that will again be driven by spending from the government, where it was curtailed during the sequestration and starting to come back, but it's been slow. So we again believe that 1% growth is achievable and a realistic goal as we go forward."

Please refer to our SEC filings, including our most recent annual reports on Form 10-K and our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, for a discussion of factors that may cause results to differ from management's projections, forecasts, estimates and expectations.

Dominion Resources reported operating earnings of $0.71 per share for the second quarter of 2016, finishing in the upper half of our guidance range of $0.65 to $0.75 per share. Operating earnings would have been at the top of our guidance range were it not for the impact of milder-than-normal weather and higher storm restoration costs. 
GAAP earnings were $0.73 per share for the second quarter. The principal difference between GAAP and operating earnings was a gain related to our investments in nuclear decommissioning trust funds. A reconciliation of operating earnings to reported earnings can be found on Schedule 2 of the Earnings Release Kit. 
Moving to results by operating segment. At Dominion Virginia Power, EBITDA for the second quarter was $363 million, which was in the lower half of its guidance range. Negative drivers for the quarter were higher major storm restoration costs and lower kilowatt-hour sales, primarily due to mild weather. These were partially offset by growth in rate base and lower operating expenses. 
Dominion Generation produced EBITDA of $509 million in the second quarter, which was in the upper half of its guidance range. Lower operating expenses and higher rider revenues offset lower-than-expected kilowatt-hour sales at Virginia Power. 
Second quarter EBITDA for Dominion Energy was $336 million, which was near the top of its guidance range. Lower operating expenses were the principal driver of the strong results. 
On a consolidated basis, interest expenses and income taxes were in line with our expectations. Overall, we were pleased with the performance of each of our operating segments. 
For the second quarter of 2016, Dominion Midstream Partners produced adjusted EBITDA of $27.2 million, 37% higher than the level produced in the second quarter of last year. Distributable cash flow increased 31% to $23.8 million, which was consistent with management's expectations. 
On July 22, Dominion Midstream's Board of Directors declared a distribution of $0.2355 per unit payable on August 15. This distribution represents a 5% increase over last quarter's payment and is consistent with our plan to achieve 22% annual distribution growth for LP units. 
Now moving to the cash flow and treasury activities at Dominion. Funds from operations were $2 billion for the first 6 months of the year. We have $5.5 billion of credit facilities, and taking into account restricted cash and short-term investments, we ended the quarter with liquidity of $2.8 billion. For statements of cash flow and liquidity, please see Pages 14 and 25 of the Earnings Release Kit. 
During the second quarter, we completed a number of financing transactions to support our growth plan and cover the acquisition of Questar. Slide 6 highlights our recent financing activities. We have a few debt financings planned for the remainder of the year, including issuances at Dominion and VEPCO. In addition, you should expect us to issue incremental mandatory convertible units to support the Questar transaction. 
Looking ahead to the third quarter, Dominion's operating earnings guidance is $0.95 to $1.10 per share. The midpoint of that range is unchanged from the operating earnings of $1.03 per share for the third quarter of 2015. Positive earnings drivers for the quarter compared to last year are higher revenues from our growth projects and lower capacity expenses for Virginia Power. Negative drivers for the quarter compared to last year include the absence of a farmout agreement and a higher share count. Dominion's operating earnings guidance for the year remains $3.60 to $4 per share. 
Slide 8 is an update of a slide we showed last quarter, which highlights the earnings drivers in the fourth quarter of 2016, which will allow us to achieve our annual guidance range. The chart begins with our actual operating earnings for the first half of 2016, plus the midpoint of our guidance for the third quarter. The middle of the chart details the positive and negative drivers for this year's fourth quarter relative to the prior year. We show about $0.07 per share of year-over-year negative drivers, principally financing costs and DD&A. We then highlight about $0.47 per share of year-over-year positive drivers in the fourth quarter, including normal weather, lower capacity expenses and the absence of a Millstone outage. 
As to hedging, you can find our hedge positions on Page 27 of the Earnings Release Kit. As of mid-July, we have hedged 95% of our expected 2016 production at Millstone and 8% of our expected 2017 production. 
So let me summarize my financial review. Operating earnings were $0.71 per share for the second quarter of 2016, which was in the upper half of our guidance range. Operating results for Dominion Midstream Partners were in line with management's expectations. And finally, Dominion's operating earnings guidance for the third quarter is $0.95 to $1.10 per share, and full year earnings guidance remains $3.60 to $4 per share. 
I will now turn the call over to Tom Farrell."

All of our business units are on track to meet or exceed their safety goals for the year. Our nuclear fleet continues to operate well. The net capacity factor of our 6 units was 92% for the first 6 months of the year. The contribution of the Brunswick County power station helped our regulated power generation group achieve record net generation. 
Our Nuclear business unit completed 2 successful refueling outages in the second quarter. The outage at Millstone Unit 3 was completed in 34 days, and the refueling of Unit 2 at North Anna was completed in 35 days. 
Now for an update on our growth plans. The 1,358-megawatt Brunswick County power station began commercial operations in April, completing a construction schedule that began in August 2013 and was completed ahead of time and under budget. 
We have begun construction of the 1,588-megawatt Greensville County combined cycle power station. The air permit for the project was issued by the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality on June 17, and a full notice to proceed was given to Fluor that same day. The $1.3 billion project is expected to achieve commercial operations in late 2018. 
Construction on our 2 large contracted solar projects, Four Brothers and Three Cedars in Utah, continues on time and on budget. All sites are mechanically complete with grid synchronization underway. Both projects are expected to be in service this quarter. 
Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe affirmed his intention for the Commonwealth to move forward on implementing the clean power plant in signing Executive Order 57 on June 28. The order set up an executive branch working group to identify executive actions that could be taken to reduce carbon emissions from the electric utility sector. Continued focus on carbon reduction, combined with demand for low carbon options by our customers, may require significant additional low or no-carbon power generation investment in Virginia. 
We have a number solar projects under development in the state today and continue to see demand for renewables from our customers, including data centers and military installations. Construction of the 80-megawatt solar facility on Virginia's Eastern Shore is underway and is expected be completed in the fourth quarter. The output from the Eastern Shore facility is under contract with our data center customer, Amazon. 
On June 30, Virginia State Corporation Commission approved 3 solar projects in Virginia. These facilities, totaling 56 megawatts, is also expected to be in service by late this year. We have filed with the State Corporation Commission for approval of an additional 20-megawatt solar facility at the site of our Remington power station to be in service next year. The output from this facility will be sold to the Commonwealth of Virginia, and the renewable energy credits will be sold to Microsoft. 
In July, we signed a lease with the Department of the Navy to develop an 18-megawatt solar facility at the Oceana Naval Air Station in Virginia Beach, and Monday filed for approval with the State Corporation Commission. The output of Oceana is under long-term contract with the Commonwealth of Virginia. If approved by the State Corporation Commission, this facility is expected to be in service by late next year. 
We have a number of electric transmission projects at various stages of regulatory approval and construction. $360 million worth of these facilities were completed in the second quarter, including our new systems operations center. We expect to place over $680 million of new transmission assets into service this year. 
An application for Phase 1 of our strategic distribution underground program was filed with the State Corporation Commission. Filing, which includes a cost-benefit analysis, covers 400 miles of distribution lines to be converted this year at a cost of $140 million, and SEC is expected to rule on the filing next month. 
Progress on our growth plan for Dominion Energy continues as well. Our Cove Point Liquefaction project is now 67% complete with over 1,800 construction workers on-site. Our engineering, procurement and structure contractor, IHI Kiewit, has installed well over half the 21,500 tons of the structural steel required, and the piping installation is proceeding on plan. We are on schedule to have all major equipment installation on foundations by end of the year. Our operations staffing plan is also on schedule. The formal classroom training began in the second quarter and will continue throughout the facility commissioning. Project continues on time and on budget for a late 2017 in-service date. 
We're continuing to work toward the commencement of construction on the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and the related Supply Header project. We made the formal FERC filings for these projects last September. In April, after submitting details of a reroute that avoid some sensitive areas within the United States Forest Service lands, we received a supplemental notice of intent to prepare an environmental impact statement. We have continued to respond to data request, and we were quite pleased with our progress at FERC. We anticipate receiving a scheduling order very soon followed by a permit, which will allow us to begin construction by mid-2017. Surveying and pipeline engineering is nearly complete and will be finished this year. Materials procurement is now over 80% complete, and we are finalizing our detailed construction plan. We expect completion of the Atlantic Coast Pipeline Supply Header in late 2018. 
The St. Charles Market Access project, delivering 132,000 dekatherms per day to a CPV power plant in Maryland, was completed June 1 on time and on budget. We currently have 4 projects under construction for an additional 600,000 dekatherms per day to come online later this year. 
In total, we have 10 pipeline growth projects underway in addition to the Atlantic Coast Pipeline Supply Header, with $1 billion of investment to move more than 1.5 billion cubic feet per day for customers by the end of 2018. The minority -- the majority of the projects are demand driven, moving gas to end-use power generation or local distribution companies. 
Turning to our farmout activity. We have enjoyed significant success with our Marcellus and Utica acreage farmout program, which began in 2013. Our current focus is on the portfolio of remaining Utica acreage packages and the prospect of restructuring a previously completed transactions. While many producers pulled back near-term drilling plans, there remains significant interest in several areas throughout our farmout program. 
During the second quarter, we restructured a previous agreement covering 79,000 acres of Marcellus shale development rights. As part of the restructuring, the parties have agreed to convey immediately a portion of the acreage to facilitate its development, resulting in the recognition of $36 million of revenue. We are currently in discussions with multiple parties and expect to realize additional value later this year. 
On March 31, Dominion filed its base rate case for our North Carolina service territory, seeking approval of a $51.1 million increase to base rate revenues based on a 10.5% return on equity. The North Carolina Commission issued a procedural order in May that calls for hearings in October. We have requested to implement the proposed rates subject to refund November 1 with permanent rates becoming effective January 1 of next year. 
Finally, I want to update you on our pending merger with Questar Corporation. Questar shareholders approved the transaction in May. Merger applications were filed with the Utah and Wyoming Public Service Commissions and notice was provided to the Idaho Commission. Technical conferences were completed last quarter, and discovery is almost complete. On August 1, we filed a settlement stipulation with the Wyoming Commission related to the merger. We will file supporting testimony on August 11 and will present the settlement to the Wyoming Commission on September 14. 
On July 28, we filed a rebuttal testimony with the Utah Commission. The hearing for that, the Commission has scheduled for August 22. We expect to close the transaction by year end. 
So to summarize, our business has delivered strong operating and safety performance in the second quarter with Brunswick County power station is now complete and in service, ahead of time and under budget. The Greensville County project has been approved, and construction is underway. The construction of the Cove Point Liquefaction project is on time and on budget. We continue to work toward FERC approval for the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and the Supply Header project, and we are working toward a successful close to our combination with Questar Corporation later this year. 
Thank you, and we are ready to take your questions."

That being said, we've referenced a number of times that as we go into a calendar year and certainly by the, call it, the end of January, early February, we would expect Millstone to be hedged between 80% and 90%, which it always has been.

That's like 8 questions here, Julien, I think, but I'll be glad to answer all of them. Let's start with this year's ITCs based on the project that have been announced, and we talked about this on previous calls. The projects in Utah, which are very large projects, will produce between $0.30 and $0.35 of earnings from ITCs, and that range is really based on whatever the actual capital cost might be at the end. So that's a good planning range. In addition, we have one other project that we anticipate ITCs on this year in Virginia. It's a Eastern Shore project contracted with Amazon, and we would expect ITCs in a range of probably $0.06 to $0.08 from that project. So that makes up 2016. On 2017, I mentioned, if I recall, on the January call that for planning purposes, we anticipated between $0.10 and $0.15 of ITCs in 2017 based on the activity that we knew of at that time. Since the first of the year, we've seen a tremendous amount of interest from a number of parties in Virginia, state government, military facilities, data centers and others to step up the generation solar build in Virginia. And I would expect that, that number for '17 pretty easily double from that $0.10 to $0.15 and be in the $0.30 range based on the activity we know of today. Now we have not announced all the projects for 2017. But again, based on a pipeline of interest in the folks that we are discussing projects with, I would expect again ITCs in '17 probably now to range in the $0.30 range."

For example, in the second quarter, although sales were down about 1% over a similar period last year, revenues were actually right at budget at about 1% higher, and that's because residential sales were very strong in the quarter. So we still believe that 1% sales growth over the next couple of years is certainly in the realm of possibility, and that's in our planning data. We would like to see stronger commercial sales growth outside of data centers. And we think that will again be driven by spending from the government, where it was curtailed during the sequestration and starting to come back, but it's been slow.

New York is -- I understand the New York PC is a straight subsidy to the Upstate New York nuclear facilities. Connecticut has taken a different approach, which is to allow carbon-free production to bid into what has been satisfied just for renewables for the local utilities. It's I think a very innovative approach and one that Millstone would participate in.

During this call, we will refer to certain schedules included in this morning's earnings releases and pages from our Earnings Release Kit. Schedules in the Earnings Release Kit are intended to answer the more detailed questions pertaining to operating statistics and accounting. Investor Relations will be available after the call for any clarification of these schedules. If you have not done so, I encourage you to visit the Investor Relations page on our website, register for e-mail alerts and view our second quarter earnings documents. Our website addresses are dom.com and dommidstream.com. In addition to the Earnings Release Kit, we have included a slide presentation on our website that will follow this morning's discussion.
And now for the usual cautionary language. The earnings releases and other matters that will be discussed on the call today may contain forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings, including our most recent annual reports on Form 10-K and our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, for a discussion of factors that may cause results to differ from management's projections, forecasts, estimates and expectations.
Also on this call, we will discuss some measures of our companies' performance that differ from those recognized by GAAP. Reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures we are able to calculate and report are contained in the Earnings Release Kit and Dominion Midstream's press release.
Joining us on the call this morning, our CEO, Tom Farrell; our CFO, Mark McGettrick; and other members of our management team. Mark will discuss our earnings results for the second quarter and Dominion's earnings guidance for the third quarter and full year 2016. Tom will review our operating and regulatory activities and review the progress we've made on our growth plans. 
I will now turn the call over to Mark McGettrick."
267105,372624663,1023553,"Dominion Resources, Inc., Dominion Midstream Partners, LP, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 03, 2016",2016-08-03,"Earnings Calls","Dominion Energy, Inc.","Executives","Good morning. Dominion Resources reported operating earnings of $0.71 per share for the second quarter of 2016, finishing in the upper half of our guidance range of $0.65 to $0.75 per share. Operating earnings would have been at the top of our guidance ra",810,"Good morning. Dominion Resources reported operating earnings of $0.71 per share for the second quarter of 2016, finishing in the upper half of our guidance range of $0.65 to $0.75 per share. Operating earnings would have been at the top of our guidance range were it not for the impact of milder-than-normal weather and higher storm restoration costs. 
GAAP earnings were $0.73 per share for the second quarter. The principal difference between GAAP and operating earnings was a gain related to our investments in nuclear decommissioning trust funds. A reconciliation of operating earnings to reported earnings can be found on Schedule 2 of the Earnings Release Kit. 
Moving to results by operating segment. At Dominion Virginia Power, EBITDA for the second quarter was $363 million, which was in the lower half of its guidance range. Negative drivers for the quarter were higher major storm restoration costs and lower kilowatt-hour sales, primarily due to mild weather. These were partially offset by growth in rate base and lower operating expenses. 
Dominion Generation produced EBITDA of $509 million in the second quarter, which was in the upper half of its guidance range. Lower operating expenses and higher rider revenues offset lower-than-expected kilowatt-hour sales at Virginia Power. 
Second quarter EBITDA for Dominion Energy was $336 million, which was near the top of its guidance range. Lower operating expenses were the principal driver of the strong results. 
On a consolidated basis, interest expenses and income taxes were in line with our expectations. Overall, we were pleased with the performance of each of our operating segments. 
For the second quarter of 2016, Dominion Midstream Partners produced adjusted EBITDA of $27.2 million, 37% higher than the level produced in the second quarter of last year. Distributable cash flow increased 31% to $23.8 million, which was consistent with management's expectations. 
On July 22, Dominion Midstream's Board of Directors declared a distribution of $0.2355 per unit payable on August 15. This distribution represents a 5% increase over last quarter's payment and is consistent with our plan to achieve 22% annual distribution growth for LP units. 
Now moving to the cash flow and treasury activities at Dominion. Funds from operations were $2 billion for the first 6 months of the year. We have $5.5 billion of credit facilities, and taking into account restricted cash and short-term investments, we ended the quarter with liquidity of $2.8 billion. For statements of cash flow and liquidity, please see Pages 14 and 25 of the Earnings Release Kit. 
During the second quarter, we completed a number of financing transactions to support our growth plan and cover the acquisition of Questar. Slide 6 highlights our recent financing activities. We have a few debt financings planned for the remainder of the year, including issuances at Dominion and VEPCO. In addition, you should expect us to issue incremental mandatory convertible units to support the Questar transaction. 
Looking ahead to the third quarter, Dominion's operating earnings guidance is $0.95 to $1.10 per share. The midpoint of that range is unchanged from the operating earnings of $1.03 per share for third quarter of 2015. Positive earnings drivers for the quarter compared to last year are higher revenues from our growth projects and lower capacity expenses for Virginia Power. Negative drivers for the quarter compared to last year include the absence of a farmout agreement and a higher share count. Dominion's operating earnings guidance for the year remains $3.60 to $4 per share. 
Slide 8 is an update of a slide we showed last quarter, which highlights the earnings drivers in the fourth quarter of 2016, which will allow us to achieve our annual guidance range. The chart begins with our actual operating earnings for the first half of 2016, plus the midpoint of our guidance for the third quarter. The middle of the chart details the positive and negative drivers for this year's fourth quarter relative to the prior year. We show about $0.07 per share of year-over-year negative drivers, principally financing costs and DD&A. We then highlight about $0.47 per share of year-over-year positive drivers in the fourth quarter, including normal weather, lower capacity expenses and the absence of a Millstone outage. 
As to hedging, you can find our hedge positions on Page 27 of the Earnings Release Kit. As of mid-July, we have hedged 95% of our expected 2016 production at Millstone and 8% of our expected 2017 production. 
So let me summarize my financial review. Operating earnings were $0.71 per share for the second quarter of 2016, which was in the upper half of our guidance range. Operating results for Dominion Midstream Partners were in line with management's expectations. And finally, Dominion's operating earnings guidance for the third quarter is $0.95 to $1.10 per share, and full year earnings guidance remains $3.60 to $4 per share. 
I will now turn the call over to Tom Farrell."

All of our business units are on track to meet or exceed their safety goals for the year. Our nuclear fleet continues to operate well. The net capacity factor of our 6 units was 92% for the first 6 months of the year. The contribution of the Brunswick County power station helped our regulated power generation group achieve record net generation. 
Our Nuclear business unit completed 2 successful refueling outages in the second quarter. The outage at Millstone Unit 3 was completed in 34 days, and the refueling of Unit 2 at North Anna was completed in 35 days. 
Now for an update on our growth plans. The 1,358-megawatt Brunswick County power station began commercial operations in April, completing a construction schedule that began in August 2013 and was completed ahead of time and under budget. 
We have begun construction of the 1,588-megawatt Greensville County combined cycle power station. The air permit for the project was issued by the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality on June 17, and a full notice to proceed was given to Fluor that same day. The $1.3 billion project is expected to achieve commercial operations in late 2018. 
Construction on our 2 large contracted solar projects, Four Brothers and Three Cedars in Utah, continues on time and on budget. All sites are mechanically complete with grid synchronization underway. Both projects are expected to be in service this quarter. 
Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe affirmed his intention for the Commonwealth to move forward on implementing the clean power plant in signing Executive Order 57 on June 28. The order set up an executive branch working group to identify executive actions that could be taken to reduce carbon emissions from the electric utility sector. Continued focus on carbon reduction, combined with demand for low carbon options by our customers, may require significant additional low or no-carbon power generation investment in Virginia. 
We have a number solar projects under development in the state today and continue to see demand for renewables from our customers, including data centers and military installations. Construction of the 80-megawatt solar facility on Virginia's Eastern Shore is underway and is expected be completed in the fourth quarter. The output from the Eastern Shore facility is under contract with our data center customer, Amazon. 
On June 30, Virginia State Corporation Commission approved 3 solar projects in Virginia. These facilities, totaling 56 megawatts, is also expected to be in service by late this year. We have filed with the State Corporation Commission for approval of an additional 20-megawatt solar facility at the site of our Remington power station to be in service next year. The output from this facility will be sold to the Commonwealth of Virginia, and the renewable energy credits will be sold to Microsoft. 
In July, we signed a lease with the Department of the Navy to develop an 18-megawatt solar facility at the Oceana Naval Air Station in Virginia Beach, and Monday filed for approval with the State Corporation Commission. The output of Oceana is under long-term contract with the Commonwealth of Virginia. If approved by the State Corporation Commission, this facility is expected to be in service by late next year. 
We have a number of electric transmission projects at various stages of regulatory approval and construction. $360 million worth of these facilities were completed in the second quarter, including our new systems operations center. We expect to place over $680 million of new transmission assets into service this year. 
An application for Phase 1 of our strategic distribution underground program was filed with the State Corporation Commission. Filing, which includes a cost-benefit analysis, covers 400 miles of distribution lines to be converted this year at a cost of $140 million, and SEC is expected to rule on the filing next month. 
Progress on our growth plan for Dominion Energy continues as well. Our Cove Point Liquefaction project is now 67% complete with over 1,800 construction workers on-site. Our engineering, procurement and structure contractor, IHI Kiewit, has installed well over half the 21,500 tons of the structural steel required, and the piping installation is proceeding on plan. We are on schedule to have all major equipment installation on foundations by end of the year. Our operations staffing plan is also on schedule. The formal classroom training began in the second quarter and will continue throughout the facility commissioning. Project continues on time and on budget for a late 2017 in-service date. 
We're continuing to work toward the commencement of construction on the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and the related Supply Header project. We made the formal FERC filings for these projects last September. In April, after submitting details of a reroute that avoid some sensitive areas within the United States Forest Service lands, we received a supplemental notice of intent to prepare an environmental impact statement. We have continued to respond to data request, and we were quite pleased with our progress at FERC. We anticipate receiving a scheduling order very soon followed by a permit, which will allow us to begin construction by mid-2017. Surveying and pipeline engineering is nearly complete and will be finished this year. Materials procurement is now over 80% complete, and we are finalizing our detailed construction plan. We expect completion of the Atlantic Coast Pipeline Supply Header in late 2018. 
The St. Charles Market Access project, delivering 132,000 dekatherms per day to a CPV power plant in Maryland, was completed June 1 on time and on budget. We currently have 4 projects under construction for an additional 600,000 dekatherms per day to come online later this year. 
In total, we have 10 pipeline growth projects underway in addition to the Atlantic Coast Pipeline Supply Header, with $1 billion of investment to move more than 1.5 billion cubic feet per day for customers by the end of 2018. The minority -- the majority of the projects are demand driven, moving gas to end-use power generation or local distribution companies. 
Turning to our farmout activity. We have enjoyed significant success with our Marcellus and Utica acreage farmout program, which began in 2013. Our current focus is on the portfolio of remaining Utica acreage packages and the prospect of restructuring a previously completed transactions. While many producers pulled back near-term drilling plans, there remains significant interest in several areas throughout our farmout program. 
During the second quarter, we restructured a previous agreement covering 79,000 acres of Marcellus shale development rights. As part of the restructuring, the parties have agreed to convey immediately a portion of the acreage to facilitate its development, resulting in the recognition of $36 million of revenue. We are currently in discussions with multiple parties and expect to realize additional value later this year. 
On March 31, Dominion filed its base rate case for our North Carolina service territory, seeking approval of a $51.1 million increase to base rate revenues based on a 10.5% return on equity. The North Carolina Commission issued a procedural order in May that calls for hearings in October. We have requested to implement the proposed rates subject to refund November 1 with permanent rates becoming effective January 1 of next year. 
Finally, I want to update you on our pending merger with Questar Corporation. Questar shareholders approved the transaction in May. Merger applications were filed with the Utah and Wyoming Public Service Commissions and notice was provided to the Idaho Commission. Technical conferences were completed last quarter, and discovery is almost complete. On August 1, we filed a settlement stipulation with the Wyoming Commission related to the merger. We will file supporting testimony on August 11 and will present the settlement to the Wyoming Commission on September 14. 
On July 28, we filed a rebuttal testimony with the Utah Commission. The hearing for that, the Commission has scheduled for August 22. We expect to close the transaction by year end. 
So to summarize, our business has delivered strong operating and safety performance in the second quarter with Brunswick County power station is now complete and in service, ahead of time and under budget. The Greensville County project has been approved, and construction is underway. The construction of the Cove Point Liquefaction project is on time and on budget. We continue to work toward FERC approval for the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and the Supply Header project, and we are working toward a successful close to our combination with Questar Corporation later this year. 
Thank you, and we are ready to take your questions."

As you can see from our hedge schedules, we didn't hedge anything in the second quarter of this year, and we actually don't expect to hedge much in the third quarter of this year, either. Our view is that the oversupply that occurred because a very mild winter and a very high production cycle over the last year or so is normalizing. And we think with a warm summer this year going into the fall, that storage will be full early, and we will see more bullish price signals in the Northeast as we go into the winter period. That being said, we've referenced a number of times that as we go into a calendar year and certainly by the, call it, the end of January, early February, we would expect Millstone to be hedged between 80% and 90%, which it always has been. But our hedge view is that we are going to wait till later this year to place more hedges on that facility."

That's like 8 questions here, Julien, I think, but I'll be glad to answer all of them. Let's start with this year's ITCs based on the project that have been announced, and we talked about this on previous calls. The projects in Utah, which are very large projects, will produce between $0.30 and $0.35 of earnings from ITCs, and that range is really based on whatever the actual capital cost might be at the end. So that's a good planning range. In addition, we have one other project that we anticipate ITCs on this year in Virginia. It's a Eastern Shore project contracted with Amazon, and we would expect ITCs in a range of probably $0.06 to $0.08 from that project. So that makes up 2016. On 2017, I mentioned, if I recall, on the January call that for planning purposes, we anticipated between $0.10 and $0.15 of ITCs in 2017 based on the activity that we knew of at that time. Since the first of the year, we've seen a tremendous amount of interest from a number of parties in Virginia, state government, military facilities, data centers and others to step up the generation solar build in Virginia. And I would expect that, that number for '17 pretty easily double from that $0.10 to $0.15 and be in the $0.30 range based on the activity we know of today. Now we have not announced all the projects for 2017. But again, based on a pipeline of interest in the folks that we are discussing projects with, I would expect again ITCs in '17 probably now to range in the $0.30 range."

For example, in the second quarter, although sales were down about 1% over a similar period last year, revenues were actually right at budget at about 1% higher, and that's because residential sales were very strong in the quarter. So we still believe that 1% sales growth over the next couple of years is certainly in the realm of possibility, and that's in our planning data. We would like to see stronger commercial sales growth outside of data centers. And we think that will again be driven by spending from the government, where it was curtailed during the sequestration and starting to come back, but it's been slow.

So we're not going to do anything to affect our tax normalization at Virginia Power in a regulated business -- in the regulated part of the business unit. So if you do want to regulate an entity, you cannot take advantage of the tax credit unless you do it through a market-based rate. Two of the projects that were approved earlier this year, the commission preferred a regulated rate of return. So those will not get -- we will not take advantage of the tax credits in that situation. The military one that we announced just this week at Oceana Naval Air Station and the Amazon project underway on the Eastern Shore are both going to be done through unregulated arms of the company, and we'll be able to take advantage of the tax credits. So most of the time, Mark mentioned there has been a tremendous uptick in interest in our customers in Virginia and elsewhere for us to participate in solar projects, and customers that we deal with in Virginia -- but those same customers have been looking for us to deal with elsewhere because we have a reputation of getting projects done on time and on budget. So we have a lot in the pipeline right now, but it will be a mix depending upon what the customers' needs are and where we are in the process."

And as we said over the last 6 to 9 months, Blue Racer, we should have had 5 processing plants online based on forecast that we put out at our Analyst Day 18 months ago. We only have 4 online although they are almost all at full capacity. We have not seen a big step up based on current NGLs or oil in the basin, and we are being very cautious on Blue Racer to only invest capital when we have firm commitments from drillers. We have had some reach out from producers and drillers here in the last several months inquiring about their interest in moving ahead in the last half of this year and first part of next year. But right now, I would say we're in a cautious mode on Blue Racer, and I don't expect new processing to be put in this year, maybe not for the first half of next year."

During this call, we will refer to certain schedules included in this morning's earnings releases and pages from our Earnings Release Kit. Schedules in the Earnings Release Kit are intended to answer the more detailed questions pertaining to operating statistics and accounting. Investor Relations will be available after the call for any clarification of these schedules. If you have not done so, I encourage you to visit the Investor Relations page on our website, register for e-mail alerts and view our second quarter earnings documents. Our website addresses are dom.com and dommidstream.com. In addition to the Earnings Release Kit, we have included a slide presentation on our website that will follow this morning's discussion.
And now for the usual cautionary language. The earnings releases and other matters that will be discussed on the call today may contain forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings, including our most recent annual reports on Form 10-K and our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, for a discussion of factors that may cause results to differ from management's projections, forecasts, estimates and expectations.
Also on this call, we will discuss some measures of our companies' performance that differ from those recognized by GAAP. Reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures we are able to calculate and report are contained in the Earnings Release Kit and Dominion Midstream's press release.
Joining us on the call this morning, our CEO, Tom Farrell; our CFO, Mark McGettrick; and other members of our management team. Mark will discuss our earnings results for the second quarter and Dominion's earnings guidance for the third quarter and full year 2016. Tom will review our operating and regulatory activities and review the progress we've made on our growth plans.

267105,372624663,1024419,"Dominion Resources, Inc., Dominion Midstream Partners, LP, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 03, 2016",2016-08-03,"Earnings Calls","Dominion Energy, Inc.","Executives","Good morning.

Dominion Resources reported operating earnings of $0.71 per share for the second quarter of 2016, finishing in the upper half of our guidance range of $0.65 to $0.75 per share. Operating earnings would have been at the top of our guidance range were it not for the impact of milder-than-normal weather and higher storm restoration costs. 
GAAP earnings were $0.73 per share for the second quarter. The principal difference between GAAP and operating earnings was a gain related to our investments in nuclear decommissioning trust funds. A reconciliation of operating earnings to reported earnings can be found on Schedule 2 of the Earnings Release Kit. 
Moving to results by operating segment. At Dominion Virginia Power, EBITDA for the second quarter was $363 million, which was in the lower half of its guidance range. Negative drivers for the quarter were higher major storm restoration costs and lower kilowatt-hour sales, primarily due to mild weather. These were partially offset by growth in rate base and lower operating expenses. 
Dominion Generation produced EBITDA of $509 million in the second quarter, which was in the upper half of its guidance range. Lower operating expenses and higher rider revenues offset lower-than-expected kilowatt-hour sales at Virginia Power. 
Second quarter EBITDA for Dominion Energy was $336 million, which was near the top of its guidance range. Lower operating expenses were the principal driver of the strong results. 
On a consolidated basis, interest expenses and income taxes were in line with our expectations. Overall, we were pleased with the performance of each of our operating segments. 
For the second quarter of 2016, Dominion Midstream Partners produced adjusted EBITDA of $27.2 million, 37% higher than the level produced in the second quarter of last year. Distributable cash flow increased 31% to $23.8 million, which was consistent with management's expectations. 
On July 22, Dominion Midstream's Board of Directors declared a distribution of $0.2355 per unit payable on August 15. This distribution represents a 5% increase over last quarter's payment and is consistent with our plan to achieve 22% annual distribution growth for LP units. 
Now moving to the cash flow and treasury activities at Dominion. Funds from operations were $2 billion for the first 6 months of the year. We have $5.5 billion of credit facilities, and taking into account restricted cash and short-term investments, we ended the quarter with liquidity of $2.8 billion. For statements of cash flow and liquidity, please see Pages 14 and 25 of the Earnings Release Kit. 
During the second quarter, we completed a number of financing transactions to support our growth plan and cover the acquisition of Questar. Slide 6 highlights our recent financing activities. We have a few debt financings planned for the remainder of the year, including issuances at Dominion and VEPCO. In addition, you should expect us to issue incremental mandatory convertible units to support the Questar transaction. 
Looking ahead to the third quarter, Dominion's operating earnings guidance is $0.95 to $1.10 per share. The midpoint of that range is unchanged from the operating earnings of $1.03 per share for third quarter of 2015. Positive earnings drivers for the quarter compared to last year are higher revenues from our growth projects and lower capacity expenses for Virginia Power. Negative drivers for the quarter compared to last year include the absence of a farmout agreement and a higher share count. Dominion's operating earnings guidance for the year remains $3.60 to $4 per share. 
Slide 8 is an update of a slide we showed last quarter, which highlights the earnings drivers in the fourth quarter of 2016, which will allow us to achieve our annual guidance range. The chart begins with our actual operating earnings for the first half of 2016, plus the midpoint of our guidance for the third quarter. The middle of the chart details the positive and negative drivers for this year's fourth quarter relative to the prior year. We show about $0.07 per share of year-over-year negative drivers, principally financing costs and DD&A. We then highlight about $0.47 per share of year-over-year positive drivers in the fourth quarter, including normal weather, lower capacity expenses and the absence of a Millstone outage. 
As to hedging, you can find our hedge positions on Page 27 of the Earnings Release Kit. As of mid-July, we have hedged 95% of our expected 2016 production at Millstone and 8% of our expected 2017 production. 
So let me summarize my financial review. Operating earnings were $0.71 per share for the second quarter of 2016, which was in the upper half of our guidance range. Operating results for Dominion Midstream Partners were in line with management's expectations. And finally, Dominion's operating earnings guidance for the third quarter is $0.95 to $1.10 per share, and full year earnings guidance remains $3.60 to $4 per share. 
I will now turn the call over to Tom Farrell."

All of our business units are on track to meet or exceed their safety goals for the year. Our nuclear fleet continues to operate well. The net capacity factor of our 6 units was 92% for the first 6 months of the year. The contribution of the Brunswick County power station helped our regulated power generation group achieve record net generation. 
Our Nuclear business unit completed 2 successful refueling outages in the second quarter. The outage at Millstone Unit 3 was completed in 34 days, and the refueling of Unit 2 at North Anna was completed in 35 days. 
Now for an update on our growth plans. The 1,358-megawatt Brunswick County power station began commercial operations in April, completing a construction schedule that began in August 2013 and was completed ahead of time and under budget. 
We have begun construction of the 1,588-megawatt Greensville County combined cycle power station. The air permit for the project was issued by the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality on June 17, and a full notice to proceed was given to Fluor that same day. The $1.3 billion project is expected to achieve commercial operations in late 2018. 
Construction on our 2 large contracted solar projects, Four Brothers and Three Cedars in Utah, continues on time and on budget. All sites are mechanically complete with grid synchronization underway. Both projects are expected to be in service this quarter. 
Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe affirmed his intention for the Commonwealth to move forward on implementing the clean power plant in signing Executive Order 57 on June 28. The order set up an executive branch working group to identify executive actions that could be taken to reduce carbon emissions from the electric utility sector. Continued focus on carbon reduction, combined with demand for low carbon options by our customers, may require significant additional low or no-carbon power generation investment in Virginia. 
We have a number solar projects under development in the state today and continue to see demand for renewables from our customers, including data centers and military installations. Construction of the 80-megawatt solar facility on Virginia's Eastern Shore is underway and is expected be completed in the fourth quarter. The output from the Eastern Shore facility is under contract with our data center customer, Amazon. 
On June 30, Virginia State Corporation Commission approved 3 solar projects in Virginia. These facilities, totaling 56 megawatts, is also expected to be in service by late this year. We have filed with the State Corporation Commission for approval of an additional 20-megawatt solar facility at the site of our Remington power station to be in service next year. The output from this facility will be sold to the Commonwealth of Virginia, and the renewable energy credits will be sold to Microsoft. 
In July, we signed a lease with the Department of the Navy to develop an 18-megawatt solar facility at the Oceana Naval Air Station in Virginia Beach, and Monday filed for approval with the State Corporation Commission. The output of Oceana is under long-term contract with the Commonwealth of Virginia. If approved by the State Corporation Commission, this facility is expected to be in service by late next year. 
We have a number of electric transmission projects at various stages of regulatory approval and construction. $360 million worth of these facilities were completed in the second quarter, including our new systems operations center. We expect to place over $680 million of new transmission assets into service this year. 
An application for Phase 1 of our strategic distribution underground program was filed with the State Corporation Commission. Filing, which includes a cost-benefit analysis, covers 400 miles of distribution lines to be converted this year at a cost of $140 million, and SEC is expected to rule on the filing next month. 
Progress on our growth plan for Dominion Energy continues as well. Our Cove Point Liquefaction project is now 67% complete with over 1,800 construction workers on-site. Our engineering, procurement and structure contractor, IHI Kiewit, has installed well over half the 21,500 tons of the structural steel required, and the piping installation is proceeding on plan. We are on schedule to have all major equipment installation on foundations by end of the year. Our operations staffing plan is also on schedule. The formal classroom training began in the second quarter and will continue throughout the facility commissioning. Project continues on time and on budget for a late 2017 in-service date. 
We're continuing to work toward the commencement of construction on the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and the related Supply Header project. We made the formal FERC filings for these projects last September. In April, after submitting details of a reroute that avoid some sensitive areas within the United States Forest Service lands, we received a supplemental notice of intent to prepare an environmental impact statement. We have continued to respond to data request, and we were quite pleased with our progress at FERC. We anticipate receiving a scheduling order very soon followed by a permit, which will allow us to begin construction by mid-2017. Surveying and pipeline engineering is nearly complete and will be finished this year. Materials procurement is now over 80% complete, and we are finalizing our detailed construction plan. We expect completion of the Atlantic Coast Pipeline Supply Header in late 2018. 
The St. Charles Market Access project, delivering 132,000 dekatherms per day to a CPV power plant in Maryland, was completed June 1 on time and on budget. We currently have 4 projects under construction for an additional 600,000 dekatherms per day to come online later this year. 
In total, we have 10 pipeline growth projects underway in addition to the Atlantic Coast Pipeline Supply Header, with $1 billion of investment to move more than 1.5 billion cubic feet per day for customers by the end of 2018. The minority -- the majority of the projects are demand driven, moving gas to end-use power generation or local distribution companies. 
Turning to our farmout activity. We have enjoyed significant success with our Marcellus and Utica acreage farmout program, which began in 2013. Our current focus is on the portfolio of remaining Utica acreage packages and the prospect of restructuring a previously completed transactions. While many producers pulled back near-term drilling plans, there remains significant interest in several areas throughout our farmout program. 
During the second quarter, we restructured a previous agreement covering 79,000 acres of Marcellus shale development rights. As part of the restructuring, the parties have agreed to convey immediately a portion of the acreage to facilitate its development, resulting in the recognition of $36 million of revenue. We are currently in discussions with multiple parties and expect to realize additional value later this year. 
On March 31, Dominion filed its base rate case for our North Carolina service territory, seeking approval of a $51.1 million increase to base rate revenues based on a 10.5% return on equity. The North Carolina Commission issued a procedural order in May that calls for hearings in October. We have requested to implement the proposed rates subject to refund November 1 with permanent rates becoming effective January 1 of next year. 
Finally, I want to update you on our pending merger with Questar Corporation. Questar shareholders approved the transaction in May. Merger applications were filed with the Utah and Wyoming Public Service Commissions and notice was provided to the Idaho Commission. Technical conferences were completed last quarter, and discovery is almost complete. On August 1, we filed a settlement stipulation with the Wyoming Commission related to the merger. We will file supporting testimony on August 11 and will present the settlement to the Wyoming Commission on September 14. 
On July 28, we filed a rebuttal testimony with the Utah Commission. The hearing for that, the Commission has scheduled for August 22. We expect to close the transaction by year end. 
So to summarize, our business has delivered strong operating and safety performance in the second quarter with Brunswick County power station is now complete and in service, ahead of time and under budget. The Greensville County project has been approved, and construction is underway. The construction of the Cove Point Liquefaction project is on time and on budget. We continue to work toward FERC approval for the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and the Supply Header project, and we are working toward a successful close to our combination with Questar Corporation later this year.

That being said, we've referenced a number of times that as we go into a calendar year and certainly by the, call it, the end of January, early February, we would expect Millstone to be hedged between 80% and 90%, which it always has been.

Let's start with this year's ITCs based on the project that have been announced, and we talked about this on previous calls. The projects in Utah, which are very large projects, will produce between $0.30 and $0.35 of earnings from ITCs, and that range is really based on whatever the actual capital cost might be at the end. So that's a good planning range. In addition, we have one other project that we anticipate ITCs on this year in Virginia. It's a Eastern Shore project contracted with Amazon, and we would expect ITCs in a range of probably $0.06 to $0.08 from that project. So that makes up 2016. On 2017, I mentioned, if I recall, on the January call that for planning purposes, we anticipated between $0.10 and $0.15 of ITCs in 2017 based on the activity that we knew of at that time. Since the first of the year, we've seen a tremendous amount of interest from a number of parties in Virginia, state government, military facilities, data centers and others to step up the generation solar build in Virginia. And I would expect that, that number for '17 pretty easily double from that $0.10 to $0.15 and be in the $0.30 range based on the activity we know of today. Now we have not announced all the projects for 2017. But again, based on a pipeline of interest in the folks that we are discussing projects with, I would expect again ITCs in '17 probably now to range in the $0.30 range."

If you look at the first half of this year, it's been less than that. It's actually slightly down to the previous period, but the mix is pretty interesting. For example, in the second quarter, although sales were down about 1% over a similar period last year, revenues were actually right at budget at about 1% higher, and that's because residential sales were very strong in the quarter. So we still believe that 1% sales growth over the next couple of years is certainly in the realm of possibility, and that's in our planning data. We would like to see stronger commercial sales growth outside of data centers. And we think that will again be driven by spending from the government, where it was curtailed during the sequestration and starting to come back, but it's been slow. So we again believe that 1% growth is achievable and a realistic goal as we go forward."

And now for the usual cautionary language. The earnings releases and other matters that will be discussed on the call today may contain forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings, including our most recent annual reports on Form 10-K and our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for a discussion of factors that may cause results to differ from management's projections, forecast, estimates and expectations.
Also on this call, we will discuss some measures of our company's performance that differ from those recognized by GAAP. Reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures we are able to calculate and report are contained in the Earnings Release Kit and Dominion Midstream's press release.
Joining us on the call this afternoon are our CEO, Tom Farrell; our CFO, Mark McGettrick; [ph] and other members of our management team.

267105,404829808,1067430,"Dominion Midstream Partners, LP, Dominion Resources, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 31, 2016",2016-10-31,"Earnings Calls","Dominion Energy, Inc.","Executives","Good afternoon.

Dominion Resources reported operating earnings of $1.14 per share for the third quarter of 2016, finishing well above the top of our guidance range. Positive factors relative to guidance for the quarter were favorable weather, lower operating expenses, an earlier approval of our Questar acquisition and partnership income from one of our large solar projects. Some of the partnership income is timing related and will reverse in the fourth quarter.
Negative factors were an unplanned outage at Millstone [ph] and higher major storm restoration costs.
GAAP earnings were $1.10 per share for the third quarter. The principal difference between GAAP and operating earnings were charges related to transaction costs for our merger with Questar. A reconciliation of operating earnings to reported earnings can be found on Schedule 2 of the Earnings Release Kit.
Moving to results by operating segment. At Dominion Virginia Power, [ph] EBITDA for the third quarter was $423 million, which was in the upper half of its guidance range. Favorable weather conditions were partially offset by higher major storm restoration costs. Dominion Generation [ph] produced EBITDA of $921 million in the third quarter, which exceeded the top of its guidance range. Favorable weather was the principal factor in the strong performance, partially offset by an unplanned outage at Millstone.
Third quarter EBITDA for Dominion Energy [ph] was $310 million, which was above the top of its guidance range. Lower operating expenses and an earlier-than-planned contribution from Questar were the principal drivers of the strong results. Overall, we are very pleased with the performance of each of our operating segments.
For the third quarter of 2016, Dominion Midstream Partners produced adjusted EBITDA of $27.9 million, 37% higher than the level produced in the third quarter of last year. Distributable cash flow increased 22% to $24.1 million, which was consistent with management's expectations.
On October 21, Dominion Midstream's Board of Directors declared a distribution of $0.2475 per unit payable on November 15. This distribution represents a 5% increase over last quarter's payment and is consistent with our plan to achieve 22% annual distribution growth for LP [ph] units.
Moving to cash flow and treasury activities at Dominion. Funds from operations were $3.1 billion for the first 9 months of the year. We have $5.5 billion of credit facilities, and taking into account cash, short-term investments and commercial paper outstanding, we ended the quarter with available liquidity of $2.5 billion.
For statements of cash flow and liquidity, please see Pages 14 and 25 of the Earnings Release Kit.
During the third quarter, we completed a number of financing transactions to support our growth plan and cover the acquisition of Questar. Slide 6 highlights our recent financing activities. We have one public debt financing plan for the remainder of this year at devco.[ph] 
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, Dominion's operating earnings guidance is $0.90 to $1.05 per share. The midpoint of that range is $0.28 per share above operating earnings of $0.70 per share for the fourth quarter of 2015. Positive earnings drivers for the quarter compared to last year are return to normal weather, the absence of refueling outage at Millstone, lower capacity expenses and the addition of Questar. Negative drivers for the quarter compared to last year include higher financing costs and DD&A.
Dominion's operating earnings guidance for the year remains $3.60 to $4 per share.
As to hedging, you can find our hedge positions on Page 27 of the Earnings Release Kit. As of mid-October, we have hedged 8% of our expected 2017 production at Millstone. We expect to add to our hedges over the next 3 months and plan to have about 80% of our 2017 production hedged by the end of January.
So let me summarize my financial review. Operating earnings were $1.14 per share for the third quarter of 2016, which was well above our guidance range. Operating results for Dominion Midstream Partners were in line with management's expectations. And finally, Dominion's operating earnings guidance for the fourth quarter is $0.90 to $1.05 per share and full year earnings guidance remains $3.60 to $4 per share.
I will now turn the call over to Tom Farrell."

All of our business units are on track to meet their safety goals for the year. We expect to set another company-wide safety record this year.
Our nuclear fleet continues to operate well. The net capacity factor of our 6 units was 93% for the first 9 months of the year. The contribution of the Brunswick County Power Station [ph] helped our regulated power generation group achieve record net generation.
Now for an update on our growth plans. Construction of the 1,588 [ph] megawatt Greensville County [ph] combined cycle power station continues on time and on budget. Approximately 480 workers are on site performing civil and structural work. The $1.3 billion project is expected to achieve commercial operations in late 2018.
Our 2 large contracted solar projects, Four Brothers and Three Cedars in Utah, were completed in September on time and on budget. We own 50% of the 2 projects that have a combined capacity of 530 megawatts and are secured by 20-year power purchase agreements.
We have a number of solar projects under development in the state of Virginia and continue to see demand for renewables from our customers, including data centers, military installations and the state government. The 80-megawatt solar facility under Virginia's Eastern Shore is complete and went into service over this past weekend. 3 other Virginia solar projects totaling 56 megawatts are also expected to be in service by year-end.
Earlier this month, we announced a 60-megawatt solar development in North Carolina, secured by 25-year power purchase agreements. This project should also be in service by the end of this year.
We have filed with State Corporation Commission for approval of an additional 20-megawatt solar facility at the sight of our Remington Power Station to be in service next year. In July, we signed a lease with the Department of the Navy [ph] to develop an 18-megawatt solar facility at the Oceana Naval Air Station [ph] in Virginia. If approved by the State Corporation Commission, this solar facility is expected to be in service by late next year. This will bring our operating solar fleet to 1,200 megawatts by the end of 2017.
We are in discussions with multiple parties for further solar development in the future, and we fully expect to exceed our goal of adding 500 megawatts of solar farms in Virginia and North Carolina. We have a number of electric transmission projects at various stages of regulatory approval and construction. $580 million worth of these facilities have been completed so far this year, including our new systems operations center.
We expect to place over $730 million of new transmission assets into service by year-end.
Progress on our growth plan for Dominion Energy continues as well. Our Cove Point Liquefaction project is now 75% complete with over 2,000 construction workers on site. Our engineering, procurement and construction contractor, IHI Kiewit, has installed well over half of the 21,500 tons [ph] of the structural steel required, and the piping installation is proceeding on plan.
All major components have been delivered to the site, and all will be installed under foundations by year-end. Our operations staffing plan is also on schedule. The project continues to be on time and on budget for a late 2017 in-service date.
We're continuing to work toward the commencement of construction on the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and the related Supply Header project. FERC issued its notice of schedule on August 12. We expect to receive the draft EIS in a few weeks and the final EIS in June. We anticipate beginning construction upon receipt of the first certificate during the second half of next year. Surveying and pipeline engineering is nearly complete and will be finished this year. We're finalizing our detailed construction plans and on September 16, executed the construction contract with Spring Ridge constructors. [ph] We expect completion of the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and Supply Header in the second half of 2019.
In addition to the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and Supply Header, we have 10 pipeline growth projects underway with $1 billion of investment to move 1.5 million [ph] cubic feet per day per customers by the end of 2018. Our Monroe to Cornwell project, with more than 200,000 dekatherms [ph] per day of capacity, was put into service in October, and we have another 3 projects to come online this year. Our new expansion projects are primarily demand driven, moving gas to engine [ph] power generators for local distribution companies.
In regulatory matters, hearings were held earlier this month for Dominion's base rate case for our North Carolina service territories, seeking approval of a $51.1 million increase in base rate revenues. A settlement was reached with the staff and a group of investor [ph] customers calling for a $34.7 million increase based on a 9.9% return on equity. We will implement the proposed rates subject to refund tomorrow with permanent rates becoming effective January 1 of next year. A decision is expected in December. 
Finally, I want to update you on our merger with Questar Corporation. The Public Service Commission of Utah approved the merger on August 23, and the Wyoming Public Service Commission approved it on September 14. We completed the merger 2 days later. Ron Jibson, [ph] Questar's retired Chairman and CEO, has joined Dominion's Board of Directors. Harry Simmons, [ph] the former Lead Director for Questar, has joined the board of Dominion Midstream Partners. We are excited about adding Questar to Dominion's operations and look forward to developing new growth opportunities in the Western states.
So to summarize, our business has delivered strong operating and safety performance in the third quarter. Construction of the Greensville County project is on time and on budget. Construction of the Cove Point Liquefaction project is on time and on budget. We continue to work toward FERC approval for the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and the Supply Header project, and we are excited about our future opportunities that will come as a result of our merger with Questar.
I will now return the call to Mark for a discussion of our financings at Dominion Midstream Partners."
267105,404829808,1067430,"Dominion Midstream Partners, LP, Dominion Resources, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 31, 2016",2016-10-31,"Earnings Calls","Dominion Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Tom. We issued press releases this morning announcing the launch and subsequent pricing of Dominion Midstream financing to acquire Questar Pipeline.I wanted to discuss it on this afternoon's call for a number of reasons. First, it represents",586,"Thank you, Tom. We issued press releases this morning announcing the launch and subsequent pricing of Dominion Midstream financing to acquire Questar Pipeline.
I wanted to discuss it on this afternoon's call for a number of reasons. First, it represents one of the largest financing transactions by a publicly traded MLP this year. Second, based on the low initial yield for the preferred equity and the modest discount to market for the common units, this financing was the least expensive for an MLP issuer this year. It provides clear evidence of the high level of interest by investors in DM equity. Third, despite being one of the largest offerings this year, demand for the common equity was significantly oversubscribed, leading us to upsize the offering. Fourth, this successful financing validates our strategic plan for Dominion Midstream Partners, which involves accessing capital markets on advantageous terms to fund the acquisition of midstream assets of Dominion that will, in turn, support a 22% annual distribution growth rate. And finally, this successful financing and low achieved [ph] yields confirm the value-accretive proposition underlying the formation of Dominion Midstream 2 years ago for investors of both D and DM.
As noted in this morning's press releases, Dominion Midstream Partners will acquire 100% interest in Questar Pipeline on or about December 1 for an implied enterprise value of $1.725 billion or about 10.3x 2016 EBITDA. About $435 million of existing long-term debt will remain in place at Questar Pipeline, leaving net consideration of just about $1.3 billion.
As announced this morning, we have priced a common unit offering, including both an underwritten offering and a private placement, totaling some $500 million assuming underwriters exercise the greenshoot [ph] option. Again, I would note that this common unit offering registers as one of the largest MLP unit offerings of the year and at just 2.9% reflects by far the smallest discount to any trade of any offering this year.
We have also received commitments from a group of private investors, led by Stone Peak Infrastructure Partners, [ph] for up to $600 million in convertible preferred securities, which was priced together with this morning's offering and which closes in conjunction with the transaction at the [ph] close on December 1. Among comparable securities offered by MLPs, this preferred security has the lowest-ever initial yield of 4.75% and an attractive conversion premium of 15%.
It is clear from the interest in DM preferred structure that investors see very high growth potential in DM shares. We very much appreciate the overwhelming interest and participation in this offering from both public and private investors.
At closing, the cash consideration to Dominion provided by these offerings will be used to repay existing Dominion level debt. We will also refinance the existing DM intercompany note with a 3-year term note from a group of banks.
As shown on Slide 19, including a $1.2 billion of proceeds from this transaction, we expect the MLP to generate about $7 billion to $8 billion in cash for Dominion through 2020, which we'll use to reduce holding company debt, increase dividends, invest in new growth projects and repurchase common stock.
We realize that D, DM structure is somewhat unique in the utility space, and investors have been waiting for us to begin to execute a drop-down strategy. We expect that with the success of today's transactions, both D and DM investors will see the clear long-term growth and value for both shareholders and unitholders.
With that, we'll be happy to take your questions."

So we have always hedged Millstone in the 80-plus-percent range by the end of the year call, and we plan on doing the same for 2017. In terms of future periods, we will be very cautious on hedging Millstone for a number of reasons. One is we believe that the current forward strip is dramatically understating the value of the market; and second, as you know, there is a lot of discussion in Connecticut about potential legislation and [ph] the ability to Millstone bid into future auctions. We hope that would be cleared up in the first half of next year, and we would want to see what the outcome of that would be before we hedge 2018 and beyond."

There's an increasing amount of RPS [ph] requirements in states on -- particularly on the Western Seacoast [ph] where, as you know and I think investors know, the more renewables that are built, the more gas-fired peakers are going to be required to deal with the fact that it's intermittent.

That's how I understand it. Just from reading the trade price, I see similar moves are being thought of in Illinois, for example. Connecticut has gone about it in a different way. They have an RPS standard there, and an auction has been established for some years where the LSEs bid, take their -- meet their RPS requirements by auctions from renewable suppliers into that RPS auction on an annual basis. The contemplation by the legislature, not the regulators in Connecticut is to expand that to a clean power standard that would include nuclear, which would allow up to approximately 50% of Millstone to be included in the auction. That, at this point, obviously is still in contemplation by the legislature. There is some momentum behind it. We're following it very closely. But it won't affect '17.

During this call, we will refer to certain schedules included in this morning's earnings releases and pages from our Earnings Release Kit. Schedules in the Earnings Release Kit are intended to answer the more detailed questions pertaining to operating statistics and accounting. Investor Relations will be available after the call for any clarification of these schedules. If you've not done so, I encourage you to visit the Investor Relations page on our websites, register for e-mail alerts and view our third quarter earnings documents. Our website addresses are dom.com and dommidstream.com.
In addition to the Earnings Release Kit, we have included a slide presentation on our website that will follow this morning's discussion.
And now for the usual cautionary language. The earnings releases and other matters that will be discussed on the call today may contain forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings, including our most recent annual reports on Form 10-K and our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for a discussion of factors that may cause results to differ from management's projections, forecast, estimates and expectations.
Also on this call, we will discuss some measures of our company's performance that differ from those recognized by GAAP. Reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures we are able to calculate and report are contained in the Earnings Release Kit and Dominion Midstream's press release.
Joining us on the call this afternoon are our CEO, Tom Farrell; our CFO, Mark McGettrick; and other members of our management team. Mark will discuss our earnings results for the third quarter and Dominion's earnings guidance for the fourth quarter.

Dominion Resources reported operating earnings of $1.14 per share for the third quarter of 2016, finishing well above the top of our guidance range. Positive factors relative to guidance for the quarter were favorable weather, lower operating expenses, an earlier approval of our Questar acquisition and partnership income from one of our large solar projects. Some of the partnership income is timing related and will reverse in the fourth quarter.
Negative factors were an unplanned outage at Millstone and higher major storm restoration costs.
GAAP earnings were $1.10 per share for the third quarter. The principal difference between GAAP and operating earnings were charges related to transaction costs for our merger with Questar. A reconciliation of operating earnings to reported earnings can be found on Schedule 2 of the Earnings Release Kit.
Moving to results by operating segment. At Dominion Virginia Power, EBITDA for the third quarter was $423 million, which was in the upper half of its guidance range. Favorable weather conditions were partially offset by higher major storm restoration costs. Dominion Generation produced EBITDA of $921 million in the third quarter, which exceeded the top of its guidance range. Favorable weather was the principal factor in the strong performance, partially offset by an unplanned outage at Millstone.
Third quarter EBITDA for Dominion Energy was $310 million, which was above the top of its guidance range. Lower operating expenses and an earlier-than-planned contribution from Questar were the principal drivers of the strong results. Overall, we are very pleased with the performance of each of our operating segments.
For the third quarter of 2016, Dominion Midstream Partners produced adjusted EBITDA of $27.9 million, 37% higher than the level produced in the third quarter of last year. Distributable cash flow increased 22% to $24.1 million, which was consistent with management's expectations.
On October 21, Dominion Midstream's Board of Directors declared a distribution of $0.2475 per unit payable on November 15. This distribution represents a 5% increase over last quarter's payment and is consistent with our plan to achieve 22% annual distribution growth for LP units.
Moving to cash flow and treasury activities at Dominion. Funds from operations were $3.1 billion for the first 9 months of the year. We have $5.5 billion of credit facilities, and taking into account cash, short-term investments and commercial paper outstanding, we ended the quarter with available liquidity of $2.5 billion.
For statements of cash flow and liquidity, please see Pages 14 and 25 of the Earnings Release Kit.
During the third quarter, we completed a number of financing transactions to support our growth plan and cover the acquisition of Questar. Slide 6 highlights our recent financing activities. We have one public debt financing plan for the remainder of this year at dev co.
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, Dominion's operating earnings guidance is $0.90 to $1.05 per share. The midpoint of that range is $0.28 per share above operating earnings of $0.70 per share for the fourth quarter of 2015. Positive earnings drivers for the quarter compared to last year are return to normal weather, the absence of refueling outage at Millstone, lower capacity expenses and the addition of Questar. Negative drivers for the quarter compared to last year include higher financing costs and DD&A.
Dominion's operating earnings guidance for the year remains $3.60 to $4 per share.
As to hedging, you can find our hedge positions on Page 27 of the Earnings Release Kit. As of mid-October, we have hedged 8% of our expected 2017 production at Millstone. We expect to add to our hedges over the next 3 months and plan to have about 80% of our 2017 production hedged by the end of January.
So let me summarize my financial review. Operating earnings were $1.14 per share for the third quarter of 2016, which was well above our guidance range. Operating results for Dominion Midstream Partners were in line with management's expectations. And finally, Dominion's operating earnings guidance for the fourth quarter is $0.90 to $1.05 per share and full year earnings guidance remains $3.60 to $4 per share.
I will now turn the call over to Tom Farrell."

All of our business units are on track to meet their safety goals for the year. We expect to set another company-wide safety record this year.
Our nuclear fleet continues to operate well. The net capacity factor of our 6 units was 93% for the first 9 months of the year. The contribution of the Brunswick County Power Station helped our regulated power generation group achieve record net generation.
Now for an update on our growth plans. Construction of the 1,588 megawatt Greensville County combined cycle power station continues on time and on budget. Approximately 480 workers are on site performing civil and structural work. The $1.3 billion project is expected to achieve commercial operations in late 2018.
Our 2 large contracted solar projects, Four Brothers and Three Cedars in Utah, were completed in September on time and on budget. We own 50% of the 2 projects that have a combined capacity of 530 megawatts and are secured by 20-year power purchase agreements.
We have a number of solar projects under development in the state of Virginia and continue to see demand for renewables from our customers, including data centers, military installations and the state government. The 80-megawatt solar facility under Virginia's Eastern Shore is complete and went into service over this past weekend. 3 other Virginia solar projects totaling 56 megawatts are also expected to be in service by year-end.
Earlier this month, we announced a 60-megawatt solar development in North Carolina, secured by 25-year power purchase agreements. This project should also be in service by the end of this year.
We have filed with State Corporation Commission for approval of an additional 20-megawatt solar facility at the sight of our Remington Power Station to be in service next year. In July, we signed a lease with the Department of the Navy to develop an 18-megawatt solar facility at the Oceana Naval Air Station in Virginia. If approved by the State Corporation Commission, this solar facility is expected to be in service by late next year. This will bring our operating solar fleet to 1,200 megawatts by the end of 2017.
We are in discussions with multiple parties for further solar development in the future, and we fully expect to exceed our goal of adding 500 megawatts of solar farms in Virginia and North Carolina. We have a number of electric transmission projects at various stages of regulatory approval and construction. $580 million worth of these facilities have been completed so far this year, including our new systems operations center.
We expect to place over $730 million of new transmission assets into service by year-end.
Progress on our growth plan for Dominion Energy continues as well. Our Cove Point Liquefaction project is now 75% complete with over 2,000 construction workers on site. Our engineering, procurement and construction contractor, IHI Kiewit, has installed well over half of the 21,500 tons of the structural steel required, and the piping installation is proceeding on plan.
All major components have been delivered to the site, and all will be installed under foundations by year-end. Our operations staffing plan is also on schedule. The project continues to be on time and on budget for a late 2017 in-service date.
We're continuing to work toward the commencement of construction on the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and the related Supply Header project. FERC issued its notice of schedule on August 12. We expect to receive the draft EIS in a few weeks and the final EIS in June. We anticipate beginning construction upon receipt of the first certificate during the second half of next year. Surveying and pipeline engineering is nearly complete and will be finished this year. We're finalizing our detailed construction plans and on September 16, executed the construction contract with Spring Ridge Constructors. We expect completion of the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and Supply Header in the second half of 2019.
In addition to the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and Supply Header, we have 10 pipeline growth projects underway with $1 billion of investment to move 1.5 million cubic feet per day per customers by the end of 2018. Our Monroe to Cornwell project, with more than 200,000 dekatherms per day of capacity, was put into service in October, and we have another 3 projects to come online this year. Our new expansion projects are primarily demand driven, moving gas to end-use power generators for local distribution companies.
In regulatory matters, hearings were held earlier this month for Dominion's base rate case for our North Carolina service territories, seeking approval of a $51.1 million increase in base rate revenues. A settlement was reached with the staff and a group of industrial customers calling for a $34.7 million increase based on a 9.9% return on equity. We will implement the proposed rates subject to refund tomorrow with permanent rates becoming effective January 1 of next year. A decision is expected in December. 
Finally, I want to update you on our merger with Questar Corporation. The Public Service Commission of Utah approved the merger on August 23, and the Wyoming Public Service Commission approved it on September 14. We completed the merger 2 days later. Ron Jibson, Questar's retired Chairman and CEO, has joined Dominion's Board of Directors. Harry Simmons, the former Lead Director for Questar, has joined the board of Dominion Midstream Partners. We are excited about adding Questar to Dominion's operations and look forward to developing new growth opportunities in the Western states.
So to summarize, our business has delivered strong operating and safety performance in the third quarter. Construction of the Greensville County project is on time and on budget. Construction of the Cove Point Liquefaction project is on time and on budget. We continue to work toward FERC approval for the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and the Supply Header project, and we are excited about our future opportunities that will come as a result of our merger with Questar.
I will now return the call to Mark for a discussion of our financings at Dominion Midstream Partners."
267105,404829808,1067468,"Dominion Midstream Partners, LP, Dominion Resources, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 31, 2016",2016-10-31,"Earnings Calls","Dominion Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Tom. We issued press releases this morning announcing the launch and subsequent pricing of Dominion Midstream financing to acquire Questar Pipeline.I wanted to discuss it on this afternoon's call for a number of reasons. First, it represents",580,"Thank you, Tom. We issued press releases this morning announcing the launch and subsequent pricing of Dominion Midstream financing to acquire Questar Pipeline.
I wanted to discuss it on this afternoon's call for a number of reasons. First, it represents one of the largest financing transactions by a publicly traded MLP this year. Second, based on the low initial yield for the preferred equity and the modest discount to market for the common units, this financing was the least expensive for an MLP issuer this year. It provides clear evidence of the high level of interest by investors in DM equity. Third, despite being one of the largest offerings this year, demand for the common equity was significantly oversubscribed, leading us to upsize the offering. Fourth, this successful financing validates our strategic plan for Dominion Midstream Partners, which involves accessing capital markets on advantageous terms to fund the acquisition of midstream assets of Dominion that will, in turn, support a 22% annual distribution growth rate. And finally, this successful financing and low achieved yields confirm the value-accretive proposition underlying the formation of Dominion Midstream 2 years ago for investors of both D and DM.
As noted in this morning's press releases, Dominion Midstream Partners will acquire 100% interest in Questar Pipeline on or about December 1 for an implied enterprise value of $1.725 billion or about 10.3x 2016 EBITDA. About $435 million of existing long-term debt will remain in place at Questar Pipeline, leaving net consideration of just about $1.3 billion.
As announced this morning, we have priced a common unit offering, including both an underwritten offering and a private placement, totaling some $500 million assuming underwriters exercise the greenshoe option. Again, I would note that this common unit offering registers as one of the largest MLP unit offerings of the year and at just 2.9% reflects by far the smallest discount to any trade of any offering this year.
We have also received commitments from a group of private investors, led by Stonepeak Infrastructure Partners, for up to $600 million in convertible preferred securities, which was priced together with this morning's offering and which closes in conjunction with the transaction at close on December 1. Among comparable securities offered by MLPs, this preferred security has the lowest-ever initial yield of 4.75% and an attractive conversion premium of 15%.
It is clear from the interest in DM preferred structure that investors see very high growth potential in DM shares. We very much appreciate the overwhelming interest and participation in this offering from both public and private investors.
At closing, the cash consideration to Dominion provided by these offerings will be used to repay existing Dominion level debt. We will also refinance the existing DM intercompany note with a 3-year term note from a group of banks.
As shown on Slide 19, including a $1.2 billion of proceeds from this transaction, we expect the MLP to generate about $7 billion to $8 billion in cash for Dominion through 2020, which we'll use to reduce holding company debt, increase dividends, invest in new growth projects and repurchase common stock.
We realize that D, DM structure is somewhat unique in the utility space, and investors have been waiting for us to begin to execute a drop-down strategy. We expect that with the success of today's transactions, both D and DM investors will see the clear long-term growth and value for both shareholders and unitholders.
With that, we'll be happy to take your questions."

The answer to the first part of your question is it's regardless of what the market power price will be between now and the end of January. We committed over many years to investors and the credit agencies that there will be a clear firm cash flow stream from Millstone as we put guidance out in the current period. So we have always hedged Millstone in the 80-plus-percent range by the end of the year call, and we plan on doing the same for 2017. In terms of future periods, we will be very cautious on hedging Millstone for a number of reasons. One is we believe that the current forward strip is dramatically understating the value of the market; and second, as you know, there is a lot of discussion in Connecticut about potential legislation in the ability to Millstone bid into future auctions. We hope that would be cleared up in the first half of next year, and we would want to see what the outcome of that would be before we hedge 2018 and beyond."

As far as the New York example, as I understand, New York is basically a taxpayer subsidization of 2 facilities in the northern part of New York without any support going to the Indian Point reactors outside New York City. That's how I understand it. Just from reading the trade price, I see similar moves are being thought of in Illinois, for example. Connecticut has gone about it in a different way. They have an RPS standard there, and an auction has been established for some years where the LSEs bid, take their -- meet their RPS requirements by auctions from renewable suppliers into that RPS auction on an annual basis. The contemplation by the legislature, not the regulators, in Connecticut is to expand that to a clean power of standard that would include nuclear, which would allow up to approximately 50% of Millstone to be included in the auction. That at this point, obviously, is still in contemplation by the legislature. There is some momentum behind it. We're following it very closely, but it won't affect '17. It would affect '18 and beyond."

The earnings releases and other matters that will be discussed on the call today may contain forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings, including our most recent annual reports on Form 10-K and our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for a discussion of factors that may cause results to differ from management's projections, forecast, estimates and expectations.
Also on this call, we will discuss some measures of our company's performance that differ from those recognized by GAAP. Reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures we are able to calculate and report are contained in the Earnings Release Kit and Dominion Midstream's press release.
Joining us on the call this afternoon are our CEO, Tom Farrell; our CFO, Mark McGettrick; and other members of our management team.

Dominion Resources reported operating earnings of $1.14 per share for the third quarter of 2016, finishing well above the top of our guidance range. Positive factors relative to guidance for the quarter were favorable weather, lower operating expenses, an earlier approval of our Questar acquisition and partnership income from one of our large solar projects. Some of the partnership income is timing related and will reverse in the fourth quarter.
Negative factors were an unplanned outage at Millstone and higher major storm restoration costs.
GAAP earnings were $1.10 per share for the third quarter. The principal difference between GAAP and operating earnings were charges related to transaction costs for our merger with Questar. A reconciliation of operating earnings to reported earnings can be found on Schedule 2 of the Earnings Release Kit.
Moving to results by operating segment. At Dominion Virginia Power, EBITDA for the third quarter was $423 million, which was in the upper half of its guidance range. Favorable weather conditions were partially offset by higher major storm restoration costs. Dominion Generation produced EBITDA of $921 million in the third quarter, which exceeded the top of its guidance range. Favorable weather was the principal factor in the strong performance, partially offset by an unplanned outage at Millstone.
Third quarter EBITDA for Dominion Energy was $310 million, which was above the top of its guidance range. Lower operating expenses and an earlier-than-planned contribution from Questar were the principal drivers of the strong results. Overall, we are very pleased with the performance of each of our operating segments.
For the third quarter of 2016, Dominion Midstream Partners produced adjusted EBITDA of $27.9 million, 37% higher than the level produced in the third quarter of last year. Distributable cash flow increased 22% to $24.1 million, which was consistent with management's expectations.
On October 21, Dominion Midstream's Board of Directors declared a distribution of $0.2475 per unit payable on November 15. This distribution represents a 5% increase over last quarter's payment and is consistent with our plan to achieve 22% annual distribution growth for LP units.
Moving to cash flow and treasury activities at Dominion. Funds from operations were $3.1 billion for the first 9 months of the year. We have $5.5 billion of credit facilities, and taking into account cash, short-term investments and commercial paper outstanding, we ended the quarter with available liquidity of $2.5 billion.
For statements of cash flow and liquidity, please see Pages 14 and 25 of the Earnings Release Kit.
During the third quarter, we completed a number of financing transactions to support our growth plan and cover the acquisition of Questar. Slide 6 highlights our recent financing activities. We have one public debt financing plan for the remainder of this year at VEPCO.
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, Dominion's operating earnings guidance is $0.90 to $1.05 per share. The midpoint of that range is $0.28 per share above operating earnings of $0.70 per share for the fourth quarter of 2015. Positive earnings drivers for the quarter compared to last year are return to normal weather, the absence of refueling outage at Millstone, lower capacity expenses and the addition of Questar. Negative drivers for the quarter compared to last year include higher financing costs and DD&A.
Dominion's operating earnings guidance for the year remains $3.60 to $4 per share.
As to hedging, you can find our hedge positions on Page 27 of the Earnings Release Kit. As of mid-October, we have hedged 8% of our expected 2017 production at Millstone. We expect to add to our hedges over the next 3 months and plan to have about 80% of our 2017 production hedged by the end of January.
So let me summarize my financial review. Operating earnings were $1.14 per share for the third quarter of 2016, which was well above our guidance range. Operating results for Dominion Midstream Partners were in line with management's expectations. And finally, Dominion's operating earnings guidance for the fourth quarter is $0.90 to $1.05 per share and full year earnings guidance remains $3.60 to $4 per share.
I will now turn the call over to Tom Farrell."

All of our business units are on track to meet their safety goals for the year. We expect to set another company-wide safety record this year.
Our nuclear fleet continues to operate well. The net capacity factor of our 6 units was 93% for the first 9 months of the year. The contribution of the Brunswick County Power Station helped our regulated power generation group achieve record net generation.
Now for an update on our growth plans. Construction of the 1,588 megawatt Greensville County combined cycle power station continues on time and on budget. Approximately 480 workers are on site performing civil and structural work. The $1.3 billion project is expected to achieve commercial operations in late 2018.
Our 2 large contracted solar projects, Four Brothers and Three Cedars in Utah, were completed in September on time and on budget. We own 50% of the 2 projects that have a combined capacity of 530 megawatts and are secured by 20-year power purchase agreements.
We have a number of solar projects under development in the state of Virginia and continue to see demand for renewables from our customers, including data centers, military installations and the state government. The 80-megawatt solar facility under Virginia's Eastern Shore is complete and went into service over this past weekend. 3 other Virginia solar projects totaling 56 megawatts are also expected to be in service by year-end.
Earlier this month, we announced a 60-megawatt solar development in North Carolina, secured by 25-year power purchase agreements. This project should also be in service by the end of this year.
We have filed with State Corporation Commission for approval of an additional 20-megawatt solar facility at the sight of our Remington Power Station to be in service next year. In July, we signed a lease with the Department of the Navy to develop an 18-megawatt solar facility at the Oceana Naval Air Station in Virginia. If approved by the State Corporation Commission, this solar facility is expected to be in service by late next year. This will bring our operating solar fleet to 1,200 megawatts by the end of 2017.
We are in discussions with multiple parties for further solar development in the future, and we fully expect to exceed our goal of adding 500 megawatts of solar farms in Virginia and North Carolina. We have a number of electric transmission projects at various stages of regulatory approval and construction. $580 million worth of these facilities have been completed so far this year, including our new systems operations center.
We expect to place over $730 million of new transmission assets into service by year-end.
Progress on our growth plan for Dominion Energy continues as well. Our Cove Point Liquefaction project is now 75% complete with over 2,000 construction workers on site. Our engineering, procurement and construction contractor, IHI Kiewit, has installed well over half of the 21,500 tons of the structural steel required, and the piping installation is proceeding on plan.
All major components have been delivered to the site, and all will be installed under foundations by year-end. Our operations staffing plan is also on schedule. The project continues to be on time and on budget for a late 2017 in-service date.
We're continuing to work toward the commencement of construction on the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and the related Supply Header project. FERC issued its notice of schedule on August 12. We expect to receive the draft EIS in a few weeks and the final EIS in June. We anticipate beginning construction upon receipt of the first certificate during the second half of next year. Surveying and pipeline engineering is nearly complete and will be finished this year. We're finalizing our detailed construction plans and on September 16, executed the construction contract with Spring Ridge Constructors. We expect completion of the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and Supply Header in the second half of 2019.
In addition to the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and Supply Header, we have 10 pipeline growth projects underway with $1 billion of investment to move 1.5 million cubic feet per day per customers by the end of 2018. Our Monroe to Cornwell project, with more than 200,000 dekatherms per day of capacity, was put into service in October, and we have another 3 projects to come online this year. Our new expansion projects are primarily demand driven, moving gas to end-use power generators for local distribution companies.
In regulatory matters, hearings were held earlier this month for Dominion's base rate case for our North Carolina service territories, seeking approval of a $51.1 million increase in base rate revenues. A settlement was reached with the staff and a group of industrial customers calling for a $34.7 million increase based on a 9.9% return on equity. We will implement the proposed rates subject to refund tomorrow with permanent rates becoming effective January 1 of next year. A decision is expected in December. 
Finally, I want to update you on our merger with Questar Corporation. The Public Service Commission of Utah approved the merger on August 23, and the Wyoming Public Service Commission approved it on September 14. We completed the merger 2 days later. Ron Jibson, Questar's retired Chairman and CEO, has joined Dominion's Board of Directors. Harry Simmons, the former Lead Director for Questar, has joined the board of Dominion Midstream Partners. We are excited about adding Questar to Dominion's operations and look forward to developing new growth opportunities in the Western states.
So to summarize, our business has delivered strong operating and safety performance in the third quarter. Construction of the Greensville County project is on time and on budget. Construction of the Cove Point Liquefaction project is on time and on budget. We continue to work toward FERC approval for the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and the Supply Header project, and we are excited about our future opportunities that will come as a result of our merger with Questar.
I will now return the call to Mark for a discussion of our financings at Dominion Midstream Partners."
267105,404829808,1067546,"Dominion Midstream Partners, LP, Dominion Resources, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 31, 2016",2016-10-31,"Earnings Calls","Dominion Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Tom. We issued press releases this morning announcing the launch and subsequent pricing of Dominion Midstream financing to acquire Questar Pipeline.I wanted to discuss it on this afternoon's call for a number of reasons. First, it represents",580,"Thank you, Tom. We issued press releases this morning announcing the launch and subsequent pricing of Dominion Midstream financing to acquire Questar Pipeline.
I wanted to discuss it on this afternoon's call for a number of reasons. First, it represents one of the largest financing transactions by a publicly traded MLP this year. Second, based on the low initial yield for the preferred equity and the modest discount to market for the common units, this financing was the least expensive for an MLP issuer this year. It provides clear evidence of the high level of interest by investors in DM equity. Third, despite being one of the largest offerings this year, demand for the common equity was significantly oversubscribed, leading us to upsize the offering. Fourth, this successful financing validates our strategic plan for Dominion Midstream Partners, which involves accessing capital markets on advantageous terms to fund the acquisition of midstream assets of Dominion that will, in turn, support a 22% annual distribution growth rate. And finally, this successful financing and low achieved yields confirm the value-accretive proposition underlying the formation of Dominion Midstream 2 years ago for investors of both D and DM.
As noted in this morning's press releases, Dominion Midstream Partners will acquire 100% interest in Questar Pipeline on or about December 1 for an implied enterprise value of $1.725 billion or about 10.3x 2016 EBITDA. About $435 million of existing long-term debt will remain in place at Questar Pipeline, leaving net consideration of just about $1.3 billion.
As announced this morning, we have priced a common unit offering, including both an underwritten offering and a private placement, totaling some $500 million assuming underwriters exercise the greenshoe option. Again, I would note that this common unit offering registers as one of the largest MLP unit offerings of the year and at just 2.9% reflects by far the smallest discount to any trade of any offering this year.
We have also received commitments from a group of private investors, led by Stonepeak Infrastructure Partners, for up to $600 million in convertible preferred securities, which was priced together with this morning's offering and which closes in conjunction with the transaction at close on December 1. Among comparable securities offered by MLPs, this preferred security has the lowest-ever initial yield of 4.75% and an attractive conversion premium of 15%.
It is clear from the interest in DM preferred structure that investors see very high growth potential in DM shares. We very much appreciate the overwhelming interest and participation in this offering from both public and private investors.
At closing, the cash consideration to Dominion provided by these offerings will be used to repay existing Dominion level debt. We will also refinance the existing DM intercompany note with a 3-year term note from a group of banks.
As shown on Slide 19, including a $1.2 billion of proceeds from this transaction, we expect the MLP to generate about $7 billion to $8 billion in cash for Dominion through 2020, which we'll use to reduce holding company debt, increase dividends, invest in new growth projects and repurchase common stock.
We realize that D, DM structure is somewhat unique in the utility space, and investors have been waiting for us to begin to execute a drop-down strategy. We expect that with the success of today's transactions, both D and DM investors will see the clear long-term growth and value for both shareholders and unitholders.
With that, we'll be happy to take your questions."

The answer to the first part of your question is it's regardless of what the market power price will be between now and the end of January. We committed over many years to investors and the credit agencies that there will be a clear firm cash flow stream from Millstone as we put guidance out in a current period. So we have always hedged Millstone in the 80-plus-percent range by the end of the year call, and we plan on doing the same for 2017. In terms of future periods, we will be very cautious on hedging Millstone for a number of reasons. One is we believe that the current forward strip is dramatically understating the value of the market; and second, as you know, there is a lot of discussion in Connecticut about potential legislation in the ability to Millstone bid into future auctions. We hope that would be cleared up in the first half of next year, and we would want to see what the outcome of that would be before we hedge 2018 and beyond."

Many of them are going to have to close or be converted to natural gas. There's an increasing amount of RPS requirements in states on -- particularly on the western seacoast where, as you know and I think investors know, the more renewables that are built, the more gas-fired peakers are going to be required to deal with the fact that it's intermittent. So that's just one potential opportunity that we see in the West. There's a lot of natural gas infrastructure that's going to be required in the future there. Now it's not on the same scale obviously as the Mid-Atlantic as far as population goes, but starting from the base that we have in the West, we think there's a tremendous amount of opportunity."

So I think that just reinforces our view that if we see an asset out there that fits the DM profile that we can fund it within the DM umbrella if we need to or with D parent support if required, but I think today's results just validate for us that the DM shares are highly valued and will be a great source of future equity and financing if we decide to enter the M&A space at all."

In terms of ownership, I think you could -- should assume that for the next several years, our ownership is going to stay in the 50% range, and then over time, toward the end of the decade, start to move down more into the 40% range."

We've done that for a long time, and we will continue to do it into the future, so everybody knows what expectations we should have for earnings and cash flows. As far as the New York example, as I understand, New York is basically a taxpayer subsidization of 2 facilities in the northern part of New York without any support going to the Indian Point reactors outside New York City. That's how I understand it. Just from reading the trade press, I see similar moves that are being thought of in Illinois, for example. Connecticut has gone about it in a different way. They have an RPS standard there, and an auction has been established for some years where the LSEs bid, take their -- meet their RPS requirements by auctions from renewable suppliers into that RPS auction on an annual basis. The contemplation by the legislature, not the regulators, in Connecticut is to expand that to a clean power of standard that would include nuclear, which would allow up to approximately 50% of Millstone to be included in the auction. That at this point, obviously, is still in contemplation by the legislature. There is some momentum behind it. We're following it very closely, but it won't affect '17. It would affect '18 and beyond."

Investor Relations will be available after the call for any clarification of these schedules. If you've not done so, I encourage you to visit the Investor Relations page on our websites, register for e-mail alerts and view our third quarter earnings documents. Our website addresses are dom.com and dommidstream.com.
In addition to the Earnings Release Kit, we have included a slide presentation on our website that will follow this morning's discussion.
And now for the usual cautionary language. The earnings releases and other matters that will be discussed on the call today may contain forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings, including our most recent annual reports on Form 10-K and our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for a discussion of factors that may cause results to differ from management's projections, forecast, estimates and expectations.
Also on this call, we will discuss some measures of our company's performance that differ from those recognized by GAAP. Reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures we are able to calculate and report are contained in the Earnings Release Kit and Dominion Midstream's press release.
Joining us on the call this afternoon are our CEO, Tom Farrell; our CFO, Mark McGettrick; and other members of our management team. Mark will discuss our earnings results for the third quarter and Dominion's earnings guidance for the fourth quarter.

267105,404829808,1067788,"Dominion Midstream Partners, LP, Dominion Resources, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 31, 2016",2016-10-31,"Earnings Calls","Dominion Energy, Inc.","Executives","Good afternoon.

Dominion Resources reported operating earnings of $1.14 per share for the third quarter of 2016, finishing well above the top of our guidance range. Positive factors relative to guidance for the quarter were favorable weather, lower operating expenses, an earlier approval of our Questar acquisition and partnership income from one of our large solar projects. Some of the partnership income is timing related and will reverse in the fourth quarter.
Negative factors were an unplanned outage at Millstone and higher major storm restoration costs.
GAAP earnings were $1.10 per share for the third quarter. The principal difference between GAAP and operating earnings were charges related to transaction costs for our merger with Questar. A reconciliation of operating earnings to reported earnings can be found on Schedule 2 of the Earnings Release Kit.
Moving to results by operating segment. At Dominion Virginia Power, EBITDA for the third quarter was $423 million, which was in the upper half of its guidance range. Favorable weather conditions were partially offset by higher major storm restoration costs. Dominion Generation produced EBITDA of $921 million in the third quarter, which exceeded the top of its guidance range. Favorable weather was the principal factor in the strong performance, partially offset by an unplanned outage at Millstone.
Third quarter EBITDA for Dominion Energy was $310 million, which was above the top of its guidance range. Lower operating expenses and an earlier-than-planned contribution from Questar were the principal drivers of the strong results. Overall, we are very pleased with the performance of each of our operating segments.
For the third quarter of 2016, Dominion Midstream Partners produced adjusted EBITDA of $27.9 million, 37% higher than the level produced in the third quarter of last year. Distributable cash flow increased 22% to $24.1 million, which was consistent with management's expectations.
On October 21, Dominion Midstream's Board of Directors declared a distribution of $0.2475 per unit payable on November 15. This distribution represents a 5% increase over last quarter's payment and is consistent with our plan to achieve 22% annual distribution growth for LP units.
Moving to cash flow and treasury activities at Dominion. Funds from operations were $3.1 billion for the first 9 months of the year. We have $5.5 billion of credit facilities, and taking into account cash, short-term investments and commercial paper outstanding, we ended the quarter with available liquidity of $2.5 billion.
For statements of cash flow and liquidity, please see Pages 14 and 25 of the Earnings Release Kit.
During the third quarter, we completed a number of financing transactions to support our growth plan and cover the acquisition of Questar. Slide 6 highlights our recent financing activities. We have one public debt financing plan for the remainder of this year at VEPCO.
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, Dominion's operating earnings guidance is $0.90 to $1.05 per share. The midpoint of that range is $0.28 per share above operating earnings of $0.70 per share for the fourth quarter of 2015. Positive earnings drivers for the quarter compared to last year are return to normal weather, the absence of refueling outage at Millstone, lower capacity expenses and the addition of Questar. Negative drivers for the quarter compared to last year include higher financing costs and DD&A.
Dominion's operating earnings guidance for the year remains $3.60 to $4 per share.
As to hedging, you can find our hedge positions on Page 27 of the Earnings Release Kit. As of mid-October, we have hedged 8% of our expected 2017 production at Millstone. We expect to add to our hedges over the next 3 months and plan to have about 80% of our 2017 production hedged by the end of January.
So let me summarize my financial review. Operating earnings were $1.14 per share for the third quarter of 2016, which was well above our guidance range. Operating results for Dominion Midstream Partners were in line with management's expectations. And finally, Dominion's operating earnings guidance for the fourth quarter is $0.90 to $1.05 per share and full year earnings guidance remains $3.60 to $4 per share.
I will now turn the call over to Tom Farrell."

All of our business units are on track to meet their safety goals for the year. We expect to set another company-wide safety record this year.
Our nuclear fleet continues to operate well. The net capacity factor of our 6 units was 93% for the first 9 months of the year. The contribution of the Brunswick County Power Station helped our regulated power generation group achieve record net generation.
Now for an update on our growth plans. Construction of the 1,588 megawatt Greensville County combined cycle power station continues on time and on budget. Approximately 480 workers are on site performing civil and structural work. The $1.3 billion project is expected to achieve commercial operations in late 2018.
Our 2 large contracted solar projects, Four Brothers and Three Cedars in Utah, were completed in September on time and on budget. We own 50% of the 2 projects that have a combined capacity of 530 megawatts and are secured by 20-year power purchase agreements.
We have a number of solar projects under development in the state of Virginia and continue to see demand for renewables from our customers, including data centers, military installations and the state government. The 80-megawatt solar facility under Virginia's Eastern Shore is complete and went into service over this past weekend. 3 other Virginia solar projects totaling 56 megawatts are also expected to be in service by year-end.
Earlier this month, we announced a 60-megawatt solar development in North Carolina, secured by 25-year power purchase agreements. This project should also be in service by the end of this year.
We have filed with State Corporation Commission for approval of an additional 20-megawatt solar facility at the sight of our Remington Power Station to be in service next year. In July, we signed a lease with the Department of the Navy to develop an 18-megawatt solar facility at the Oceana Naval Air Station in Virginia. If approved by the State Corporation Commission, this solar facility is expected to be in service by late next year. This will bring our operating solar fleet to 1,200 megawatts by the end of 2017.
We are in discussions with multiple parties for further solar development in the future, and we fully expect to exceed our goal of adding 500 megawatts of solar farms in Virginia and North Carolina. We have a number of electric transmission projects at various stages of regulatory approval and construction. $580 million worth of these facilities have been completed so far this year, including our new systems operations center.
We expect to place over $730 million of new transmission assets into service by year-end.
Progress on our growth plan for Dominion Energy continues as well. Our Cove Point Liquefaction project is now 75% complete with over 2,000 construction workers on site. Our engineering, procurement and construction contractor, IHI Kiewit, has installed well over half of the 21,500 tons of the structural steel required, and the piping installation is proceeding on plan.
All major components have been delivered to the site, and all will be installed under foundations by year-end. Our operations staffing plan is also on schedule. The project continues to be on time and on budget for a late 2017 in-service date.
We're continuing to work toward the commencement of construction on the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and the related Supply Header project. FERC issued its notice of schedule on August 12. We expect to receive the draft EIS in a few weeks and the final EIS in June. We anticipate beginning construction upon receipt of the first certificate during the second half of next year. Surveying and pipeline engineering is nearly complete and will be finished this year. We're finalizing our detailed construction plans and on September 16, executed the construction contract with Spring Ridge Constructors. We expect completion of the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and Supply Header in the second half of 2019.
In addition to the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and Supply Header, we have 10 pipeline growth projects underway with $1 billion of investment to move 1.5 million cubic feet per day per customers by the end of 2018. Our Monroe to Cornwell project, with more than 200,000 dekatherms per day of capacity, was put into service in October, and we have another 3 projects to come online this year. Our new expansion projects are primarily demand driven, moving gas to end-use power generators for local distribution companies.
In regulatory matters, hearings were held earlier this month for Dominion's base rate case for our North Carolina service territories, seeking approval of a $51.1 million increase in base rate revenues. A settlement was reached with the staff and a group of industrial customers calling for a $34.7 million increase based on a 9.9% return on equity. We will implement the proposed rates subject to refund tomorrow with permanent rates becoming effective January 1 of next year. A decision is expected in December. 
Finally, I want to update you on our merger with Questar Corporation. The Public Service Commission of Utah approved the merger on August 23, and the Wyoming Public Service Commission approved it on September 14. We completed the merger 2 days later. Ron Jibson, Questar's retired Chairman and CEO, has joined Dominion's Board of Directors. Harry Simmons, the former Lead Director for Questar, has joined the board of Dominion Midstream Partners. We are excited about adding Questar to Dominion's operations and look forward to developing new growth opportunities in the Western states.
So to summarize, our business has delivered strong operating and safety performance in the third quarter. Construction of the Greensville County project is on time and on budget. Construction of the Cove Point Liquefaction project is on time and on budget. We continue to work toward FERC approval for the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and the Supply Header project, and we are excited about our future opportunities that will come as a result of our merger with Questar.
I will now return the call to Mark for a discussion of our financings at Dominion Midstream Partners."
267105,404829808,1067788,"Dominion Midstream Partners, LP, Dominion Resources, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 31, 2016",2016-10-31,"Earnings Calls","Dominion Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Tom. We issued press releases this morning announcing the launch and subsequent pricing of Dominion Midstream financing to acquire Questar Pipeline.I wanted to discuss it on this afternoon's call for a number of reasons. First, it represents",580,"Thank you, Tom. We issued press releases this morning announcing the launch and subsequent pricing of Dominion Midstream financing to acquire Questar Pipeline.
I wanted to discuss it on this afternoon's call for a number of reasons. First, it represents one of the largest financing transactions by a publicly traded MLP this year. Second, based on the low initial yield for the preferred equity and the modest discount to market for the common units, this financing was the least expensive for an MLP issuer this year. It provides clear evidence of the high level of interest by investors in DM equity. Third, despite being one of the largest offerings this year, demand for the common equity was significantly oversubscribed, leading us to upsize the offering. Fourth, this successful financing validates our strategic plan for Dominion Midstream Partners, which involves accessing capital markets on advantageous terms to fund the acquisition of midstream assets of Dominion that will, in turn, support a 22% annual distribution growth rate. And finally, this successful financing and low achieved yields confirm the value-accretive proposition underlying the formation of Dominion Midstream 2 years ago for investors of both D and DM.
As noted in this morning's press releases, Dominion Midstream Partners will acquire 100% interest in Questar Pipeline on or about December 1 for an implied enterprise value of $1.725 billion or about 10.3x 2016 EBITDA. About $435 million of existing long-term debt will remain in place at Questar Pipeline, leaving net consideration of just about $1.3 billion.
As announced this morning, we have priced a common unit offering, including both an underwritten offering and a private placement, totaling some $500 million assuming underwriters exercise the greenshoe option. Again, I would note that this common unit offering registers as one of the largest MLP unit offerings of the year and at just 2.9% reflects by far the smallest discount to any trade of any offering this year.
We have also received commitments from a group of private investors, led by Stonepeak Infrastructure Partners, for up to $600 million in convertible preferred securities, which was priced together with this morning's offering and which closes in conjunction with the transaction at close on December 1. Among comparable securities offered by MLPs, this preferred security has the lowest-ever initial yield of 4.75% and an attractive conversion premium of 15%.
It is clear from the interest in DM preferred structure that investors see very high growth potential in DM shares. We very much appreciate the overwhelming interest and participation in this offering from both public and private investors.
At closing, the cash consideration to Dominion provided by these offerings will be used to repay existing Dominion level debt. We will also refinance the existing DM intercompany note with a 3-year term note from a group of banks.
As shown on Slide 19, including a $1.2 billion of proceeds from this transaction, we expect the MLP to generate about $7 billion to $8 billion in cash for Dominion through 2020, which we'll use to reduce holding company debt, increase dividends, invest in new growth projects and repurchase common stock.
We realize that D, DM structure is somewhat unique in the utility space, and investors have been waiting for us to begin to execute a drop-down strategy. We expect that with the success of today's transactions, both D and DM investors will see the clear long-term growth and value for both shareholders and unitholders.
With that, we'll be happy to take your questions."

We committed over many years to investors and the credit agencies that there will be a clear firm cash flow stream from Millstone as we put guidance out in a current period. So we have always hedged Millstone in the 80-plus-percent range by the end of the year call, and we plan on doing the same for 2017. In terms of future periods, we will be very cautious on hedging Millstone for a number of reasons. One is we believe that the current forward strip is dramatically understating the value of the market; and second, as you know, there is a lot of discussion in Connecticut about potential legislation in the ability to Millstone bid into future auctions. We hope that would be cleared up in the first half of next year, and we would want to see what the outcome of that would be before we hedge 2018 and beyond."

That's how I understand it. Just from reading the trade press, I see similar moves that are being thought of in Illinois, for example. Connecticut has gone about it in a different way. They have an RPS standard there, and an auction has been established for some years where the LSEs bid, take their -- meet their RPS requirements by auctions from renewable suppliers into that RPS auction on an annual basis. The contemplation by the legislature, not the regulators, in Connecticut is to expand that to a clean power of standard that would include nuclear, which would allow up to approximately 50% of Millstone to be included in the auction. That at this point, obviously, is still in contemplation by the legislature. There is some momentum behind it. We're following it very closely, but it won't affect '17.
