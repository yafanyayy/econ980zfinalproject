With me to review Kroger's fourth quarter and fiscal 2015 results is Mike Schlotman, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. 
Let me just start by saying, wow, what a year. I'm delighted to report that Kroger executed on our growth plan and delivered on our financial performance commitments in 2015. We delivered our 49th consecutive quarter of positive identical supermarket sales growth without fuel and our 11th consecutive year of market share growth. We met our goal to increase capital investment while improving return on invested capital. And excluding Roundy's, we exceeded our commitment to slightly expand FIFO operating margin excluding fuel. 
Our 431,000 associates make it all happen. I am very proud of our team. By keeping our focus on serving one customer at a time, we continue to deliver for our customers and for our shareholders with remarkable consistency. 
I also want to welcome the Roundy's associates in Wisconsin and Chicago to the Kroger family. Our merger closed in December, and integration is well underway. As we've gotten to know the people at Roundy's, it is clear they share our values and desire to make a difference for our customers. 
We continue to successfully expand the technology that Harris Teeter and Vitacost.com brought to Kroger, which provide an even better shopping experience for our customers. We developed ClickList, our shop online, pick up at the store service based on what we learned from Harris Teeter's Express Lane. I'm pleased to share that we've expanded ClickList from 1 market to 7 markets. We continue to improve the offering, and our customers and associates both are providing very positive feedback. We are testing Vitacost.com's technology and ship-to-home infrastructure in Denver through a pilot in our King Soopers division. We're also testing a similar endless aisle experience in our new store format that we launched earlier this month in Washington.
We're very excited about this new community-focused grocery store concept called Main and Vine. Main and Vine mixes local, specialty and everyday products all at affordable prices. It reimagines the modern grocery shopping experience, placing in the middle of the store fresh produce and bulk items, along with an event center where shoppers can enjoy cooking demonstrations, food and beverage tasting and find a new recipe idea for dinner tonight. Customer feedback has been very positive.
2015 was a big year for our Corporate Brands portfolio, accounting for more than $20 billion of our total revenue. During the quarter, Corporate Brands represented approximately 29% of total units sold and 26.2% of sales dollars excluding fuel and pharmacy. 
Simple Truth continues to grow at an incredible rate, setting sales records quarter after quarter. The brand reached $1.5 billion in revenue for the year. And already in 2016, Simple Truth expanded to be a lot true lifestyle brand with the introduction of Simple Truth household personal care and baby products. We expect 2016 to be an exciting year of continued innovation throughout our Corporate Brands portfolio.
Needless to say, there's a lot going on at Kroger. We are creating a seamless experience for our customers. Whether experimenting with new formats, driving digital engagement or launching new corporate brand products, we believe that combining Kroger's culture of innovation with our culture of opportunity will continue to support our growth. Kroger has an incredibly strong management team and a deep bench of leaders throughout our business. We are incrementally investing in leadership development and training for all our associates, including high-volume store managers and future senior leaders. And we have created 9,000 new jobs last year at all levels, which means even more opportunities for current associates to grow and advance. For example, we established a new operating division, the Dallas division, which created dozens of new leadership opportunities.
Looking at the economy and customer shopping behavior during 2015, we noticed that customer sentiment held relatively stable throughout the year versus previous years in which their attitudes were more volatile. The past few months we've seen the top economic concerns shift from rising health care cost to the stock market. Customers have more disposable income as a result of significantly lower fuel prices. Yet economic uncertainty remains, which typically causes people to cut back on discretionary spending.
That said, an interesting insight is that our customers continue to spend with us. If you look at some of our high-quality offerings such as Murray's Cheese, Private Selection, Starbucks and Boar's Head or at the strength of our wine and craft beer business, it is clear that customers across all demographics want a great food experience. Because Kroger is doing a better job offering high-quality food at affordable prices, we continue to win with our customers even as they remain cautious about their overall spending.
2015 was an outstanding year for Kroger. We delivered on our performance targets and continued to expand our use of technology to drive growth. In 2016, we will continue making a difference for our customers and associates, growing our business and delivering value for shareholders. Now Mike will offer more detail on Kroger's financial results and outline our guidance for 2016. Mike?"

As Rodney said, wow, what a year. We exceeded all 4 of our financial performance commitments for the year.

We exceeded all 4 of our financial performance commitments for the year. Identical supermarket sales and net earnings per diluted share growth, FIFO operating profit margin and return on invested capital were all better than our annual and long-term guidance. Market share growth continued, improving by 40 basis points, with 17 of 20 markets outlined by Nielsen POS plus data up and just 1 market down. 
We had a lot of unique items in last year's fourth quarter, which make comparisons more complicated, so I'd like to spend the next few minutes discussing the story behind the numbers for our fourth quarter and fiscal year and to give you some color on those and the current operating environment.
There's a lot of speculation about inflation or deflation or disinflation. We believe a deeper dive is required when the operating environment has increased volatility. When you look at identical supermarket sales, you should not come to the conclusion that less inflation is fundamentally a bad thing. In fact, if you look at our real growth in the fourth quarter, that is, identical supermarket sales less inflation, this year's fourth quarter result was stronger than last year's fourth quarter when identical sales were over 6%. Tonnage stayed strong at over 3% unit growth during the quarter and the strong tonnage allowed us to grow FIFO, gross profit dollars, excluding fuel and Roundy's, by 4.4% in the quarter. All but 1 supermarket department had positive identical supermarket sales, excluding fuel during the quarter. Our natural foods, deli and produce departments led the way. The meat department was slightly negative due to 5% deflation in the category. This deflation has allowed retail prices to [indiscernible] or increase their purchases. As a result of strong tonnage, the meat department had a great quarter with strong FIFO gross profit dollar growth. This is what we often refer to as good deflation. 
Our operating costs as a rate of sales were down for the 11th consecutive year. However, they were up 23 basis points in the fourth quarter. This calculation excludes retail fuel operations and Roundy's and excludes a $60 million contribution to the Kroger Company Foundation and $55 million contribution to the UFCW pension plan in last year's fourth quarter and a $30 million contribution to that same plan in this year's fourth quarter.
There were several expenses in the quarter that won't continue at the same rate in future quarters, including chargebacks related to the transition of our payment systems to EMV that we expect to level out throughout 2016. We also saw higher pension costs and health care costs due to an increase in the number of claims and higher health care cost claims that occurred during the fourth quarter. All that said, we can and will do a better job in some expense categories, including shrink, completing our EMV rollout and benefit costs.
In December, we said that volatility in weekly fuel costs would influence our fourth quarter results. That was true for the fourth quarter as our cents per gallon fuel margin was approximately $0.169 compared to $0.234 in the same quarter last year. Fuel in the fourth quarter only contributed about half as much net earnings per diluted share as compared to last year's fourth quarter. For the full year, the cents per gallon fuel margin was roughly $0.174 compared to $0.19 last year. 
Our fourth quarter net earnings per diluted share increased 9.6% to $0.57 compared to $0.52 during the same period last year. This result was helped by the lower tax rate and lower LIFO expense, but our strong real growth contributed to our results. 
Our 2015 cash flow generation was strong, allowing us to make $3.3 billion in capital investments during the year, excluding mergers, acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities. We repurchased $703 million of stock and returned $385 million to shareholders through our dividend. Net operating working capital declined $451 million, which also enhanced cash flow. Our net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio came in at 2.08x compared to 2.14 during the same period last year, even while investing approximately $870 million in our merger with Roundy's late in the year. Our balance sheet is a strong as ever. 
I'll provide a brief update on labor relations. In 2016, we will negotiate agreements with UFCW for store associates in Houston, Indianapolis, Little Rock, Nashville, Portland, Southern California and Fry's in Arizona. Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive costs and compensation packages that provide solid wages, good quality affordable health care and retirement benefits for our associates. Kroger's financial results continue to be pressured by rising health care and pension costs, which some of our competitors do not face. Kroger and the local unions, which represent many of our associates, have a shared objective: Growing Kroger's business and growing it profitably, which will help us create more jobs and career opportunities and enhance job security for our associates.
Turning now to our 2016 guidance. We expect identical supermarket sales growth, excluding fuel, of approximately 2.5% to 3.5% for 2016, reflecting the lower inflationary environment. For full year net earnings, we expect 2016 to range from $2.19 to $2.28 per diluted share. Wherewithal within the range will be primarily driven by the actual fuel margins. We expect margins will be at or slightly below the 5-year average with continued volatility. We expect our core business in 2016 to grow in line with its long-term net earnings per share growth rate of 8% to 11%. Shareholder return will be further enhanced by a dividend, which is expected to increase over time. 
In thinking about the cadence of our quarterly results compared to our long-term 8% to 11% guidance, the first quarter we would expect to be at the midpoint to high end; the second quarter, below that range, and keep in mind, 2015 grew 26% for earnings per share last year; the third quarter, at the midpoint; and the fourth quarter at the midpoint. 
We expect capital investments, excluding mergers, acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities to be in the $4.1 billion to $4.4 billion range for 2016. 
We expect Kroger's full year FIFO operating margin in 2016, excluding fuel, to expand slightly compared to 2015 results. 
Now I will turn it back to Rodney"

When you look at, even coming into this year, when you look at shipments, case shipments out of our warehouses to replenish our stores, it remains very, very strong. If you go back to the commentary I had on the meat department, some of the categories, as we say, it's good deflation, because we are getting back to retail price points where the customers can buy a lot more of that product. And while for the time being, it's a slight headwind to sales when you just look at the top line, with the number of units we're selling at a good gross profit dollar rate per item, we are generating significantly more gross profit dollars. When you look at the fourth quarter overall, you have to keep in mind a few things about your commentary about late in the quarter. We had significant snow events during last year's fourth quarter as well as the Super Bowl shifting from the fourth quarter to the first quarter. And those on top of department like meat with the deflation certainly play a factor in what the sales percentage growth is, but the unit growth continues to be very strong."

And as Rodney said, if you look at produce, it was actually inflationary. So the produce has been all over the map this year, deflationary in the first 2 quarters, about flat in the third quarter, now inflationary. And our job is to operate the best we can given the environment we're operating in. And I think we've done a phenomenal job of managing our way through some of the volatility in the commodities that are out there. And then the backdrop of that, pharmacy continues to have inflation although it declined throughout the year. And then at the fourth quarter, just under 5% inflation and it started the year at 10.

We believe later in the year, we'll see a little bit more inflation versus being consistent throughout the year.

The guidance at that point in time didn't contemplate a merger with Harris Teeter and then a subsequent merger with Roundy's. Harris Teeter had gone into a new market into Washington DC, Baltimore area. We continue to fill in those markets with some very attractive sites. Another chunk of the increase in the CapEx is allocating capital to Roundy's, not only to support the plan they had in place, there were a lot of plans they would have had that given their financial position they could have executed on. So there are dollars in there for us to go in and refresh and remodel some of their stores to show the folks in Wisconsin what they can expect going forward. The rest of it is really, we didn't start off as quickly on our fill in strategies we would've thought in 2012. It took us a little longer to get projects lined up, and we feel comfortable now that the pipeline of projects we have are starting to come to fruition.

But almost every week, or really every day when we get ID sales, it seems there's some geography that was up against weather last year and no weather this year. That's going to flush itself out. Those things happen occasionally. It's our job to manage through it. Tonnage has remained strong. We feel good about where we're trending on those pieces. I don't think it's an issue from our tonnage or our growth or our customers coming in to the store. We saw great trends in the fourth quarter when we worked up against weather when our total households that came to our stores increased, the visits per households in total increased and units per baskets in the fourth quarter increased. And those kinds of things, over time, that's the momentum you want to see going into a new year. So we'll work our way through that. Relative to your question on IDs not where they were, but EPS up, I would go back to my comment on the meat department, where you just can't assume that if ID sales aren't as strong as they were, that's just a percentage calculation. What you have to understand is what's the cost of that product, what can I sell it for and how many gross profit dollars do I make off of that? In many instances like meat, because of the pickup in the volume at lower retails, you wind up generating significantly more gross profit dollars, and we would expect that to continue to play out in different categories throughout the year. Think about the effect that's had on milk on the top line. Milk generated a good profit in the year for us. Headwind is the reported ID sales, absolutely. But overall, the generation of profitability in milk was strong for the year."

With me to review Kroger's fourth quarter and fiscal 2015 results is Mike Schlotman, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. 
Let me just start by saying, wow, what a year. I'm delighted to report that Kroger executed on our growth plan and delivered on our financial performance commitments in 2015. We delivered our 49th consecutive quarter of positive identical supermarket sales growth without fuel and our 11th consecutive year of market share growth. We met our goal to increase capital investment while improving return on invested capital. And excluding Roundy's, we exceeded our commitment to slightly expand FIFO operating margin, excluding fuel. 
Our 431,000 associates make it all happen. I am very proud of our team. By keeping our focus on serving one customer at a time, we continue to deliver for our customers and for our shareholders with remarkable consistency. 
I also want to welcome the Roundy's associates in Wisconsin and Chicago to the Kroger family. Our merger closed in December and integration is well underway. As we've gotten to know the people at Roundy's, it is clear they share our values and desire to make a difference for our customers. 
We continue to successfully expand the technologies that Harris Teeter and Vitacost.com brought to Kroger, which provide an even better shopping experience for our customers. We developed ClickList, our shop online, ""pick up at the store"" service based on what we learned from Harris Teeter's Express Lane. I'm pleased to share that we've expanded ClickList from 1 market to 7 markets. We continue to improve the offering, and our customers and associates both are providing very positive feedback. We are testing Vitacost.com's technology and ship-to-home infrastructure in Denver through a pilot in our King Soopers division. We're also testing a similar endless aisle experience in our new store format that we launched earlier this month in Gig Harbor, Washington.
We're very excited about this new community-focused grocery store concept called Main &Vine. Main & Vine mixes local, specialty and everyday products all at affordable prices. It reimagines the modern grocery shopping experience, placing in the middle of the store fresh produce and bulk items, along with an event center where shoppers can enjoy cooking demonstrations, food and beverage tastings and find a new recipe idea for dinner tonight. Customer feedback has been very positive.
2015 was a big year for our Corporate Brands portfolio, accounting for more than $20 billion of our total revenue. During the quarter, Corporate Brands represented approximately 29% of total units sold and 26.2% of sales dollars, excluding fuel and pharmacy. 
Simple Truth continues to grow at an incredible rate, setting sales records quarter after quarter. The brand reached $1.5 billion in revenue for the year. And already in 2016, Simple Truth expanded to be a lot true lifestyle brand with the introduction of Simple Truth household, personal care and baby products. We expect 2016 to be an exciting year of continued innovation throughout our Corporate Brands portfolio.
Needless to say, there's a lot going on at Kroger. We are creating a seamless experience for our customers. Whether experimenting with new formats, driving digital engagement or launching new corporate brand products, we believe that combining Kroger's culture of innovation with our culture of opportunity will continue to support our growth. Kroger has an incredibly strong management team and a deep bench of leaders throughout our business. We are incrementally investing in leadership development and training for all our associates, including high-volume store managers and future senior leaders. And we have created 9,000 new jobs last year at all levels, which means even more opportunities for current associates to grow and advance. For example, we established a new operating division, the Dallas division, which created dozens of new leadership opportunities.
Looking at the economy and customer shopping behavior during 2015, we noticed that customer sentiment held relatively stable throughout the year versus previous years in which their attitudes were more volatile. The past few months, we've seen the top economic concerns shift from rising health care cost to the stock market. Customers have more disposable income as a result of significantly lower fuel prices. Yet economic uncertainty remains, which typically causes people to cut back on discretionary spending.
That said, an interesting insight is that our customers continue to spend with us. If you look at some of our high-quality offerings such as Murray's Cheese, Private Selection, Starbucks and Boar's Head or at the strength of our wine and craft beer business, it is clear that customers across all demographics want a great food experience. Because Kroger is doing a better job offering high-quality food at affordable prices, we continue to win with our customers even as they remain cautious about their overall spending.
2015 was an outstanding year for Kroger. We delivered on our performance targets and continue to expand our use of technology to drive growth. In 2016, we will continue making a difference for our customers and associates, growing our business and delivering value for shareholders. Now Mike will offer more detail on Kroger's financial results and outline our guidance for 2016. Mike?"

As Rodney said, wow, what a year. We exceeded all 4 of our financial performance commitments for the year.

We exceeded all 4 of our financial performance commitments for the year. Identical supermarket sales and net earnings per diluted share growth, FIFO operating profit margin and return on invested capital were all better than our annual and long-term guidance. Market share growth continued, improving by 40 basis points, with 17 of 20 markets outlined by Nielsen POS plus data up and just one market down. 
We had a lot of unique items in last year's fourth quarter, which make comparisons more complicated, so I'd like to spend the next few minutes discussing the story behind the numbers for our fourth quarter and fiscal year and to give you some color on those and the current operating environment.
There's a lot of speculation about inflation or deflation or disinflation. We believe a deeper dive is required when the operating environment has increased volatility. When you look at identical supermarket sales, you should not come to the conclusion that less inflation is fundamentally a bad thing. In fact, if you look at our real growth in the fourth quarter, that is, identical supermarket sales less inflation, this year's fourth quarter result was stronger than last year's fourth quarter when identical sales were over 6%. Tonnage stayed strong at over 3% unit growth during the quarter, and the strong tonnage allowed us to grow FIFO, gross profit dollars, excluding fuel and Roundy's, by 4.4% in the quarter. All but one supermarket department had positive identical supermarket sales, excluding fuel during the quarter. Our natural foods, deli and produce departments led the way. The meat department was slightly negative due to 5% deflation in the category. This deflation has allowed retail prices to repeat or increase their purchases. As a result of strong tonnage, the meat department had a great quarter with strong FIFO gross profit dollar growth. This is what we often refer to as good deflation. 
Our operating costs as a rate of sales were down for the 11th consecutive year. However, they were up 23 basis points in the fourth quarter. This calculation excludes retail fuel operations and Roundy's and excludes a $60 million contribution to the Kroger Co. Foundation and $55 million contribution to the UFCW pension plan in last year's fourth quarter and a $30 million contribution to that same plan in this year's fourth quarter.
There were several expenses in the quarter that won't continue at the same rate in future quarters, including chargebacks related to the transition of our payment systems to EMV that we expect to level out throughout 2016. We also saw higher pension costs and health care costs due to an increase in the number of claims and higher health care cost claims that occurred during the fourth quarter. All that said, we can and will do a better job in some expense categories, including shrink, completing our EMV rollout and benefit costs.
In December, we said that volatility in weekly fuel cost would influence our fourth quarter results. That was true for the fourth quarter as our cents per gallon fuel margin was approximately $0.169 compared to $0.234 in the same quarter last year. Fuel in the fourth quarter only contributed about half as much net earnings per diluted share as compared to last year's fourth quarter. For the full year, the cents per gallon fuel margin was roughly $0.174 compared to $0.19 last year. 
Our fourth quarter net earnings per diluted share increased 9.6% to $0.57 compared to $0.52 during the same period last year. This result was helped by the lower tax rate and lower LIFO expense, but our strong real growth contributed to our results. 
Our 2015 cash flow generation was strong, allowing us to make $3.3 billion in capital investments during the year, excluding mergers, acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities. We repurchased $703 million of stock and returned $385 million to shareholders through our dividend. Net operating working capital declined $451 million, which also enhanced cash flow. Our net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio came in at 2.08x compared to 2.14 during the same period last year, even while investing approximately $870 million in our merger with Roundy's late in the year. Our balance sheet is a strong as ever. 
I'll provide a brief update on labor relations. In 2016, we will negotiate agreements with UFCW for store associates in Houston, Indianapolis, Little Rock, Nashville, Portland, Southern California and Fry's in Arizona. Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive costs and compensation packages that provide solid wages, good quality affordable health care and retirement benefits for our associates. Kroger's financial results continue to be pressured by rising health care and pension costs, which some of our competitors do not face. Kroger and the local unions, which represent many of our associates, have a shared objective: Growing Kroger's business and growing it profitably, which will help us create more jobs and career opportunities and enhance job security for our associates.
Turning now to our 2016 guidance. We expect identical supermarket sales growth, excluding fuel, of approximately 2.5% to 3.5% for 2016, reflecting the lower inflationary environment. For full year net earnings, we expect 2016 to range from $2.19 to $2.28 per diluted share. Wherewithal within the range will be primarily driven by the actual fuel margins. We expect margins will be at or slightly below the 5-year average with continued volatility. We expect our core business in 2016 to grow in line with its long-term net earnings per share growth rate of 8% to 11%. Shareholder return will be further enhanced by a dividend, which is expected to increase over time. 
In thinking about the cadence of our quarterly results compared to our long-term 8% to 11% guidance, the first quarter, we would expect to be at the midpoint to high end; the second quarter, below that range, and keep in mind, 2015 grew 26% for earnings per share last year; the third quarter, at the midpoint; and the fourth quarter at the midpoint. 
We expect capital investments, excluding mergers, acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities to be in the $4.1 billion to $4.4 billion range for 2016. 
We expect Kroger's full year FIFO operating margin in 2016, excluding fuel, to expand slightly compared to 2015 results. 
Now I will turn it back to Rodney"

When -- if you go back to the commentary I had on the meat department, some of the categories, as we say, it's good deflation because we're getting back to retail price points where the customers can buy a lot more of that product. And while for the time being, it's a slight headwind to sales when you just look at the top line, with the number of units we're selling at a good gross profit dollar rate per item, we're generating significantly more gross profit dollars. When you look at the fourth quarter overall, you have to keep in mind a few things about your commentary about late in the quarter. We had significant snow events during last year's fourth quarter as well as the Super Bowl shifting from the fourth quarter to the first quarter. And those on top of department, like meat with the deflation, certainly play a factor in what the sales percentage growth is, but the unit growth continues to be very strong."

And as Rodney said, if you look at produce, it was actually inflationary. So produce has been all over the map this year, deflationary in the first 2 quarters, about flat in the third quarter, now inflationary. And our job is to operate the best we can given the environment we're operating in. And I think we've done a phenomenal job of managing our way through some of the volatility in the commodities that are out there. And then the backdrop of that, pharmacy continues to have inflation, although it declined throughout the year.

The other thing is, and that's -- and you never know until after the fact is, how did the inflation happen. And we believe that early in the year, we won't see much inflation. We believe later in the year, we'll see a little bit more inflation versus being consistent throughout the year. And the inflation guidance is as much affecting the LIFO estimate as it is what we really think inflation's going to be if you volume-weighted it throughout the year.

So it's really our partnership and synergies that we felt like we could bring to Roundy's and the strength that they have that we could improve from where everything was. So it's a little different than a completely typical thing, how we merge to put somebody. But I wouldn't -- I don't think you should read into that, that our strategies have just fundamentally changed in terms of the way we approach things."

The guidance at that point in time didn't contemplate a merger with Harris Teeter and then a subsequent merger with Roundy's. Harris Teeter had gone into a new market into Washington DC, Baltimore area. We continue to fill in those markets with some very attractive sites. Another chunk of the increase in the CapEx is allocating capital to Roundy's, not only to support the plan they had in place, there were a lot of plans they would have had that, given their financials position, they couldn't have executed on. So there are dollars in there for us to go in and refresh and remodel some of their stores to show the folks in Wisconsin what they can expect going forward. The rest of it is really, we didn't start off as quickly on our fill-in strategies, we would've thought in 2012. It took us a little longer to get projects lined up, and we feel comfortable now that the pipeline of projects we have are starting to come to fruition.

But almost every week or, really, every day when we get ID sales, it seems there's some geography that was up against weather last year and no weather this year. That's going to flush itself out. Those things happen occasionally. It's our job to manage through it. Tonnage has remained strong. We feel good about where we're trending on those pieces. I don't think it's an issue from our tonnage or our growth or our customers coming in the store. We saw great trends in the fourth quarter when we worked up against weather when our total households that came to our stores increased, the visits per households, and total increased in units per basket in the fourth quarter increased. And those kinds of things, over time, that's the momentum you want to see going into the new year. So we'll work our way through that. Relative to your question on, ID is not where they were, but EPS up, I would go back to my comment on the meat department, where you just can't assume that if ID sales aren't as strong as they were, that's just a percentage calculation. What you have to understand is what's the cost of that product, what can I sell it for and how many gross profit dollars do I make off of that? In many instances, like meat, because of the pickup in the volume at lower retails, you wind up generating significantly more gross profit dollars, and we would expect that to continue to play out in different categories throughout the year. Think about the effect that's had on milk on the top line. Milk generated a good profit in the year for us. Headwind is the reported ID sales, absolutely.

As you know, a lot of our associates listen into the call each quarter. Our strong results in 2015 are the result of your hard work and dedication to our customers' each other and the communities that we serve. I want to thank each of you for what you do every day to make a difference for our customers. Sometimes even simple things make someone's day brighter, like when Kroger associates in Tennessee worked with a community partner to deliver flowers to seniors, or when our Fry's team celebrated a special customer's 101st birthday at a Tucson store. Just awesome. 
Our customers appreciate your thoughtfulness. Keep up the great work. Across the country, we continue to listen to our associates' feedback. In addition to solid pay, healthcare, pension and other benefits, you told us that work-life balance is important, too. That's why we are introducing advance notice work schedules for associates working in our stores. This means associates will have their work schedule further in advance every time. This is designed to help you plan and manage other important things such as school, family and other events and responsibilities. 14 of our retail divisions have introduced this or are doing so now, and several others will have launched by the end of the first quarter. We work closely with our union locals who introduced this. So far, feedback from our associates have been very positive. 
As always, thank you, again, for your continued commitment to Kroger and our customers. That completes today's call. Thanks for joining."

With me to review Kroger's fourth quarter and fiscal 2015 results is Mike Schlotman, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. 
Let me just start by saying, wow, what a year! I'm delighted to report that Kroger executed on our growth plan and delivered on our financial performance commitments in 2015. We delivered our 49th consecutive quarter of positive identical supermarket sales growth without fuel and our 11th consecutive year of market share growth. We met our goal to increase capital investment while improving return on invested capital. And excluding Roundy's, we exceeded our commitment to slightly expand FIFO operating margin, excluding fuel. 
Our 431,000 associates make it all happen. I am very proud of our team. By keeping our focus on serving one customer at a time, we continue to deliver for our customers and for our shareholders with remarkable consistency. 
I also want to welcome the Roundy's associates in Wisconsin and Chicago to the Kroger family. Our merger closed in December and integration is well underway. As we've gotten to know the people at Roundy's, it is clear they share our values and desire to make a difference for our customers. 
We continue to successfully expand the technologies that Harris Teeter and Vitacost.com brought to Kroger, which provide an even better shopping experience for our customers. We developed ClickList, our shop online, ""pick up at the store"" service based on what we learned from Harris Teeter's Express Lane. I'm pleased to share that we've expanded ClickList from 1 market to 7 markets. We continue to improve the offering, and our customers and associates both are providing very positive feedback. We are testing Vitacost.com's technology and ship-to-home infrastructure in Denver through a pilot in our King Soopers division. We're also testing a similar endless aisle experience in our new store format that we launched earlier this month in Gig Harbor, Washington.
We're very excited about this new community-focused grocery store concept called Main & Vine. Main & Vine mixes local, specialty and everyday products all at affordable prices. It reimagines the modern grocery shopping experience, placing in the middle of the store fresh produce and bulk items, along with an event center where shoppers can enjoy cooking demonstrations, food and beverage tastings and find a new recipe idea for dinner tonight. Customer feedback has been very positive.
2015 was a big year for our Corporate Brands portfolio, accounting for more than $20 billion of our total revenue. During the quarter, Corporate Brands represented approximately 29% of total units sold and 26.2% of sales dollars, excluding fuel and Pharmacy. 
Simple Truth continues to grow at an incredible rate, setting sales records quarter after quarter. The brand reached $1.5 billion in revenue for the year. And already in 2016, Simple Truth expanded to be a true lifestyle brand with the introduction of Simple Truth household, personal care and baby products. We expect 2016 to be an exciting year of continued innovation throughout our Corporate Brands portfolio.
Needless to say, there's a lot going on at Kroger. We are creating a seamless experience for our customers. Whether experimenting with new formats, driving digital engagement or launching new corporate brand products, we believe that combining Kroger's culture of innovation with our culture of opportunity will continue to support our growth. Kroger has an incredibly strong management team and a deep bench of leaders throughout our business. We are incrementally investing in leadership development and training for all our associates, including high-volume store managers and future senior leaders. And we have created 9,000 new jobs last year at all levels, which means even more opportunities for current associates to grow and advance. For example, we established a new operating division, the Dallas division, which created dozens of new leadership opportunities.
Looking at the economy and customer shopping behavior during 2015, we noticed that customer sentiment held relatively stable throughout the year versus previous years in which their attitudes were more volatile. The past few months, we've seen the top economic concerns shift from rising health care cost to the stock market. Customers have more disposable income as a result of significantly lower fuel prices. Yet economic uncertainty remains, which typically causes people to cut back on discretionary spending.
That said, an interesting insight is that our customers continue to spend with us. If you look at some of our high-quality offerings such as Murray's Cheese, Private Selection, Starbucks and Boar's Head or at the strength of our wine and craft beer business, it is clear that customers across all demographics want a great food experience. Because Kroger is doing a better job offering high-quality food at affordable prices, we continue to win with our customers even as they remain cautious about their overall spending.
2015 was an outstanding year for Kroger. We delivered on our performance targets and continue to expand our use of technology to drive growth. In 2016, we will continue making a difference for our customers and associates, growing our business and delivering value for shareholders. Now Mike will offer more detail on Kroger's financial results and outline our guidance for 2016. Mike?"

We exceeded all 4 of our financial performance commitments for the year. Identical supermarket sales and net earnings per diluted share growth, FIFO operating profit margin and return on invested capital were all better than our annual and long-term guidance. Market share growth continued, improving by 40 basis points, with 17 of 20 markets outlined by Nielsen POS plus data up and just one market down. 
We had a lot of unique items in last year's fourth quarter, which make comparisons more complicated, so I'd like to spend the next few minutes discussing the story behind the numbers for our fourth quarter and fiscal year and to give you some color on those and the current operating environment.
There's a lot of speculation about inflation or deflation or disinflation. We believe a deeper dive is required when the operating environment has increased volatility. When you look at identical supermarket sales, you should not come to the conclusion that less inflation is fundamentally a bad thing. In fact, if you look at our real growth in the fourth quarter, that is, identical supermarket sales less inflation, this year's fourth quarter result was stronger than last year's fourth quarter when identical sales were over 6%. Tonnage stayed strong at over 3% unit growth during the quarter, and the strong tonnage allowed us to grow FIFO gross profit dollars, excluding fuel and Roundy's, by 4.4% in the quarter. All but one supermarket department had positive identical supermarket sales, excluding fuel during the quarter. Our natural foods, deli and produce departments led the way. The meat department was slightly negative due to 5% deflation in the category. This deflation has allowed retail prices to retreat or increase their purchases. As a result of strong tonnage, the meat department had a great quarter with strong FIFO gross profit dollar growth. This is what we often refer to as good deflation. 
Our operating costs as a rate of sales were down for the 11th consecutive year. However, they were up 23 basis points in the fourth quarter. This calculation excludes retail fuel operations and Roundy's and excludes a $60 million contribution to the Kroger Co. Foundation and $55 million contribution to the UFCW pension plan in last year's fourth quarter and a $30 million contribution to that same plan in this year's fourth quarter.
There were several expenses in the quarter that won't continue at the same rate in future quarters, including chargebacks related to the transition of our payment systems to EMV that we expect to level out throughout 2016. We also saw higher pension costs and health care costs due to an increase in the number of claims and higher health care cost claims. That occurred during the fourth quarter. All that said, we can and will do a better job in some expense categories, including shrink, completing our EMV rollout and benefit costs.
In December, we said that volatility in weekly fuel costs would influence our fourth quarter results. That was true for the fourth quarter as our cents per gallon fuel margin was approximately $0.169 compared to $0.234 in the same quarter last year. Fuel in the fourth quarter only contributed about half as much net earnings per diluted share as compared to last year's fourth quarter. For the full year, the cents per gallon fuel margin was roughly $0.174 compared to $0.19 last year. 
Our fourth quarter net earnings per diluted share increased 9.6% to $0.57 compared to $0.52 during the same period last year. This result was helped by the lower tax rate and lower LIFO expense, but our strong real growth contributed to our results. 
Our 2015 cash flow generation was strong, allowing us to make $3.3 billion in capital investments during the year, excluding mergers, acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities. We repurchased $703 million of stock and returned $385 million to shareholders through our dividend. Net operating working capital declined $451 million, which also enhanced cash flow. Our net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio came in at 2.08x compared to 2.14 during the same period last year, even while investing approximately $870 million in our merger with Roundy's late in the year. Our balance sheet is as strong as ever. 
I'll provide a brief update on labor relations. In 2016, we will negotiate agreements with UFCW for store associates in Houston, Indianapolis, Little Rock, Nashville, Portland, Southern California and Fry's in Arizona. Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive costs and compensation packages that provide solid wages, good quality affordable health care and retirement benefits for our associates. Kroger's financial results continue to be pressured by rising health care and pension costs, which some of our competitors do not face. Kroger and the local unions, which represent many of our associates, have a shared objective: Growing Kroger's business and growing it profitably, which will help us create more jobs and career opportunities and enhance job security for our associates.
Turning now to our 2016 guidance. We expect identical supermarket sales growth, excluding fuel, of approximately 2.5% to 3.5% for 2016, reflecting the lower inflationary environment. For full year net earnings, we expect 2016 to range from $2.19 to $2.28 per diluted share. Where we fall within the range will be primarily driven by the actual fuel margins. We expect margins will be at or slightly below the 5-year average with continued volatility. We expect our core business in 2016 to grow in line with its long-term net earnings per share growth rate of 8% to 11%. Shareholder return will be further enhanced by a dividend which is expected to increase over time. 
In thinking about the cadence of our quarterly results compared to our long-term 8% to 11% guidance, the first quarter, we would expect to be at the midpoint to high end; the second quarter, below that range, and keep in mind, 2015 grew 26% for earnings per share last year; the third quarter, at the midpoint; and the fourth quarter at the midpoint. 
We expect capital investments, excluding mergers, acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities to be in the $4.1 billion to $4.4 billion range for 2016. 
We expect Kroger's full year FIFO operating margin in 2016, excluding fuel, to expand slightly compared to 2015 results. 
Now I will turn it back to Rodney"

When -- if you go back to the commentary I had on the meat department, some of the categories, as we say, it's good deflation because we're getting back to retail price points where the customers can buy a lot more of our product. And while for the time being, it's a slight headwind to sales when you just look at the top line, with the number of units we're selling at a good gross profit dollar rate per item, we're generating significantly more gross profit dollars. When you look at the fourth quarter overall, you have to keep in mind a few things about your commentary about late in the quarter. We had significant snow events during last year's fourth quarter as well as the Super Bowl shifting from the fourth quarter to the first quarter. And those on top of a department, like meat with the deflation, certainly play a factor in what the sales percentage growth is, but the unit growth continues to be very strong."

And as Rodney said, if you look at produce, it was actually inflationary. So produce has been all over the map this year, deflationary in the first 2 quarters, about flat in the third quarter, now inflationary. And our job is to operate the best we can given the environment we're operating in. And I think we've done a phenomenal job of managing our way through some of the volatility in the commodities that are out there. And in the backdrop of that, pharmacy continues to have inflation, although it declined throughout the year. And at the fourth quarter, at just under 5% inflation, and it started the year at 10%.

Could you maybe talk about how your M&A strategy is evolving? If I think about -- your company over the last few years, obviously you've been more aggressive than you were prior. You did Roundy's, which I think is something that years ago, at least from a Street perspective, we would have thought was something that maybe you wouldn't want to do, a turnaround into new market.

One of the things that we loved about merging with Roundy's was, as you -- as everybody knows, that we were looking at going into a new market. By merging with Roundy's, it allowed us to go into Chicago with a business that -- Mariano's had done a phenomenal job -- has done a phenomenal job on connecting with customers, and their market share is in the low teens. And they entered that market in 2010. So we felt like we could learn a lot, plus we started out a position of strength because of the success they've had. When you look at Wisconsin, Pick 'n Save and Copps has great market share across the state. We love Wisconsin. We -- it's a market that we really like, and we look forward to operating in it. So it's really our partnership and synergies that we felt like we could bring to Roundy's and the strength that they have that we could improve from where everything was. So it's a little different than a completely typical thing, how we've merged it with somebody. But I wouldn't -- I don't think you should read into that, that our strategies have just fundamentally changed in terms of the way we approach things."

The guidance at that point in time didn't contemplate a merger with Harris Teeter and then a subsequent merger with Roundy's. Harris Teeter had gone into a new market in the Washington DC, Baltimore area. We continue to fill in those markets with some very attractive sites. Another chunk of the increase in the CapEx is allocating capital to Roundy's, not only to support the plan they had in place, there were a lot of plans they would have had that, given their financial position, they couldn't have executed on. So there are dollars in there for us to go in and refresh and remodel some of their stores to show the folks in Wisconsin what they can expect going forward. The rest of it is really, we didn't start off as quickly on our fill-in strategies as we would've thought in 2012. It took us a little longer to get projects lined up, and we feel comfortable now that the pipeline of projects we have are starting to come to fruition. And the other thing that's in there for Roundy's is probably a little bit of capital for conversions and the like on systems and so forth."

But almost every week or, really, every day when we get ID sales, it seems there's some geography that was up against weather last year and no weather this year. That's going to flush itself out. Those things happen occasionally. It's our job to manage through it. Tonnage has remained strong. We feel good about where we're trending on those pieces. I don't think it's an issue from our tonnage or our growth or our customers coming in the store. We saw great trends in the fourth quarter, when we weren't up against weather, when our total households that came to our stores increased, the visits per households in total increased, and units per basket in the fourth quarter increased. And those kinds of things, over time, that's the momentum you want to see going into the new year. So we'll work our way through that. Relative to your question on IDs not where they were, but EPS up, I would go back to my comment on the meat department, where you just can't assume that if ID sales aren't as strong as they were -- that's just a percentage calculation. What you have to understand is what's the cost of that product, what can I sell it for and how many gross profit dollars do I make off of that? In many instances, like meat, because of the pickup in the volume at lower retails, you wind up generating significantly more gross profit dollars, and we would expect that to continue to play out in different categories throughout the year. Think about the effect that's had on milk on the top line. Milk generated a good profit in the year for us. Headwind to reported ID sales -- absolutely.

As you know, a lot of our associates listen into the call each quarter. Our strong results in 2015 are the result of your hard work and dedication to our customers, each other and the communities that we serve. I want to thank each of you for what you do every day to make a difference for our customers. Sometimes even simple things make someone's day brighter, like when Kroger associates in Tennessee worked with a community partner to deliver flowers to seniors, or when our Fry's team celebrated a special customer's 101st birthday at a Tucson store. Just awesome. 
Our customers appreciate your thoughtfulness. Keep up the great work. Across the country, we continue to listen to our associates' feedback. In addition to solid pay, healthcare, pension and other benefits, you told us that work-life balance is important, too. That's why we are introducing advance notice work schedules for associates working in our stores. This means associates will have their work schedule further in advance every time. This is designed to help you plan and manage other important things such as school, family and other events and responsibilities; 14 of our retail divisions have introduced this or are doing so now. And several others will have launched by the end of the first quarter. We work closely with our union locals who introduced this. So far, feedback from our associates have been very positive. 
As always, thank you, again, for your continued commitment to Kroger and our customers. That completes today's call. Thanks for joining."

With me to review Kroger's fourth quarter and fiscal 2015 results is Mike Schlotman, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. 
Let me just start by saying, wow, what a year. I'm delighted to report that Kroger executed on our growth plan and delivered on our financial performance commitments in 2015. We delivered our 49th consecutive quarter of positive identical supermarket sales growth without fuel and our 11th consecutive year of market share growth. We met our goal to increase capital investment while improving return on invested capital. And excluding Roundy's, we exceeded our commitment to slightly expand FIFO operating margin, excluding fuel. 
Our 431,000 associates make it all happen. I am very proud of our team. By keeping our focus on serving one customer at a time, we continue to deliver for our customers and for our shareholders with remarkable consistency. 
I also want to welcome the Roundy's associates in Wisconsin and Chicago to the Kroger family. Our merger closed in December and integration is well underway. As we've gotten to know the people at Roundy's, it is clear they share our values and desire to make a difference for our customers. 
We continue to successfully expand the technologies that Harris Teeter and Vitacost.com brought to Kroger, which provide an even better shopping experience for our customers. We developed ClickList, our shop online, ""pick up at the store"" service based on what we learned from Harris Teeter's Express Lane. I'm pleased to share that we've expanded ClickList from 1 market to 7 markets. We continue to improve the offering, and our customers and associates both are providing very positive feedback. We are testing Vitacost.com's technology and ship-to-home infrastructure in Denver through a pilot in our King Soopers division. We're also testing a similar endless aisle experience in our new store format that we launched earlier this month in Gig Harbor, Washington.
We're very excited about this new community-focused grocery store concept called Main & Vine. Main & Vine mixes local, specialty and everyday products all at affordable prices. It reimagines the modern grocery shopping experience, placing in the middle of the store fresh produce and bulk items, along with an event center where shoppers can enjoy cooking demonstrations, food and beverage tastings and find a new recipe idea for dinner tonight. Customer feedback has been very positive.
2015 was a big year for our Corporate Brands portfolio, accounting for more than $20 billion of our total revenue. During the quarter, Corporate Brands represented approximately 29% of total units sold and 26.2% of sales dollars, excluding fuel and Pharmacy. 
Simple Truth continues to grow at an incredible rate, setting sales records quarter after quarter. The brand reached $1.5 billion in revenue for the year. And already in 2016, Simple Truth expanded to be a true lifestyle brand with the introduction of Simple Truth household, personal care and baby products. We expect 2016 to be an exciting year of continued innovation throughout our Corporate Brands portfolio.
Needless to say, there's a lot going on at Kroger. We are creating a seamless experience for our customers. Whether experimenting with new formats, driving digital engagement or launching new corporate brand products, we believe that combining Kroger's culture of innovation with our culture of opportunity will continue to support our growth. Kroger has an incredibly strong management team and a deep bench of leaders throughout our business. We are incrementally investing in leadership development and training for all our associates, including high-volume store managers and future senior leaders. And we have created 9,000 new jobs last year at all levels, which means even more opportunities for current associates to grow and advance. For example, we established a new operating division, the Dallas division, which created dozens of new leadership opportunities.
Looking at the economy and customer shopping behavior during 2015, we noticed that customer sentiment held relatively stable throughout the year versus previous years in which their attitudes were more volatile. The past few months, we've seen the top economic concerns shift from rising health care cost to the stock market. Customers have more disposable income as a result of significantly lower fuel prices. Yet economic uncertainty remains, which typically causes people to cut back on discretionary spending.
That said, an interesting insight is that our customers continue to spend with us. If you look at some of our high-quality offerings such as Murray's Cheese, Private Selection, Starbucks and Boar's Head or at the strength of our wine and craft beer business, it is clear that customers across all demographics want a great food experience. Because Kroger is doing a better job offering high-quality food at affordable prices, we continue to win with our customers even as they remain cautious about their overall spending.
2015 was an outstanding year for Kroger. We delivered on our performance targets and continue to expand our use of technology to drive growth. In 2016, we will continue making a difference for our customers and associates, growing our business and delivering value for shareholders. Now Mike will offer more detail on Kroger's financial results and outline our guidance for 2016. Mike?"

We exceeded all 4 of our financial performance commitments for the year. Identical supermarket sales and net earnings per diluted share growth, FIFO operating profit margin and return on invested capital were all better than our annual and long-term guidance. Market share growth continued, improving by 40 basis points, with 17 of 20 markets outlined by Nielsen POS plus data up and just one market down. 
We had a lot of unique items in last year's fourth quarter, which make comparisons more complicated, so I'd like to spend the next few minutes discussing the story behind the numbers for our fourth quarter and fiscal year and to give you some color on those and the current operating environment.
There's a lot of speculation about inflation or deflation or disinflation. We believe a deeper dive is required when the operating environment has increased volatility. When you look at identical supermarket sales, you should not come to the conclusion that less inflation is fundamentally a bad thing. In fact, if you look at our real growth in the fourth quarter, that is, identical supermarket sales less inflation, this year's fourth quarter result was stronger than last year's fourth quarter when identical sales were over 6%. Tonnage stayed strong at over 3% unit growth during the quarter, and the strong tonnage allowed us to grow FIFO gross profit dollars, excluding fuel and Roundy's, by 4.4% in the quarter. All but one supermarket department had positive identical supermarket sales, excluding fuel during the quarter. Our natural foods, deli and produce departments led the way. The meat department was slightly negative due to 5% deflation in the category. This deflation has allowed retail prices to retreat or increase their purchases. As a result of strong tonnage, the meat department had a great quarter with strong FIFO gross profit dollar growth. This is what we often refer to as good deflation. 
Our operating costs as a rate of sales were down for the 11th consecutive year. However, they were up 23 basis points in the fourth quarter. This calculation excludes retail fuel operations and Roundy's and excludes a $60 million contribution to the Kroger Co. Foundation and $55 million contribution to the UFCW pension plan in last year's fourth quarter and a $30 million contribution to that same plan in this year's fourth quarter.
There were several expenses in the quarter that won't continue at the same rate in future quarters, including chargebacks related to the transition of our payment systems to EMV that we expect to level out throughout 2016. We also saw higher pension costs and health care costs due to an increase in the number of claims and higher health care cost claims. That occurred during the fourth quarter. All that said, we can and will do a better job in some expense categories, including shrink, completing our EMV rollout and benefit costs.
In December, we said that volatility in weekly fuel costs would influence our fourth quarter results. That was true for the fourth quarter as our cents per gallon fuel margin was approximately $0.169 compared to $0.234 in the same quarter last year. Fuel in the fourth quarter only contributed about half as much net earnings per diluted share as compared to last year's fourth quarter. For the full year, the cents per gallon fuel margin was roughly $0.174 compared to $0.19 last year. 
Our fourth quarter net earnings per diluted share increased 9.6% to $0.57 compared to $0.52 during the same period last year. This result was helped by the lower tax rate and lower LIFO expense, but our strong real growth contributed to our results. 
Our 2015 cash flow generation was strong, allowing us to make $3.3 billion in capital investments during the year, excluding mergers, acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities. We repurchased $703 million of stock and returned $385 million to shareholders through our dividend. Net operating working capital declined $451 million, which also enhanced cash flow. Our net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio came in at 2.08x compared to 2.14 during the same period last year, even while investing approximately $870 million in our merger with Roundy's late in the year. Our balance sheet is as strong as ever. 
I'll provide a brief update on labor relations. In 2016, we will negotiate agreements with UFCW for store associates in Houston, Indianapolis, Little Rock, Nashville, Portland, Southern California and Fry's in Arizona. Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive costs and compensation packages that provide solid wages, good quality affordable health care and retirement benefits for our associates. Kroger's financial results continue to be pressured by rising health care and pension costs, which some of our competitors do not face. Kroger and the local unions, which represent many of our associates, have a shared objective: Growing Kroger's business and growing it profitably, which will help us create more jobs and career opportunities and enhance job security for our associates.
Turning now to our 2016 guidance. We expect identical supermarket sales growth, excluding fuel, of approximately 2.5% to 3.5% for 2016, reflecting the lower inflationary environment. For full year net earnings, we expect 2016 to range from $2.19 to $2.28 per diluted share. Where we fall within the range will be primarily driven by the actual fuel margins. We expect margins will be at or slightly below the 5-year average with continued volatility. We expect our core business in 2016 to grow in line with its long-term net earnings per share growth rate of 8% to 11%. Shareholder return will be further enhanced by a dividend which is expected to increase over time. 
In thinking about the cadence of our quarterly results compared to our long-term 8% to 11% guidance, the first quarter, we would expect to be at the midpoint to high end; the second quarter, below that range, and keep in mind, 2015 grew 26% for earnings per share last year; the third quarter, at the midpoint; and the fourth quarter at the midpoint. 
We expect capital investments, excluding mergers, acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities to be in the $4.1 billion to $4.4 billion range for 2016. 
We expect Kroger's full year FIFO operating margin in 2016, excluding fuel, to expand slightly compared to 2015 results. 
Now I will turn it back to Rodney"

When -- if you go back to the commentary I had on the meat department, some of the categories, as we say, it's good deflation because we're getting back to retail price points where the customers can buy a lot more of our product. And while for the time being, it's a slight headwind to sales when you just look at the top line, with the number of units we're selling at a good gross profit dollar rate per item, we're generating significantly more gross profit dollars. When you look at the fourth quarter overall, you have to keep in mind a few things about your commentary about late in the quarter. We had significant snow events during last year's fourth quarter as well as the Super Bowl shifting from the fourth quarter to the first quarter. And those on top of a department, like meat with the deflation, certainly play a factor in what the sales percentage growth is, but the unit growth continues to be very strong."

And as Rodney said, if you look at produce, it was actually inflationary. So produce has been all over the map this year, deflationary in the first 2 quarters, about flat in the third quarter, now inflationary. And our job is to operate the best we can given the environment we're operating in. And I think we've done a phenomenal job of managing our way through some of the volatility in the commodities that are out there. And in the backdrop of that, pharmacy continues to have inflation, although it declined throughout the year. And at the fourth quarter, at just under 5% inflation, and it started the year at 10%.

The other thing is, and that's -- and you never know until after the fact is, how does the inflation happen. And we believe that early in the year, we won't see much inflation. We believe later in the year, we'll see a little bit more inflation versus being consistent throughout the year. And the inflation guidance is as much affecting the LIFO estimate as it is what we really think inflation's going to be if you volume-weighted it throughout the year.

One of the things that we loved about merging with Roundy's was, as you -- as everybody knows, that we were looking at going into a new market. By merging with Roundy's, it allowed us to go into Chicago with a business that -- Mariano's had done a phenomenal job -- has done a phenomenal job on connecting with customers, and their market share is in the low teens. And they entered that market in 2010. So we felt like we could learn a lot, plus we started out a position of strength because of the success they've had. When you look at Wisconsin, Pick 'n Save and Copps has great market share across the state. We love Wisconsin. We -- it's a market that we really like, and we look forward to operating in it. So it's really our partnership and synergies that we felt like we could bring to Roundy's and the strength that they have that we could improve from where everything was. So it's a little different than a completely typical thing, how we've merged it with somebody.

Harris Teeter had gone into a new market in the Washington DC, Baltimore area. We continue to fill in those markets with some very attractive sites. Another chunk of the increase in the CapEx is allocating capital to Roundy's, not only to support the plan they had in place, there were a lot of plans they would have had that, given their financial position, they couldn't have executed on. So there are dollars in there for us to go in and refresh and remodel some of their stores to show the folks in Wisconsin what they can expect going forward. The rest of it is really, we didn't start off as quickly on our fill-in strategies as we would've thought in 2012. It took us a little longer to get projects lined up, and we feel comfortable now that the pipeline of projects we have are starting to come to fruition.

But almost every week or, really, every day when we get ID sales, it seems there's some geography that was up against weather last year and no weather this year. That's going to flush itself out. Those things happen occasionally. It's our job to manage through it. Tonnage has remained strong. We feel good about where we're trending on those pieces. I don't think it's an issue from our tonnage or our growth or our customers coming in the store. We saw great trends in the fourth quarter, when we weren't up against weather, when our total households that came to our stores increased, the visits per households in total increased, and units per basket in the fourth quarter increased. And those kinds of things, over time, that's the momentum you want to see going into the new year. So we'll work our way through that. Relative to your question on IDs not where they were, but EPS up, I would go back to my comment on the meat department, where you just can't assume that if ID sales aren't as strong as they were -- that's just a percentage calculation. What you have to understand is what's the cost of that product, what can I sell it for and how many gross profit dollars do I make off of that? In many instances, like meat, because of the pickup in the volume at lower retails, you wind up generating significantly more gross profit dollars, and we would expect that to continue to play out in different categories throughout the year. Think about the effect that's had on milk on the top line. Milk generated a good profit in the year for us. Headwind to reported ID sales -- absolutely.

Our strong results in 2015 are the result of your hard work and dedication to our customers, each other and the communities that we serve. I want to thank each of you for what you do every day to make a difference for our customers. Sometimes even simple things make someone's day brighter, like when Kroger associates in Tennessee worked with a community partner to deliver flowers to seniors, or when our Fry's team celebrated a special customer's 101st birthday at a Tucson store. Just awesome. 
Our customers appreciate your thoughtfulness. Keep up the great work. Across the country, we continue to listen to our associates' feedback. In addition to solid pay, healthcare, pension and other benefits, you told us that work-life balance is important, too. That's why we are introducing advance notice work schedules for associates working in our stores. This means associates will have their work schedule further in advance every time. This is designed to help you plan and manage other important things such as school, family and other events and responsibilities; 14 of our retail divisions have introduced this or are doing so now. And several others will have launched by the end of the first quarter. We work closely with our union locals who introduced this. So far, feedback from our associates have been very positive.

And good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. With me to review Kroger's first quarter results is Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Mike Schlotman.
Our associates delivered another solid quarter. We continue to execute our growth plan and to deliver on our financial performance commitments. Most importantly, we continue to strengthen our connection with our customers, growing loyalty and market share and achieving Kroger's 50th consecutive quarter of positive identical supermarket sales growth, excluding fuel. Most companies can only aspire to achieve these results. It says a lot about our consistently remarkable performance and our ability to grow in a balanced way with a long-term focus.
We've managed through nearly every conceivable operating environment and demonstrated through different cycles that by providing value to our customers and partnering with our associates, we'll continue to make a difference for our customers, associates and communities. And when we do that, we create value for shareholders as evidenced by our growing dividend and our consistent net earnings per diluted share growth above our long-term guidance of 8% to 11%. In fact, our net earnings per diluted share growth rate on a compounded annual basis was 14.1% for 3 years and 18.8% for 5 years.
We demonstrate our long-term focus by continuing to invest for the future. We are making investments in our people, our digital and online capabilities and our strategic partnerships. Across the board, Kroger has an incredibly strong management team and a deep bench of leaders, who are making us better every day. We continue to make strategic investments in leadership development and training for all of our associates, including high-volume store managers and future senior leaders. Many people come here for a job, and Kroger creates opportunities for all associates to build a career.
Despite record low unemployment figures, when we held a 1-day hiring event in every supermarket location in May, we received more than 116,000 applications. From that pool, we hired more than 12,000 new associates. We see our opportunity culture as a competitive advantage.
We are expanding our digital presence and marching steadily toward a time when we can provide our customers with anything, anytime, anywhere. As you know, we are taking a disciplined approach to digital growth, testing new offerings in local markets so we can make sure we get it right before we scale offerings more broadly.
Our ClickList and ExpressLane offerings are now available in 25 markets with more to come. Our merger with Harris Teeter gave us a base of learnings that allowed us to ramp up quickly the development of ClickList. Customers now have downloaded nearly 3 billion digital coupons and offers from our mobile app and website, and we continue to experiment with Vitacost.com's ship-to-home technology and platform.
Earlier this week, Kroger's technology business unit was named one of the Top 100 Places to Work by Computerworld Magazine. We are obviously very proud of this honor. We've launched a new website, kroger.com/liveKT, to connect with and recruit top talent from around the world to join the Kroger team.
Similarly, we are finding out that ClickList also serves as a great tool to both hire and retain great people. Kroger is a fantastic place for tech talent to build careers because the technology they create can improve the lives of millions of customers each and every day.
In April, we announced a strategic investment in Lucky's Market, a specialty grocery store chain focused on natural, organic and locally grown products currently operating in 22 locations. We invested in Lucky's because of their great people and unique go-to-market strategy, which includes smaller-format stores that resemble an indoor farmers market, plus the culinary department that showcases amazingly restaurant-quality prepared foods. Lucky's approach is very much aligned with our efforts to provide affordable, fresh, organic and natural foods as part of our Customer 1st strategy. We expect to learn a lot from each other.
There are a lot of questions about the economy and the customer, inflation or lack thereof, consumer sentiment or competition. These are all issues that we've managed through, some several times over the last 50 quarters. Inflation, for example, I've often said that a 2% to 3% inflation would be a great environment to operate in. However, you rarely get the perfect operating environment. What we know is that by focusing on our associates and our customers will be a winning formula in the future as it has been in the past. At times like this, it's even more important to have 84.51° on the team so we can generate insights into what our customers want and figure out a way to give them that without having to guess at it. 
Kroger's core business is solid. We are providing exceptional customer service in the highest-quality, freshest products. Customers are giving us higher marks for better product selection and store layout as well as friendlier service. We remain focused on customer loyalty that grows tonnage in both our top and bottom lines, which then creates value for shareholders.
Where we are right now, it looks like we will be at the low end to midpoint of our 2016 net earnings per diluted share range. Where we end up in that range will be driven primarily by fuel margins. I do want to stress that we are never satisfied and our to-do list remains longer than our done list.
Now Mike will offer more details on Kroger's first quarter financial results and discuss our guidance for the remainder of the year. Mike?"
284342,345286375,1000764,"The Kroger Co., Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Jun 16, 2016",2016-06-16,"Earnings Calls","The Kroger Co.","Executives","Thanks, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. IDs came in at 2.4%. As Rodney said, we've been in environments like this before, and we will continue to focus on growing households, growing units and making sure we are delivering the right value proposition",1029,"Thanks, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. IDs came in at 2.4%. As Rodney said, we've been in environments like this before, and we will continue to focus on growing households, growing units and making sure we are delivering the right value proposition for our customers.
Inflation was nonexistent in the first quarter. Lower inflation has persisted and, in fact, was slightly deflationary without pharmacy. When you add pharmacy back in, we had approximately 30 basis points of inflation. This is the lowest we have seen in the last 6 years.
During the quarter, trips per household were up and units per basket declined. This, combined with more households, led to positive tonnage growth.
Operating costs, excluding fuel and Roundy's, were 4 basis points better in the first quarter. Operating, general and administrative expenses were 11 basis points better and grew by approximately 2.9%. Rent and depreciation were a combined 7 basis points worse.
We continue to work diligently to keep operating costs in check. As you know, this is the fuel we used to run our Customer 1st strategy, and as Rodney just said, this is an area where our to-do list is longer than our done list.
Now for an update on retail fuel. In the first quarter, the average retail price of a gallon of gas declined by $0.45 compared to last year. Our cents per gallon fuel margin was approximately $0.143 compared to $0.116 in the same quarter last year. On a rolling 4 quarters basis, we were at $0.182 this year compared to $0.184 last year. We expect this downward trend to accelerate as we cycle some very strong margin quarters for the rest of the year.
Our first quarter net earnings per diluted share increased 12.9% to $0.70 compared to $0.62 during the same period last year. This result was helped primarily by our operating results and higher fuel margins during the first quarter. A lower LIFO expense and share buybacks also contributed to the EPS growth.
Our integration with Roundy's is well underway. Synergies are coming together nicely. We are beginning to focus on the physical assets in Wisconsin while continuing to open new Mariano stores in Chicago. Roundy's associates share our deep commitment to putting our customer first, which makes it easy for us to work together as one team.
For our corporate brands portfolio, we are off to an exciting start on the new innovation in 2016. Last quarter, we told you that we had just introduced Simple Truth household and personal care products, expanding our popular natural and organics line into a true lifestyle brand. Customers have responded enthusiastically as both sales and unit volume have exceeded our expectations in all categories. We continue to launch new Simple Truth offerings in laundry, household, baby and health and beauty care.
We also continue to push the boundaries of culinary trends with new Private Selection spices, marinades, condiments and cooking sauces. Customers are savoring global flavors in our delicious Private Selection products such as Korean black garlic kalbi marinade and Peruvian Aji Amarillo hot sauce. 
During the first quarter, corporate brands represented approximately 27.9% of total units sold and 25.9% of sales dollars, excluding fuel and pharmacy.
The company's net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio increased to 2.12x compared to 2.09 during the same period last year. This result illustrates our commitment to use free cash flow to both grow our business and return cash to shareholders while remaining -- while maintaining an appropriate level of leverage for our credit rating.
Over the last year, Kroger used free cash flow to repurchase $1.1 billion in common shares, paid $397 million in dividends, invest $3.6 billion in capital and merged with Roundy's for $866 million. Kroger's strong EBITDA performance resulted in a return on invested capital for the first quarter of 14.08%, excluding Roundy's, compared to 14.03% for the first quarter of 2015. Our balance sheet is as strong as ever.
I will now provide a brief update on labor relations. We recently agreed in new contracts covering store associates in Houston, Indianapolis, Portland and Roanoke. We are currently negotiating contracts with UFCW for store associates in Little Rock, Nashville and Southern California. Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive costs and compensation packages that provide solid wages, good quality, affordable health care and retirement benefits for our associates. Kroger's financial results continue to be pressured by rising health care and pension costs, which some of our competitors do not face. Kroger and the local unions, which represent many of our associates, have a shared objective: growing Kroger's business and profitably, which will help us create more jobs and career opportunities and enhance job security for our associates.
Turning now to our 2016 guidance. We continue to expect identical supermarket sales growth, excluding fuel, of approximately 2.5% to 3.5% for 2016. This reflects lower inflation as well as Roundy's results, which are an approximate 30 basis point headwind to identical supermarket sales growth.
For the full year net earnings, we expect 2016 range of $2.19 to $2.28 per diluted share. As Rodney said earlier, based on current fuel margin trends, we expect to be at the low end to midpoint of our guidance range. We expect fuel margins will be at or slightly below the 5-year average.
Shareholder return will be further enhanced by a dividend that is expected to increase over time. And thinking about the cadence of our quarterly results compared to our long-term 8% to 11% guidance, we believe that the second quarter will be the toughest quarter with slight growth over 2015. Keep in mind the second quarter last year grew by 26%. Both the third and fourth quarters will be at the low end to midpoint of the range.
We continue to expect capital investments, excluding mergers, acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities, to be in the $4.1 billion to $4.4 billion range for 2016.
Finally, we continue to expect Kroger's full year LIFO -- full year FIFO operating margin in 2016, excluding fuel, to slightly expand compared to 2015 results.
Now I will turn it back to Rodney."

The effect of the interest rate, it's really -- it's odd how a lot of pensions are calculated from the liability using the interest rates, the present value of the liability. If you look at state and local and federal pensions and multiemployer pensions, their liability is actually calculated using the expected rate of return, it's the discount rate. So UFCW plans, the way they calculate their unfunded status is really unaffected by changes in the interest rate unless they change their expected rate of return. It's the same way state -- it's just the way it's mandated to be done or is done. It would affect the company plan a little bit, but remember, our company plans are a frozen plan. There continue to be benefits earned by those who are still working and are participants in it, but there's no new participants in it. And we try to maintain the funded status of that enough so we don't have to do some reporting issues to participants. But I never want that fund to go overfunded because as the last person winds up getting their check, there's no easy way to get any excess money out of that. So we purposefully manage that to be slightly underfunded. We're not even -- to be underfunded because someday rates will go up, and I don't want to put a bunch of money in now and then wake up in 5 years and have the fund be overfunded because I can't do anything with it."

We continue to make the investments we plan to make in price throughout the first quarter. Certainly, the dynamics of the deflation when you look at the whole gross profit margins in the entire company makes it kind of interesting because as you have deflation, if you pass on exactly the lower cost to the customer, it drives your gross profit rate up. It's just simple math. Pharmacy continues to be a bit of a headwind to the gross profit numbers as well with some of the inflation in there and where the reimbursement rates are.

Relative to the commercial paper, you'll probably see us maintain commercial paper in that range. It's the easiest way, particularly with where commercial paper rates are today. It's the easiest way for us to get exposure to floating rates. If you want to modify your exposure to floating rates quickly, it's easiest to do that with commercial paper because assuming the markets are open that can always term it out. If I have slots or hedges or if I've done a 3- or 5-year floating-rate note, you really can't change that quickly or eloquently, so that will be continue to be part of our strategy."

Before we end today's call, I'd like to share some additional thoughts with our associates listening in today. And as you know, I always like to tell our associates a few comments because we just have so many that listen in. And first, I want to take this -- take a moment to extend our deepest sympathies to the family and friends of those who lost their lives in the recent horrific attack in Orlando. What happened is tragic and heartbreaking. I also want to thank the first responders, who put their lives in danger every day to protect us. I know our family of associates, those at Axiom Health Care outside of Orlando, across Florida and throughout the rest of the country is deeply saddened by what has happened. We stand in support of the LGBT community. An event like this affects each and everyone of us. No matter where we live or work, it serves to remind us of what is most important, and that is taking care of each other. I want to thank our associates everywhere, who demonstrate our values of diversity, inclusion and respect every day, to treat all with dignity, to seek and embrace the differences among people and to lift each other up. That completes our call today. Thanks for joining us, and have a good summer."

And good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. With me to review Kroger's first quarter results is Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Mike Schlotman.
Our associates delivered another solid quarter. We continue to execute our growth plan and to deliver on our financial performance commitments. Most importantly, we continue to strengthen our connection with our customers, growing loyalty and market share and achieving Kroger's 50th consecutive quarter of positive identical supermarket sales growth, excluding fuel. Most companies can only aspire to achieve these results. It says a lot about our consistently remarkable performance and our ability to grow in a balanced way with a long-term focus.
We've managed through nearly every conceivable operating environment and demonstrated through different cycles that by providing value to our customers and partnering with our associates, we'll continue to make a difference for our customers, associates and communities. And when we do that, we create value for shareholders as evidenced by our growing dividend and our consistent net earnings per diluted share growth above our long-term guidance of 8% to 11%. In fact, our net earnings per diluted share growth rate on a compounded annual basis was 14.1% for 3 years and 18.8% for 5 years.
We demonstrate our long-term focus by continuing to invest for the future. We are making investments in our people, our digital and online capabilities and our strategic partnerships. Across the board, Kroger has an incredibly strong management team and a deep bench of leaders, who are making us better every day. We continue to make strategic investments in leadership development and training for all of our associates, including high-volume store managers and future senior leaders. Many people come here for a job, and Kroger creates opportunities for all associates to build a career.
Despite record low unemployment figures, when we held a 1-day hiring event in every supermarket location in May, we received more than 116,000 applications. From that pool, we hired more than 12,000 new associates. We see our opportunity culture as a competitive advantage.
We are expanding our digital presence and marching steadily toward a time when we can provide our customers with anything, anytime, anywhere. As you know, we are taking a disciplined approach to digital growth, testing new offerings in local markets so we can make sure we get it right before we scale offerings more broadly.
Our ClickList and ExpressLane offerings are now available in 25 markets with more to come. Our merger with Harris Teeter gave us a base of learnings that allowed us to ramp up quickly the development of ClickList. Customers now have downloaded nearly 3 billion digital coupons and offers from our mobile app and website, and we continue to experiment with Vitacost.com's ship-to-home technology and platform.
Earlier this week, Kroger's technology business unit was named one of the Top 100 Places to Work by Computerworld Magazine. We are obviously very proud of this honor. We've launched a new website, kroger.com/liveKT, to connect with and recruit top talent from around the world to join the Kroger team.
Similarly, we are finding out that ClickList also serves as a great tool to both hire and retain great people. Kroger is a fantastic place for tech talent to build careers because the technology they create can improve the lives of millions of customers each and every day.
In April, we announced a strategic investment in Lucky's Market, a specialty grocery store chain focused on natural, organic and locally grown products currently operating in 22 locations. We invested in Lucky's because of their great people and unique go-to-market strategy, which includes smaller-format stores that resemble an indoor farmers market, plus the culinary department that showcases amazingly restaurant-quality prepared foods. Lucky's approach is very much aligned with our efforts to provide affordable, fresh, organic and natural foods as part of our Customer 1st strategy. We expect to learn a lot from each other.
There are a lot of questions about the economy and the customer, inflation or lack thereof, consumer sentiment or competition. These are all issues that we've managed through, some several times over the last 50 quarters. Inflation, for example, I've often said that a 2% to 3% inflation would be a great environment to operate in. However, you rarely get the perfect operating environment. What we know is that by focusing on our associates and our customers will be a winning formula in the future as it has been in the past. At times like this, it's even more important to have 84.51° on the team so we can generate insights into what our customers want and figure out a way to give them that without having to guess at it. 
Kroger's core business is solid. We are providing exceptional customer service in the highest-quality, freshest products. Customers are giving us higher marks for better product selection and store layout as well as friendlier service. We remain focused on customer loyalty that grows tonnage in both our top and bottom lines, which then creates value for shareholders.
Where we are right now, it looks like we will be at the low end to midpoint of our 2016 net earnings per diluted share range. Where we end up in that range will be driven primarily by fuel margins. I do want to stress that we are never satisfied and our to-do list remains longer than our done list.
Now Mike will offer more details on Kroger's first quarter financial results and discuss our guidance for the remainder of the year. Mike?"
284342,345286375,1000798,"The Kroger Co., Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Jun 16, 2016",2016-06-16,"Earnings Calls","The Kroger Co.","Executives","Thanks, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. IDs came in at 2.4%. As Rodney said, we've been in environments like this before, and we will continue to focus on growing households, growing units and making sure we are delivering the right value proposition",1029,"Thanks, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. IDs came in at 2.4%. As Rodney said, we've been in environments like this before, and we will continue to focus on growing households, growing units and making sure we are delivering the right value proposition for our customers.
Inflation was nonexistent in the first quarter. Lower inflation has persisted and, in fact, was slightly deflationary without pharmacy. When you add pharmacy back in, we had approximately 30 basis points of inflation. This is the lowest we have seen in the last 6 years.
During the quarter, trips per household were up and units per basket declined. This, combined with more households, led to positive tonnage growth.
Operating costs, excluding fuel and Roundy's, were 4 basis points better in the first quarter. Operating, general and administrative expenses were 11 basis points better and grew by approximately 2.9%. Rent and depreciation were a combined 7 basis points worse.
We continue to work diligently to keep operating costs in check. As you know, this is the fuel we used to run our Customer 1st strategy, and as Rodney just said, this is an area where our to-do list is longer than our done list.
Now for an update on retail fuel. In the first quarter, the average retail price of a gallon of gas declined by $0.45 compared to last year. Our cents per gallon fuel margin was approximately $0.143 compared to $0.116 in the same quarter last year. On a rolling 4 quarters basis, we were at $0.182 this year compared to $0.184 last year. We expect this downward trend to accelerate as we cycle some very strong margin quarters for the rest of the year.
Our first quarter net earnings per diluted share increased 12.9% to $0.70 compared to $0.62 during the same period last year. This result was helped primarily by our operating results and higher fuel margins during the first quarter. A lower LIFO expense and share buybacks also contributed to the EPS growth.
Our integration with Roundy's is well underway. Synergies are coming together nicely. We are beginning to focus on the physical assets in Wisconsin while continuing to open new Mariano stores in Chicago. Roundy's associates share our deep commitment to putting our customer first, which makes it easy for us to work together as one team.
For our corporate brands portfolio, we are off to an exciting start on the new innovation in 2016. Last quarter, we told you that we had just introduced Simple Truth household and personal care products, expanding our popular natural and organics line into a true lifestyle brand. Customers have responded enthusiastically as both sales and unit volume have exceeded our expectations in all categories. We continue to launch new Simple Truth offerings in laundry, household, baby and health and beauty care.
We also continue to push the boundaries of culinary trends with new Private Selection spices, marinades, condiments and cooking sauces. Customers are savoring global flavors in our delicious Private Selection products such as Korean black garlic kalbi marinade and Peruvian Aji Amarillo hot sauce. 
During the first quarter, corporate brands represented approximately 27.9% of total units sold and 25.9% of sales dollars, excluding fuel and pharmacy.
The company's net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio increased to 2.12x compared to 2.09 during the same period last year. This result illustrates our commitment to use free cash flow to both grow our business and return cash to shareholders while remaining -- while maintaining an appropriate level of leverage for our credit rating.
Over the last year, Kroger used free cash flow to repurchase $1.1 billion in common shares, paid $397 million in dividends, invest $3.6 billion in capital and merged with Roundy's for $866 million. Kroger's strong EBITDA performance resulted in a return on invested capital for the first quarter of 14.08%, excluding Roundy's, compared to 14.03% for the first quarter of 2015. Our balance sheet is as strong as ever.
I will now provide a brief update on labor relations. We recently agreed in new contracts covering store associates in Houston, Indianapolis, Portland and Roanoke. We are currently negotiating contracts with UFCW for store associates in Little Rock, Nashville and Southern California. Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive costs and compensation packages that provide solid wages, good quality, affordable health care and retirement benefits for our associates. Kroger's financial results continue to be pressured by rising health care and pension costs, which some of our competitors do not face. Kroger and the local unions, which represent many of our associates, have a shared objective: growing Kroger's business and profitably, which will help us create more jobs and career opportunities and enhance job security for our associates.
Turning now to our 2016 guidance. We continue to expect identical supermarket sales growth, excluding fuel, of approximately 2.5% to 3.5% for 2016. This reflects lower inflation as well as Roundy's results, which are an approximate 30 basis point headwind to identical supermarket sales growth.
For the full year net earnings, we expect 2016 range of $2.19 to $2.28 per diluted share. As Rodney said earlier, based on current fuel margin trends, we expect to be at the low end to midpoint of our guidance range. We expect fuel margins will be at or slightly below the 5-year average.
Shareholder return will be further enhanced by a dividend that is expected to increase over time. And thinking about the cadence of our quarterly results compared to our long-term 8% to 11% guidance, we believe that the second quarter will be the toughest quarter with slight growth over 2015. Keep in mind the second quarter last year grew by 26%. Both the third and fourth quarters will be at the low end to midpoint of the range.
We continue to expect capital investments, excluding mergers, acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities, to be in the $4.1 billion to $4.4 billion range for 2016.
Finally, we continue to expect Kroger's full year LIFO -- full year FIFO operating margin in 2016, excluding fuel, to slightly expand compared to 2015 results.
Now I will turn it back to Rodney."

The effect of the interest rate, it's really -- it's odd how a lot of pensions are calculated from the liability using the interest rates, the present value of the liability. If you look at state and local and federal pensions and multiemployer pensions, their liability is actually calculated using the expected rate of return, it's the discount rate. So UFCW plans, the way they calculate their unfunded status is really unaffected by changes in the interest rate unless they change their expected rate of return. It's the same way state -- it's just the way it's mandated to be done or is done. It would affect the company plan a little bit, but remember, our company plans are a frozen plan. There continue to be benefits earned by those who are still working and are participants in it, but there's no new participants in it. And we try to maintain the funded status of that enough so we don't have to do some reporting issues to participants. But I never want that fund to go overfunded because as the last person winds up getting their check, there's no easy way to get any excess money out of that. So we purposefully manage that to be slightly underfunded. We're not even -- to be underfunded because someday rates will go up, and I don't want to put a bunch of money in now and then wake up in 5 years and have the fund be overfunded because I can't do anything with it."

If you happen to have a year where that's not the case, that just makes it -- the year a little bit better. But the industry's always been very competitive, and we see no -- nothing out there that would cause it to be less competitive. And we go into every year with that assumption and build a business plan of how we can invest the dollars we have to invest for our customers' benefit to drive more tonnage and more trips to the store and increase loyal households. And as we continue to do that, you see the results as the number of our loyal households continue to grow, their trips to the store continue to grow and then the units they buy on a monthly or quarterly basis continue to grow. And that really winds up being our focus. As Rodney said earlier on competition and pricing environment, we don't ignore anybody.

Some may wind up being relocated. And then you step back and you figure out how to get the best value proposition to their customers like we've done premerger with Roundy's. So the good news is this is a game plan that we've used before as we invested and growing -- taking a business who had sluggish sales in Kroger at the turn of the century to a company that has very robust sales.

Relative to the commercial paper, you'll probably see us maintain commercial paper in that range. It's the easiest way, particularly with where commercial paper rates are today. It's the easiest way for us to get exposure to floating rates. If you want to modify your exposure to floating rates quickly, it's easiest to do that with commercial paper because assuming the markets are open, I can always term it out.

No matter where we live or work, it serves to remind us of what is most important, and that is taking care of each other.

And good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. With me to review Kroger's first quarter results is Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Mike Schlotman.
Our associates delivered another solid quarter. We continue to execute our growth plan and to deliver on our financial performance commitments. Most importantly, we continue to strengthen our connection with our customers, growing loyalty and market share and achieving Kroger's 50th consecutive quarter of positive identical supermarket sales growth, excluding fuel. Most companies can only aspire to achieve these results. It says a lot about our consistently remarkable performance and our ability to grow in a balanced way with a long-term focus.
We've managed through nearly every conceivable operating environment and demonstrated through different cycles that by providing value to our customers and partnering with our associates, we'll continue to make a difference for our customers, associates and communities. And when we do that, we create value for shareholders as evidenced by our growing dividend and our consistent net earnings per diluted share growth above our long-term guidance of 8% to 11%. In fact, our net earnings per diluted share growth rate on a compounded annual basis was 14.1% for 3 years and 18.8% for 5 years.
We demonstrate our long-term focus by continuing to invest for the future. We are making investments in our people, our digital and online capabilities and our strategic partnerships. Across the board, Kroger has an incredibly strong management team and a deep bench of leaders, who are making us better every day. We continue to make strategic investments in leadership development and training for all of our associates, including high-volume store managers and future senior leaders. Many people come here for a job, and Kroger creates opportunities for all associates to build a career.
Despite record low unemployment figures, when we held a 1-day hiring event in every supermarket location in May, we received more than 116,000 applications. From that pool, we hired more than 12,000 new associates. We see our opportunity culture as a competitive advantage.
We are expanding our digital presence and marching steadily toward a time when we can provide our customers with anything, anytime, anywhere. As you know, we are taking a disciplined approach to digital growth, testing new offerings in local markets so we can make sure we get it right before we scale offerings more broadly.
Our ClickList and ExpressLane offerings are now available in 25 markets with more to come. Our merger with Harris Teeter gave us a base of learnings that allowed us to ramp up quickly the development of ClickList. Customers now have downloaded nearly 3 billion digital coupons and offers from our mobile app and website, and we continue to experiment with Vitacost.com's ship-to-home technology and platform.
Earlier this week, Kroger's technology business unit was named one of the Top 100 Places to Work by Computerworld Magazine. We are obviously very proud of this honor. We've launched a new website, kroger.com/liveKT, to connect with and recruit top talent from around the world to join the Kroger team.
Similarly, we are finding out that ClickList also serves as a great tool to both hire and retain great people. Kroger is a fantastic place for tech talent to build careers because the technology they create can improve the lives of millions of customers each and every day.
In April, we announced a strategic investment in Lucky's Market, a specialty grocery store chain focused on natural, organic and locally grown products currently operating in 22 locations. We invested in Lucky's because of their great people and unique go-to-market strategy, which includes smaller-format stores that resemble an indoor farmers market, plus the culinary department that showcases amazingly restaurant-quality prepared foods. Lucky's approach is very much aligned with our efforts to provide affordable, fresh, organic and natural foods as part of our Customer 1st strategy. We expect to learn a lot from each other.
There are a lot of questions about the economy and the customer, inflation or lack thereof, consumer sentiment or competition. These are all issues that we've managed through, some several times over the last 50 quarters. Inflation, for example, I've often said that a 2% to 3% inflation would be a great environment to operate in. However, you rarely get the perfect operating environment. What we know is that by focusing on our associates and our customers will be a winning formula in the future as it has been in the past. At times like this, it's even more important to have 84.51° on the team so we can generate insights into what our customers want and figure out a way to give them that without having to guess at it. 
Kroger's core business is solid. We are providing exceptional customer service in the highest-quality, freshest products. Customers are giving us higher marks for better product selection and store layout as well as friendlier service. We remain focused on customer loyalty that grows tonnage in both our top and bottom lines, which then creates value for shareholders.
Where we are right now, it looks like we will be at the low end to midpoint of our 2016 net earnings per diluted share range. Where we end up in that range will be driven primarily by fuel margins. I do want to stress that we are never satisfied and our to-do list remains longer than our done list.
Now Mike will offer more details on Kroger's first quarter financial results and discuss our guidance for the remainder of the year. Mike?"

Inflation was nonexistent in the first quarter. Lower inflation has persisted and, in fact, was slightly deflationary without pharmacy. When you add pharmacy back in, we had approximately 30 basis points of inflation. This is the lowest we have seen in the last 6 years.
During the quarter, trips per household were up and units per basket declined. This, combined with more households, led to positive tonnage growth.
Operating costs, excluding fuel and Roundy's, were 4 basis points better in the first quarter. Operating, general and administrative expenses were 11 basis points better and grew by approximately 2.9%. Rent and depreciation were a combined 7 basis points worse.
We continue to work diligently to keep operating costs in check. As you know, this is the fuel we use to run our Customer 1st strategy, and as Rodney just said, this is an area where our to-do list is longer than our done list.
Now for an update on retail fuel. In the first quarter, the average retail price of a gallon of gas declined by $0.45 compared to last year. Our cents per gallon fuel margin was approximately $0.143 compared to $0.116 in the same quarter last year. On a rolling 4 quarters basis, we were at $0.182 this year compared to $0.184 last year. We expect this downward trend to accelerate as we cycle some very strong margin quarters for the rest of the year.
Our first quarter net earnings per diluted share increased 12.9% to $0.70 compared to $0.62 during the same period last year. This result was helped primarily by our operating results and higher fuel margins during the first quarter. A lower LIFO expense and share buybacks also contributed to the EPS growth.
Our integration with Roundy's is well underway. Synergies are coming together nicely. We are beginning to focus on the physical assets in Wisconsin while continuing to open new Mariano stores in Chicago. Roundy's associates share our deep commitment to putting our customer first, which makes it easy for us to work together as one team.
For our corporate brands portfolio, we are off to an exciting start on the new innovation in 2016. Last quarter, we told you that we had just introduced Simple Truth household and personal care products, expanding our popular natural and organics line into a true lifestyle brand. Customers have responded enthusiastically as both sales and unit volume have exceeded our expectations in all categories. We continue to launch new Simple Truth offerings in laundry, household, baby and health and beauty care.
We also continue to push the boundaries of culinary trends with new Private Selection spices, marinades, condiments and cooking sauces. Customers are savoring global flavors in our delicious Private Selection products such as Korean black garlic kalbi marinade and Peruvian Aji Amarillo hot sauce. 
During the first quarter, corporate brands represented approximately 27.9% of total units sold and 25.9% of sales dollars, excluding fuel and pharmacy.
The company's net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio increased to 2.12x compared to 2.09x during the same period last year. This result illustrates our commitment to use free cash flow to both grow our business and return cash to shareholders while remaining -- while maintaining an appropriate level of leverage for our credit rating.
Over the last year, Kroger used free cash flow to repurchase $1.1 billion in common shares, paid $397 million in dividends, invest $3.6 billion in capital and merged with Roundy's for $866 million. Kroger's strong EBITDA performance resulted in a return on invested capital for the first quarter of 14.08%, excluding Roundy's, compared to 14.03% for the first quarter of 2015. Our balance sheet is as strong as ever.
I will now provide a brief update on labor relations. We recently agreed to new contracts covering store associates in Houston, Indianapolis, Portland and Roanoke. We are currently negotiating contracts with UFCW for store associates in Little Rock, Nashville and Southern California. Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive costs and compensation packages that provide solid wages, good quality, affordable health care and retirement benefits for our associates. Kroger's financial results continue to be pressured by rising health care and pension costs, which some of our competitors do not face. Kroger and the local unions, which represent many of our associates, have a shared objective: growing Kroger's business and profitably, which will help us create more jobs and career opportunities and enhance job security for our associates.
Turning now to our 2016 guidance. We continue to expect identical supermarket sales growth, excluding fuel, of approximately 2.5% to 3.5% for 2016. This reflects lower inflation as well as Roundy's results, which are an approximate 30 basis point headwind to identical supermarket sales growth.
For full year net earnings, we expect 2016 range of $2.19 to $2.28 per diluted share. As Rodney said earlier, based on current fuel margin trends, we expect to be at the low end to midpoint of our guidance range. We expect fuel margins will be at or slightly below the 5-year average.
Shareholder return will be further enhanced by a dividend that is expected to increase over time. And thinking about the cadence of our quarterly results compared to our long-term 8% to 11% guidance, we believe that the second quarter will be the toughest quarter with slight growth over 2015. Keep in mind the second quarter last year grew by 26%. Both the third and fourth quarters will be at the low end to midpoint of the range.
We continue to expect capital investments, excluding mergers, acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities, to be in the $4.1 billion to $4.4 billion range for 2016.
Finally, we continue to expect Kroger's full year LIFO -- full year FIFO operating margin in 2016, excluding fuel, to slightly expand compared to 2015 results.
Now I will turn it back to Rodney."

The effect of the interest rate, it's really -- it's odd how a lot of pensions are calculated from the liability using  interest rates, the present value of the liability. If you look at state and local and federal pensions and multiemployer pensions, their liability is actually calculated using the expected rate of return, it's the discount rate. So UFCW plans, the way they calculate their unfunded status is really unaffected by changes in the interest rate unless they change their expected rate of return. It's the same way state -- it's just the way it's mandated to be done or is done. It would affect the company plan a little bit, but remember, our company plan is a frozen plan. There continue to be benefits earned by those who are still working and are participants in it, but there's no new participants in it. And we try to maintain the funded status of that enough so we don't have to do some reporting issues to participants. But I never want that fund to go overfunded because as the last person winds up getting their check, there's no easy way to get any excess money out of that. So we purposefully manage that to be slightly underfunded. We're not even -- to be underfunded because some day rates will go up, and I don't want to put a bunch of money in now and then wake up in 5 years and have the fund be overfunded because I can't do anything with it."

The thing that I would say that I'm extremely pleased with is the -- our associates in -- at Roundy's and how welcoming they are and how excited they are to be part of Kroger and making sure that we leverage the size of Kroger, and the synergies continued to actually come in better than what we were expecting a little bit.

And good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. With me to review Kroger's first quarter results is Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Mike Schlotman.Our associates delivered another solid quarter. We",927,"Thank you, Kate. And good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. With me to review Kroger's first quarter results is Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Mike Schlotman.
Our associates delivered another solid quarter. We continue to execute our growth plan and to deliver on our financial performance commitments. Most importantly, we continue to strengthen our connection with our customers, growing loyalty and market share and achieving Kroger's 50th consecutive quarter of positive identical supermarket sales growth, excluding fuel. Most companies can only aspire to achieve these results. It says a lot about our consistently remarkable performance and our ability to grow in a balanced way with a long-term focus.
We've managed through nearly every conceivable operating environment and demonstrated through different cycles that by providing value to our customers and partnering with our associates, we'll continue to make a difference for our customers, associates and communities. And when we do that, we create value for shareholders as evidenced by our growing dividend and our consistent net earnings per diluted share growth above our long-term guidance of 8% to 11%. In fact, our net earnings per diluted share growth rate on a compounded annual basis was 14.1% for 3 years and 18.8% for 5 years.
We demonstrate our long-term focus by continuing to invest for the future. We are making investments in our people, our digital and online capabilities and our strategic partnerships. Across the board, Kroger has an incredibly strong management team and a deep bench of leaders, who are making us better every day. We continue to make strategic investments in leadership development and training for all of our associates, including high-volume store managers and future senior leaders. Many people come here for a job, and Kroger creates opportunities for all associates to build a career.
Despite record low unemployment figures, when we held a 1-day hiring event in every supermarket location in May, we received more than 116,000 applications. From that pool, we hired more than 12,000 new associates. We see our opportunity culture as a competitive advantage.
We are expanding our digital presence and marching steadily toward a time when we can provide our customers with anything, anytime, anywhere. As you know, we are taking a disciplined approach to digital growth, testing new offerings in local markets so we can make sure we get it right before we scale offerings more broadly.
Our ClickList and ExpressLane offerings are now available in 25 markets with more to come. Our merger with Harris Teeter gave us a base of learnings that allowed us to ramp up quickly the development of ClickList. Customers now have downloaded nearly 3 billion digital coupons and offers from our mobile app and website, and we continue to experiment with Vitacost.com's ship-to-home technology and platform.
Earlier this week, Kroger's technology business unit was named one of the Top 100 Places to Work by Computerworld Magazine. We are obviously very proud of this honor. We've launched a new website, kroger.com/liveKT, to connect with and recruit top talent from around the world to join the Kroger team.
Similarly, we are finding out that ClickList also serves as a great tool to both hire and retain great people. Kroger is a fantastic place for tech talent to build careers because the technology they create can improve the lives of millions of customers each and every day.
In April, we announced a strategic investment in Lucky's Market, a specialty grocery store chain focused on natural, organic and locally grown products currently operating in 22 locations. We invested in Lucky's because of their great people and unique go-to-market strategy, which includes smaller-format stores that resemble an indoor farmers market, plus the culinary department that showcases amazingly restaurant-quality prepared foods. Lucky's approach is very much aligned with our efforts to provide affordable, fresh, organic and natural foods as part of our Customer 1st strategy. We expect to learn a lot from each other.
There are a lot of questions about the economy and the customer, inflation or lack thereof, consumer sentiment or competition. These are all issues that we've managed through, some several times over the last 50 quarters. Inflation, for example, I've often said that a 2% to 3% inflation would be a great environment to operate in. However, you rarely get the perfect operating environment. What we know is that by focusing on our associates and our customers will be a winning formula in the future as it has been in the past. At times like this, it's even more important to have 84.51° on the team so we can generate insights into what our customers want and figure out a way to give them that without having to guess at it. 
Kroger's core business is solid. We are providing exceptional customer service in the highest-quality, freshest products. Customers are giving us higher marks for better product selection and store layout as well as friendlier service. We remain focused on customer loyalty that grows tonnage in both our top and bottom lines, which then creates value for shareholders.
Where we are right now, it looks like we will be at the low end to midpoint of our 2016 net earnings per diluted share range. Where we end up in that range will be driven primarily by fuel margins. I do want to stress that we are never satisfied and our to-do list remains longer than our done list.
Now Mike will offer more details on Kroger's first quarter financial results and discuss our guidance for the remainder of the year. Mike?"
284342,345286375,1001044,"The Kroger Co., Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Jun 16, 2016",2016-06-16,"Earnings Calls","The Kroger Co.","Executives","Thanks, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. IDs came in at 2.4%. As Rodney said, we've been in environments like this before, and we will continue to focus on growing households, growing units and making sure we are delivering the right value proposition",1028,"Thanks, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. IDs came in at 2.4%. As Rodney said, we've been in environments like this before, and we will continue to focus on growing households, growing units and making sure we are delivering the right value proposition for our customers.
Inflation was nonexistent in the first quarter. Lower inflation has persisted and, in fact, was slightly deflationary without pharmacy. When you add pharmacy back in, we had approximately 30 basis points of inflation. This is the lowest we have seen in the last 6 years.
During the quarter, trips per household were up and units per basket declined. This, combined with more households, led to positive tonnage growth.
Operating costs, excluding fuel and Roundy's, were 4 basis points better in the first quarter. Operating, general and administrative expenses were 11 basis points better and grew by approximately 2.9%. Rent and depreciation were a combined 7 basis points worse.
We continue to work diligently to keep operating costs in check. As you know, this is the fuel we use to run our Customer 1st strategy, and as Rodney just said, this is an area where our to-do list is longer than our done list.
Now for an update on retail fuel. In the first quarter, the average retail price of a gallon of gas declined by $0.45 compared to last year. Our cents per gallon fuel margin was approximately $0.143 compared to $0.116 in the same quarter last year. On a rolling 4 quarters basis, we were at $0.182 this year compared to $0.184 last year. We expect this downward trend to accelerate as we cycle some very strong margin quarters for the rest of the year.
Our first quarter net earnings per diluted share increased 12.9% to $0.70 compared to $0.62 during the same period last year. This result was helped primarily by our operating results and higher fuel margins during the first quarter. A lower LIFO expense and share buybacks also contributed to the EPS growth.
Our integration with Roundy's is well underway. Synergies are coming together nicely. We are beginning to focus on the physical assets in Wisconsin while continuing to open new Mariano stores in Chicago. Roundy's associates share our deep commitment to putting our customer first, which makes it easy for us to work together as one team.
For our corporate brands portfolio, we are off to an exciting start on the new innovation in 2016. Last quarter, we told you that we had just introduced Simple Truth household and personal care products, expanding our popular natural and organics line into a true lifestyle brand. Customers have responded enthusiastically as both sales and unit volume have exceeded our expectations in all categories. We continue to launch new Simple Truth offerings in laundry, household, baby and health and beauty care.
We also continue to push the boundaries of culinary trends with new Private Selection spices, marinades, condiments and cooking sauces. Customers are savoring global flavors in our delicious Private Selection products such as Korean black garlic kalbi marinade and Peruvian Aji Amarillo hot sauce. 
During the first quarter, corporate brands represented approximately 27.9% of total units sold and 25.9% of sales dollars, excluding fuel and pharmacy.
The company's net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio increased to 2.12x compared to 2.09x during the same period last year. This result illustrates our commitment to use free cash flow to both grow our business and return cash to shareholders while remaining -- while maintaining an appropriate level of leverage for our credit rating.
Over the last year, Kroger used free cash flow to repurchase $1.1 billion in common shares, paid $397 million in dividends, invest $3.6 billion in capital and merged with Roundy's for $866 million. Kroger's strong EBITDA performance resulted in a return on invested capital for the first quarter of 14.08%, excluding Roundy's, compared to 14.03% for the first quarter of 2015. Our balance sheet is as strong as ever.
I will now provide a brief update on labor relations. We recently agreed to new contracts covering store associates in Houston, Indianapolis, Portland and Roanoke. We are currently negotiating contracts with UFCW for store associates in Little Rock, Nashville and Southern California. Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive costs and compensation packages that provide solid wages, good quality, affordable health care and retirement benefits for our associates. Kroger's financial results continue to be pressured by rising health care and pension costs, which some of our competitors do not face. Kroger and the local unions, which represent many of our associates, have a shared objective: growing Kroger's business and profitably, which will help us create more jobs and career opportunities and enhance job security for our associates.
Turning now to our 2016 guidance. We continue to expect identical supermarket sales growth, excluding fuel, of approximately 2.5% to 3.5% for 2016. This reflects lower inflation as well as Roundy's results, which are an approximate 30 basis point headwind to identical supermarket sales growth.
For full year net earnings, we expect 2016 range of $2.19 to $2.28 per diluted share. As Rodney said earlier, based on current fuel margin trends, we expect to be at the low end to midpoint of our guidance range. We expect fuel margins will be at or slightly below the 5-year average.
Shareholder return will be further enhanced by a dividend that is expected to increase over time. And thinking about the cadence of our quarterly results compared to our long-term 8% to 11% guidance, we believe that the second quarter will be the toughest quarter with slight growth over 2015. Keep in mind the second quarter last year grew by 26%. Both the third and fourth quarters will be at the low end to midpoint of the range.
We continue to expect capital investments, excluding mergers, acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities, to be in the $4.1 billion to $4.4 billion range for 2016.
Finally, we continue to expect Kroger's full year LIFO -- full year FIFO operating margin in 2016, excluding fuel, to slightly expand compared to 2015 results.
Now I will turn it back to Rodney."

The other thing on inflation, inflation, we had expected that it would start picking up some, and when we look going forward, we just don't see that picking up.

How do they get treated by associates?

The effect of the interest rate, it's really -- it's odd how a lot of pensions are calculated from the liability using  interest rates, the present value of the liability. If you look at state and local and federal pensions and multiemployer pensions, their liability is actually calculated using the expected rate of return, it's the discount rate. So UFCW plans, the way they calculate their unfunded status is really unaffected by changes in the interest rate unless they change their expected rate of return. It's the same way state -- it's just the way it's mandated to be done or is done. It would affect the company plan a little bit, but remember, our company plan is a frozen plan. There continue to be benefits earned by those who are still working and are participants in it, but there's no new participants in it. And we try to maintain the funded status of that enough so we don't have to do some reporting issues to participants. But I never want that fund to go overfunded because as the last person winds up getting their check, there's no easy way to get any excess money out of that. So we purposefully manage that to be slightly underfunded. We're not even -- to be underfunded because some day rates will go up, and I don't want to put a bunch of money in now and then wake up in 5 years and have the fund be overfunded because I can't do anything with it."

Relative to the commercial paper, you'll probably see us maintain commercial paper in that range. It's the easiest way, particularly with where commercial paper rates are today. It's the easiest way for us to get exposure to floating rates. If you want to modify your exposure to floating rates quickly, it's easiest to do that with commercial paper because assuming the markets are open, I can always term it out. If I have swaps or hedges or if I've done a 3- or 5-year floating rate note, you really can't change that quickly or eloquently, so that will be -- continue to be part of our strategy."

Before we end today's call, I'd like to share some additional thoughts with our associates listening in today. And as you know, I always like to tell our associates a few comments because we just have so many that listen in. And first, I want to take this -- take a moment to extend our deepest sympathies to the family and friends of those who lost their lives in the recent horrific attack in Orlando. What happened is tragic and heartbreaking. I also want to thank the first responders who put their lives in danger every day to protect us. I know our family of associates, those at Axiom Health Care outside of Orlando, across Florida and throughout the rest of the country is deeply saddened by what has happened. We stand in support of the LGBT community. An event like this affects each and every one of us. No matter where we live or work, it serves to remind us of what is most important, and that is taking care of each other. I want to thank our associates everywhere who demonstrate our values of diversity, inclusion and respect every day, to treat all with dignity, to seek and embrace the differences among people and to lift each other up. That completes our call today. Thanks for joining us, and have a good summer."

284342,381880935,1044261,"The Kroger Co., Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Sep 09, 2016",2016-09-09,"Earnings Calls","The Kroger Co.","Executives","Thank you, Kate. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. With me to review Kroger's second quarter results is Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Mike Schlotman.Our core business remains strong in the second quarter",1080,"Thank you, Kate. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. With me to review Kroger's second quarter results is Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Mike Schlotman.
Our core business remains strong in the second quarter as we continue to increase market share, improve tonnage and grow loyal households. As we often say, we are focused on the long-term performance over a 3- to 5-year horizon. We have the right strategy, the right people and the financial flexibility to execute our strategy, which allows us to continue investing in our associates, our business and grow market share.
By remaining focused on our strategy, we create long-term value for our shareholders. An example of staying on our strategy is continuing to add hours to support tonnage growth in a deflationary environment. This increases our cost as a rate of sales, but without this investment, the shopping experience, an important element of our Customer 1st Strategy, would be negatively affected.
The transition from inflation to deflation creates a difficult operating environment. We estimate that we had deflation without pharmacy of 1.25%, including 1.5% deflation in the grocery category. I want to stress that we've been through economic environments like this before.
In 2009, we transitioned from inflation to deflation in a very similar way. Of course, in 2009, we also had a much more difficult macroeconomic backdrop. Even though the current environment is volatile, we are confident that we will navigate today's challenges and continue to deliver value for our customers and shareholders.
While we've revised our identical supermarket sales growth and net earnings per diluted share guidance for the year, our growth objectives are on a 3- to 5-year rolling cycle, and we remain confident in those targets. We are in this long-term range run and not a 12-week cycle or particular year. We have demonstrated our ability to invest at the appropriate times to create momentum when the environment improves.
While we expect continued deflation and tough year-over-year comparisons for the remainder of the year and even into early next year, as we know from past experience, the environment won't be deflationary forever. Kroger's long-term focus is one of the reasons why our business continues to generate healthy free cash flow, which allow us to invest for the future and maintain financial flexibility to create shareholder value.
To this end, we have decided to allocate approximately $500 million less to capital investments for 2016 and for 2017, which will allow us the flexibility to return value in the near term.  This could include utilizing our current board-authorized $500 million share repurchase authority as market conditions provide the opportunity.
We often say that the only certain thing in retail is that it is always changing. This is certainly true for an ever-shifting customer preferences as well as the overall competitive environment. We believe one of the reasons for our continued success, regardless of the operating conditions or competition, is our ability to generate increasingly sophisticated customer insights.
Our team at 84.51° helps us figure out what customers want so we can provide highly informed strategic investments based on rigorous data analytics rather than simply reacting to competitors. Customer insights give us a big advantage in challenging environments like this one.
A lot of what we are seeing suggests a gradual tightening of budgets. Our customers tell us they are less confident about the economy now than they were 3 months ago, and they expect the economy to get worse in the next 3 months. We are as committed as ever to doing what is right for the customer.
Our team's execution of our Customer 1st Strategy helped deliver growth in loyal and total households, units and market share compared to last year. Customers continue to vote with their dollar, and on that basis, Kroger continues to win.
We believe that it is easier to steer a big ship when the waters are smooth. But when the water gets rough, the right people and the right strategy make all the difference. These are some of the same reasons why you should continue to believe in Kroger.
We are focused on the long term. We have the financial flexibility to execute our strategy, and we have the right people and the right strategy to weather any storm. Our merchandisers and operators are the best in the business. Our senior management team brings a great mix of new ideas and long tenure, propelling innovation while remaining steady at the helm.
Like any of the high-performance teams, the mindset of our leaders is agility and responsiveness to changing customer and economic dynamics. We remain focused on growing market share, and we'll continue to invest in our associates and our business, providing value to our customers, both today and for the future.
One example of our long-term focus is our recent merger between our specialty drug pharmacy, Axiom, and ModernHEALTH. The merger, which closed last Friday, further expands our presence in the high-growth specialty pharmacy area and connects nicely with our retail pharmacies and broader health and wellness strategy. We are excited to welcome ModernHEALTH's 500 associates to the Kroger family.
A second example of a long -- of our long-term focus is our progress integrating sustainable practices into our business operations. We believe that customers and associates increasingly make decisions based on how well companies take care of their people, their communities and the planet. So we are very pleased to share that Kroger has earned a spot on the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the fourth consecutive year. More than 600 companies in North America are evaluated each year, and only the top 20% are listed on the index. This recognition, of course, is only possible, thanks to the thousands of individual activities our associates do on a daily basis in our stores, manufacturing and distribution facilities and offices.
Through all our growth initiatives, we strive for balance between our core business, beyond the core and innovation. This fundamental approach is how we'll continue to win with customers and create sustainable long-term value for shareholders.
I noted earlier that we operate our business on a 3- to 5-year rolling cycle. Over both time horizons, we have been performing consistently above our long-term net earnings per diluted share growth guidance of 8% to 11%, plus a growing dividend.
Now Mike will offer more detail on Kroger's second quarter financial results and discuss our guidance for the remainder of the year. Mike?"
284342,381880935,1044261,"The Kroger Co., Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Sep 09, 2016",2016-09-09,"Earnings Calls","The Kroger Co.","Executives","Thanks, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. As Rodney said, we've been through periods like this before, and we have the leaders and the strategy to continue delivering value to our customers, associates and shareholders.

As Rodney said, we've been through periods like this before, and we have the leaders and the strategy to continue delivering value to our customers, associates and shareholders. While the quarter and the year aren't shaping up the way we expected, we continue to be well positioned for the long term.
We continue to see a strong flow of capital projects. We've tried to be very clear about our deliberate ramp-up of capital spending since 2012. As the management team, we recognize the environment and believe it is prudent to reduce capital investments, excluding mergers, acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities, to $3.6 billion to $3.9 billion for 2016 and 2017. This is still a substantial investment in the business.
Consistent with our long-term financial strategy, we're maintaining flexibility with our cash flow to invest in the business, repurchase shares and maintain a growing dividend. Our philosophy is to always create value for shareholders. And while our Customer 1st approach remains our distinctive business strategy, we implement multiple approaches to deliver shareholder value.
There are many gives and takes in any quarter and year, and we view our ability to adjust to return value to shareholders as the core strength of our financial strategy.
Identical supermarket sales without fuel came in at 1.7%, impacted by deflation across most departments, with the exception of produce and pharmacy. We are seeing significant deflation in milk, eggs and cheese. We will continue to focus on growing households, growing units and making sure we are delivering the right value proposition for our customers.
As Rodney pointed out, we continue to do all 3 of these things during the second quarter. That. Our team accomplished this in such a deflationary environment is no small feat and demonstrates that our associates continue to connect with customers in a personal and meaningful way.
As you know, a strength of our Customer 1st model is that we make regular investments in our people, products, shopping experience and price. As Rodney said, we added hours to keep up with unit growth, and we also continued our price investments as evidenced by our lower gross margin. We balance these investments based on the needs we see in the business to drive sustainable results over time.
Operating costs, excluding fuel, Roundy's and the pension agreements, were better by 6 basis points in the second quarter. A lower expected bonus is one driver of these results. We'll continue to focus on cost controls and use those savings to provide additional value to customers.
Now for an update on retail fuel. In the second quarter, the average retail price of a gallon of gas declined by $0.47 compared to last year. Our cents per gallon fuel margin was approximately $0.198 compared to $0.19 in the same quarter last year. On a rolling 4 quarters basis, we are at $0.184 this year compared to $0.186 last year. We expect this rolling 4-quarter comparison to further decline as we cycle some very strong margins for the rest of the year.
A variety of factors contributed to our net earnings per diluted share results in the second quarter. Deflation was clearly a headwind, and that was offset by our lower-than-expected effective income tax rate due to the adoption of a new accounting standard.
Our second quarter net earnings per diluted share on a GAAP basis was $0.40 compared to $0.44 during the same period last year. Our net earnings per diluted share results included charges related to the restructuring of certain pension obligations to help stabilize associates' future benefits. Excluding the effects of these charges, Kroger's adjusted net earnings were $454 million or $0.47 per diluted share.
Our integration with Roundy's continues to be on plan. We have 2 dedicated management teams, one for Roundy's in Wisconsin and one for Mariano's in Illinois, to take into account the uniqueness of the formats in each location. These leadership teams have a mix of Kroger and Roundy's experience. We are pleased with the early results of our Roundy's investments in Wisconsin, and we remain excited about this opportunity.
During the second quarter, corporate brands represented approximately 27% of total units sold and 26% of sales dollars, excluding fuel and pharmacy. Our corporate brands team continues to drive innovation in important categories.
Earlier this week, we launched a new, more affordable corporate brand line of cage-free eggs. As you may know that earlier this year, we committed to a 100% cage-free eggs supply chain by 2025. In order to reach that goal, we want to help customers shift from conventional eggs to the cage-free category. By offering a lower-price alternative to most other cage-free eggs on the market today, we believe our mainstream customers will begin to migrate to the cage-free category.
Our net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio increased to 2.11 compared to 2.02 [ph] during the second -- the same period last year. This result illustrates our commitment to use free cash flow to both grow our business and return cash to shareholders while maintaining an appropriate level of leverage for our credit rating. Over time, we would expect our net total debt to EBITDA ratio to grow if we continue to successfully negotiate restructuring of troubled multiemployer pension plan obligations to help stabilize associates' future benefits. We would not expect this increase to adversely affect our credit rating as the rating agencies already contemplate our multiemployer pension plan obligations, and the additional debt we would take on to fund these plans will be offset in a reduction of our off-balance sheet multiemployer pension plan obligations.
Over the last year, Kroger's used free cash flow to repurchase $1.1 billion of common shares, pay $406 million in dividends, invest $3.8 billion in capital and merge with Roundy's for $866 million. Return on invested capital for the second quarter was 13.95%, excluding Roundy's, compared to 14.24% for the second quarter of 2015. Our balance sheet is as strong as ever.
I will now provide a brief update on labor relations. We recently agreed to new contracts covering store associates in Little Rock, Nashville and Southern California. We are currently negotiating contracts with the UFCW for price [ph] associates in Arizona and store associates in Michigan and Atlanta. We also negotiated a new contract with the Teamsters for our Roundy's distribution center.
Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive costs and compensation packages to provide solid wages, good quality, affordable health care and retirement benefits for our associates. Kroger's financial results continue to be pressured by rising health care and pension costs, which some of our competitors do not face. Kroger and the local unions, which represent many of our associates, have a shared objective, growing Kroger's business and profitably, which will help us create more jobs, incur opportunities and enhance job security for our associates.
I'd like to take a moment to highlight our $111 million commitment to the UFCW consolidated pension plan. This is part of an agreement to transfer the liabilities of 2 troubled multiemployer pension plans, which protects pensions already earned and will provide greater stability for future benefits of more than 6,500 Kroger associates and retirees. This is the latest in a series of steps we've taken during the last 4 years to provide greater stability of current and future benefits for Kroger associates and enhance the prospects for future returns while continuing to deliver strong shareholder value.
In 2012, we agreed to establish the UFCW consolidated pension plan by working with the unions to consolidate 4 multiemployer pension funds into one. That agreement protected benefits -- that agreement protected earned benefits and provide a greater stability of the future benefits of more than 65,000 Kroger associates.
In 2014, we announced similar agreements with 2 additional multiemployer pension funds. And in 2015, we accelerated contributions to the consolidated plan. We are proud of our ability to do this even in a tough operating environment. We intend to continue looking for opportunities to leverage our strong financial flexibility to safeguard associates' benefits, increase certainty and control over future benefit obligations and continuing to deliver strong shareholder value.
Turning now to our 2016 guidance. As a result of continued deflation, we lowered our net earnings guidance to a range of $2.03 to $2.13 per diluted share for 2016. Kroger's adjusted net earnings guidance range per share -- per diluted share for 2016 is $2.10 to $2.20, which excludes the $0.07 charge from the company's commitment to restructure certain pension obligations. The previous guidance range was $2.19 to $2.28, which did not anticipate the $0.07 charge from the company's commitment to restructure the pension obligations.
Shareholder return will be enhanced by a dividend that is expected to increase over time. For identical supermarket sales growth, excluding fuel, we expect the remainder of 2016 to be in the 50 basis point to 1.5% range, which is 1.4% to 1.8% for the full year. Finally, we now expect Kroger's full year FIFO operating margin in 2016, excluding fuel, to decline slightly compared to 2015 results.
Now I will turn it back to Rodney."

You can't just look at one particular area. So to say that there's something drastically different, I wouldn't define it as that. As you know, we have a basket of goods that we look at on almost a weekly basis in terms of how is our pricing relative to our strategy and relative to our competition. And we really haven't seen drastic changes in that relative pricing in those basket of goods, and we haven't for a long period of time. The other thing, I think it's always incredibly important for us to remember, and this is as much inside the company as external, is the customer decides where to shop, and price is only one element of that decision on where to price. They also look at the fresh -- the quality of the fresh departments. What are the products that are being offered, what's the variety there. And then really a critical part is how do the associates engage and how are they treated and how long does it take to -- when you're in line and those elements. And we continue to make great progress on those elements, and our customers continue to tell us it's really important for them as they decide where to shop. And that's -- as you know, years ago, that's the reason we started the Customer 1st Strategy. It's also the reason why we continue to execute the Customer 1st Strategy. If you look at what's within it though, it has changed over time as customers change. So if you look at natural and organics, when we started the journey, natural and organics really wasn't a critical part of the product strategy. Today, it's incredibly important.

And the high inflation actually happened, as you referenced, in '08, and it also happened in '11. So to say that it's different in this time, I mean, each one of us would have our own opinions. An awful lot of deflation/inflation is driven by what's going on in commodity markets, and most of the commodity markets are incredibly benign at the moment. And historically, I always like to say high prices solve high prices and low prices solve low prices because capacity will start changing. And if you look at farmers, they're very smart, and they'll start producing less of the things that -- where they don't make money. So historically, that's what caused inflations to swing. And still an awful lot of our business is driven by the commodity markets. If you look at produce, that's just going to be driven by what's the growing season and what's the growing season like. We continue to see good demand. We still continue to see tonnage growth and those elements, and those are the things that we're looking at to see do we think it's different this time."

It's an area where we believe we have a unique competitive advantage just because we can start helping customers eat healthier as well, and that's something that's a positive in terms of the overall connection with the customer. And when you look at all the pieces together, we think it's a great opportunity to create sum of all parts where a customer can engage with us in a physical facility, online or through the specialty drug channel and then we can leverage across and then the Little Clinic helps as well.

If you look at the items in the basket, that's always a tough one to answer because if you look at items in the basket, we've been flat or up slightly or down slightly for a long period of time. The thing that's important to note is if you look at customers over a month, how do they spend with us and they continue to spend 5 more items from us. And as we get better and better in our fresh department, customers come in and shop our stores more often because on fresh products, people want to buy it. It's not quite to the European standards where people buy daily, but you'll see people increasingly coming into the store every 2 or 3 days to pick up their fresh items. And that affects the items of the basket. So I think it's always difficult to overlook it, to look too much at items in the basket, and we would focus much more in terms of over a month how our customers behaving. In terms of competitors, I don't know that there's too much I can add from what Mike and I mentioned before. Overall, I wouldn't say that we are seeing a huge difference. If you go back and look, you have competitors that had gone out of business that now stores have been reopened in some parts of the country. You have all kinds of different things going on and to make a blanket statement toward a specific competitor, that, I don't think it would be helpful because I really don't see it changing massively when you look at big groups.

284342,381880935,1044293,"The Kroger Co., Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Sep 09, 2016",2016-09-09,"Earnings Calls","The Kroger Co.","Executives","Thank you, Kate. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. With me to review Kroger's second quarter results is Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Mike Schlotman.Our core business remains strong in the second quarter",1080,"Thank you, Kate. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. With me to review Kroger's second quarter results is Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Mike Schlotman.
Our core business remains strong in the second quarter as we continue to increase market share, improve tonnage and grow loyal households. As we often say, we are focused on the long-term performance over a 3- to 5-year horizon. We have the right strategy, the right people and the financial flexibility to execute our strategy, which allows us to continue investing in our associates, our business and grow market share.
By remaining focused on our strategy, we create long-term value for our shareholders. An example of staying on our strategy is continuing to add hours to support tonnage growth in a deflationary environment. This increases our cost as a rate of sales, but without this investment, the shopping experience, an important element of our Customer 1st Strategy, would be negatively affected.
The transition from inflation to deflation creates a difficult operating environment. We estimate that we had deflation without pharmacy of 1.25%, including 1.5% deflation in the grocery category. I want to stress that we've been through economic environments like this before.
In 2009, we transitioned from inflation to deflation in a very similar way. Of course, in 2009, we also had a much more difficult macroeconomic backdrop. Even though the current environment is volatile, we are confident that we will navigate today's challenges and continue to deliver value for our customers and shareholders.
While we've revised our identical supermarket sales growth and net earnings per diluted share guidance for the year, our growth objectives are on a 3- to 5-year rolling cycle, and we remain confident in those targets. We are in this long-term range run and not a 12-week cycle or particular year. We have demonstrated our ability to invest at the appropriate times to create momentum when the environment improves.
While we expect continued deflation and tough year-over-year comparisons for the remainder of the year and even into early next year, as we know from past experience, the environment won't be deflationary forever. Kroger's long-term focus is one of the reasons why our business continues to generate healthy free cash flow, which allow us to invest for the future and maintain financial flexibility to create shareholder value.
To this end, we have decided to allocate approximately $500 million less to capital investments for 2016 and for 2017, which will allow us the flexibility to return value in the near term.  This could include utilizing our current board-authorized $500 million share repurchase authority as market conditions provide the opportunity.
We often say that the only certain thing in retail is that it is always changing. This is certainly true for an ever-shifting customer preferences as well as the overall competitive environment. We believe one of the reasons for our continued success, regardless of the operating conditions or competition, is our ability to generate increasingly sophisticated customer insights.
Our team at 84.51° helps us figure out what customers want so we can provide highly informed strategic investments based on rigorous data analytics rather than simply reacting to competitors. Customer insights give us a big advantage in challenging environments like this one.
A lot of what we are seeing suggests a gradual tightening of budgets. Our customers tell us they are less confident about the economy now than they were 3 months ago, and they expect the economy to get worse in the next 3 months. We are as committed as ever to doing what is right for the customer.
Our team's execution of our Customer 1st Strategy helped deliver growth in loyal and total households, units and market share compared to last year. Customers continue to vote with their dollar, and on that basis, Kroger continues to win.
We believe that it is easier to steer a big ship when the waters are smooth. But when the water gets rough, the right people and the right strategy make all the difference. These are some of the same reasons why you should continue to believe in Kroger.
We are focused on the long term. We have the financial flexibility to execute our strategy, and we have the right people and the right strategy to weather any storm. Our merchandisers and operators are the best in the business. Our senior management team brings a great mix of new ideas and long tenure, propelling innovation while remaining steady at the helm.
Like any of the high-performance teams, the mindset of our leaders is agility and responsiveness to changing customer and economic dynamics. We remain focused on growing market share, and we'll continue to invest in our associates and our business, providing value to our customers, both today and for the future.
One example of our long-term focus is our recent merger between our specialty drug pharmacy, Axiom, and ModernHEALTH. The merger, which closed last Friday, further expands our presence in the high-growth specialty pharmacy area and connects nicely with our retail pharmacies and broader health and wellness strategy. We are excited to welcome ModernHEALTH's 500 associates to the Kroger family.
A second example of a long -- of our long-term focus is our progress integrating sustainable practices into our business operations. We believe that customers and associates increasingly make decisions based on how well companies take care of their people, their communities and the planet. So we are very pleased to share that Kroger has earned a spot on the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the fourth consecutive year. More than 600 companies in North America are evaluated each year, and only the top 20% are listed on the index. This recognition, of course, is only possible, thanks to the thousands of individual activities our associates do on a daily basis in our stores, manufacturing and distribution facilities and offices.
Through all our growth initiatives, we strive for balance between our core business, beyond the core and innovation. This fundamental approach is how we'll continue to win with customers and create sustainable long-term value for shareholders.
I noted earlier that we operate our business on a 3- to 5-year rolling cycle. Over both time horizons, we have been performing consistently above our long-term net earnings per diluted share growth guidance of 8% to 11%, plus a growing dividend.
Now Mike will offer more detail on Kroger's second quarter financial results and discuss our guidance for the remainder of the year. Mike?"
284342,381880935,1044293,"The Kroger Co., Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Sep 09, 2016",2016-09-09,"Earnings Calls","The Kroger Co.","Executives","Thanks, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. As Rodney said, we've been through periods like this before, and we have the leaders and the strategy to continue delivering value to our customers, associates and shareholders. While the quarter and the year ar",1526,"Thanks, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. As Rodney said, we've been through periods like this before, and we have the leaders and the strategy to continue delivering value to our customers, associates and shareholders. While the quarter and the year aren't shaping up the way we expected, we continue to be well positioned for the long term.
We continue to see a strong flow of capital projects. We've tried to be very clear about our deliberate ramp-up of capital spending since 2012. As the management team, we recognize the environment and believe it is prudent to reduce capital investments, excluding mergers, acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities, to $3.6 billion to $3.9 billion for 2016 and 2017. This is still a substantial investment in the business.
Consistent with our long-term financial strategy, we're maintaining flexibility with our cash flow to invest in the business, repurchase shares and maintain a growing dividend. Our philosophy is to always create value for shareholders. And while our Customer 1st approach remains our distinctive business strategy, we implement multiple approaches to deliver shareholder value.
There are many gives and takes in any quarter and year, and we view our ability to adjust to return value to shareholders as the core strength of our financial strategy.
Identical supermarket sales without fuel came in at 1.7%, impacted by deflation across most departments, with the exception of produce and pharmacy. We are seeing significant deflation in milk, eggs and cheese. We will continue to focus on growing households, growing units and making sure we are delivering the right value proposition for our customers.
As Rodney pointed out, we continue to do all 3 of these things during the second quarter. That. Our team accomplished this in such a deflationary environment is no small feat and demonstrates that our associates continue to connect with customers in a personal and meaningful way.
As you know, a strength of our Customer 1st model is that we make regular investments in our people, products, shopping experience and price. As Rodney said, we added hours to keep up with unit growth, and we also continued our price investments as evidenced by our lower gross margin. We balance these investments based on the needs we see in the business to drive sustainable results over time.
Operating costs, excluding fuel, Roundy's and the pension agreements, were better by 6 basis points in the second quarter. A lower expected bonus is one driver of these results. We'll continue to focus on cost controls and use those savings to provide additional value to customers.
Now for an update on retail fuel. In the second quarter, the average retail price of a gallon of gas declined by $0.47 compared to last year. Our cents per gallon fuel margin was approximately $0.198 compared to $0.19 in the same quarter last year. On a rolling 4 quarters basis, we are at $0.184 this year compared to $0.186 last year. We expect this rolling 4-quarter comparison to further decline as we cycle some very strong margins for the rest of the year.
A variety of factors contributed to our net earnings per diluted share results in the second quarter. Deflation was clearly a headwind, and that was offset by our lower-than-expected effective income tax rate due to the adoption of a new accounting standard.
Our second quarter net earnings per diluted share on a GAAP basis was $0.40 compared to $0.44 during the same period last year. Our net earnings per diluted share results included charges related to the restructuring of certain pension obligations to help stabilize associates' future benefits. Excluding the effects of these charges, Kroger's adjusted net earnings were $454 million or $0.47 per diluted share.
Our integration with Roundy's continues to be on plan. We have 2 dedicated management teams, one for Roundy's in Wisconsin and one for Mariano's in Illinois, to take into account the uniqueness of the formats in each location. These leadership teams have a mix of Kroger and Roundy's experience. We are pleased with the early results of our Roundy's investments in Wisconsin, and we remain excited about this opportunity.
During the second quarter, corporate brands represented approximately 27% of total units sold and 26% of sales dollars, excluding fuel and pharmacy. Our corporate brands team continues to drive innovation in important categories.
Earlier this week, we launched a new, more affordable corporate brand line of cage-free eggs. As you may know that earlier this year, we committed to a 100% cage-free eggs supply chain by 2025. In order to reach that goal, we want to help customers shift from conventional eggs to the cage-free category. By offering a lower-price alternative to most other cage-free eggs on the market today, we believe our mainstream customers will begin to migrate to the cage-free category.
Our net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio increased to 2.11 compared to 2.02 during the second -- the same period last year. This result illustrates our commitment to use free cash flow to both grow our business and return cash to shareholders while maintaining an appropriate level of leverage for our credit rating. Over time, we would expect our net total debt to EBITDA ratio to grow if we continue to successfully negotiate restructuring of troubled multiemployer pension plan obligations to help stabilize associates' future benefits. We would not expect this increase to adversely affect our credit rating as the rating agencies already contemplate our multiemployer pension plan obligations, and the additional debt we would take on to fund these plans will be offset in a reduction of our off-balance sheet multiemployer pension plan obligations.
Over the last year, Kroger's used free cash flow to repurchase $1.1 billion of common shares, pay $406 million in dividends, invest $3.8 billion in capital and merge with Roundy's for $866 million. Return on invested capital for the second quarter was 13.95%, excluding Roundy's, compared to 14.24% for the second quarter of 2015. Our balance sheet is as strong as ever.
I will now provide a brief update on labor relations. We recently agreed to new contracts covering store associates in Little Rock, Nashville and Southern California. We are currently negotiating contracts with the UFCW for Fry's associates in Arizona and store associates in Michigan and Atlanta. We also negotiated a new contract with the Teamsters for our Roundy's distribution center.
Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive costs and compensation packages to provide solid wages, good quality, affordable health care and retirement benefits for our associates. Kroger's financial results continue to be pressured by rising health care and pension costs, which some of our competitors do not face. Kroger and the local unions, which represent many of our associates, have a shared objective, growing Kroger's business and profitably, which will help us create more jobs, incur opportunities and enhance job security for our associates.
I'd like to take a moment to highlight our $111 million commitment to the UFCW consolidated pension plan. This is part of an agreement to transfer the liabilities of 2 troubled multiemployer pension plans, which protects pensions already earned and will provide greater stability for future benefits of more than 6,500 Kroger associates and retirees. This is the latest in a series of steps we've taken during the last 4 years to provide greater stability of current and future benefits for Kroger associates and enhance the prospects for future returns while continuing to deliver strong shareholder value.
In 2012, we agreed to establish the UFCW consolidated pension plan by working with the unions to consolidate 4 multiemployer pension funds into one. That agreement protected benefits -- that agreement protected earned benefits and provide a greater stability of the future benefits of more than 65,000 Kroger associates.
In 2014, we announced similar agreements with 2 additional multiemployer pension funds. And in 2015, we accelerated contributions to the consolidated plan. We are proud of our ability to do this even in a tough operating environment. We intend to continue looking for opportunities to leverage our strong financial flexibility to safeguard associates' benefits, increase certainty and control over future benefit obligations and continuing to deliver strong shareholder value.
Turning now to our 2016 guidance. As a result of continued deflation, we lowered our net earnings guidance to a range of $2.03 to $2.13 per diluted share for 2016. Kroger's adjusted net earnings guidance range per share -- per diluted share for 2016 is $2.10 to $2.20, which excludes the $0.07 charge from the company's commitment to restructure certain pension obligations. The previous guidance range was $2.19 to $2.28, which did not anticipate the $0.07 charge from the company's commitment to restructure the pension obligations.
Shareholder return will be enhanced by a dividend that is expected to increase over time. For identical supermarket sales growth, excluding fuel, we expect the remainder of 2016 to be in the 50 basis point to 1.5% range, which is 1.4% to 1.8% for the full year. Finally, we now expect Kroger's full year FIFO operating margin in 2016, excluding fuel, to decline slightly compared to 2015 results.
Now I will turn it back to Rodney."

You can't just look at one particular area. So to say that there's something drastically different, I wouldn't define it as that.

And we really haven't seen drastic changes in that relative pricing in those basket of goods, and we haven't for a long period of time. The other thing, I think it's always incredibly important for us to remember, and this is as much inside the company as external, is the customer decides where to shop, and price is only one element of that decision on where to price. They also look at the fresh -- the quality of the fresh departments. What are the products that are being offered, what's the variety there. And then really a critical part is how do the associates engage and how are they treated and how long does it take to -- when you're in line and those elements. And we continue to make great progress on those elements, and our customers continue to tell us it's really important for them as they decide where to shop. And that's -- as you know, years ago, that's the reason we started the Customer 1st Strategy. It's also the reason why we continue to execute the Customer 1st Strategy. If you look at what's within it though, it has changed over time as customers change. So if you look at natural and organics, when we started the journey, natural and organics really wasn't a critical part of the product strategy. Today, it's incredibly important.

And the high inflation actually happened, as you referenced, in '08, and it also happened in '11. So to say that it's different in this time, I mean, each one of us would have our own opinions. An awful lot of deflation/inflation is driven by what's going on in commodity markets, and most of the commodity markets are incredibly benign at the moment. And historically, I always like to say high prices solve high prices and low prices solve low prices because capacity will start changing. And if you look at farmers, they're very smart, and they'll start producing less of the things that -- where they don't make money. So historically, that's what caused inflations to swing. And still an awful lot of our business is driven by the commodity markets. If you look at produce, that's just going to be driven by what's the growing season and what's the growing season like. We continue to see good demand. We still continue to see tonnage growth and those elements, and those are the things that we're looking at to see do we think it's different this time."

If you look at the items in the basket, that's always a tough one to answer because if you look at the items in the basket, we've been flat or up slightly or down slightly for a long period of time. The thing that's important to note is if you look at customers over a month, how do they spend with us, and they continue to spend 5 more items from us. And as we get better and better in our fresh departments, customers come in and shop our stores more often because on fresh products, people want to buy it. It's not quite to the European standards where people buy daily, but you'll see people increasingly coming into the store every 2 or 3 days to pick up their fresh items. And that affects the items in the basket. So I think it's always difficult to overlook it, to look too much at items in the basket, and we would focus much more in terms of, over a month, how our customer is behaving. In terms of the competitors, I don't know that there's too much I can add from what I -- Mike and I mentioned before. Overall, I wouldn't say that we're seeing a huge difference.

284342,381880935,1044343,"The Kroger Co., Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Sep 09, 2016",2016-09-09,"Earnings Calls","The Kroger Co.","Executives","Thank you, Kate. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. With me to review Kroger's second quarter results is Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Mike Schlotman.Our core business remains strong in the second quarter",1080,"Thank you, Kate. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. With me to review Kroger's second quarter results is Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Mike Schlotman.
Our core business remains strong in the second quarter as we continue to increase market share, improve tonnage and grow loyal households. As we often say, we are focused on the long-term performance over a 3- to 5-year horizon. We have the right strategy, the right people and the financial flexibility to execute our strategy, which allows us to continue investing in our associates, our business and grow market share.
By remaining focused on our strategy, we create long-term value for our shareholders. An example of staying on our strategy is continuing to add hours to support tonnage growth in a deflationary environment. This increases our cost as a rate of sales, but without this investment, the shopping experience, an important element of our Customer 1st Strategy, would be negatively affected.
The transition from inflation to deflation creates a difficult operating environment. We estimate that we had deflation without pharmacy of 1.25%, including 1.5% deflation in the grocery category. I want to stress that we've been through economic environments like this before.
In 2009, we transitioned from inflation to deflation in a very similar way. Of course, in 2009, we also had a much more difficult macroeconomic backdrop. Even though the current environment is volatile, we are confident that we will navigate today's challenges and continue to deliver value for our customers and shareholders.
While we've revised our identical supermarket sales growth and net earnings per diluted share guidance for the year, our growth objectives are on a 3- to 5-year rolling cycle, and we remain confident in those targets. We are in this long-term range run and not a 12-week cycle or particular year. We have demonstrated our ability to invest at the appropriate times to create momentum when the environment improves.
While we expect continued deflation and tough year-over-year comparisons for the remainder of the year and even into early next year, as we know from past experience, the environment won't be deflationary forever. Kroger's long-term focus is one of the reasons why our business continues to generate healthy free cash flow, which allow us to invest for the future and maintain financial flexibility to create shareholder value.
To this end, we have decided to allocate approximately $500 million less to capital investments for 2016 and for 2017, which will allow us the flexibility to return value in the near term.  This could include utilizing our current board-authorized $500 million share repurchase authority as market conditions provide the opportunity.
We often say that the only certain thing in retail is that it is always changing. This is certainly true for an ever-shifting customer preferences as well as the overall competitive environment. We believe one of the reasons for our continued success, regardless of the operating conditions or competition, is our ability to generate increasingly sophisticated customer insights.
Our team at 84.51° helps us figure out what customers want so we can provide highly informed strategic investments based on rigorous data analytics rather than simply reacting to competitors. Customer insights give us a big advantage in challenging environments like this one.
A lot of what we are seeing suggests a gradual tightening of budgets. Our customers tell us they are less confident about the economy now than they were 3 months ago, and they expect the economy to get worse in the next 3 months. We are as committed as ever to doing what is right for the customer.
Our team's execution of our Customer 1st Strategy helped deliver growth in loyal and total households, units and market share compared to last year. Customers continue to vote with their dollar, and on that basis, Kroger continues to win.
We believe that it is easier to steer a big ship when the waters are smooth. But when the water gets rough, the right people and the right strategy make all the difference. These are some of the same reasons why you should continue to believe in Kroger.
We are focused on the long term. We have the financial flexibility to execute our strategy, and we have the right people and the right strategy to weather any storm. Our merchandisers and operators are the best in the business. Our senior management team brings a great mix of new ideas and long tenure, propelling innovation while remaining steady at the helm.
Like any of the high-performance teams, the mindset of our leaders is agility and responsiveness to changing customer and economic dynamics. We remain focused on growing market share, and we'll continue to invest in our associates and our business, providing value to our customers, both today and for the future.
One example of our long-term focus is our recent merger between our specialty drug pharmacy, Axiom, and ModernHEALTH. The merger, which closed last Friday, further expands our presence in the high-growth specialty pharmacy area and connects nicely with our retail pharmacies and broader health and wellness strategy. We are excited to welcome ModernHEALTH's 500 associates to the Kroger family.
A second example of a long -- of our long-term focus is our progress integrating sustainable practices into our business operations. We believe that customers and associates increasingly make decisions based on how well companies take care of their people, their communities and the planet. So we are very pleased to share that Kroger has earned a spot on the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the fourth consecutive year. More than 600 companies in North America are evaluated each year, and only the top 20% are listed on the index. This recognition, of course, is only possible thanks to the thousands of individual activities our associates do on a daily basis in our stores, manufacturing and distribution facilities and offices.
Through all our growth initiatives, we strive for balance between our core business, beyond the core and innovation. This fundamental approach is how we'll continue to win with customers and create sustainable long-term value for shareholders.
I noted earlier that we operate our business on a 3- to 5-year rolling cycle. Over both time horizons, we have been performing consistently above our long-term net earnings per diluted share growth guidance of 8% to 11%, plus a growing dividend.
Now Mike will offer more detail on Kroger's second quarter financial results and discuss our guidance for the remainder of the year. Mike?"
284342,381880935,1044343,"The Kroger Co., Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Sep 09, 2016",2016-09-09,"Earnings Calls","The Kroger Co.","Executives","Thanks, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. As Rodney said, we've been through periods like this before, and we have the leaders and the strategy to continue delivering value to our customers, associates and shareholders. While the quarter and the year ar",1527,"Thanks, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. As Rodney said, we've been through periods like this before, and we have the leaders and the strategy to continue delivering value to our customers, associates and shareholders. While the quarter and the year aren't shaping up the way we expected, we continue to be well positioned for the long term.
We continue to see a strong flow of capital projects. We've tried to be very clear about our deliberate ramp-up of capital spending since 2012. As the management team, we recognize the environment and believe it is prudent to reduce capital investments, excluding mergers, acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities, to $3.6 billion to $3.9 billion for 2016 and 2017. This is still a substantial investment in the business.
Consistent with our long-term financial strategy, we're maintaining flexibility with our cash flow to invest in the business, repurchase shares and maintain a growing dividend. Our philosophy is to always create value for shareholders. And while our Customer 1st approach remains our distinctive business strategy, we implement multiple approaches to deliver shareholder value.
There are many gives and takes in any quarter and year, and we view our ability to adjust to return value to shareholders as the core strength of our financial strategy.
Identical supermarket sales without fuel came in at 1.7%, impacted by deflation across most departments, with the exception of produce and pharmacy. We are seeing significant deflation in milk, eggs and cheese. We will continue to focus on growing households, growing units and making sure we are delivering the right value proposition for our customers.
As Rodney pointed out, we continue to do all 3 of these things during the second quarter. That our team accomplished this in such a deflationary environment is no small feat and demonstrates that our associates continue to connect with customers in a personal and meaningful way.
As you know, a strength of our Customer 1st model is that we make regular investments in our people, products, shopping experience and price. As Rodney said, we added hours to keep up with unit growth, and we also continued our price investments as evidenced by our lower gross margin. We balance these investments based on the needs we see in the business to drive sustainable results over time.
Operating costs, excluding fuel, Roundy's and the pension agreements, were better by 6 basis points in the second quarter. A lower expected bonus is one driver of these results. We'll continue to focus on cost controls and use those savings to provide additional value to customers.
Now for an update on retail fuel. In the second quarter, the average retail price of a gallon of gas declined by $0.47 compared to last year. Our cents per gallon fuel margin was approximately $0.198 compared to $0.19 in the same quarter last year. On a rolling 4 quarters basis, we are at $0.184 this year compared to $0.186 last year. We expect this rolling 4-quarter comparison to further decline as we cycle some very strong margins for the rest of the year.
A variety of factors contributed to our net earnings per diluted share results in the second quarter. Deflation was clearly a headwind, and that was offset by a lower-than-expected affected income tax rate due to the adoption of a new accounting standard.
Our second quarter net earnings per diluted share on a GAAP basis was $0.40 compared to $0.44 during the same period last year. Our net earnings per diluted share results included charges related to the restructuring of certain pension obligations to help stabilize associates' future benefits. Excluding the effects of these charges, Kroger's adjusted net earnings were $454 million or $0.47 per diluted share.
Our integration with Roundy's continues to be on plan. We have 2 dedicated management teams, one for Roundy's in Wisconsin and one for Mariano's in Illinois, to take into account the uniqueness of the formats in each location. These leadership teams have a mix of Kroger and Roundy's experience. We are pleased with the early results of our Roundy's investments in Wisconsin, and we remain excited about this opportunity.
During the second quarter, corporate brands represented approximately 27% of total units sold and 26% of sales dollars, excluding fuel and pharmacy. Our corporate brands team continues to drive innovation in important categories.
Earlier this week, we launched a new, more affordable corporate brand line of cage-free eggs. As you may know that earlier this year, we committed to a 100% cage-free eggs supply chain by 2025. In order to reach that goal, we want to help customers shift from conventional eggs to the cage-free category. By offering a lower-price alternative to most other cage-free eggs on the market today, we believe our mainstream customers will begin to migrate to the cage-free category.
Our net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio increased to 2.11 compared to 2.02 during the second -- the same period last year. This result illustrates our commitment to use free cash flow to both grow our business and return cash to shareholders while maintaining an appropriate level of leverage for our credit rating. Over time, we would expect our net total debt to EBITDA ratio to grow if we continue to successfully negotiate restructuring of troubled multiemployer pension plan obligations to help stabilize associates' future benefits. We would not expect this increase to adversely affect our credit rating as the rating agencies already contemplate our multiemployer pension plan obligations, and the additional debt we would take on to fund these plans will be offset in a reduction of our off-balance sheet multiemployer pension plan obligations.
Over the last year, Kroger's used free cash flow to repurchase $1.1 billion of common shares, pay $406 million in dividends, invest $3.8 billion in capital and merge with Roundy's for $866 million. Return on invested capital for the second quarter was 13.95%, excluding Roundy's, compared to 14.24% for the second quarter of 2015. Our balance sheet is as strong as ever.
I will now provide a brief update on labor relations. We recently agreed to new contracts covering store associates in Little Rock, Nashville and Southern California. We are currently negotiating contracts with the UFCW for Fry's associates in Arizona and store associates in Michigan and Atlanta. We also negotiated a new contract with the Teamsters for our Roundy's distribution center.
Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive costs and compensation packages that provide solid wages, good quality, affordable health care and retirement benefits for our associates. Kroger's financial results continue to be pressured by rising health care and pension costs, which some of our competitors do not face. Kroger and the local unions, which represent many of our associates, have a shared objective, growing Kroger's business and profitably, which will help us create more jobs and career opportunities and enhance job security for our associates.
I'd like to take a moment to highlight our $111 million commitment to the UFCW consolidated pension plan. This is part of an agreement to transfer the liabilities of 2 troubled multiemployer pension plans, which protects pensions already earned and will provide greater stability for future benefits of more than 6,500 Kroger associates and retirees. This is the latest in a series of steps we've taken during the last 4 years to provide greater stability of current and future benefits for Kroger associates and enhance the prospects for future returns while continuing to deliver strong shareholder value.
In 2012, we agreed to establish the UFCW consolidated pension plan by working with the unions to consolidate 4 multiemployer pension funds into one. That agreement protected benefits -- that agreement protected earned benefits and provide a greater stability of the future benefits of more than 65,000 Kroger associates.
In 2014, we announced similar agreements with 2 additional multiemployer pension funds. And in 2015, we accelerated contributions to the consolidated plan. We are proud of our ability to do this even in a tough operating environment. We intend to continue looking for opportunities to leverage our strong financial flexibility to safeguard associates' benefits, increase certainty and control over future benefit obligations and continuing to deliver strong shareholder value.
Turning now to our 2016 guidance. As a result of continued deflation, we lowered our net earnings guidance to a range of $2.03 to $2.13 per diluted share for 2016. Kroger's adjusted net earnings guidance range per share -- per diluted share for 2016 is $2.10 to $2.20, which excludes the $0.07 charge from the company's commitment to restructure certain pension obligations. The previous guidance range was $2.19 to $2.28, which did not anticipate the $0.07 charge from the company's commitment to restructure the pension obligations.
Shareholder return will be enhanced by a dividend that is expected to increase over time. For identical supermarket sales growth, excluding fuel, we expect the remainder of 2016 to be in the 50 basis point to 1.5% range, which is 1.4% to 1.8% for the full year. Finally, we now expect Kroger's full year FIFO operating margin in 2016, excluding fuel, to decline slightly compared to 2015 results.
Now I will turn it back to Rodney."

You can't just look at one particular area. So to say that there's something drastically different, I wouldn't define it as that.

And we really haven't seen drastic changes in that relative pricing in those basket of goods, and we haven't for a long period of time. The other thing, I think it's always incredibly important for us to remember, and this is as much inside the company as external, is the customer decides where to shop, and price is only one element of that decision on where to price. They also look at the fresh -- the quality of the fresh departments. What are the products that are being offered, what's the variety there. And then a really critical part is how do the associates engage and how are they treated and how long does it take to -- when you're in line and those elements. And we continue to make great progress on those elements, and our customers continue to tell us it's really important for them as they decide where to shop. And that's -- as you know, years ago, that's the reason we started the Customer 1st Strategy. It's also the reason why we continue to execute the Customer 1st Strategy.

And the high inflation actually happened, as you referenced, in '08, and it also happened in '11. So to say that it's different this time, I mean, each one of us would have our own opinions. An awful lot of deflation/inflation is driven by what's going on in commodity markets, and most of the commodity markets are incredibly benign at the moment. And historically, I always like to say high prices solve high prices and low prices solve low prices because capacity will start changing. And if you look at farmers, they're very smart, and they'll start producing less of the things that -- where they don't make money. So historically, that's what caused inflations to swing. And still an awful lot of our business is driven by the commodity markets. If you look at produce, that's just going to be driven by what's the growing season and what's the growing season like. We continue to see good demand. We still continue to see tonnage growth and those elements, and those are the things that we're looking at to see do we think it's different this time."

On terms of moderating, as you get toward the latter part of the year and early next year, you're starting to cycle the deflation. So I would -- certainly, we would guess that it would start to moderate just because you're starting to cycle some of the deflation. And an awful lot of the deflation is driven because of commodity pricing. And that would be the reason why -- that we would believe that it would start moderating.

If you look at the items in the basket, that's always a tough one to answer because if you look at the items in the basket, we've been flat or up slightly or down slightly for a long period of time. The thing that's important to note is if you look at customers over a month, how do they spend with us, and they continue to spend 5 more items from us. And as we get better and better in our fresh departments, customers come in and shop our stores more often because on fresh products, people want to buy it. It's not quite to the European standards where people buy daily, but you'll see people increasingly coming into the store every 2 or 3 days to pick up their fresh items. And that affects the items in the basket. So I think it's always difficult to overlook it, to look too much at items in the basket, and we would focus much more in terms of, over a month, how our customer is behaving.

284342,381880935,1044471,"The Kroger Co., Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Sep 09, 2016",2016-09-09,"Earnings Calls","The Kroger Co.","Executives","Thank you, Kate. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. With me to review Kroger's second quarter results is Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Mike Schlotman.Our core business remains strong in the second quarter",1080,"Thank you, Kate. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. With me to review Kroger's second quarter results is Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Mike Schlotman.
Our core business remains strong in the second quarter as we continue to increase market share, improve tonnage and grow loyal households. As we often say, we are focused on the long-term performance over a 3- to 5-year horizon. We have the right strategy, the right people and the financial flexibility to execute our strategy, which allows us to continue investing in our associates, our business and grow market share.
By remaining focused on our strategy, we create long-term value for our shareholders. An example of staying on our strategy is continuing to add hours to support tonnage growth in a deflationary environment. This increases our cost as a rate of sales, but without this investment, the shopping experience, an important element of our Customer 1st Strategy, would be negatively affected.
The transition from inflation to deflation creates a difficult operating environment. We estimate that we had deflation without pharmacy of 1.25%, including 1.5% deflation in the grocery category. I want to stress that we've been through economic environments like this before.
In 2009, we transitioned from inflation to deflation in a very similar way. Of course, in 2009, we also had a much more difficult macroeconomic backdrop. Even though the current environment is volatile, we are confident that we will navigate today's challenges and continue to deliver value for our customers and shareholders.
While we've revised our identical supermarket sales growth and net earnings per diluted share guidance for the year, our growth objectives are on a 3- to 5-year rolling cycle, and we remain confident in those targets. We are in this long-term range run and not a 12-week cycle or particular year. We have demonstrated our ability to invest at the appropriate times to create momentum when the environment improves.
While we expect continued deflation and tough year-over-year comparisons for the remainder of the year and even into early next year, as we know from past experience, the environment won't be deflationary forever. Kroger's long-term focus is one of the reasons why our business continues to generate healthy free cash flow, which allow us to invest for the future and maintain financial flexibility to create shareholder value.
To this end, we have decided to allocate approximately $500 million less to capital investments for 2016 and for 2017, which will allow us the flexibility to return value in the near term.  This could include utilizing our current board-authorized $500 million share repurchase authority as market conditions provide the opportunity.
We often say that the only certain thing in retail is that it is always changing. This is certainly true for an ever-shifting customer preferences as well as the overall competitive environment. We believe one of the reasons for our continued success, regardless of the operating conditions or competition, is our ability to generate increasingly sophisticated customer insights.
Our team at 84.51° helps us figure out what customers want so we can provide highly informed strategic investments based on rigorous data analytics rather than simply reacting to competitors. Customer insights give us a big advantage in challenging environments like this one.
A lot of what we are seeing suggests a gradual tightening of budgets. Our customers tell us they are less confident about the economy now than they were 3 months ago, and they expect the economy to get worse in the next 3 months. We are as committed as ever to doing what is right for the customer.
Our team's execution of our Customer 1st Strategy helped deliver growth in loyal and total households, units and market share compared to last year. Customers continue to vote with their dollar, and on that basis, Kroger continues to win.
We believe that it is easier to steer a big ship when the waters are smooth. But when the water gets rough, the right people and the right strategy make all the difference. These are some of the same reasons why you should continue to believe in Kroger.
We are focused on the long term. We have the financial flexibility to execute our strategy, and we have the right people and the right strategy to weather any storm. Our merchandisers and operators are the best in the business. Our senior management team brings a great mix of new ideas and long tenure, propelling innovation while remaining steady at the helm.
Like any of the high-performance teams, the mindset of our leaders is agility and responsiveness to changing customer and economic dynamics. We remain focused on growing market share, and we'll continue to invest in our associates and our business, providing value to our customers, both today and for the future.
One example of our long-term focus is our recent merger between our specialty drug pharmacy, Axiom, and ModernHEALTH. The merger, which closed last Friday, further expands our presence in the high-growth specialty pharmacy area and connects nicely with our retail pharmacies and broader health and wellness strategy. We are excited to welcome ModernHEALTH's 500 associates to the Kroger family.
A second example of a long -- of our long-term focus is our progress integrating sustainable practices into our business operations. We believe that customers and associates increasingly make decisions based on how well companies take care of their people, their communities and the planet. So we are very pleased to share that Kroger has earned a spot on the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the fourth consecutive year. More than 600 companies in North America are evaluated each year, and only the top 20% are listed on the index. This recognition, of course, is only possible thanks to the thousands of individual activities our associates do on a daily basis in our stores, manufacturing and distribution facilities and offices.
Through all our growth initiatives, we strive for balance between our core business, beyond the core and innovation. This fundamental approach is how we'll continue to win with customers and create sustainable long-term value for shareholders.
I noted earlier that we operate our business on a 3- to 5-year rolling cycle. Over both time horizons, we have been performing consistently above our long-term net earnings per diluted share growth guidance of 8% to 11%, plus a growing dividend.
Now Mike will offer more detail on Kroger's second quarter financial results and discuss our guidance for the remainder of the year. Mike?"
284342,381880935,1044471,"The Kroger Co., Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Sep 09, 2016",2016-09-09,"Earnings Calls","The Kroger Co.","Executives","Thanks, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. As Rodney said, we've been through periods like this before, and we have the leaders and the strategy to continue delivering value to our customers, associates and shareholders. While the quarter and the year ar",1527,"Thanks, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. As Rodney said, we've been through periods like this before, and we have the leaders and the strategy to continue delivering value to our customers, associates and shareholders. While the quarter and the year aren't shaping up the way we expected, we continue to be well positioned for the long term.
We continue to see a strong flow of capital projects. We've tried to be very clear about our deliberate ramp-up of capital spending since 2012. As the management team, we recognize the environment and believe it is prudent to reduce capital investments, excluding mergers, acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities, to $3.6 billion to $3.9 billion for 2016 and 2017. This is still a substantial investment in the business.
Consistent with our long-term financial strategy, we're maintaining flexibility with our cash flow to invest in the business, repurchase shares and maintain a growing dividend. Our philosophy is to always create value for shareholders. And while our Customer 1st approach remains our distinctive business strategy, we implement multiple approaches to deliver shareholder value.
There are many gives and takes in any quarter and year, and we view our ability to adjust to return value to shareholders as the core strength of our financial strategy.
Identical supermarket sales without fuel came in at 1.7%, impacted by deflation across most departments, with the exception of produce and pharmacy. We are seeing significant deflation in milk, eggs and cheese. We will continue to focus on growing households, growing units and making sure we are delivering the right value proposition for our customers.
As Rodney pointed out, we continue to do all 3 of these things during the second quarter. That our team accomplished this in such a deflationary environment is no small feat and demonstrates that our associates continue to connect with customers in a personal and meaningful way.
As you know, a strength of our Customer 1st model is that we make regular investments in our people, products, shopping experience and price. As Rodney said, we added hours to keep up with unit growth, and we also continued our price investments as evidenced by our lower gross margin. We balance these investments based on the needs we see in the business to drive sustainable results over time.
Operating costs, excluding fuel, Roundy's and the pension agreements, were better by 6 basis points in the second quarter. A lower expected bonus is one driver of these results. We'll continue to focus on cost controls and use those savings to provide additional value to customers.
Now for an update on retail fuel. In the second quarter, the average retail price of a gallon of gas declined by $0.47 compared to last year. Our cents per gallon fuel margin was approximately $0.198 compared to $0.19 in the same quarter last year. On a rolling 4 quarters basis, we are at $0.184 this year compared to $0.186 last year. We expect this rolling 4-quarter comparison to further decline as we cycle some very strong margins for the rest of the year.
A variety of factors contributed to our net earnings per diluted share results in the second quarter. Deflation was clearly a headwind, and that was offset by a lower-than-expected affected income tax rate due to the adoption of a new accounting standard.
Our second quarter net earnings per diluted share on a GAAP basis was $0.40 compared to $0.44 during the same period last year. Our net earnings per diluted share results included charges related to the restructuring of certain pension obligations to help stabilize associates' future benefits. Excluding the effects of these charges, Kroger's adjusted net earnings were $454 million or $0.47 per diluted share.
Our integration with Roundy's continues to be on plan. We have 2 dedicated management teams, one for Roundy's in Wisconsin and one for Mariano's in Illinois, to take into account the uniqueness of the formats in each location. These leadership teams have a mix of Kroger and Roundy's experience. We are pleased with the early results of our Roundy's investments in Wisconsin, and we remain excited about this opportunity.
During the second quarter, corporate brands represented approximately 27% of total units sold and 26% of sales dollars, excluding fuel and pharmacy. Our corporate brands team continues to drive innovation in important categories.
Earlier this week, we launched a new, more affordable corporate brand line of cage-free eggs. As you may know that earlier this year, we committed to a 100% cage-free eggs supply chain by 2025. In order to reach that goal, we want to help customers shift from conventional eggs to the cage-free category. By offering a lower-price alternative to most other cage-free eggs on the market today, we believe our mainstream customers will begin to migrate to the cage-free category.
Our net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio increased to 2.11 compared to 2.02 during the second -- the same period last year. This result illustrates our commitment to use free cash flow to both grow our business and return cash to shareholders while maintaining an appropriate level of leverage for our credit rating. Over time, we would expect our net total debt to EBITDA ratio to grow if we continue to successfully negotiate restructuring of troubled multiemployer pension plan obligations to help stabilize associates' future benefits. We would not expect this increase to adversely affect our credit rating as the rating agencies already contemplate our multiemployer pension plan obligations, and the additional debt we would take on to fund these plans will be offset in a reduction of our off-balance sheet multiemployer pension plan obligations.
Over the last year, Kroger's used free cash flow to repurchase $1.1 billion of common shares, pay $406 million in dividends, invest $3.8 billion in capital and merge with Roundy's for $866 million. Return on invested capital for the second quarter was 13.95%, excluding Roundy's, compared to 14.24% for the second quarter of 2015. Our balance sheet is as strong as ever.
I will now provide a brief update on labor relations. We recently agreed to new contracts covering store associates in Little Rock, Nashville and Southern California. We are currently negotiating contracts with the UFCW for Fry's associates in Arizona and store associates in Michigan and Atlanta. We also negotiated a new contract with the Teamsters for our Roundy's distribution center.
Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive costs and compensation packages that provide solid wages, good quality, affordable health care and retirement benefits for our associates. Kroger's financial results continue to be pressured by rising health care and pension costs, which some of our competitors do not face. Kroger and the local unions, which represent many of our associates, have a shared objective, growing Kroger's business and profitably, which will help us create more jobs and career opportunities and enhance job security for our associates.
I'd like to take a moment to highlight our $111 million commitment to the UFCW consolidated pension plan. This is part of an agreement to transfer the liabilities of 2 troubled multiemployer pension plans, which protects pensions already earned and will provide greater stability for future benefits of more than 6,500 Kroger associates and retirees. This is the latest in a series of steps we've taken during the last 4 years to provide greater stability of current and future benefits for Kroger associates and enhance the prospects for future returns while continuing to deliver strong shareholder value.
In 2012, we agreed to establish the UFCW consolidated pension plan by working with the unions to consolidate 4 multiemployer pension funds into one. That agreement protected benefits -- that agreement protected earned benefits and provide a greater stability of the future benefits of more than 65,000 Kroger associates.
In 2014, we announced similar agreements with 2 additional multiemployer pension funds. And in 2015, we accelerated contributions to the consolidated plan. We are proud of our ability to do this even in a tough operating environment. We intend to continue looking for opportunities to leverage our strong financial flexibility to safeguard associates' benefits, increase certainty and control over future benefit obligations and continuing to deliver strong shareholder value.
Turning now to our 2016 guidance. As a result of continued deflation, we lowered our net earnings guidance to a range of $2.03 to $2.13 per diluted share for 2016. Kroger's adjusted net earnings guidance range per share -- per diluted share for 2016 is $2.10 to $2.20, which excludes the $0.07 charge from the company's commitment to restructure certain pension obligations. The previous guidance range was $2.19 to $2.28, which did not anticipate the $0.07 charge from the company's commitment to restructure the pension obligations.
Shareholder return will be enhanced by a dividend that is expected to increase over time. For identical supermarket sales growth, excluding fuel, we expect the remainder of 2016 to be in the 50 basis point to 1.5% range, which is 1.4% to 1.8% for the full year. Finally, we now expect Kroger's full year FIFO operating margin in 2016, excluding fuel, to decline slightly compared to 2015 results.
Now I will turn it back to Rodney."

And we really haven't seen drastic changes in that relative pricing in those basket of goods, and we haven't for a long period of time. The other thing, I think it's always incredibly important for us to remember, and this is as much inside the company as external, is the customer decides where to shop, and price is only one element of that decision on where to price. They also look at the fresh -- the quality of the fresh departments. What are the products that are being offered, what's the variety there. And then a really critical part is how do the associates engage and how are they treated and how long does it take to -- when you're in line and those elements. And we continue to make great progress on those elements, and our customers continue to tell us it's really important for them as they decide where to shop.

And the high inflation actually happened, as you referenced, in '08, and it also happened in '11. So to say that it's different this time, I mean, each one of us would have our own opinions. An awful lot of deflation/inflation is driven by what's going on in commodity markets, and most of the commodity markets are incredibly benign at the moment. And historically, I always like to say high prices solve high prices and low prices solve low prices because capacity will start changing. And if you look at farmers, they're very smart, and they'll start producing less of the things that -- where they don't make money. So historically, that's what caused inflations to swing. And still an awful lot of our business is driven by the commodity markets. If you look at produce, that's just going to be driven by what's the growing season and what's the growing season like.

If you look at the items in the basket, that's always a tough one to answer because if you look at the items in the basket, we've been flat or up slightly or down slightly for a long period of time. The thing that's important to note is if you look at customers over a month, how do they spend with us, and they continue to spend 5 more items from us. And as we get better and better in our fresh departments, customers come in and shop our stores more often because on fresh products, people want to buy it. It's not quite to the European standards where people buy daily, but you'll see people increasingly coming into the store every 2 or 3 days to pick up their fresh items. And that affects the items in the basket. So I think it's always difficult to overlook it, to look too much at items in the basket, and we would focus much more in terms of, over a month, how our customer is behaving.

To start, I want to say how -- that I'm proud of our associates for their continuing objective in connecting with our customers in a very difficult operating environment. Their efforts helped us grow both total households and loyal households during the third quarter. As expected, deflation persisted during the third quarter. And as we've said before, transition periods create a difficult operating environment. This is the third time we've had deflation in 30 years. And in previous instances, deflation lasted from 3 to 5 quarters in a row. We're in a middle -- in the middle of a cycle right now, and it's not fun. Still, our tonnage continues to grow. Our total market share continues to expand, and we're focused on executing our strategy. 
A silver lining of deflationary environments is that it reveals to us how we can run our business better by shining a light on areas we can improve. It is really tough when you're in it, but we'll be in a position to benefit from changes we're making today once we're out of this cycle. We are firmly focused on our long-term strategy of improving our connection with customers and associates and continuing to work on process changes to lower costs. 
We don't change our strategy based on quarterly swings in results. We remain committed to delivering on our long-term earnings per share growth rate target of 8% to 11%, plus an increasing dividend on a 3- to 5-year time horizon. We will continue to try to win every customer meal by driving our strategy and reacting appropriately to the environment.
Looking at the broader economy and the customer shopping behavior, what we're seeing is mixed. Typically, our data shows our customers' economic concerns mirror what they see in the headlines. For example, health care costs continue to be a worry for customers. Consumer confidence retreated during the quarter, with customers telling us they expect the economy to get worse in the next 3 months. It's important to remember this survey was completed in October, and it's too early to say what the mood of our customers is since then.
Natural, organic and health and wellness continue to be a food megatrend, and we're riding these trends well. Our natural and organic sales continued to outpace total sales growth. Simple Truth continued its strong double-digit growth. Simple Truth organic kombucha is a very -- is very popular as more customers focus on digestive health. We've also recently launched a 24-pack Simple Truth vapor distilled water with electrolytes. It's priced fantastically, it's a great product, and it's selling really well. Our produce, fresh-prepared and deli package departments, sushi, Starbucks, wine and liquor sales all saw comparatively strong growth during the quarter as well. If you can drink it or snack on it, it's selling. 
A few on-trend examples are protein snacks such as Simple Truth -- Private Selection and Simple Truth paninos [ph], which are imported cured meats wrapped around a creamy cheese as well as handcrafted and real sugar sodas. 
As I said at our investor conference here in Cincinnati 4 weeks ago, Kroger's earnings growth has outpaced our peers over both the last 5 years and last 10 years, and we still see incredible growth potential as we look forward. We can clearly identify where we have 100 plus billion in market share growth opportunities in our existing markets alone. 
But good enough today won't be good enough tomorrow. That is why we're both embracing change and accelerating change. For example, 84.51° is helping us spot trends and create unique customer experiences to drive growth. We continue to focus on solving customer needs on their terms. We now offer ClickList in more than 550 stores. That is 50 more locations than we were operating just 4 weeks ago. We're connecting with tens of millions of customers digitally, online and through our mobile app. Customers have now downloaded more than 3.5 billion digital offers. 
We know that the typical customer eats 35 to 45 times per week. Increasingly, we are positioning ourselves to solve for all of those meals or snacks in addition to our historical model of solving for meals at home. We've built a strong Customer 1st foundation over the last 15 years, upon which we can confidently accelerate change. In doing so, we can deliver even better results for our customers, associates and shareholders. 
Now Mike will offer more detail on Kroger's third quarter financial results and discuss our guidance for the fourth quarter and 2017. Mike?"
284342,410104275,1095428,"The Kroger Co., Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Dec 01, 2016",2016-12-01,"Earnings Calls","The Kroger Co.","Executives","Thanks, Rodney, and once again, good morning, everyone. I want to also thank our associates for their hard work and focus on connecting with customers. As a result, both household and unit growth were up during the quarter as was market share. As we said",1172,"Thanks, Rodney, and once again, good morning, everyone. I want to also thank our associates for their hard work and focus on connecting with customers. As a result, both household and unit growth were up during the quarter as was market share. As we said at the investor conference, the last 2 weeks of the quarter would drive our identical supermarket sales results, and our IDs came in at the low end of our expectations for the quarter. 
Deflation has not only persisted, but has increased with overall deflation, excluding pharmacy, growing from 1.3% in the second quarter to 1.5% in the third quarter. Additionally, pharmacy inflation declined 130 basis points to 3.3% during the third quarter. 
Over the last 4 quarters, we have relocated or expanded 49 strong performing stores. This takes them out of our identical supermarket sales calculation. Further, we have opened 42 new stores over the same time frame. Both of these create a headwind to identical food store sales. By way of comparison, last year, there were 19 new stores opened that affected nearby stores. Operating costs, excluding fuel, Roundy's and an $80 million contribution to the UFCW consolidated pension plan in third quarter of 2015, grew by 19 basis points, of which 15 basis points were related to depreciation due to increases in our capital program. 
We can clearly do better, and we're redoubling our efforts to reduce these costs as a rate of sales over time. While the environment is difficult, managing operating expenses is something that is in our control. Our Customer 1st strategy is funded by saving costs in areas of the business that customers don't see in order to return value to our customers in the form of lower prices on products that they want, improved service and the shopping experience that makes them want to return. We are and will continue to look at a variety of options to improve processes and lower costs as a rate of sales in a strategic and conscientious way. 
Now for an update on retail fuel. In the third quarter, our cents per gallon fuel margin was approximately 17.9 cents compared to 23.8 cents in the same quarter last year. On a rolling 4 quarters basis, we were at $0.17 this year compared to 18.8 cents last year. 
During the third quarter, corporate brands represented approximately 28.1% of total units sold and 25.5% of sales dollars, excluding fuel and pharmacy. As Rodney said earlier, Simple Truth continues to have an impressive growth rate. 
Our net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio increased to 2.35 compared to 1.99 during the same period last year. This is a result -- this result is due to the mergers with ModernHEALTH and Roundy's Inc. At year-end, Kroger expects net total debt to adjusted EBITDA to be near the high end of the company's targeted range of 2 to 2.2x. It's worth noting that over longer-time horizon, we do expect our net total debt to EBITDA ratio to grow if we continually -- if we continue to successfully negotiate restructuring a troubled multiemployer pension plan obligations to help stabilize associates' future benefits, as we did in the second quarter. We would not expect this increase to adversely affect our credit rating, as the rating agencies already factor in our multiemployer pension plan obligations in their evaluations of our credit rating. When we take on additional debt to fund these plans, this reduces the off-balance-sheet amount of our estimated multiemployer pension plan obligations. 
Over the last 4 quarters, Kroger has used cash to repurchase $1.4 billion in common shares, pay $418 million in dividends, invest $3.8 billion in capital, in line with our commitment to reduce planned capital expenditures for the year, merged with Roundy's for $866 million and merged with ModernHEALTH for approximately $390 million. 
The flexibility to return value to shareholders is a core strength of our financial strategy. Return on invested capital for the third quarter was 13.63, excluding Roundy's, compared to 14.16 in the third quarter of 2015. 
I will now provide a brief update on labor relations. We recently agreed to a new contract with UFCW, covering Fry's associates in Arizona. We are currently negotiating contracts governing store associates in Atlanta, Michigan and North Carolina. And we are also negotiating a new contract with the Teamsters for our Roundy's distribution center. Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive costs and compensation packages that provide solid wages, good quality, affordable health care and retirement benefits for our associates. Kroger's financial results continue to be pressured by rising health care and pension costs, which some of our competitors do not face. Kroger continues to communicate with our local unions, which represent many of our associates, the importance of growing Kroger's business and profitability, which will help us create more jobs, incur opportunities and enhance job security for our associates.
Turning now to our guidance for the remainder of the year. We narrowed our net earnings guidance to a range of $2.03 to $2.08 per diluted share for 2016. The previous guidance was $2.03 to $2.13. On an adjusted net earnings guidance range per diluted share for the year, it's $2.10 to $2.15, which excludes the $0.07 charge from the company's commitment to restructure certain multiemployer pension plan obligations in the second quarter. The previous adjusted guidance range was $2.10 to $2.20. 
For the fourth quarter of 2016, Kroger expects slightly positive identical supermarket sales growth excluding fuel. The persistent and increasing deflation has caused us to adjust our view of identical store sales for the fourth quarter. 
We continue to expect capital investments of $3.6 billion to $3.9 billion for the year, excluding mergers, acquisitions and purchases of lease facilities. And we expect Kroger's full year FIFO operating margin in 2016, excluding fuel, to decline compared to 2015 results. 
Finally, I want to take a moment to look ahead to 2017. We're completing our business plan process for 2017 now, and we'll provide specific guidance in March as we normally do. We anticipate both positive identical supermarket sales and net earnings per diluted share growth, excluding the 53rd week. Net earnings growth will likely be below the low end of the company's 8% to 11% net earnings per diluted share long-term growth rate guidance. 
We expect the operating environment in the first half of 2017 to be similar today. The second half of 2017 should show improvement as we cycle the current environment. As you know, we define long term as over a 3- to 5-year time horizon, and we are committed to achieving our net earnings per diluted share growth rate guidance of 8% to 11% plus a growing dividend. 
We expect 2017 capital investments of $3.6 billion to $3.9 billion, excluding mergers, acquisitions and purchases of lease facilities. We will continue to make investments to reward our customers, and we'll increase our intensity in finding cost savings for these investments. 
Now I will turn it back to Rodney."

Milk and cheese looks like it may be bottoming, but that doesn't mean things turn around on a dime as raw material input costs change. There's usually a lag from the bottom and a slight blip up on those costs until you start to see any effect on retail pricing. So we would expect this to persist. Some of that is just based on the last 2 cycles of inflation and deflation we've had. We have a 5-year rolling average chart that we look at a lot. if you think about the waves on where that happens within inflation and deflation, this cycle looks very similar to the last couple, maybe a little closer to '02 versus '09, which was a little bit more persistent, but that's what in the back of our minds."

And when you think about $23 billion [ph] a quarter in ID sales, so $1 billion to $1.5 billion a week, the potential for a couple of days to move by $20 million is very real. You've all heard me at different times talk about -- if you saw our daily sales when counter shifts and holiday shifts, you would understand why grocers get gray hair early in their careers. And those kinds of things just happen, it's a big effect. The effect of milk, eggs and cheese continue to be big. It's a big headwind to ID sales this year versus last year, a meaningful percentage. I won't necessarily give the exact amount, but it's a meaningful amount. Rodney's shrugging his shoulders. So it's as much as 50 basis points effect to ID sales in the quarter, those 3 commodities because of deflation this year versus last year. So these kinds of things are real. You've often heard us talk about milk being elastic when there's deflation. When it's deflation on deflation, elasticity happens when you first break that $2 barrier and then demand flattens out.

The number's a little bit difficult to interpret this quarter because of the fact of dairy complex because such a high percentage of the dairy complex is corporate brands. The other thing that's the new there is a fresh mix. You heard Rodney talk a lot about being on top of the foodie trends and snacking and things like that. Those departments do come with a higher gross margin mix now. Their contribution to overhead or their operating profit may not be as strong as other departments because there's a lot of labor cost and more shrink in those categories and more fixed costs like electricity and things like that. So it's a combination of all those leading to it. Rest assured, we do continue to invest in price and continue to drive value to our customers.

You also see some of that ClickList in categories that customers are finding convenient to buy bigger packs because they don't have to fill up their cart with it. We do that for them and put that in their trunk. So they may be buying a 12-pack of paper towels instead of a 4-pack of paper towels, because they don't have to worry about space in the car. As long as their trunk can hold it, it's okay. we continues to be pleased with our tonnage growth. It's something we know that's the fundamental piece of what is core to our business."

Some of the business is incremental. it's a reasonably high range when you look across the company. If you look at the financial performance, it's a headwind initially. If you go back and look at some of the original locations that Harris Teeter before we merged, it becomes where you're indifferent whether somebody shops via ClickList or in the store.

The cycle coming out would be driven by what caused you to go in and how do you end up coming out of it. Everything that we could see, the reason why we would expect today would be a modest increase once we cycle on the other side of it is most of it is supply-oriented. So if you look at 2008 and 2009, it was as much driven by the economy and all going on. If you look at 2002, it was more supply driven because there was a lot of supply in the market. unless there would just be a terrible crop year in '17, we would expect this to look much more like 2002. Remember, once, and Mike talked about it a little bit on dairy, if you have $3 a gallon milk and it goes to $2 a gallon milk, when you cycle that the next year and milk is still at $2 a gallon, you're cycling $2 on $2 versus $2 on $3.

We said we were near it, and it's actually -- in our original guidance for that, we expect that the third quarter to not get to the low end, but the fourth quarter to be above the low end to bring us inside that range. And we didn't end up the third quarter drastically different than we did. And I think maybe it was my communication skills back on November 2, and people hearing that we're near the low end, just assuming that you're at the low end. I go back, it takes $20 million in a quarter to move ID sales by 10 basis points. So the fluctuations when you're in this range, if I missed those 4 days that were left by $20 million, that cuts my ID sales in half if I was at 20 basis points.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today.

Their e",768,"Thank you, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. To start, I want to say how -- that I'm proud of our associates for their continuing objective in connecting with our customers in a very difficult operating environment. Their efforts helped us grow both total households and loyal households during the third quarter. As expected, deflation persisted during the third quarter. And as we've said before, transition periods create a difficult operating environment. This is the third time we've had deflation in 30 years. And in previous instances, deflation lasted from 3 to 5 quarters in a row. We're in a middle -- in the middle of a cycle right now, and it's not fun. Still, our tonnage continues to grow. Our total market share continues to expand, and we're focused on executing our strategy. 
A silver lining of deflationary environments is that it reveals to us how we can run our business better by shining a light on areas we can improve. It is really tough when you're in it, but we'll be in a position to benefit from changes we're making today once we're out of this cycle. We are firmly focused on our long-term strategy of improving our connection with customers and associates and continuing to work on process changes to lower costs. 
We don't change our strategy based on quarterly swings in results. We remain committed to delivering on our long-term earnings per share growth rate target of 8% to 11%, plus an increasing dividend on a 3- to 5-year time horizon. We will continue to try to win every customer meal by driving our strategy and reacting appropriately to the environment.
Looking at the broader economy and the customer shopping behavior, what we're seeing is mixed. Typically, our data shows our customers' economic concerns mirror what they see in the headlines. For example, health care costs continue to be a worry for customers. Consumer confidence retreated during the quarter, with customers telling us they expect the economy to get worse in the next 3 months. It's important to remember this survey was completed in October, and it's too early to say what the mood of our customers is since then.
Natural, organic and health and wellness continue to be a food megatrend, and we're riding these trends well. Our natural and organic sales continued to outpace total sales growth. Simple Truth continued its strong double-digit growth. Simple Truth organic kombucha is a very -- is very popular as more customers focus on digestive health. We've also recently launched a 24-pack Simple Truth vapor distilled water with electrolytes. It's priced fantastically, it's a great product, and it's selling really well. Our produce, fresh-prepared and deli package departments, sushi, Starbucks, wine and liquor sales all saw comparatively strong growth during the quarter as well. If you can drink it or snack on it, it's selling. 
A few on-trend examples are protein snacks such as Simple Truth -- Private Selection and Simple Truth paninos, which are imported cured meats wrapped around a creamy cheese as well as handcrafted and real sugar sodas. 
As I said at our investor conference here in Cincinnati 4 weeks ago, Kroger's earnings growth has outpaced our peers over both the last 5 years and last 10 years, and we still see incredible growth potential as we look forward. We can clearly identify where we have 100 plus billion in market share growth opportunities in our existing markets alone. 
But good enough today won't be good enough tomorrow. That is why we're both embracing change and accelerating change. For example, 84.51° is helping us spot trends and create unique customer experiences to drive growth. We continue to focus on solving customer needs on their terms. We now offer ClickList in more than 550 stores. That is 50 more locations than we were operating just 4 weeks ago. We're connecting with tens of millions of customers digitally, online and through our mobile app. Customers have now downloaded more than 3.5 billion digital offers. 
We know that the typical customer eats 35 to 45 times per week. Increasingly, we are positioning ourselves to solve for all of those meals or snacks in addition to our historical model of solving for meals at home. We've built a strong Customer 1st foundation over the last 15 years, upon which we can confidently accelerate change. In doing so, we can deliver even better results for our customers, associates and shareholders. 
Now Mike will offer more detail on Kroger's third quarter financial results and discuss our guidance for the fourth quarter and 2017. Mike?"
284342,410104275,1095573,"The Kroger Co., Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Dec 01, 2016",2016-12-01,"Earnings Calls","The Kroger Co.","Executives","Thanks, Rodney, and once again, good morning, everyone. I want to also thank our associates for their hard work and focus on connecting with customers. As a result, both household and unit growth were up during the quarter as was market share. As we said",1172,"Thanks, Rodney, and once again, good morning, everyone. I want to also thank our associates for their hard work and focus on connecting with customers. As a result, both household and unit growth were up during the quarter as was market share. As we said at the investor conference, the last 2 weeks of the quarter would drive our identical supermarket sales results, and our IDs came in at the low end of our expectations for the quarter. 
Deflation has not only persisted, but has increased with overall deflation, excluding pharmacy, growing from 1.3% in the second quarter to 1.5% in the third quarter. Additionally, pharmacy inflation declined 130 basis points to 3.3% during the third quarter. 
Over the last 4 quarters, we have relocated or expanded 49 strong performing stores. This takes them out of our identical supermarket sales calculation. Further, we have opened 42 new stores over the same time frame. Both of these create a headwind to identical food store sales. By way of comparison, last year, there were 19 new stores opened that affected nearby stores. Operating costs, excluding fuel, Roundy's and an $80 million contribution to the UFCW consolidated pension plan in third quarter of 2015, grew by 19 basis points, of which 15 basis points were related to depreciation due to increases in our capital program. 
We can clearly do better, and we're redoubling our efforts to reduce these costs as a rate of sales over time. While the environment is difficult, managing operating expenses is something that is in our control. Our Customer 1st strategy is funded by saving costs in areas of the business that customers don't see in order to return value to our customers in the form of lower prices on products that they want, improved service and the shopping experience that makes them want to return. We are and will continue to look at a variety of options to improve processes and lower costs as a rate of sales in a strategic and conscientious way. 
Now for an update on retail fuel. In the third quarter, our cents per gallon fuel margin was approximately 17.9 cents compared to 23.8 cents in the same quarter last year. On a rolling 4 quarters basis, we were at $0.17 this year compared to 18.8 cents last year. 
During the third quarter, corporate brands represented approximately 28.1% of total units sold and 25.5% of sales dollars, excluding fuel and pharmacy. As Rodney said earlier, Simple Truth continues to have an impressive growth rate. 
Our net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio increased to 2.35 compared to 1.99 during the same period last year. This is a result -- this result is due to the mergers with ModernHEALTH and Roundy's Inc. At year-end, Kroger expects net total debt to adjusted EBITDA to be near the high end of the company's targeted range of 2 to 2.2x. It's worth noting that over longer-time horizon, we do expect our net total debt to EBITDA ratio to grow if we continually -- if we continue to successfully negotiate restructuring a troubled multiemployer pension plan obligations to help stabilize associates' future benefits, as we did in the second quarter. We would not expect this increase to adversely affect our credit rating, as the rating agencies already factor in our multiemployer pension plan obligations in their evaluations of our credit rating. When we take on additional debt to fund these plans, this reduces the off-balance-sheet amount of our estimated multiemployer pension plan obligations. 
Over the last 4 quarters, Kroger has used cash to repurchase $1.4 billion in common shares, pay $418 million in dividends, invest $3.8 billion in capital, in line with our commitment to reduce planned capital expenditures for the year, merged with Roundy's for $866 million and merged with ModernHEALTH for approximately $390 million. 
The flexibility to return value to shareholders is a core strength of our financial strategy. Return on invested capital for the third quarter was 13.63, excluding Roundy's, compared to 14.16 in the third quarter of 2015. 
I will now provide a brief update on labor relations. We recently agreed to a new contract with UFCW, covering Fry's associates in Arizona. We are currently negotiating contracts governing store associates in Atlanta, Michigan and North Carolina. And we are also negotiating a new contract with the Teamsters for our Roundy's distribution center. Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive costs and compensation packages that provide solid wages, good quality, affordable health care and retirement benefits for our associates. Kroger's financial results continue to be pressured by rising health care and pension costs, which some of our competitors do not face. Kroger continues to communicate with our local unions, which represent many of our associates, the importance of growing Kroger's business and profitability, which will help us create more jobs, incur opportunities and enhance job security for our associates.
Turning now to our guidance for the remainder of the year. We narrowed our net earnings guidance to a range of $2.03 to $2.08 per diluted share for 2016. The previous guidance was $2.03 to $2.13. On an adjusted net earnings guidance range per diluted share for the year, it's $2.10 to $2.15, which excludes the $0.07 charge from the company's commitment to restructure certain multiemployer pension plan obligations in the second quarter. The previous adjusted guidance range was $2.10 to $2.20. 
For the fourth quarter of 2016, Kroger expects slightly positive identical supermarket sales growth excluding fuel. The persistent and increasing deflation has caused us to adjust our view of identical store sales for the fourth quarter. 
We continue to expect capital investments of $3.6 billion to $3.9 billion for the year, excluding mergers, acquisitions and purchases of lease facilities. And we expect Kroger's full year FIFO operating margin in 2016, excluding fuel, to decline compared to 2015 results. 
Finally, I want to take a moment to look ahead to 2017. We're completing our business plan process for 2017 now, and we'll provide specific guidance in March as we normally do. We anticipate both positive identical supermarket sales and net earnings per diluted share growth, excluding the 53rd week. Net earnings growth will likely be below the low end of the company's 8% to 11% net earnings per diluted share long-term growth rate guidance. 
We expect the operating environment in the first half of 2017 to be similar today. The second half of 2017 should show improvement as we cycle the current environment. As you know, we define long term as over a 3- to 5-year time horizon, and we are committed to achieving our net earnings per diluted share growth rate guidance of 8% to 11% plus a growing dividend. 
We expect 2017 capital investments of $3.6 billion to $3.9 billion, excluding mergers, acquisitions and purchases of lease facilities. We will continue to make investments to reward our customers, and we'll increase our intensity in finding cost savings for these investments. 
Now I will turn it back to Rodney."

A lot of those, when you look at them on year-on-year, they're still quite negative. But there is some trend up in some of those categories, the input costs over the last 4 weeks, but still down on the prior year. Milk and cheese looks like it may be bottoming, but that doesn't mean things turn around on a dime as raw material input costs change. There's usually a lag from the bottom and a slight blip up on those costs until you start to see any effect on retail pricing. So we would expect this to persist. Some of that is just based on the last 2 cycles of inflation and deflation we've had. And we have a 5-year rolling average chart that we look at a lot. And if you think about the waves of where that happens with inflation and deflation, this cycle looks very similar to the last couple, maybe a little closer to '02 versus '09, which was a little bit more persistent, but that's what's in the back of our minds."

It takes about $23 million of sales to move our IDs by 10 basis points. When you're plus or minus $23 million on a 2- or 3-day time frame, or even $40 million on a 2- or 3-day time frame, when you're at 4% to 4.5% idents, it's a blip on the radar screen. When you're between 0 -- when you're between flat and 50 basis points of identicals, it's a huge percentage move on where your identicals can be. And when you think about $23 billion a quarter in ID sales, so $1 billion to $1.5 billion a week, the potential for a couple of days to move by $20 million is very real. You've all heard me at different times talk about -- if you saw our daily sales when calendar shifts and holiday shifts, you would understand why grocers get gray hair early in their careers. And those kinds of things just happen, and it's a big effect. The effect of milk, eggs and cheese continues to be big. It's a big headwind to ID sales this year versus last year, a meaningful percentage. I won't necessarily give the exact amount, but it's a meaningful amount. Rodney's shrugging his shoulders. So it's as much as 50 basis points effect to ID sales in the quarter, just those 3 commodities, because of the deflation this year versus last year. So these kinds of things are real. You've often heard us talk about milk being elastic when there's deflation. When it's deflation on deflation, the elasticity happens when you first break that $2 barrier and then demand flattens out. So you don't get a 2-year bump in it."

So there is -- what -- where we ended up was exactly consistent with what -- how Mike outlined in terms of the uncertainty for the balance of a few days. When you look at quarter-to-date in the fourth quarter, we would be slightly negative. But if you look at last year, last year's -- the first 4 weeks of last year's fourth quarter were by far the strongest, and it kept getting weaker during the quarter. So we will start cycling numbers from a year ago that look a lot different than what we've been cycling so far this year.

I think the one I would go a little deeper on is the corporate brands. And as we continue to have an expansion of our Private Selection line, when you look at Simple Truth continuing to grow nearly -- basically, double digits, those kinds of products contain a higher gross margin as well. And as they continue to become a higher and higher portion of our mix, that somewhat distorts historical reference. The number's a little bit difficult to interpret this quarter because of the fact of the dairy complex, because such a high percentage of the dairy complex is corporate brands. The other thing that's in there is the fresh mix. You heard Rodney talk a lot about being on top of the foodie trends and snacking and things like that. Those departments do come with a higher gross margin mix. Now their contribution to overhead or their operating profit may not be as strong as other departments because there's a lot of labor costs and more shrink in those categories and more fixed costs like electricity and things like that. So it's a combination of all those leading to it. Rest assured, we do continue to invest in price and continue to drive value to our customers.

Now you buy a 32-pack of bottled water. All of those are 1 unit, even though we're selling more bottled water units. And there's a lot of multipacks and bigger packs that are trending to that kind of an opportunity. You also see some of that with ClickList in categories that customers are finding convenient to buy bigger packs because they don't have to fill up their basket cart with it. We do that for them and put it in their trunk. So they may be buying a 12-pack of paper towels instead of a 4-pack of paper towels, because they don't have to worry about space in the basket cart.

Part of it will -- part of it determines what -- I'm trying to think about how to word this in a way that's helpful. The cycle coming out will be driven by what caused you to go in and how do you end up coming out of it. Everything that we can see, the reason what we would expect today would be a modest increase once we cycle on the other side of it is most of it is supply-oriented. So if you look at like 2008 and 2009, it was as much driven by the economy and everything going on. If you look at 2002, it was more supply-driven because there was a lot of supply in the market. Unless there would just be a terrible crop year in '17, we would expect this to look much more like 2002. Remember, once -- and Mike talked about it a little bit, like on dairy, if you have $3 a gallon milk and it goes to $2 a gallon milk, when you cycle that the next year and if milk is still at $2 a gallon, you're cycling $2 on $2 versus $2 on $3.

I don't think we said that we were absolutely at the low end of our 50 basis points to 150 basis points ID guidance.

And we didn't end up the third quarter drastically different than we did. And I think it's -- maybe it was my communication skills back on November 2, and people hearing that we're near the low end, just assuming that you're at the low end. I go back, it takes $20 million in a quarter to move ID sales by 10 basis points.

If I'm at 4%, it goes to 3.9%, and it's not a very big deal."

Before we end today's call, I'd like to share some additional thoughts with our associates listening in today. Being part of millions of families' celebrations this holiday season is a great honor and privilege. Our customers count on us to have what they need and more, and you make it all happen. Just last week, nearly 10.5 million customers shopped with us on Tuesday and 13.5 million on Wednesday before Thanksgiving. That's incredible. A huge thank you. No matter where you work, you make the holidays special for our customers, our communities and each other. 
I also want to thank our store teams for their outstanding response to our national hiring event in November for all military veterans and family members. We hired 4,000 veterans and family members in one day, which is nearly 3,000 more than last year's event. We are delighted to welcome them to our Kroger family as part of our continuing commitment to active duty troops and the nation's 23 million veterans. Thank you for all you do every day. Merry Christmas and happy holidays to you and your family. 
That completes our call today. Thanks for joining."

284342,410104275,1095801,"The Kroger Co., Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Dec 01, 2016",2016-12-01,"Earnings Calls","The Kroger Co.","Executives","Thank you, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. To start, I want to say how -- that I'm proud of our associates for their continuing objective in connecting with our customers in a very difficult operating environment. Their e",768,"Thank you, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. To start, I want to say how -- that I'm proud of our associates for their continuing objective in connecting with our customers in a very difficult operating environment. Their efforts helped us grow both total households and loyal households during the third quarter. As expected, deflation persisted during the third quarter. And as we've said before, transition periods create a difficult operating environment. This is the third time we've had deflation in 30 years. And in previous instances, deflation lasted from 3 to 5 quarters in a row. We're in a middle -- in the middle of the cycle right now, and it's not fun. Still, our tonnage continues to grow. Our total market share continues to expand, and we're focused on executing our strategy. 
A silver lining of deflationary environments is that it reveals to us how we can run our business better by shining a light on areas we can improve. It is really tough when you're in it, but we'll be in a position to benefit from changes we're making today once we're out of this cycle. We are firmly focused on our long-term strategy of improving our connection with customers and associates and continuing to work on process changes to lower costs. 
We don't change our strategy based on quarterly swings in results. We remain committed to delivering on our long-term earnings per share growth rate target of 8% to 11%, plus an increasing dividend on a 3- to 5-year time horizon. We will continue to try to win every customer meal by driving our strategy and reacting appropriately to the environment.
Looking at the broader economy and the customer shopping behavior, what we're seeing is mixed. Typically, our data shows our customers' economic concerns mirror what they see in the headlines. For example, health care costs continue to be a worry for customers. Consumer confidence retreated during the quarter, with customers telling us they expect the economy to get worse in the next 3 months. It's important to remember this survey was completed in October, and it's too early to say what the mood of our customers is since then.
Natural, organic and health and wellness continue to be a food megatrend, and we're riding these trends well. Our natural and organic sales continue to outpace total sales growth. Simple Truth continued its strong double-digit growth. Simple Truth organic kombucha is a very -- is very popular as more customers focus on digestive health. We've also recently launched a 24-pack Simple Truth vapor distilled water with electrolytes. It's priced fantastically, it's a great product, and it's selling really well. Our produce, fresh-prepared and deli package departments, sushi, Starbucks, wine and liquor sales all saw comparatively strong growth during the quarter as well. If you can drink it or snack on it, it's selling. 
A few on-trend examples are protein snacks such as Simple Truth -- Private Selection and Simple Truth paninos, which are imported cured meats wrapped around a creamy cheese as well as handcrafted and real sugar sodas. 
As I said at our investor conference here in Cincinnati 4 weeks ago, Kroger's earnings growth has outpaced our peers over both the last 5 years and last 10 years, and we still see incredible growth potential as we look forward. We can clearly identify where we have 100 plus billion in market share growth opportunities in our existing markets alone. 
But good enough today won't be good enough tomorrow. That is why we're both embracing change and accelerating change. For example, 84.51° is helping us spot trends and create unique customer experiences to drive growth. We continue to focus on solving customer needs on their terms. We now offer ClickList in more than 550 stores. That is 50 more locations than we were operating just 4 weeks ago. We're connecting with tens of millions of customers digitally, online and through our mobile app. Customers have now downloaded more than 3.5 billion digital offers. 
We know that the typical customer eats 35 to 45 times per week. Increasingly, we are positioning ourselves to solve for all of those meals or snacks in addition to our historical model of solving for meals at home. We've built a strong Customer 1st foundation over the last 15 years, upon which we can confidently accelerate change. In doing so, we can deliver even better results for our customers, associates and shareholders. 
Now Mike will offer more details on Kroger's third quarter financial results and discuss our guidance for the fourth quarter and 2017. Mike?"
284342,410104275,1095801,"The Kroger Co., Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Dec 01, 2016",2016-12-01,"Earnings Calls","The Kroger Co.","Executives","Thanks, Rodney, and once again, good morning, everyone. I want to also thank our associates for their hard work and focus on connecting with customers. As a result, both household and unit growth were up during the quarter as was market share. As we said",1174,"Thanks, Rodney, and once again, good morning, everyone. I want to also thank our associates for their hard work and focus on connecting with customers. As a result, both household and unit growth were up during the quarter as was market share. As we said at the investor conference, the last 2 weeks of the quarter would drive our identical supermarket sales results, and our IDs came in at the low end of our expectations for the quarter. 
Deflation has not only persisted, but has increased with overall deflation, excluding pharmacy, growing from 1.3% in the second quarter to 1.5% in the third quarter. Additionally, pharmacy inflation declined 130 basis points to 3.3% during the third quarter. 
Over the last 4 quarters, we have relocated or expanded 49 strong performing stores. This takes them out of our identical supermarket sales calculation. Further, we have opened 42 new stores over the same time frame. Both of these create a headwind to identical food store sales. By way of comparison, last year, there were 19 new stores opened that affected nearby stores. Operating costs, excluding fuel, Roundy's and an $80 million contribution to the UFCW consolidated pension plan in the third quarter of 2015, grew by 19 basis points, of which 15 basis points were related to depreciation due to increases in our capital program. 
We can clearly do better, and we're redoubling our efforts to reduce these costs as a rate of sales over time. While the environment is difficult, managing operating expenses is something that is in our control. Our Customer 1st strategy is funded by saving costs in areas of the business that customers don't see in order to return value to our customers in the form of lower prices on products that they want, improved service and the shopping experience that makes them want to return. We are and will continue to look at a variety of options to improve processes and lower costs as a rate of sales in a strategic and conscientious way. 
Now for an update on retail fuel. In the third quarter, our cents per gallon fuel margin was approximately 17.9 cents compared to 23.8 cents in the same quarter last year. On a rolling 4 quarters basis, we were at $0.17 this year compared to $0.188 last year. 
During the third quarter, corporate brands represented approximately 28.1% of total units sold and 25.5% of sales dollars, excluding fuel and pharmacy. As Rodney said earlier, Simple Truth continues to have an impressive growth rate. 
Our net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio increased to 2.35 compared to 1.99 during the same period last year. This is a result -- this result is due to the mergers with ModernHEALTH and Roundy's Inc. At year-end, Kroger expects net total debt to adjusted EBITDA to be near the high end of the company's targeted range of 2 to 2.2x. It's worth noting that over a longer-time horizon, we do expect our net total debt to EBITDA ratio to grow if we continually -- if we continue to successfully negotiate restructuring of troubled multiemployer pension plan obligations to help stabilize associates' future benefits, as we did in the second quarter. We would not expect this increase to adversely affect our credit rating, as the rating agencies already factor in our multiemployer pension plan obligations in their evaluations of our credit rating. When we take on additional debt to fund these plans, this reduces the off-balance-sheet amount of our estimated multiemployer pension plan obligations. 
Over the last 4 quarters, Kroger has used cash to repurchase $1.4 billion in common shares, pay $418 million in dividends, invest $3.8 billion in capital, in line with our commitment to reduce planned capital expenditures for the year, merged with Roundy's for $866 million and merged with ModernHEALTH for approximately $390 million. 
The flexibility to return value to shareholders is a core strength of our financial strategy. Return on invested capital for the third quarter was 13.63%, excluding Roundy's, compared to 14.16% for the third quarter of 2015. 
I will now provide a brief update on labor relations. We recently agreed to a new contract with UFCW, covering Fry's associates in Arizona. We are currently negotiating contracts governing store associates in Atlanta, Michigan and North Carolina. And we are also negotiating a new contract with the Teamsters for our Roundy's distribution center. Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive costs and compensation packages that provide solid wages, good quality, affordable health care and retirement benefits for our associates. Kroger's financial results continue to be pressured by rising health care and pension costs, which some of our competitors do not face. Kroger continues to communicate with our local unions, which represent many of our associates, the importance of growing Kroger's business and profitability, which will help us create more jobs and career opportunities and enhance job security for our associates.
Turning now to our guidance for the remainder of the year. We narrowed our net earnings guidance to a range of $2.03 to $2.08 per diluted share for 2016. The previous guidance was $2.03 to $2.13. On an adjusted net earnings guidance range per diluted share for the year, it's $2.10 to $2.15, which excludes the $0.07 charge from the company's commitment to restructure certain multiemployer pension plan obligations in the second quarter. The previous adjusted guidance range was $2.10 to $2.20. 
For the fourth quarter of 2016, Kroger expects slightly positive identical supermarket sales growth, excluding fuel. The persistent and increasing deflation has caused us to adjust our view of identical store sales for the fourth quarter. 
We continue to expect capital investments of $3.6 billion to $3.9 billion for the year, excluding mergers, acquisitions and purchases of lease facilities. And we expect Kroger's full year FIFO operating margin in 2016, excluding fuel, to decline compared to 2015 results. 
Finally, I want to take a moment to look ahead to 2017. We're completing our business plan process for 2017 now, and we'll provide specific guidance in March as we normally do. We anticipate both positive identical supermarket sales and net earnings per diluted share growth, excluding the 53rd week. Net earnings growth will likely be below the low end of the company's 8% to 11% net earnings per diluted share long-term growth rate guidance. 
We expect the operating environment in the first half of 2017 to be similar today. The second half of 2017 should show improvement as we cycle the current environment. As you know, we define long term as over a 3- to 5-year time horizon, and we are committed to achieving our net earnings per diluted share growth rate guidance of 8% to 11% plus a growing dividend. 
We expect 2017 capital investments of $3.6 billion to $3.9 billion, excluding mergers, acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities. We will continue to make investments to reward our customers, and we'll increase our intensity in finding cost savings for these investments. 
Now I will turn it back to Rodney."

A lot of those, when you look at them on year-on-year, they're still quite negative. But there is some trend up in some of those categories in the input costs over the last 4 weeks, but still down on the prior year. Milk and cheese looks like it may be bottoming, but that doesn't mean things turn around on a dime as raw material input costs change. There's usually a lag from that bottom and a slight blip up in those costs until you start to see any effect on retail pricing. So we would expect this to persist. Some of that is just based on the last 2 cycles of inflation and deflation we've had. And we have a 5-year rolling average chart that we look at a lot. And if you think about the waves of where that happens with inflation and deflation, this cycle looks very similar to the last couple, maybe a little closer to '02 versus '09, which was a little bit more persistent, but that's what's in the back of our minds."

It takes about $23 million of sales to move our IDs by 10 basis points. When you're plus or minus $23 million on a 2- or 3-day time frame, or even $40 million on a 2- or 3-day time frame, when you're at 4% or 4.5% idents, it's a blip on the radar screen. When you're between 0 -- when you're between flat and 50 basis points of identicals, it's a huge percentage move on where your identicals can be. And when you think about $23 billion a quarter in ID sales, so $1.5 billion to $2 billion a week, the potential for a couple of days to move by $20 million is very real. You've all heard me at different times talk about -- if you saw our daily sales when calendar shifts and holiday shifts, you would understand why grocers get gray hair early in their careers. And those kinds of things just happen, and it's a big effect. The effect of milk, eggs and cheese continues to be big. It's a big headwind to ID sales this year versus last year, a meaningful percentage. I won't necessarily give the exact amount, but it's a meaningful amount. Rodney's shrugging his shoulders. So it's as much as 50 basis points effect to ID sales in the quarter, just those 3 commodities, because of the deflation this year versus last year. So these kinds of things are real. You've often heard us talk about milk being elastic when there's deflation. When it's deflation on deflation, the elasticity happens when you first break that $2 barrier and then demand flattens out. So you don't get a 2-year bump in it."

When Mike shared the guidance at our Analyst Day, he did talk about the uncertainty because of the calendar shifts. So there is -- what -- where we ended up was exactly consistent with what -- how Mike outlined in terms of the uncertainty for the balance of a few days. When you look at quarter-to-date in the fourth quarter, we would be slightly negative. But if you look at last year, last year's -- the first 4 weeks of last year's fourth quarter were by far the strongest, and it kept getting weaker during the quarter. So we will start cycling numbers from a year ago that look a lot different than what we've been cycling so far this year. So that's the reason why we were comfortable on giving the guidance in terms of being slightly positive for the fourth quarter."

The other thing is that our buying teams have done a ton of work on changing the way we buy product in terms of cost of goods. And if you look, we have a lot of corporate brand products where we buy direct. So a lot of those changes have really been helpful in terms of making improvement in cost of goods, too, which has helped some on the cost -- the gross margin line. I know Mike, you -- I'm sure you have a couple of other comments you want to add."

I think the one I would go a little deeper on is the corporate brands. And as we continue to have an expansion of our Private Selection line, when you look at Simple Truth continuing to grow nearly -- basically, double digits, those kinds of products contain a higher gross margin as well. And as they continue to become a higher and higher portion of our mix, that somewhat distorts the historical reference. The number's a little bit difficult to interpret this quarter because of the fact of the dairy complex, because such a high percentage of the dairy complex is corporate brands. The other thing that's in there is the fresh mix. You heard Rodney talk a lot about being on top of the foodie trends and snacking and things like that. Those departments do come with a higher gross margin mix. Now their contribution to overhead or their operating profit may not be as strong as other departments because there's a lot of labor costs and more shrink in those categories and more fixed costs like electricity and things like that. So it's a combination of all those leading to it. Rest assured, we do continue to invest in price and continue to drive value to our customers. And it's something that we've -- been our cornerstone for the last 14 years."

Today -- it used to be, you bought a -- well, you didn't even buy bottled water, and then you bought a 12-pack of bottled water, then you bought 24-pack of bottled water. Now you buy a 32-pack of bottled water. All of those are 1 unit, even though we're selling more bottled water units. And there's a lot of multipacks and bigger packs that are trending to that kind of an opportunity. You also see some of that with ClickList in categories that customers are finding convenient to buy bigger packs because they don't have to fill up their basket cart with it. We do that for them and put it in their trunk. So they may be buying a 12-pack of paper towels instead of a 4-pack of paper towels, because they don't have to worry about space in the basket cart.

Part of it will -- part of it determines what -- I'm trying to think about how to word this in a way that's helpful. The cycle coming out will be driven by what caused you to go in and how do you end up coming out of it. Everything that we can see, the reason what we would expect today would be a modest increase once we cycle on the other side of it is most of it is supply-oriented. So if you look at like 2008 and 2009, it was as much driven by the economy and everything going on. If you look at 2002, it was more supply-driven because there was a lot of supply in the market. Unless there would just be a terrible crop year in '17, we would expect this to look much more like 2002. Remember, once -- and Mike talked about it a little bit, like on dairy, if you have $3 a gallon milk and it goes to $2 a gallon milk, when you cycle that the next year and if milk is still at $2 a gallon, you're cycling $2 on $2 versus $2 on $3. And that's the reason why the pressures decreases. I don't know, Mike, anything else you want to add that?"

So if you go back then, and we didn't have a loyalty card, and we didn't have the analysis we do today. But everything we could find, the customer would -- the basket would be bigger on an individual basis. But if you look at a monthly basis, it's bigger today. In terms of the cycle comments, the things that we think are the same are more the materials in raw ingredients space, where if you look at beef and pork and chicken, the biggest component of that is corn price. And chicken in that cycle is much quicker than it is on pork and beef. And that hasn't changed now versus 2002.

And we didn't end up the third quarter drastically different than we did. And I think it's -- maybe it was my communication skills back on November 2, and people hearing that we're near the low end, just assuming that you're at the low end. I go back to, it takes $20 million in a quarter to move ID sales by 10 basis points. So the fluctuations when you're in this range, if I missed those 4 days that were left by $20 million, that cuts my ID sales in half if I was at 20 basis points.

Their e",768,"Thank you, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. To start, I want to say how -- that I'm proud of our associates for their continuing objective in connecting with our customers in a very difficult operating environment. Their efforts helped us grow both total households and loyal households during the third quarter. As expected, deflation persisted during the third quarter. And as we've said before, transition periods create a difficult operating environment. This is the third time we've had deflation in 30 years. And in previous instances, deflation lasted from 3 to 5 quarters in a row. We're in a middle -- in the middle of the cycle right now, and it's not fun. Still, our tonnage continues to grow. Our total market share continues to expand, and we're focused on executing our strategy. 
A silver lining of deflationary environments is that it reveals to us how we can run our business better by shining a light on areas we can improve. It is really tough when you're in it, but we'll be in a position to benefit from changes we're making today once we're out of this cycle. We are firmly focused on our long-term strategy of improving our connection with customers and associates and continuing to work on process changes to lower costs. 
We don't change our strategy based on quarterly swings in results. We remain committed to delivering on our long-term earnings per share growth rate target of 8% to 11%, plus an increasing dividend on a 3- to 5-year time horizon. We will continue to try to win every customer meal by driving our strategy and reacting appropriately to the environment.
Looking at the broader economy and the customer shopping behavior, what we're seeing is mixed. Typically, our data shows our customers' economic concerns mirror what they see in the headlines. For example, health care costs continue to be a worry for customers. Consumer confidence retreated during the quarter, with customers telling us they expect the economy to get worse in the next 3 months. It's important to remember this survey was completed in October, and it's too early to say what the mood of our customers is since then.
Natural, organic and health and wellness continue to be a food megatrend, and we're riding these trends well. Our natural and organic sales continue to outpace total sales growth. Simple Truth continued its strong double-digit growth. Simple Truth organic kombucha is a very -- is very popular as more customers focus on digestive health. We've also recently launched a 24-pack Simple Truth vapor distilled water with electrolytes. It's priced fantastically, it's a great product, and it's selling really well. Our produce, fresh-prepared and deli package departments, sushi, Starbucks, wine and liquor sales all saw comparatively strong growth during the quarter as well. If you can drink it or snack on it, it's selling. 
A few on-trend examples are protein snacks such as Simple Truth -- Private Selection and Simple Truth paninos, which are imported cured meats wrapped around a creamy cheese as well as handcrafted and real sugar sodas. 
As I said at our investor conference here in Cincinnati 4 weeks ago, Kroger's earnings growth has outpaced our peers over both the last 5 years and last 10 years, and we still see incredible growth potential as we look forward. We can clearly identify where we have 100 plus billion in market share growth opportunities in our existing markets alone. 
But good enough today won't be good enough tomorrow. That is why we're both embracing change and accelerating change. For example, 84.51° is helping us spot trends and create unique customer experiences to drive growth. We continue to focus on solving customer needs on their terms. We now offer ClickList in more than 550 stores. That is 50 more locations than we were operating just 4 weeks ago. We're connecting with tens of millions of customers digitally, online and through our mobile app. Customers have now downloaded more than 3.5 billion digital offers. 
We know that the typical customer eats 35 to 45 times per week. Increasingly, we are positioning ourselves to solve for all of those meals or snacks in addition to our historical model of solving for meals at home. We've built a strong Customer 1st foundation over the last 15 years, upon which we can confidently accelerate change. In doing so, we can deliver even better results for our customers, associates and shareholders. 
Now Mike will offer more details on Kroger's third quarter financial results and discuss our guidance for the fourth quarter and 2017. Mike?"
284342,410104275,1096155,"The Kroger Co., Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Dec 01, 2016",2016-12-01,"Earnings Calls","The Kroger Co.","Executives","Thanks, Rodney, and once again, good morning, everyone. I want to also thank our associates for their hard work and focus on connecting with customers. As a result, both household and unit growth were up during the quarter as was market share. As we said",1174,"Thanks, Rodney, and once again, good morning, everyone. I want to also thank our associates for their hard work and focus on connecting with customers. As a result, both household and unit growth were up during the quarter as was market share. As we said at the investor conference, the last 2 weeks of the quarter would drive our identical supermarket sales results, and our IDs came in at the low end of our expectations for the quarter. 
Deflation has not only persisted, but has increased with overall deflation, excluding pharmacy, growing from 1.3% in the second quarter to 1.5% in the third quarter. Additionally, pharmacy inflation declined 130 basis points to 3.3% during the third quarter. 
Over the last 4 quarters, we have relocated or expanded 49 strong performing stores. This takes them out of our identical supermarket sales calculation. Further, we have opened 42 new stores over the same time frame. Both of these create a headwind to identical food store sales. By way of comparison, last year, there were 19 new stores opened that affected nearby stores. Operating costs, excluding fuel, Roundy's and an $80 million contribution to the UFCW consolidated pension plan in the third quarter of 2015, grew by 19 basis points, of which 15 basis points were related to depreciation due to increases in our capital program. 
We can clearly do better, and we're redoubling our efforts to reduce these costs as a rate of sales over time. While the environment is difficult, managing operating expenses is something that is in our control. Our Customer 1st strategy is funded by saving costs in areas of the business that customers don't see in order to return value to our customers in the form of lower prices on products that they want, improved service and the shopping experience that makes them want to return. We are and will continue to look at a variety of options to improve processes and lower costs as a rate of sales in a strategic and conscientious way. 
Now for an update on retail fuel. In the third quarter, our cents per gallon fuel margin was approximately 17.9 cents compared to 23.8 cents in the same quarter last year. On a rolling 4 quarters basis, we were at $0.17 this year compared to $0.188 last year. 
During the third quarter, corporate brands represented approximately 28.1% of total units sold and 25.5% of sales dollars, excluding fuel and pharmacy. As Rodney said earlier, Simple Truth continues to have an impressive growth rate. 
Our net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio increased to 2.35 compared to 1.99 during the same period last year. This is a result -- this result is due to the mergers with ModernHEALTH and Roundy's Inc. At year-end, Kroger expects net total debt to adjusted EBITDA to be near the high end of the company's targeted range of 2 to 2.2x. It's worth noting that over a longer-time horizon, we do expect our net total debt to EBITDA ratio to grow if we continually -- if we continue to successfully negotiate restructuring of troubled multiemployer pension plan obligations to help stabilize associates' future benefits, as we did in the second quarter. We would not expect this increase to adversely affect our credit rating, as the rating agencies already factor in our multiemployer pension plan obligations in their evaluations of our credit rating. When we take on additional debt to fund these plans, this reduces the off-balance-sheet amount of our estimated multiemployer pension plan obligations. 
Over the last 4 quarters, Kroger has used cash to repurchase $1.4 billion in common shares, pay $418 million in dividends, invest $3.8 billion in capital, in line with our commitment to reduce planned capital expenditures for the year, merged with Roundy's for $866 million and merged with ModernHEALTH for approximately $390 million. 
The flexibility to return value to shareholders is a core strength of our financial strategy. Return on invested capital for the third quarter was 13.63%, excluding Roundy's, compared to 14.16% for the third quarter of 2015. 
I will now provide a brief update on labor relations. We recently agreed to a new contract with UFCW, covering Fry's associates in Arizona. We are currently negotiating contracts governing store associates in Atlanta, Michigan and North Carolina. And we are also negotiating a new contract with the Teamsters for our Roundy's distribution center. Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive costs and compensation packages that provide solid wages, good quality, affordable health care and retirement benefits for our associates. Kroger's financial results continue to be pressured by rising health care and pension costs, which some of our competitors do not face. Kroger continues to communicate with our local unions, which represent many of our associates, the importance of growing Kroger's business and profitability, which will help us create more jobs and career opportunities and enhance job security for our associates.
Turning now to our guidance for the remainder of the year. We narrowed our net earnings guidance to a range of $2.03 to $2.08 per diluted share for 2016. The previous guidance was $2.03 to $2.13. On an adjusted net earnings guidance range per diluted share for the year, it's $2.10 to $2.15, which excludes the $0.07 charge from the company's commitment to restructure certain multiemployer pension plan obligations in the second quarter. The previous adjusted guidance range was $2.10 to $2.20. 
For the fourth quarter of 2016, Kroger expects slightly positive identical supermarket sales growth, excluding fuel. The persistent and increasing deflation has caused us to adjust our view of identical store sales for the fourth quarter. 
We continue to expect capital investments of $3.6 billion to $3.9 billion for the year, excluding mergers, acquisitions and purchases of lease facilities. And we expect Kroger's full year FIFO operating margin in 2016, excluding fuel, to decline compared to 2015 results. 
Finally, I want to take a moment to look ahead to 2017. We're completing our business plan process for 2017 now, and we'll provide specific guidance in March as we normally do. We anticipate both positive identical supermarket sales and net earnings per diluted share growth, excluding the 53rd week. Net earnings growth will likely be below the low end of the company's 8% to 11% net earnings per diluted share long-term growth rate guidance. 
We expect the operating environment in the first half of 2017 to be similar today. The second half of 2017 should show improvement as we cycle the current environment. As you know, we define long term as over a 3- to 5-year time horizon, and we are committed to achieving our net earnings per diluted share growth rate guidance of 8% to 11% plus a growing dividend. 
We expect 2017 capital investments of $3.6 billion to $3.9 billion, excluding mergers, acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities. We will continue to make investments to reward our customers, and we'll increase our intensity in finding cost savings for these investments. 
Now I will turn it back to Rodney."

A lot of those, when you look at them on year-on-year, they're still quite negative. But there is some trend up in some of those categories in the input costs over the last 4 weeks, but still down on the prior year. Milk and cheese looks like it may be bottoming, but that doesn't mean things turn around on a dime as raw material input costs change. There's usually a lag from that bottom and a slight blip up in those costs until you start to see any effect on retail pricing. So we would expect this to persist. Some of that is just based on the last 2 cycles of inflation and deflation we've had. And we have a 5-year rolling average chart that we look at a lot. And if you think about the waves of where that happens with inflation and deflation, this cycle looks very similar to the last couple, maybe a little closer to '02 versus '09, which was a little bit more persistent, but that's what's in the back of our minds."

It takes about $23 million of sales to move our IDs by 10 basis points. When you're plus or minus $23 million on a 2- or 3-day time frame, or even $40 million on a 2- or 3-day time frame, when you're at 4% or 4.5% idents, it's a blip on the radar screen. When you're between 0 -- when you're between flat and 50 basis points of identicals, it's a huge percentage move on where your identicals can be. And when you think about $23 billion a quarter in ID sales, so $1.5 billion to $2 billion a week, the potential for a couple of days to move by $20 million is very real. You've all heard me at different times talk about -- if you saw our daily sales when calendar shifts and holiday shifts, you would understand why grocers get gray hair early in their careers. And those kinds of things just happen, and it's a big effect. The effect of milk, eggs and cheese continues to be big. It's a big headwind to ID sales this year versus last year, a meaningful percentage. I won't necessarily give the exact amount, but it's a meaningful amount. Rodney's shrugging his shoulders. So it's as much as 50 basis points effect to ID sales in the quarter, just those 3 commodities, because of the deflation this year versus last year. So these kinds of things are real. You've often heard us talk about milk being elastic when there's deflation. When it's deflation on deflation, the elasticity happens when you first break that $2 barrier and then demand flattens out. So you don't get a 2-year bump in it."

And as they continue to become a higher and higher portion of our mix, that somewhat distorts the historical reference. The number's a little bit difficult to interpret this quarter because of the fact of the dairy complex, because such a high percentage of the dairy complex is corporate brands. The other thing that's in there is the fresh mix. You heard Rodney talk a lot about being on top of the foodie trends and snacking and things like that. Those departments do come with a higher gross margin mix. Now their contribution to overhead or their operating profit may not be as strong as other departments because there's a lot of labor costs and more shrink in those categories and more fixed costs like electricity and things like that. So it's a combination of all those leading to it. Rest assured, we do continue to invest in price and continue to drive value to our customers.

Today -- it used to be, you bought a -- well, you didn't even buy bottled water, and then you bought a 12-pack of bottled water, then you bought 24-pack of bottled water. Now you buy a 32-pack of bottled water. All of those are 1 unit, even though we're selling more bottled water units. And there's a lot of multipacks and bigger packs that are trending to that kind of an opportunity. You also see some of that with ClickList in categories that customers are finding convenient to buy bigger packs because they don't have to fill up their basket cart with it. We do that for them and put it in their trunk. So they may be buying a 12-pack of paper towels instead of a 4-pack of paper towels, because they don't have to worry about space in the basket cart.

Some of the business is incremental. It's a reasonably high range when you look across the company. If you look at the financial performance, it's a headwind initially. If you go back and look at some of the original locations that Harris Teeter had before we merged, it becomes where you're indifferent whether somebody shops via ClickList or in the store.

So if you look at like 2008 and 2009, it was as much driven by the economy and everything going on. If you look at 2002, it was more supply-driven because there was a lot of supply in the market. Unless there would just be a terrible crop year in '17, we would expect this to look much more like 2002. Remember, once -- and Mike talked about it a little bit, like on dairy, if you have $3 a gallon milk and it goes to $2 a gallon milk, when you cycle that the next year and if milk is still at $2 a gallon, you're cycling $2 on $2 versus $2 on $3.

Is OPEC not going to do something? And they ultimately did the 32.5 billion -- or billion gallon decline -- barrel decline, 32.5 billion barrel. I put the b on the dollar -- the number instead of the barrel. That equates to 500,000 barrels a day. And to see the wild swings down $1.50 one day, up almost $4 the next day is kind of confusing on what's -- when you look at that relative to worldwide supply of oil is relatively modest amount of production cut. That said, volatility, up and down. Volatility is generally very positive for us because we have many, many fuel centers at our supermarket locations that get not just a delivery a day, but some of them get a couple of deliveries a day. So when there's daily volatility like that, it allows us to take advantage of market fluctuations."

So if you go back then, and we didn't have a loyalty card, and we didn't have the analysis we do today. But everything we could find, the customer would -- the basket would be bigger on an individual basis. But if you look at a monthly basis, it's bigger today. In terms of the cycle comments, the things that we think are the same are more the materials in raw ingredients space, where if you look at beef and pork and chicken, the biggest component of that is corn price. And chicken in that cycle is much quicker than it is on pork and beef. And that hasn't changed now versus 2002.

And we didn't end up the third quarter drastically different than we did. And I think it's -- maybe it was my communication skills back on November 2, and people hearing that we're near the low end, just assuming that you're at the low end. I go back to, it takes $20 million in a quarter to move ID sales by 10 basis points. So the fluctuations when you're in this range, if I missed those 4 days that were left by $20 million, that cuts my ID sales in half if I was at 20 basis points.

And good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. With me to review Kroger's first quarter results is Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Mike Schlotman.
Our associates delivered another solid quarter. We continue to execute our growth plan and to deliver on our financial performance commitments. Most importantly, we continue to strengthen our connection with our customers, growing loyalty and market share and achieving Kroger's 50th consecutive quarter of positive identical supermarket sales growth, excluding fuel. Most companies can only aspire to achieve these results. It says a lot about our consistently remarkable performance and our ability to grow in a balanced way with a long-term focus.
We've managed through nearly every conceivable operating environment and demonstrated through different cycles that by providing value to our customers and partnering with our associates, we'll continue to make a difference for our customers, associates and communities. And when we do that, we create value for shareholders as evidenced by our growing dividend and our consistent net earnings per diluted share growth above our long-term guidance of 8% to 11%. In fact, our net earnings per diluted share growth rate on a compounded annual basis was 14.1% for 3 years and 18.8% for 5 years.
We demonstrate our long-term focus by continuing to invest for the future. We are making investments in our people, our digital and online capabilities and our strategic partnerships. Across the board, Kroger has an incredibly strong management team and a deep bench of leaders, who are making us better every day. We continue to make strategic investments in leadership development and training for all of our associates, including high-volume store managers and future senior leaders. Many people come here for a job, and Kroger creates opportunities for all associates to build a career.
Despite record low unemployment figures, when we held a 1-day hiring event in every supermarket location in May, we received more than 116,000 applications. From that pool, we hired more than 12,000 new associates. We see our opportunity culture as a competitive advantage.
We are expanding our digital presence and marching steadily toward a time when we can provide our customers with anything, anytime, anywhere. As you know, we are taking a disciplined approach to digital growth, testing new offerings in local markets so we can make sure we get it right before we scale offerings more broadly.
Our ClickList and ExpressLane offerings are now available in 25 markets with more to come. Our merger with Harris Teeter gave us a base of learnings that allowed us to ramp up quickly the development of ClickList. Customers now have downloaded nearly 3 billion digital coupons and offers from our mobile app and website, and we continue to experiment with Vitacost.com's ship-to-home technology and platform.
Earlier this week, Kroger's technology business unit was named one of the Top 100 Places to Work by Computerworld Magazine. We are obviously very proud of this honor. We've launched a new website, kroger.com/liveKT, to connect with and recruit top talent from around the world to join the Kroger team.
Similarly, we are finding out that ClickList also serves as a great tool to both hire and retain great people. Kroger is a fantastic place for tech talent to build careers because the technology they create can improve the lives of millions of customers each and every day.
In April, we announced a strategic investment in Lucky's Market, a specialty grocery store chain focused on natural, organic and locally grown products currently operating in 22 locations. We invested in Lucky's because of their great people and unique go-to-market strategy, which includes smaller-format stores that resemble an indoor farmers market, plus the culinary department that showcases amazingly restaurant-quality prepared foods. Lucky's approach is very much aligned with our efforts to provide affordable, fresh, organic and natural foods as part of our Customer 1st strategy. We expect to learn a lot from each other.
There are a lot of questions about the economy and the customer, inflation or lack thereof, consumer sentiment or competition. These are all issues that we've managed through, some several times over the last 50 quarters. Inflation, for example, I've often said that a 2% to 3% inflation would be a great environment to operate in. However, you rarely get the perfect operating environment. What we know is that by focusing on our associates and our customers will be a winning formula in the future as it has been in the past. At times like this, it's even more important to have 84.51° on the team so we can generate insights into what our customers want and figure out a way to give them that without having to guess at it. 
Kroger's core business is solid. We are providing exceptional customer service in the highest-quality, freshest products. Customers are giving us higher marks for better product selection and store layout as well as friendlier service. We remain focused on customer loyalty that grows tonnage in both our top and bottom lines, which then creates value for shareholders.
Where we are right now, it looks like we will be at the low end to midpoint of our 2016 net earnings per diluted share range. Where we end up in that range will be driven primarily by fuel margins. I do want to stress that we are never satisfied and our to-do list remains longer than our done list.
Now Mike will offer more details on Kroger's first quarter financial results and discuss our guidance for the remainder of the year. Mike?"
284342,345286375,1216614,"The Kroger Co., Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Jun 16, 2016",2016-06-16,"Earnings Calls","The Kroger Co.","Executives","Thanks, Rodney, and good morning, everyone.

IDs came in at 2.4%. As Rodney said, we've been in environments like this before, and we will continue to focus on growing households, growing units and making sure we are delivering the right value proposition for our customers.
Inflation was nonexistent in the first quarter. Lower inflation has persisted and, in fact, was slightly deflationary without pharmacy. When you add pharmacy back in, we had approximately 30 basis points of inflation. This is the lowest we have seen in the last 6 years.
During the quarter, trips per household were up and units per basket declined. This, combined with more households, led to positive tonnage growth.
Operating costs, excluding fuel and Roundy's, were 4 basis points better in the first quarter. Operating, general and administrative expenses were 11 basis points better and grew by approximately 2.9%. Rent and depreciation were a combined 7 basis points worse.
We continue to work diligently to keep operating costs in check. As you know, this is the fuel we use to run our Customer 1st strategy, and as Rodney just said, this is an area where our to-do list is longer than our done list.
Now for an update on retail fuel. In the first quarter, the average retail price of a gallon of gas declined by $0.45 compared to last year. Our cents per gallon fuel margin was approximately $0.143 compared to $0.116 in the same quarter last year. On a rolling 4 quarters basis, we were at $0.182 this year compared to $0.184 last year. We expect this downward trend to accelerate as we cycle some very strong margin quarters for the rest of the year.
Our first quarter net earnings per diluted share increased 12.9% to $0.70 compared to $0.62 during the same period last year. This result was helped primarily by our operating results and higher fuel margins during the first quarter. A lower LIFO expense and share buybacks also contributed to the EPS growth.
Our integration with Roundy's is well underway. Synergies are coming together nicely. We are beginning to focus on the physical assets in Wisconsin while continuing to open new Mariano stores in Chicago. Roundy's associates share our deep commitment to putting our customer first, which makes it easy for us to work together as one team.
For our corporate brands portfolio, we are off to an exciting start on the new innovation in 2016. Last quarter, we told you that we had just introduced Simple Truth household and personal care products, expanding our popular natural and organics line into a true lifestyle brand. Customers have responded enthusiastically as both sales and unit volume have exceeded our expectations in all categories. We continue to launch new Simple Truth offerings in laundry, household, baby and health and beauty care.
We also continue to push the boundaries of culinary trends with new Private Selection spices, marinades, condiments and cooking sauces. Customers are savoring global flavors in our delicious Private Selection products such as Korean black garlic kalbi marinade and Peruvian Aji Amarillo hot sauce. 
During the first quarter, corporate brands represented approximately 27.9% of total units sold and 25.9% of sales dollars, excluding fuel and pharmacy.
The company's net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio increased to 2.12x compared to 2.09x during the same period last year. This result illustrates our commitment to use free cash flow to both grow our business and return cash to shareholders while remaining -- while maintaining an appropriate level of leverage for our credit rating.
Over the last year, Kroger used free cash flow to repurchase $1.1 billion in common shares, paid $397 million in dividends, invest $3.6 billion in capital and merged with Roundy's for $866 million. Kroger's strong EBITDA performance resulted in a return on invested capital for the first quarter of 14.08%, excluding Roundy's, compared to 14.03% for the first quarter of 2015. Our balance sheet is as strong as ever.
I will now provide a brief update on labor relations. We recently agreed to new contracts covering store associates in Houston, Indianapolis, Portland and Roanoke. We are currently negotiating contracts with UFCW for store associates in Little Rock, Nashville and Southern California. Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive costs and compensation packages that provide solid wages, good quality, affordable health care and retirement benefits for our associates. Kroger's financial results continue to be pressured by rising health care and pension costs, which some of our competitors do not face. Kroger and the local unions, which represent many of our associates, have a shared objective: growing Kroger's business and profitably, which will help us create more jobs and career opportunities and enhance job security for our associates.
Turning now to our 2016 guidance. We continue to expect identical supermarket sales growth, excluding fuel, of approximately 2.5% to 3.5% for 2016. This reflects lower inflation as well as Roundy's results, which are an approximate 30 basis point headwind to identical supermarket sales growth.
For full year net earnings, we expect 2016 range of $2.19 to $2.28 per diluted share. As Rodney said earlier, based on current fuel margin trends, we expect to be at the low end to midpoint of our guidance range. We expect fuel margins will be at or slightly below the 5-year average.
Shareholder return will be further enhanced by a dividend that is expected to increase over time. And thinking about the cadence of our quarterly results compared to our long-term 8% to 11% guidance, we believe that the second quarter will be the toughest quarter with slight growth over 2015. Keep in mind the second quarter last year grew by 26%. Both the third and fourth quarters will be at the low end to midpoint of the range.
We continue to expect capital investments, excluding mergers, acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities, to be in the $4.1 billion to $4.4 billion range for 2016.
Finally, we continue to expect Kroger's full year LIFO -- full year FIFO operating margin in 2016, excluding fuel, to slightly expand compared to 2015 results.

The effect of the interest rate, it's really -- it's odd how a lot of pensions are calculated from the liability using  interest rates, the present value of the liability. If you look at state and local and federal pensions and multiemployer pensions, their liability is actually calculated using the expected rate of return, it's the discount rate. So UFCW plans, the way they calculate their unfunded status is really unaffected by changes in the interest rate unless they change their expected rate of return. It's the same way state -- it's just the way it's mandated to be done or is done. It would affect the company plan a little bit, but remember, our company plan is a frozen plan. There continue to be benefits earned by those who are still working and are participants in it, but there's no new participants in it. And we try to maintain the funded status of that enough so we don't have to do some reporting issues to participants. But I never want that fund to go overfunded because as the last person winds up getting their check, there's no easy way to get any excess money out of that. So we purposefully manage that to be slightly underfunded. We're not even -- to be underfunded because some day rates will go up, and I don't want to put a bunch of money in now and then wake up in 5 years and have the fund be overfunded because I can't do anything with it."

And I think this year, we'll end up opening 4 or 5 stores in Chicago on a base of 30-some stores. So very aggressive capital plan there."

Relative to the commercial paper, you'll probably see us maintain commercial paper in that range. It's the easiest way, particularly with where commercial paper rates are today. It's the easiest way for us to get exposure to floating rates. If you want to modify your exposure to floating rates quickly, it's easiest to do that with commercial paper because assuming the markets are open, I can always term it out.
