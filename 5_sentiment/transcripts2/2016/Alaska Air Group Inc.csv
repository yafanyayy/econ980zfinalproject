Thank you for joining us for Alaska Air Group's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2015 Earnings Call.
On the call today, our CEO Brad Tilden, will provide an overview of the business; our Chief Commercial Officer, Andrew Harrison, will share the revenue results for the fourth quarter and full year; and then Bran Pedersen, our CFO, will discuss our financial results for 2015 and outlook for 2016.
Several members of our senior management team are also on hand to help answer your questions.
As a reminder, our comments today will include forward-looking statements regarding our future expectations, which may differ significantly from actual results. Information or risk factors that could affect our business can be found in our SEC filings.
We will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures such as adjusted earnings and unit costs, excluding fuel. We have provided a reconciliation between the most directly comparable GAAP and non-GAAP measures in our earnings release.
This morning, Alaska Air Group reported a fourth quarter GAAP net profit of $191 million. Excluding mark-to-market fuel hedge losses and certain other items that netted to $5 million, the company recorded fourth quarter 2015 net income of $186 million or $1.46 per diluted share. This result compares to First Call estimate of $1.40 per share and exceeds last year's adjusted net income of $125 million or $0.94 per diluted share.
For the full year, Air Group reported a record adjusted net profit of $842 million, that's up 47%. Earnings per share grew 56% to $6.51 per share, with the incremental growth driven by the significant number of shares repurchased during the year. Additional information about cost expectations, capacity plans, fuel hedging, capital expenditures and other items can be found in our investor update, included in our Form 8-K issued this morning and available on our website at alaskaair.com.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Brad."

I'm sure you've all seen our results by now and have seen that 2015 was a record year on almost every front. While every airline has benefited from low fuel prices, Alaska led the industry in many of the underlying drivers of financial performance. Areas like operational reliability, customer satisfaction, customer growth and low fares, low costs. These are the areas that represent our competitive advantage or our economic mode, and they're also the reasons that our financial performance is what it is. I'd like to start the call by covering a few of these areas.
For safety, we reduced what we call our risk level 3 events dramatically over the last 5 years. And over the same time period, our lost time injuries are down more than 25%. We're by no means perfect. And safety events, no matter how small, remind us of the enormous responsibility we have towards our customers, our employees and their families. And again, our focus on doing things safely is also a focus on doing things right, and that benefits everyone. 
Operationally, Alaska leads the industry. Notwithstanding a tough December at Horizon, 86.1% of our flights in 2015 arrived on time, and that resulted in Alaska being named the #1 North American carrier by FlightStats for the sixth straight years. We also led the industry with the fewest number of customer complaints, and our completion rate of 99.5% was second among the 9 largest domestic airlines. This performance led to the Wall Street Journal ranking us the top airline for the third year in a row and for the fourth out of the last 5 years.
I want to thank Ben and Dave, together with their operational leaders and all of our frontline employees, for their focus on getting it right with more than 900 flights every single day.
Moving to the next item. In 2015, our internal measure of customer satisfaction reached a new record high of 86%, a 2-point implement over last year and a remarkable 16-point increase since we began collecting this data in 2007. We know that satisfying customers have contributed to record growth in both our Mileage Plan and our credit card. Considering how established these programs are, these record growth rates are extraordinary and they are huge credit to our people.
And we've spoken to you in the past about Beyond Service, a 2-day customer service workshop for our frontline employees. We've now completed all 66 classes. Long-time company leaders: Andy Schneider, Diana Shaw and Jeff Butler, led this fantastic effort. And I want to both thank and congratulate them and their teams who put in countless hours putting these classes together. I believe this program is already moving the needle in terms of how we focus on our customers.
On the labor front, with our new dispatcher contracts, we are the only U.S. airline to have no open contracts at this time. The weighted average duration of our agreement is almost 3 years, which compares very favorably to the rest of the industry. 
As folks have said before, the airline business is the ultimate team sport. And for an airline to run well, the team has to work together. As you know, this is an area where we spent a lot of time, and our people are incredibly proud of what they've built at Alaska. Or employee engagement store -- scores and our top 100 ranking in the Forbes Employer Survey are a testament to this.
We're also very proud that when our company does well, our employees benefit. Every employee at our group participates in the same gainsharing plan, which we call PVP. This program, combined with our monthly operational bonus programs, will pay out a record $120 million this year, with $98 million of this being paid to our employees tomorrow. This is the seventh consecutive year where our employees will get a full month's pay in performance bonuses. This alignment is very powerful, and we believe it will do nothing but benefit us in future years.
So those areas combined with our low fares and low costs, our strong balance sheet and are simple and profitable fleet represent our competitive advantage. Or performance in these areas, together with low fuel prices, drove our financial results. And I'd like to highlight those now.
As Lavanya said, our net income for the quarter was $186 million, up 49% from 2014. And for the year, it was $842 million, up 47%. Our pretax margin expanded 680 basis points to 24% for the year, and our ROIC for the trailing 12 months of 25.2% is more than 3x our cost to capital.
We expect these results will put our pretax margin and ROIC both in the top 10% of the S&P 500. Our cash flows from operations were almost $1.6 billion. Free cash flow was $760 million. And of this total, over $600 million was returned to shareholders. We bought back 5.5% of our stock this year, and we bought back 35% since 2007. 
We were very excited to announce this morning our third dividend [indiscernible]. Our dividend yield is 1.6%, bringing us closer to our goal of having a dividend that assembles high-quality industrials. 
And with respect to the quality and diversity of our route network, I thought you might be interested in knowing that even if we adjusted our fuel prices to $3 a gallon, markets representing 95% of our revenue would still be profitable.
2015 was a great year for all of our constituents: Customers, employees, communities and owners. And as you know, this continues a longer-term trend. So we feel good our about our performance. There's obviously some concern in the industry about the revenue environment. And on that score, I would like to say that we're quite optimistic about 2016, and we feel good about both our geographies and our customer segments. 90% of our revenue is generated in the domestic U.S. market, which is a good place to be. And 2/3 of our revenue has a leisure focus, which is more resilient in the downturn and more stable to the cycle.
As we move forward in 2016, we're focused on a number of new initiatives, which will -- which we expect will bring value to both customers and shareholders. These include: Launching our new premium economy product; continuing to reconfigure our fleet, with renewal of the 737 fleet at Alaska and preparation for the possible introduction of regional jets at Horizon; growing the 20 new markets that we added in 2015; enhancing our alliance relationships, primarily in the international arena; better marketing our Mileage Plan and credit card, which have new benefits for members; and finally, further lowering our cost structure and making our feed advantage better known to customers.
As I close, I want to thank our team of 15,000 people for an incredible year. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Andrew."
248501,321222567,919916,"Alaska Air Group, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 21, 2016",2016-01-21,"Earnings Calls","Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Brad, and good morning, everyone.

We were very pleased with our 2015 passenger revenue, which grew 4.7%. This is in contrast to the industry's revenue decline of 1%. We were within 1 point of industry unit revenue performance, despite competitive capacity headwinds of 12%. For the fourth quarter, our revenue was up 5.5% against a backdrop of 9% increase in competitive capacity. That drove our PRASM down 6.6%, but well within our expectations.
We added 18 new markets in the second half of 2015, and 11 of those were in the fourth quarter. This is the largest number of new markets added in any single quarter in over a decade. And we understand there continue to be questions around our growth, so we went back and looked at a few data points that I want to share with you. These reinforce for us that we continue to take the right actions.
First, our launch of 20 new markets over the last year brings our total North America destinations served from Seattle to 86. That's more than 2x our closest competitor at 39. And this creates the best schedule utility for customers in Seattle in the Pacific Northwest.
Second, notwithstanding a competitive onslaught, our growth has helped us maintain our Seattle market share at 51%. This is unchanged from 3 years ago, and our Seattle hub is performing exceptionally well.
Third. Our new markets are maturing quickly. The portfolio of new markets launched in the last 12 months are profitable. More importantly, half of these markets have only operated for 1 quarter, being our seasonally weakest Q4.
And then finally, as we highlighted at Investor Day, over the last 5 years, we've added 90 new markets, grown capacity at a compounded annual growth rate of 7.6% and revenue at 7.9%. Industry's revenue grew at a rate of less than 3% over the same period.
If you're asking, Andrew, what is your point here? The point is this. Our total capacity growth over the past 5 years accounts for $1.8 billion or 1/3 of our revenues. Margins on this revenue are in line with system average. Said another way, or earnings per share would be approximately $2 lower than what we've reported today had we decided to keep capacity flat.
The bottom line is this. Growth has been good for our customers, our employees and unquestionably, for our shareholders. And we believe that a thoughtful growth as a low-cost carrier that enjoys strong customer loyalty will increase our network utility, diversifying our revenue base and create durable earnings streams. These outcomes far outweigh the short-term impact of PRASM comps, which we're experiencing today and we will likely see through the first half of 2016.
Moving to the performance of the broader commercial business. Our partnerships are growing. Over the last year, we provided our customers with access to an incremental 60 international destinations and 3,600 flights per day, on which to earn and redeem miles. In fact, passengers on Alaska metal coming from Hainan, Icelandair and Emirates increased 43% in the fourth quarter as a result of our new agreements, coupled with our partners' expanded service.
Customer loyalty is growing at unprecedented rates even in the face of competition. Active Mileage Plan members are up 15.5% this year, outstripping passenger growth of 8.9%. This is the second consecutive year of double-digit growth in our Mileage Plan members. More impressive, our elite members grew 19%, pointing to increased stickiness with our brand. And our credit card members increased 11.6%, making 2015 the strongest year for cardmember growth since we started tracking this data.
Our program generated nearly $700 million of cash flow in 2015 and will continue to grow 2016. A very important initiative that we announced at Investor Day in December that will further grow our revenue. 
First, we'll introduce our premium costs product on our 737s and our regional jets, adding at least $85 million in annual profit by 2018. We'll start to retrofit existing aircraft in the second half of 2016 and will complete 75 aircraft by year-end.
Second. Our new agreement with Bank of America will add $60 million in new annual revenue, starting in the first quarter of '16. And our affinity Visa card offers industry-leading benefits like no first-bag fee, no international transaction costs, a companion fare and the lowest annual fee amongst comparable cards. We are confident that our card will remain top of wallet for existing cardholders and help us continue to grow the cardholder base and related revenues.
And then finally, we'll be adding 2 more regional jets to our network this month to fill a market need for an aircraft that can serve longer-haul markets with demands that doesn't justify 737. We'll also be replacing our HCI AJ 700 with Embraer 175s, as they have an 8.5% more capacity and allow us to sell premium seats and give us greater range. This is an area where we think we have plenty of room for profitable growth in 2016 and beyond. The 4 markets we've launched thus far are already profitable with 6 months -- within 6 months of launch. And Brandon's going to talk a bit more about this in a moment.
Looking forward at capacity growth. Q1 is expected to be up 13.5%, given a heavy new delivery schedule that meet us down to 10.8% as we enter the seasonally strongest second quarter and we move to retire our 737-400s.
Today, I am reiterating our 2016 full year growth expectation of 8%. We expect growth in the second half of 2016 to be in the neighborhood of 5%.
Moving to competitive capacity. Other realign capacity, competitive capacity is expected to be up 13% and 12% in Q1 and Q2, respectively. To reiterate what Brad said, we're optimistic about 2016. Underlying demand in our geography is strong. New markets continue to deliver. And loyalty and credit card programs are growing. New revenue initiatives we're implementing will deliver an annual run rate of $150 million. This gives us confidence that our growth is sound and that we will continue to deliver on shareholder returns.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Brandon."

As Brad said, fourth quarter adjusted earnings grew by 49% to $186 million, and earnings per share grew by 55% to $1.46 per share. The record fourth quarter result brings our full year net profit to $842 million",1155,"Thanks, Andrew, and good morning, everyone. As Brad said, fourth quarter adjusted earnings grew by 49% to $186 million, and earnings per share grew by 55% to $1.46 per share. The record fourth quarter result brings our full year net profit to $842 million and earnings per share to $6.51 per share.
Earnings per share has almost doubled since 2012, even in the face of unprecedented competition in our Seattle hub since that time.
Similarly, our after-tax return on invested capital has grown from 13% in 2012 to 25.2% this year. Our net operating profit has more than doubled over that period, yet our invested capital base has grown by only 11%. We expect our ROIC to lead about 90% of the companies in the S&P 500 and all but 10 industrials in the index.
Fourth quarter pretax profit grew by $86 million led by a $100 -- $100 million decline in economic fuel costs. We recognized that low fuel prices will probably not last forever, so we remain focused in creating a permanent sustainable advantage by lowering nonfuel unit costs and increasing the fuel efficiency of our fleet.
Fourth quarter x fuel unit costs defined by another 1.3%, bringing full year nonfuel unit costs down 8/10 of a percent. 2015 marks the sixth year in a row of nonfuel unit cost reduction and the 13th year out of the last 14 for the mainline.
Looking ahead into 2016, we expect nonfuel unit costs to be down 1% on the 8% ASM growth, consistent with our Investor Day guidance.
More offers and thoughts on that track record. Every year now for 14 years, we've been chipping away unit costs. And while each year -- in each individual year, like 0.5% or 1.5% of cost reduction doesn't sound like a lot, the cumulative impact is enormous, especially when the competition has unit costs that are growing, albeit slowly. Because of that focus on productivity, our emphasis on lower overhead and a general culture of frugality that's growing through our group, our cost structure today looks a lot like the low-cost carriers and its nearly 25% lower than the legacy carriers. And if you include fuel and nonoperating expenses, our cost gap widens to 36%. To borrow Brad space that he used on Investor Day, our economic moat is getting wider and it's giving us confidence about the sustainability of our results.
As we mentioned, we remain focus on having one of the most fuel-efficient fleets in the industry. In 2015, our fuel efficiency on an ASM per gallon basis improved by another 2%, with much of that coming from the delivery during the year of 11 737-900ERs and the installation of split-scimitar winglets across the majority of the Boeing fleet. This year's improvement extends the cumulative fuel efficiency improvement over the last 10 years to 24%. And the trend should continue in 2016, as we take delivery of 19 new 737-900ERs, phaseout 13 older less-efficient and maintenance intensive 737-400s and add longer-stage length to regional flying.
And speaking of regional flying. Andrew mentioned in the -- Andrew mentioned the profitable growth opportunities we see with large regional jets. In order to fund that growth and to replace 15 Q400s that are scheduled for lease return in 2018, we're in the final phase of a regional jet campaign. It's likely that we'll place an order for 30 large regional jets in the first quarter of 2016, with delivery starting in 2017, if we can reach acceptable commercial terms with the parties involved. Our intent is for those jets to be flown by Horizon if our pilots and flight attendants approved changes to their collective-bargaining agreements that will make them cost competitive with other CPA providers. Voting is taking place now.
SkyWest does a great job operating regional jets for us today and will continue to operate them in our network despite us potentially bringing some of that jet flying back in-house.
Alaska ended the year with $1.3 billion in cash. Operating cash flow increased by 54% to almost $1.6 billion. 2015 marks the second year in a row of operating cash flow in excess of $1 billion. CapEx was just under $800 million, resulting in free cash flow of almost $800 million. We used that considerable free cash flow to buy back 7.2 million shares of our common stock or about 5.5% of the shares outstanding. It's noteworthy that going back to 2007, we've bought back 35% of the company.
In addition, we paid $102 million in dividends, bringing total return to shareholders to $607 million. Our announcement today that we're increasing our dividends by 38% reaffirms our board's confidence in the sustainability of our cash flows is consistent with our goal of creating a track record of dividend increases like other high-quality industrial companies and makes Alaska the highest dealing stock among U.S. airlines that pay a regular dividend.
Normal principal payments of $116 million brought our long-term debt balance to $686 million. We're now in a $300 million net cash position even after including operating leases. Alaska's adjusted debt-to-cap ratio stands at 27%. This compares with the media and S&P 500 debt-to-cap ratio of 45%. We have 78 unencumbered mainline aircraft and 86 unencumbered aircraft overall. Our pensions are 92% funded on a GAAP basis, and we have no required contributions again in 2016. Alaska remains 1 of only 2 U.S. airlines to have an investment-grade balance sheet.
And of course, in a rising interest rate environment, our low debt levels will further widen our cost GAAP versus competitors who are more highly leveraged. We expect to generate very strong cash flow again in 2016. We currently project CapEx to be $705 million next year, including options, but excluding CapEx associated with a regional jet order, which could add up to $90 million next year, bringing the total close to $800 million, using consensus estimates that would imply free cash flow of nearly $650 million and free cash flow yield of over 7%.
We still expect to return more capital to owners in 2016 than we did in 2015, both through our higher dividends and through share buybacks. We have $880 million remaining on our $1 billion repurchase authorization.
As we enter 2016, our business is working well. We're safe. We run the most reliable operation in the business. We're delivering award-winning service. Customer preference has never been higher, our labor relations are excellent and contracts have an average length of just under 3 years. Our costs are low, and they're getting lower. Our investment-grade balance sheet is getting stronger. Our new cash flow streams are earnings accretive. We're returning record amounts of cash to our shareholders. And more importantly, and most importantly, our people are engaged, and we're confident in their ability to continue to do great things in 2016.
And with that, we'd like to open up to questions that you may have."

I think what I would share with you is in 2015, and I think we've sort of been transparent here, is that apart of that was bringing forward some of the growth to continue to grow Seattle at a higher rate than we initially planned today. But as we move into 2016, and yes, we're a little higher in the first quarter, we're getting a lot of deliveries this year. We're getting 19 [ph] ERs. They're heavily loaded to the front end and we don't stop pushing out our 400s to the middle of the year and there's 13 of those. So we're a little higher in the first half of the year than we'd like to. But as we move into the back part of the year, I think we're going to be around 5% or so. And the other thing is we have a lot of MOD lines going now putting ATG for WiFi own as well as mods for premium economy. So we're going to be using a lot of that aircraft to get all that done by the end of the year. So I feel fairly comfortable about where we sit today with our capacity guidance."

In terms of the broader strategy, what we're -- goes back to something maybe what Brad said, which is we're going to do the right thing for Alaska. We do have a profit hurdle internally. Most of our markets are well above that. Most of our markets would be well above that at $3 a fuel.

And again, I think our -- to get your point about margin compression. Alaska's financial performance comes from our competitive advantage. It doesn't come from international exchange rate or Brazilian currency. It comes from us having a cost structure that's 36% lower than the other guys when you factor in fuel and interest costs. It comes from the fact that customers prefer to fly with us. We have incredible loyalty at Seattle. It comes from very strong balance sheet, the right fleet.

And I thi",433,"Jim, this is Joe Sprague, and I just got back from Juneau late last night, people are pointing at me to take this one, so I'll give it a shot. I know there's some question about oil activity, oil business related activity in the State of Alaska. And I think the first thing I would just say is despite Alaska, the state being known for its oil reserves and its oil production, our exposure on that front is actually relatively small. We get business, oil-related business obviously flying our scheduled flight up to the crude oil bay. And then we get additional oil-related business because there's so many oilfield workers that actually live outside of Alaska and commute to work. And so we do get revenue from that activity. I would say it's fairly stable. A lot of the oilfield production workers, although production is declining, those oilfields still require the same amount of workers to sort of operate the drills and the pipelines and so forth. And so it's actually a very stable business. I think that we probably will see a bit of a reduction in the exploration for new oil deposits, but that's a much smaller portion of our overall oil portfolio. So bottom line is I think that our exposure on the oil side is minimal and stable. Beyond that obviously the state is having some issues because of the fact that they get most of the state revenue from oil reserves, oil royalties and so forth. And so there's a lot of question about this permanent fund dividend check that all of the state residents receive. However, that's tied more to overall market performance at this point than it is to oil prices. So ironically, in 2015, the PND check that all residents received was over $2,000, and that was actually up from 2014. So some of the proposals floating around in the legislature might take that number down. It won't eliminate it by any means. And I think as you look at some of the other factors for travel in the State of Alaska, a lot of the intra-Alaska travel by residence is nondiscretionary because they just -- they have to go. There's no roads in a lot of cases. And then another big driver over the course of the year for traveling in the State of Alaska's is tourism, which is actually up. They had their best year ever in 2015 and then expecting another good year in 2016. So all in all, I think we see of fairly stable demand in the State of Alaska."

So if we're trying to really isolate the incremental revenue headwinds from Delta, it seems like the damage has mostly been done. But first, is my analysis close or correct? And then secondly, what do we really need to keep in mind because the competitive growth, the growth in competitive capacity sounds a lot worse than what it might actually be as I look at the underlying data."

On the call today, our CEO Brad Tilden, will provide an overview of the business; our Chief Commercial Officer, Andrew Harrison, will share the revenue results for the fourth quarter and full year; and then Bran Pedersen, our CFO, will discuss our financial results for 2015 and outlook for 2016.
Several members of our senior management team are also on hand to help answer your questions.
As a reminder, our comments today will include forward-looking statements regarding our future expectations, which may differ significantly from actual results. Information or risk factors that could affect our business can be found in our SEC filings.
We will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures such as adjusted earnings and unit costs, excluding fuel. We have provided a reconciliation between the most directly comparable GAAP and non-GAAP measures in our earnings release.
This morning, Alaska Air Group reported a fourth quarter GAAP net profit of $191 million. Excluding mark-to-market fuel hedge losses and certain other items that netted to $5 million, the company recorded fourth quarter 2015 net income of $186 million or $1.46 per diluted share. This result compares to First Call estimate of $1.40 per share and exceeds last year's adjusted net income of $125 million or $0.94 per diluted share.
For the full year, Air Group reported a record adjusted net profit of $842 million, that's up 47%. Earnings per share grew 56% to $6.51 per share, with the incremental growth driven by the significant number of shares repurchased during the year. Additional information about cost expectations, capacity plans, fuel hedging, capital expenditures and other items can be found in our investor update included in our Form 8-K issued this morning and available on our website at alaskaair.com.

I'm sure you've all seen our results by now and have seen that 2015 was a record year on almost every front. While every airline has benefited from low fuel prices, Alaska led the industry in many of the underlying drivers of financial performance. Areas like operational reliability, customer satisfaction, customer growth and low fares, low costs. These are the areas that represent our competitive advantage or our economic moat, and they're also the reasons that our financial performance is what it is. I'd like to start the call by covering a few of these areas.
First, safety. We reduced what we call our risk level 3 events dramatically over the last 5 years. And over the same time period, our lost time injuries are down more than 25%. We're by no means perfect. And safety events, no matter how small, remind us of the enormous responsibility we have towards our customers, our employees and their families. And again, a focus on doing things safely is also a focus on doing things right, and that benefits everyone.
Operationally, Alaska leads the industry. Notwithstanding a tough December at Horizon, 86.1% of our flights in 2015 arrived on time, and that resulted in Alaska being named the #1 North American carrier by FlightStats for the sixth straight years. We also led the industry with the fewest number of customer complaints, and our completion rate of 99.5% was second among the 9 largest domestic airlines. This performance led to the Wall Street Journal ranking us the top airline for the third year in a row and for the fourth out of the last 5 years.
I want to thank Ben and Dave, together with their operational leaders and all of our frontline employees, for their focus on getting it right with more than 900 flights every single day.
Moving to the next item. In 2015, our internal measure of customer satisfaction reached a new record high of 86%, a 2-point improvement over last year and a remarkable 16-point increase since we began collecting this data in 2007. We know that satisfying customers have contributed to record growth in both our Mileage Plan and our credit card. Considering how established these programs are, these record growth rates are extraordinary, and they are huge credit to our people.
And we've spoken to you in the past about Beyond Service, a 2-day customer service workshop for our frontline employees. We've now completed all 66 classes. Long-time company leaders Andy Schneider, Diana Shaw and Jeff Butler led this fantastic effort. And I want to both thank and congratulate them and their teams who put in countless hours putting these classes together. I believe this program is already moving the needle in terms of how we focus on our customers.
On the labor front, with our new dispatcher contracts, we are the only U.S. airline to have no open contracts at this time. The weighted average duration of our agreements is almost 3 years, which compares very favorably to the rest of the industry.
As folks have said before, the airline business is the ultimate team sport. And for an airline to run well, the team has to work together. As you know, this is an area where we spent a lot of time, and our people are incredibly proud of what they've built at Alaska. Or employee engagement store -- scores and our top 100 ranking in the Forbes employer survey are a testament to this.
We're also very proud that when our company does well, our employees benefit. Every employee at Air Group participates in the same gain-sharing plan, which we call PBP. This program, combined with our monthly operational bonus program, will pay out a record $120 million this year, with $98 million of this being paid to our employees tomorrow. This is the seventh consecutive year where our employees will get a full month's pay in performance bonuses. This alignment is very powerful, and we believe it will do nothing but benefit us in future years.
So those areas, combined with our low fares and low costs, our strong balance sheet and our simple and profitable fleet, represent our competitive advantage. Our performance in these areas, together with low fuel prices, drove our financial results. And I'd like to highlight those now.
As Lavanya said, our net income for the quarter was $186 million, up 49% from 2014. And for the year, it was $842 million, up 47%. Our pretax margin expanded 680 basis points to 24% for the year, and our ROIC for the trailing 12 months of 25.2% is more than 3x our cost of capital.
We expect these results will put our pretax margin and ROIC both in the top 10% of the S&P 500. Our cash flows from operations were almost $1.6 billion. Free cash flow was $760 million. And of this total, over $600 million was returned to shareholders. We bought back 5.5% of our stock this year, and we bought back 35% since 2007.
We were very excited to announce this morning our third dividend event [ph]. Our dividend yield is 1.6%, bringing us closer to our goal of having a dividend that resembles high-quality industrials.
And with respect to the quality and diversity of our route network, I thought you might be interested in knowing that even if we adjusted our fuel prices to $3 a gallon, markets representing 95% of our revenue would still be profitable.
2015 was a great year for all of our constituents: customers, employees, communities and owners. And as you know, this continues a longer-term trend. So we feel good about our performance. There's obviously some concern in the industry about the revenue environment. And on that score, I would like to say that we're quite optimistic about 2016, and we feel good about both our geographies and our customer segments. 90% of our revenue is generated in the domestic U.S. market, which is a good place to be. And 2/3 of our revenue has a leisure focus, which is more resilient in a downturn and more stable through the cycle.
As we move forward in 2016, we're focused on a number of new initiatives, which will -- which we expect will bring value to both customers and shareholders. These include: launching our new premium economy product; continuing to reconfigure our fleet, with renewal of the 737 fleet at Alaska and preparation for the possible introduction of regional jets at Horizon; growing the 20 new markets that we added in 2015; enhancing our alliance relationships, primarily in the international arena; better marketing our Mileage Plan and credit card, which have new benefits for members; and finally, further lowering our cost structure and making our fare advantage better known to customers.
As I close, I want to thank our team of 15,000 people for an incredible year. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Andrew."
248501,321222567,919993,"Alaska Air Group, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 21, 2016",2016-01-21,"Earnings Calls","Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Brad, and good morning, everyone.

We were very pleased with our 2015 passenger revenue, which grew 4.7%. This is in contrast to the industry's revenue decline of 1%. We were within 1 point of industry unit revenue performance, despite competitive capacity headwinds of 12%. For the fourth quarter, our revenue was up 5.5% against a backdrop of 9% increase in competitive capacity. That drove our PRASM down 6.6% but well within our expectations.
We added 18 new markets in the second half of 2015, and 11 of those were in the fourth quarter. This is the largest number of new markets added in any single quarter in over a decade. And we understand there continue to be questions around our growth, so we went back and looked at a few data points that I want to share with you. These reinforce for us that we continue to take the right actions.
First, our launch of 20 new markets over the last year brings our total North America destinations served from Seattle to 86. That's more than 2x our closest competitor at 39. And this creates the best schedule utility for customers in Seattle and the Pacific Northwest.
Second, notwithstanding a competitive onslaught, our growth has helped us maintain our Seattle market share at 51%. This is unchanged from 3 years ago, and our Seattle hub is performing exceptionally well.
Third, our new markets are maturing quickly. The portfolio of new markets launched in the last 12 months are profitable. More importantly, half of these markets have only operated for 1 quarter, being our seasonally weakest, Q4.
And then finally, as we highlighted at Investor Day, over the last 5 years, we've added 90 new markets, grown capacity at a compounded annual growth rate of 7.6% and revenue at 7.9%. Industry's revenue grew at a rate of less than 3% over the same period.
If you're asking, ""Andrew, what is your point here?"" The point is this. Our total capacity growth over the past 5 years accounts for $1.8 billion or 1/3 of our revenues. Margins on this revenue are in line with system average. Said another way, our earnings per share would be approximately $2 lower than what we've reported today had we decided to keep capacity flat.
The bottom line is this. Growth has been good for our customers, our employees and unquestionably, for our shareholders. And we believe that a thoughtful growth as a low-cost carrier that enjoys strong customer loyalty will increase our network utility, diversify our revenue base and create durable earning streams. These outcomes far outweigh the short-term impact of RASM comps, which we're experiencing today, and we will likely see through the first half of 2016.
Moving to the performance of the broader commercial business. Our partnerships are growing. Over the last year, we provided our customers with access to an incremental 60 international destinations and 3,600 flights per day, on which to earn and redeem miles. In fact, passengers on Alaska metal coming from Hainan, Icelandair and Emirates increased 43% in the fourth quarter as a result of our new agreements, coupled with our partners' expanded service.
Customer loyalty is growing at unprecedented rates even in the face of competition. Active Mileage Plan members are up 15.5% this year, outstripping passenger growth of 8.9%. This is the second consecutive year of double-digit growth in our Mileage Plan members. More impressive, our elite members grew 19%, pointing to increased stickiness with our brand. And our credit card members increased 11.6%, making 2015 the strongest year for card member growth since we started tracking this data.
Our [indiscernible] program generated nearly $700 million of cash flow in 2015 and will continue to grow in 2016. A very important initiative that we announced at Investor Day in December that will further grow our revenue.
First, we'll introduce a premium cost product on our 737s and our regional jets, adding at least $85 million in annual profit by 2018. We'll start to retrofit existing aircraft in the second half of 2016 and will complete 75 aircraft by year-end.
Second, our new agreement with Bank of America will add $60 million in new annual revenue starting in the first quarter of '16. And our Affinity Visa card offers industry-leading benefits like no first-bag fee, no international transaction costs, a companion fare and the lowest annual fee amongst comparable cards. We are confident that our card will remain top of wallet for existing holders and help us continue to grow the cardholder base and related revenues.
And then finally, we'll be adding 2 more regional jets to our network this month to fill a market need for an aircraft that can serve longer-haul markets with demands that doesn't justify 737. We'll also be replacing our 8 CRJ-700 with Embraer 175s, as they have an 8.5% more capacity and allow us to sell premium seats and give us greater range. This is an area where we think we have plenty of room for profitable growth in 2016 and beyond. The 4 markets we launched thus far are already profitable with 6 months -- within 6 months of launch. And Brandon's going to talk a bit more about this in a moment.
Looking forward at capacity growth. Q1 is expected to be up 13.5%, given a heavy new delivery schedule that led us down to 10.8% as we enter the seasonally strongest second quarter and we move to retire our 737-400s.
Today, I am reiterating our 2016 full year growth expectation of 8%. We expect growth in the second half of 2016 to be in the neighborhood of 5%.
Moving to competitive capacity. Other airline capacity, competitive capacity is expected to be up 13% and 12% in Q1 and Q2, respectively. To reiterate what Brad said, we're optimistic about 2016. Underlying demand in our geography is strong. New markets continue to deliver. And loyalty and credit card programs are growing. New revenue initiatives we're implementing will deliver an annual run rate of $150 million. This gives us confidence that our growth is sound and that we will continue to deliver on shareholder returns.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Brandon."

As Brad said, fourth quarter adjusted earnings grew by 49% to $186 million, and earnings per share grew by 55% to $1.46 per share. The record fourth quarter result brings our full year net profit to $842 million",1152,"Thanks, Andrew, and good morning, everyone. As Brad said, fourth quarter adjusted earnings grew by 49% to $186 million, and earnings per share grew by 55% to $1.46 per share. The record fourth quarter result brings our full year net profit to $842 million and earnings per share to $6.51 per share.
Earnings per share has almost doubled since 2012, even in the face of unprecedented competition in our Seattle hub since that time.
Similarly, our after-tax return on invested capital has grown from 13% in 2012 to 25.2% this year. Our net operating profit has more than doubled over that period, yet our invested capital base has grown by only 11%. We expect our ROIC to lead about 90% of the companies in the S&P 500 and all but 10 industrials in the index.
Fourth quarter pretax profit grew by $86 million led by a $100 million decline in economic fuel costs. We recognized that low fuel prices will probably not last forever, so we remain focused on creating a permanent sustainable advantage by lowering nonfuel unit costs and increasing the fuel efficiency of our fleet.
Fourth quarter ex fuel unit costs declined by another 1.3%, bringing full year nonfuel unit costs down 0.8%. 2015 marks the sixth year in a row of nonfuel unit cost reduction and the 13th year out of the last 14 for the mainline.
Looking ahead into 2016, we expect nonfuel unit costs to be down 1% on the 8% ASM growth, consistent with our Investor Day guidance.
I might offer some thoughts on that track record. Every year now for 14 years, we've been chipping away unit costs. And while each year -- in each individual year, like 0.5% or 1.5% of cost reduction doesn't sound like a lot, the cumulative impact is enormous, especially when the competition has unit costs that are growing, albeit slowly. Because of that focus on productivity, our emphasis on low overhead and a general culture of frugality that's growing through our group, our cost structure today looks a lot like the low-cost carriers and it's nearly 25% lower than the legacy carriers. And if you include fuel and nonoperating expenses, our cost gap widens to 36%. To borrow Brad's phrase that he used on Investor Day, our economic moat is getting wider and it's giving us confidence about the sustainability of our results.
As we mentioned, we remain focused on having one of the most fuel-efficient fleets in the industry. In 2015, our fuel efficiency on an ASM per gallon basis improved by another 2%, with much of that coming from [indiscernible] The delivery during the year of 11 737-900ERs and the installation of split-scimitar winglets across the majority of the Boeing fleet. This year's improvement extends the cumulative fuel efficiency improvement over the last 10 years to 24%. And the trend should continue in 2016, as we take delivery of 19 new 737-900ERs, phaseout 13 older, less-efficient and maintenance intensive 737-400s and add longer-stage length to regional flying.
And speaking of regional flying. Andrew mentioned in the -- Andrew mentioned the profitable growth opportunities we see with large regional jets. In order to fund that growth and replace 15 Q400s that are scheduled for lease return in 2018, we're in the final phase of a regional jet campaign. It's likely that we'll place an order for 30 large regional jets in the first quarter of 2016, with delivery starting in 2017, if we can reach acceptable commercial terms with the parties involved. Our intent is for those jets to be flown by Horizon if our pilots and flight attendants approve changes to their collective bargaining agreements that will make them cost-competitive with other CPA providers. Voting is taking place now.
SkyWest does a great job operating regional jets for us today, and they'll continue to operate them in our network despite us potentially bringing some of that jet flying back in-house.
Alaska ended the year with $1.3 billion in cash. Operating cash flow increased by 54% to almost $1.6 billion. 2015 marks the second year in a row of operating cash flow in excess of $1 billion. CapEx was just under $800 million, resulting in free cash flow of almost $800 million. We used that considerable free cash flow to buy back 7.2 million shares of our common stock or about 5.5% of the shares outstanding. It's noteworthy that going back to 2007, we've bought back 35% of the company.
In addition, we paid $102 million in dividends, bringing total return to shareholders to $607 million. Our announcement today that we're increasing our dividends by 38% reaffirms our board's confidence in the sustainability of our cash flows, is consistent with our goal of creating a track record of dividend increases like other high-quality industrial companies and makes Alaska the highest yielding stock among U.S. airlines that pay a regular dividend.
Normal principal payments of $116 million brought our long-term debt balance to $686 million. We're now in a $300 million net cash position even after including operating leases. Alaska's adjusted debt-to-cap ratio stands at 27%. This compares with the media and S&P 500 debt-to-cap ratio of 45%. We have 78 unencumbered mainline aircraft and 86 unencumbered aircraft overall. Our pensions are 92% funded on a GAAP basis, and we have no required contributions again in 2016. Alaska remains 1 of only 2 U.S. airlines to have an investment-grade balance sheet.
And of course, in a rising interest rate environment, our low debt levels will further widen our cost GAAP versus competitors who are more highly leveraged. We expect to generate very strong cash flow again in 2016. We currently project CapEx to be $705 million next year, including options but excluding CapEx associated with a regional jet order, which could add up to $90 million next year, bringing the total close to $800 million. Using consensus estimates, that would imply free cash flow of nearly $650 million and free cash flow yield of over 7%.
We still expect to return more capital to owners in 2016 than we did in 2015, both through our higher dividend and through share buybacks. We have $880 million remaining on our $1 billion repurchase authorization.
As we enter 2016, our business is working well. We're safe. We run the most reliable operation in the business. We're delivering award-winning service. Customer preference has never been higher, our labor relations are excellent and contracts have an average length of just under 3 years. Our costs are low, and they're getting lower. Our investment-grade balance sheet is getting stronger. Our new cash flow streams are earnings accretive. We're returning record amounts of cash to our shareholders. And more importantly, and most importantly, our people are engaged, and we're confident in their ability to continue to do great things in 2016.
And with that, we'd like to open it up to questions that you may have."

The Q400 has been a great airplane for us, and it works well in the short-stage length around the Pacific Northwest, but I think there's an opportunity to tap into lots of new revenue opportunities with the regional jets by bringing some of those in-house."

They're heavily loaded to the front end, and we don't stop pushing out our 400s to the middle of the year, and there's 13 of those. So we're a little higher in the first half of the year than we'd like to. But as we move into the back part of the year, I think we're going to be around 5% or so. And the other thing is we have a lot of mod lines going now putting ATG4, WiFi own as well as mods for premium economy.

Our sort of history with this, albeit small, certainly out of Portland, where we face ULCC competition, is we haven't felt the need to use those types of products. We think our customers not only appreciate the superior products we have, but recognize we have already very low fares.

When we think about the RASM declines at Alaska, they are comparatively unique to those at the industry in that they're mostly representative of the increased competition as opposed to the elimination of fuel surcharges, a strong dollar, a crappy Brazil and so forth. Fuel is obviously a blessing for you here. But if and when fuel escalates, your competitors are actually going to be picking up RASM along the way that you won't save maybe for budgets improving in the State of Alaska. So I'm just wondering if you're content with what appears to be a virtual guarantee of significant margin compression if fuel begins to escalate? And if you're not, does that alter your view on the optimal network contract and/or your opinion on consolidation?"

And what I would say is that no public company can report record earnings quarter after quarter after quarter. And the other thing I would say is that we're generating really, really, really outstanding returns right now. If fuel goes up, I think it is possible that you could see margins come down. In terms of the broader strategy, what we're -- goes back to something maybe that Brad said, which is we're going to do the right thing for Alaska. We do have a profit hurdle internally. Most of our markets are well above that. Most of our markets would be well above that at $3 a fuel. And so we're going to continue to -- we are very satisfied with the network, and we're going to continue to do what's right. If fuel prices go up, we may adjust capacity.

And again, I think our -- to get to your point about margin compression. Alaska's financial performance comes from our competitive advantage. It doesn't come from international exchange rate or Brazilian currency. It comes from us having a cost structure that's 36% lower than the other guys when you factor in fuel and interest costs. It comes from the fact that customers prefer to fly with us. We have incredible loyalty in Seattle. It comes from a very strong balance sheet, the right fleet.

I know there's some question about oil activity, oil business-related activity in the State of Alaska. And I think the first thing I would just say is despite Alaska, the state being known for its oil reserves and its oil production, our exposure on that front is actually relatively small. We get business, oil-related business obviously flying our scheduled flight up to the crude oil bay. And then we get additional oil-related business because there's so many oilfield workers that actually live outside of Alaska and commute to work. And so we do get revenue from that activity. I would say it's fairly stable. A lot of the oilfield production, workers. Although production is declining, those oilfields still require the same amount of workers to sort of operate the drills and the pipelines and so forth. And so it's actually a very stable business. I think that we probably will see a bit of a reduction in the exploration for new oil deposits, but that's a much smaller portion of our overall oil portfolio. So bottom line is I think that our exposure on the oil side is minimal and stable. Beyond that obviously the state is having some issues because of the fact that they get most of the state revenue from oil reserves, oil royalties and so forth. And so there's a lot of question about this permanent fund dividend check that all of the state residents receive. However, that's tied more to overall market performance at this point than it is to oil prices. So ironically, in 2015, the PFD check that all residents received was over $2,000, and that was actually up from 2014. So some of the proposals floating around in the legislature might take that number down. It won't eliminate it by any means. And I think as you look at some of the other factors for travel in the State of Alaska, a lot of the intra-Alaska travel by residence is nondiscretionary because they just -- they have to go. There's no roads in a lot of cases. And then another big driver over the course of the year for travel in the State of Alaska is tourism, which is actually up. They had their best year ever in 2015 and they're expecting another good year in 2016. So all in all, I think we see fairly stable demand in the State of Alaska."

So if we're trying to really isolate the incremental revenue headwinds from Delta, it seems like the damage has mostly been done. But first, is my analysis close or correct?

As a reminder, our comments today will include forward-looking statements regarding our future expectations, which may differ significantly from actual results. Information or risk factors that could affect our business can be found in our SEC filings.
We will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures such as adjusted earnings and unit costs, excluding fuel. We have provided a reconciliation between the most directly comparable GAAP and non-GAAP measures in our earnings release.
This morning, Alaska Air Group reported a fourth quarter GAAP net profit of $191 million. Excluding mark-to-market fuel hedge losses and certain other items that netted to $5 million, the company recorded fourth quarter 2015 net income of $186 million or $1.46 per diluted share. This result compares to First Call estimate of $1.40 per share and exceeds last year's adjusted net income of $125 million or $0.94 per diluted share.
For the full year, Air Group reported a record adjusted net profit of $842 million, that's up 47%. Earnings per share grew 56% to $6.51 per share, with the incremental growth driven by the significant number of shares repurchased during the year. Additional information about cost expectations, capacity plans, fuel hedging, capital expenditures and other items can be found in our investor update included in our Form 8-K issued this morning and available on our website at alaskaair.com.

I'm sure you've all seen our results by now and have seen that 2015 was a record year on almost every front. While every airline has benefited from low fuel prices, Alaska led the industry in many of the underlying drivers of financial performance. Areas like operational reliability, customer satisfaction, customer growth and low fares, low costs. These are the areas that represent our competitive advantage or our economic moat, and they're also the reasons that our financial performance is what it is. I'd like to start the call by covering a few of these areas.
First, safety. We reduced what we call our risk level 3 events dramatically over the last 5 years. And over the same time period, our lost time injuries are down more than 25%. We're by no means perfect. And safety events, no matter how small, remind us of the enormous responsibility we have towards our customers, our employees and their families. And again, a focus on doing things safely is also a focus on doing things right, and that benefits everyone.
Operationally, Alaska leads the industry. Notwithstanding a tough December at Horizon, 86.1% of our flights in 2015 arrived on time, and that resulted in Alaska being named the #1 North American carrier by FlightStats for the sixth straight year. We also led the industry with the fewest number of customer complaints, and our completion rate of 99.5% was second among the 9 largest domestic airlines. This performance led to the Wall Street Journal ranking us the top airline for the third year in a row and for the fourth out of the last 5 years.
I want to thank Ben and Dave, together with their operational leaders and all of our frontline employees, for their focus on getting it right with more than 900 flights every single day.
Moving to the next item. In 2015, our internal measure of customer satisfaction reached a new record high of 86%, a 2-point improvement over last year and a remarkable 16-point increase since we began collecting this data in 2007. We know that satisfied customers have contributed to record growth in both our Mileage Plan and our credit card. Considering how established these programs are, these record growth rates are extraordinary, and they are huge credit to our people.
And we've spoken to you in the past about Beyond Service, a 2-day customer service workshop for our frontline employees. We've now completed all 66 classes. Long-time company leaders Andy Schneider, Diana Shaw and Jeff Butler led this fantastic effort. And I want to both thank and congratulate them and their teams who put in countless hours putting these classes together. I believe this program is already moving the needle in terms of how we focus on our customers.
On the labor front, with our new dispatcher contracts, we are the only U.S. airline to have no open contracts at this time. The weighted average duration of our agreements is almost 3 years, which compares very favorably to the rest of the industry.
As folks have said before, the airline business is the ultimate team sport. And for an airline to run well, the team has to work together. As you know, this is an area where we spent a lot of time, and our people are incredibly proud of what they've built at Alaska. Or employee engagement store -- scores and our top 100 ranking in the Forbes employer survey are a testament to this.
We're also very proud that when our company does well, our employees benefit. Every employee at Air Group participates in the same gain-sharing plan, which we call PBP. This program, combined with our monthly operational bonus program, will pay out a record $120 million this year, with $98 million of this being paid to our employees tomorrow. This is the seventh consecutive year where our employees will get a full month's pay in performance bonuses. This alignment is very powerful, and we believe it will do nothing but benefit us in future years.
So those areas, combined with our low fares and low costs, our strong balance sheet and our simple and profitable fleet, represent our competitive advantage. Our performance in these areas, together with low fuel prices, drove our financial results. And I'd like to highlight those now.
As Lavanya said, our net income for the quarter was $186 million, up 49% from 2014. And for the year, it was $842 million, up 47%. Our pretax margin expanded 680 basis points to 24% for the year, and our ROIC for the trailing 12 months of 25.2% is more than 3x our cost of capital.
We expect these results will put our pretax margin and ROIC both in the top 10% of the S&P 500. Our cash flows from operations were almost $1.6 billion. Free cash flow was $760 million. And of this total, over $600 million was returned to shareholders. We bought back 5.5% of our stock this year, and we bought back 35% since 2007.
We were very excited to announce this morning our third dividend event [ph]. Our dividend yield is 1.6%, bringing us closer to our goal of having a dividend that resembles high-quality industrials.
And with respect to the quality and diversity of our route network, I thought you might be interested in knowing that even if we adjusted our fuel prices to $3 a gallon, markets representing 95% of our revenue would still be profitable.
2015 was a great year for all of our constituents: customers, employees, communities and owners. And as you know, this continues a longer-term trend. So we feel good about our performance. There's obviously some concern in the industry about the revenue environment. And on that score, I would like to say that we're quite optimistic about 2016, and we feel good about both our geographies and our customer segments. 90% of our revenue is generated in the domestic U.S. market, which is a good place to be. And 2/3 of our revenue has a leisure focus, which is more resilient in a downturn and more stable through the cycle.
As we move forward in 2016, we're focused on a number of new initiatives, which will -- which we expect will bring value to both customers and shareholders. These include: launching our new premium economy product; continuing to reconfigure our fleet, with renewal of the 737 fleet at Alaska and preparation for the possible introduction of regional jets at Horizon; growing the 20 new markets that we added in 2015; enhancing our alliance relationships, primarily in the international arena; better marketing our Mileage Plan and credit card, which have new benefits for members; and finally, further lowering our cost structure and making our fare advantage better known to customers.
As I close, I want to thank our team of 15,000 people for an incredible year. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Andrew."
248501,321222567,920081,"Alaska Air Group, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 21, 2016",2016-01-21,"Earnings Calls","Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Brad, and good morning, everyone.

We were very pleased with our 2015 passenger revenue, which grew 4.7%. This is in contrast to the industry's revenue decline of 1%. We were within 1 point of industry unit revenue performance, despite competitive capacity headwinds of 12%. For the fourth quarter, our revenue was up 5.5% against a backdrop of 9% increase in competitive capacity. That drove our PRASM down 6.6% but well within our expectations.
We added 18 new markets in the second half of 2015, and 11 of those were in the fourth quarter. This is the largest number of new markets added in any single quarter in over a decade. And we understand there continue to be questions around our growth, so we went back and looked at a few data points that I want to share with you. These reinforce for us that we continue to take the right actions.
First, our launch of 20 new markets over the last year brings our total North America destinations served from Seattle to 86. That's more than 2x our closest competitor at 39. And this creates the best schedule utility for customers in Seattle and the Pacific Northwest.
Second, notwithstanding a competitive onslaught, our growth has helped us maintain our Seattle market share at 51%. This is unchanged from 3 years ago, and our Seattle hub is performing exceptionally well.
Third, our new markets are maturing quickly. The portfolio of new markets launched in the last 12 months are profitable. More importantly, half of these markets have only operated for 1 quarter, being our seasonally weakest, Q4.
And then finally, as we highlighted at Investor Day, over the last 5 years, we've added 90 new markets, grown capacity at a compounded annual growth rate of 7.6% and revenue at 7.9%. Industry's revenue grew at a rate of less than 3% over the same period.
If you're asking, ""Andrew, what is your point here?"" The point is this. Our total capacity growth over the past 5 years accounts for $1.8 billion or 1/3 of our revenues. Margins on this revenue are in line with system average. Said another way, our earnings per share would be approximately $2 lower than what we've reported today had we decided to keep capacity flat.
The bottom line is this. Growth has been good for our customers, our employees and unquestionably, for our shareholders. And we believe that a thoughtful growth as a low-cost carrier that enjoys strong customer loyalty will increase our network utility, diversify our revenue base and create durable earning streams. These outcomes far outweigh the short-term impact of RASM comps, which we're experiencing today, and we will likely see through the first half of 2016.
Moving to the performance of the broader commercial business. Our partnerships are growing. Over the last year, we provided our customers with access to an incremental 60 international destinations and 3,600 flights per day, on which to earn and redeem miles. In fact, passengers on Alaska metal coming from Hainan, Icelandair and Emirates increased 43% in the fourth quarter as a result of our new agreements, coupled with our partners' expanded service.
Customer loyalty is growing at unprecedented rates even in the face of competition. Active Mileage Plan members are up 15.5% this year, outstripping passenger growth of 8.9%. This is the second consecutive year of double-digit growth in our Mileage Plan members. More impressive, our elite members grew 19%, pointing to increased stickiness with our brand. And our credit card members increased 11.6%, making 2015 the strongest year for card member growth since we started tracking this data.
Our Affinity program generated nearly $700 million of cash flow in 2015 and will continue to grow in 2016. A very important initiative that we announced at Investor Day in December that will further grow our revenue.
First, we'll introduce a premium cost product on our 737s and our regional jets, adding at least $85 million in annual profit by 2018. We'll start to retrofit existing aircraft in the second half of 2016 and will complete 75 aircraft by year-end.
Second, our new agreement with Bank of America will add $60 million in new annual revenue starting in the first quarter of '16. And our Affinity Visa card offers industry-leading benefits like no first-bag fee, no international transaction costs, a companion fare and the lowest annual fee amongst comparable cards. We are confident that our card will remain top of wallet for existing holders and help us continue to grow the cardholder base and related revenues.
And then finally, we'll be adding 2 more regional jets to our network this month to fill a market need for an aircraft that can serve longer-haul markets with demands that doesn't justify a 737. We'll also be replacing our 8 CRJ-700 with Embraer 175s, as they have an 8.5% more capacity and allow us to sell premium seats and give us greater range. This is an area where we think we have plenty of room for profitable growth in 2016 and beyond. The 4 markets we launched thus far are already profitable with 6 months -- within 6 months of launch. And Brandon's going to talk a bit more about this in a moment.
Looking forward at capacity growth. Q1 is expected to be up 13.5%, given a heavy new delivery schedule that meters down to 10.8% as we enter the seasonally strongest second quarter and we move to retire our 737-400s.
Today, I am reiterating our 2016 full year growth expectation of 8%. We expect growth in the second half of 2016 to be in the neighborhood of 5%.
Moving to competitive capacity. Other airline capacity, competitive capacity is expected to be up 13% and 12% in Q1 and Q2, respectively. To reiterate what Brad said, we're optimistic about 2016. Underlying demand in our geography is strong. New markets continue to deliver. And loyalty and credit card programs are growing. New revenue initiatives we're implementing will deliver an annual run rate of $150 million. This gives us confidence that our growth is sound and that we will continue to deliver on shareholder returns.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Brandon."
248501,321222567,920081,"Alaska Air Group, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 21, 2016",2016-01-21,"Earnings Calls","Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Andrew, and good morning, everyone. As Brad said, fourth quarter adjusted earnings grew by 49% to $186 million, and earnings per share grew by 55% to $1.46 per share. The record fourth quarter result brings our full year net profit to $842 million",1153,"Thanks, Andrew, and good morning, everyone. As Brad said, fourth quarter adjusted earnings grew by 49% to $186 million, and earnings per share grew by 55% to $1.46 per share. The record fourth quarter result brings our full year net profit to $842 million and earnings per share to $6.51 per share.
Earnings per share has almost doubled since 2012, even in the face of unprecedented competition in our Seattle hub since that time.
Similarly, our after-tax return on invested capital has grown from 13% in 2012 to 25.2% this year. Our net operating profit has more than doubled over that period, yet our invested capital base has grown by only 11%. We expect our ROIC to lead about 90% of the companies in the S&P 500 and all but 10 industrials in the index.
Fourth quarter pretax profit grew by $86 million led by a $100 million decline in economic fuel costs. We recognized that low fuel prices will probably not last forever, so we remain focused on creating a permanent sustainable advantage by lowering nonfuel unit costs and increasing the fuel efficiency of our fleet.
Fourth quarter ex fuel unit costs declined by another 1.3%, bringing full year nonfuel unit costs down 0.8%. 2015 marks the sixth year in a row of nonfuel unit cost reduction and the 13th year out of the last 14 for the mainline.
Looking ahead into 2016, we expect nonfuel unit costs to be down 1% on the 8% ASM growth, consistent with our Investor Day guidance.
I might offer some thoughts on that track record. Every year now for 14 years, we've been chipping away at unit costs. And while each year -- in each individual year, like 0.5% or 1.5% of cost reduction doesn't sound like a lot, the cumulative impact is enormous, especially when the competition has unit costs that are growing, albeit slowly. Because of that focus on productivity, our emphasis on low overhead and a general culture of frugality that's growing throughout Air Group, our cost structure today looks a lot like the low-cost carriers and it's nearly 25% lower than the legacy carriers. And if you include fuel and nonoperating expenses, our cost gap widens to 36%. To borrow Brad's phrase that he used on Investor Day, our economic moat is getting wider and it's giving us confidence about the sustainability of our results.
As we mentioned, we remain focused on having one of the most fuel-efficient fleets in the industry. In 2015, our fuel efficiency on an ASM per gallon basis improved by another 2%, with much of that coming from the delivery during the year of 11 737-900ERs and the installation of split-scimitar winglets across the majority of the Boeing fleet. This year's improvement extends the cumulative fuel efficiency improvement over the last 10 years to 24%. And the trend should continue in 2016, as we take delivery of 19 new 737-900ERs, phase out 13 older, less-efficient and maintenance intensive 737-400s and add longer-stage length to regional flying.
And speaking of regional flying. Andrew mentioned in the -- Andrew mentioned the profitable growth opportunities we see with large regional jets. In order to fund that growth and replace 15 Q400s that are scheduled for lease return in 2018, we're in the final phase of a regional jet campaign. It's likely that we'll place an order for 30 large regional jets in the first quarter of 2016, with delivery starting in 2017, if we can reach acceptable commercial terms with the parties involved. Our intent is for those jets to be flown by Horizon if our pilots and flight attendants approve changes to their collective bargaining agreements that will make them cost-competitive with other CPA providers. Voting is taking place now.
SkyWest does a great job operating regional jets for us today, and they'll continue to operate them in our network despite us potentially bringing some of that jet flying back in-house.
Alaska ended the year with $1.3 billion in cash. Operating cash flow increased by 54% to almost $1.6 billion. 2015 marks the second year in a row of operating cash flow in excess of $1 billion. CapEx was just under $800 million, resulting in free cash flow of almost $800 million. We used that considerable free cash flow to buy back 7.2 million shares of our common stock or about 5.5% of the shares outstanding. It's noteworthy that going back to 2007, we've bought back 35% of the company.
In addition, we paid $102 million in dividends, bringing total return to shareholders to $607 million. Our announcement today that we're increasing our dividends by 38% reaffirms our board's confidence in the sustainability of our cash flows, is consistent with our goal of creating a track record of dividend increases like other high-quality industrial companies and makes Alaska the highest yielding stock among U.S. airlines that pay a regular dividend.
Normal principal payments of $116 million brought our long-term debt balance to $686 million. We're now in a $300 million net cash position even after including operating leases. Alaska's adjusted debt-to-cap ratio stands at 27%. This compares with the media and S&P 500 debt-to-cap ratio of 45%. We have 78 unencumbered mainline aircraft and 86 unencumbered aircraft overall. Our pensions are 92% funded on a GAAP basis, and we have no required contributions again in 2016. Alaska remains 1 of only 2 U.S. airlines to have an investment-grade balance sheet.
And of course, in a rising interest rate environment, our low debt levels will further widen our cost GAAP versus competitors who are more highly leveraged. We expect to generate very strong cash flow again in 2016. We currently project CapEx to be $705 million next year, including options but excluding CapEx associated with a regional jet order, which could add up to $90 million next year, bringing the total close to $800 million. Using consensus estimates, that would imply free cash flow of nearly $650 million and free cash flow yield of over 7%.
We still expect to return more capital to owners in 2016 than we did in 2015, both through our higher dividend and through share buybacks. We have $880 million remaining on our $1 billion repurchase authorization.
As we enter 2016, our business is working well. We're safe. We run the most reliable operation in the business. We're delivering award-winning service. Customer preference has never been higher, our labor relations are excellent and contracts have an average length of just under 3 years. Our costs are low, and they're getting lower. Our investment-grade balance sheet is getting stronger. Our new cash flow streams are earnings accretive. We're returning record amounts of cash to our shareholders. And more importantly, and most importantly, our people are engaged, and we're confident in their ability to continue to do great things in 2016.
And with that, we'd like to open it up to questions that you may have."

As we think about the regional jets, the opportunity here is as follows: one is they have increased reach versus the Q400, it delivers a better passenger experience, especially on those longer-stage length mission than the Q400. Our competition, frankly, is using those in many of our markets. And I think we want to make sure that we're staying on par or better with that customer experience side. We have a much higher revenue opportunity with a 3-class cabin and actually in excess of 400 miles, the regional jet has a lower trip cost. The Q400 has been a great airplane for us, and it works well in the short-stage length around the Pacific Northwest, but I think there's an opportunity to tap into lots of new revenue opportunities with the regional jets by bringing some of those in-house."

But as we move into 2016, and yes, we're a little higher in the first quarter, we're getting a lot of deliveries this year. We're getting 19 ERs. They're heavily loaded to the front end, and we don't stop pushing out our 400s until the middle of the year, and there's 13 of those. So we're a little higher in the first half of the year than we'd like to. But as we move into the back part of the year, I think we're going to be around 5% or so. And the other thing is we have a lot of mod lines going now putting ATG4, WiFi on as well as mods for premium economy. So we're going to be using a lot of those aircraft to get all that done by the end of the year. So I feel fairly confident about where we sit today with our capacity guidance."

We think our customers not only appreciate the superior products we have, but recognize we have already very low fares.

In terms of the broader strategy, what we're -- goes back to something maybe that Brad said, which is we're going to do the right thing for Alaska. We do have a profit hurdle internally. Most of our markets are well above that. Most of our markets would be well above that at $3 a fuel. And so we're going to continue to -- we are very satisfied with the network, and we're going to continue to do what's right. If fuel prices go up, we may adjust capacity.

And again, I think our -- to get to your point about margin compression. Alaska's financial performance comes from our competitive advantage. It doesn't come from international exchange rate or Brazilian currency. It comes from us having a cost structure that's 36% lower than the other guys when you factor in fuel and interest costs. It comes from the fact that customers prefer to fly with us. We have incredible loyalty in Seattle. It comes from a very strong balance sheet, the right fleet.

And",429,"Duane, this is Joe Sprague, and since I just got back from Juno late last night, people are pointing at me to take this one, so I'll give it a shot. I know there's some question about oil activity, oil business-related activity in the State of Alaska. And I think the first thing I would just say is despite Alaska, the state being known for its oil reserves and its oil production, our exposure on that front is actually relatively small. We get business, oil-related business obviously flying our scheduled flight up to Prudhoe Bay. And then we get additional oil-related business because there's so many oilfield workers that actually live outside of Alaska and commute to work. And so we do get revenue from that activity. I would say it's fairly stable. A lot of the oilfield production workers. Although production is declining, those oilfields still require the same amount of workers to sort of operate the drills and the pipelines and so forth. And so it's actually a very stable business. I think that we probably will see a bit of a reduction in the exploration for new oil deposits, but that's a much smaller portion of our overall oil portfolio. So bottom line is I think that our exposure on the oil side is minimal and stable. Beyond that obviously the state is having some issues because of the fact that they get most of the state revenue from oil reserves, oil royalties and so forth. And so there's a lot of question about this permanent fund dividend check that all of the state residents receive. However, that's tied more to overall market performance at this point than it is to oil prices. So ironically, in 2015, the PFD check that all residents received was over $2,000, and that was actually up from 2014. So some of the proposals floating around in the legislature might take that number down. It won't eliminate it by any means. And I think as you look at some of the other factors for travel in the State of Alaska, a lot of the intra-Alaska travel by residents is nondiscretionary because they just -- they have to go. There's no roads in a lot of cases. And then another big driver over the course of the year for travel in the State of Alaska is tourism, which is actually up. They had their best year ever in 2015 and they're expecting another good year in 2016. So all in all, I think we see stable demand in the State of Alaska."

Several members of our senior management team are also on hand to help answer your questions.
As a reminder, our comments today will include forward-looking statements regarding our future expectations, which may differ significantly from actual results. Information on risk factors that could affect our business can be found in our SEC filings.
We will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures such as adjusted earnings and unit costs, excluding fuel. We have provided a reconciliation between the most directly comparable GAAP and non-GAAP measures in our earnings release.
In addition, today's call may be deemed a solicitation in respect of Alaska Air Group's contemplated acquisition of Virgin America. The information discussed today is qualified in its entirety by the proxy statement that Virgin America will be filing in the future, and that will be available on Virgin America's Investor Relations page at ir.virginamerica.com. 
All right, with that lengthy disclosure done, let's look at results. This morning Alaska Air Group reported a first quarter GAAP net profit of $184 million. Excluding the small impact of mark-to-market adjustments related to our fuel hedge portfolio, Air Group reported a record adjusted net income of $183 million. That's up 23%.
Earnings per share grew by 29.5% to $1.45 per share. A higher growth rate in EPS is driven by over 7.3 million shares that we have repurchased during the last 12 months. Additional information about cost expectations, capacity plans, fuel hedging capital expenditures and other items can be found in our investor update included in our Form 8-K issued this morning and available on our website at alaskaair.com.

Before I jump into the results for this quarter, I want to talk for a minute about our proposed acquisition of Virgin America. Virgin America and Alaska share similar philosophies about building alignment with and taking care of our people and about putting customers first. Both of us run strong operations, we're both recognized for our terrific customer service, we both have a great onboard product, and we're 2 of the youngest and fuel-efficient planes in the industry. We're excited about bringing together 2 great airlines to create an airline that will have a national footprint and one that we believe will be the premier airline for people who live anywhere along the West Coast. The next steps on the process involves a vote by Virgin America shareholders sometime in the second quarter and a review by the Department of Justice. We believe this competition strengthens our 2 airlines and enhances competition from the innovative and low-fare segment of the market. So we are hoping for swift clearance to close, which could be in 60 days or less. Even if the DOJ decides that the deal warrants a closer look, we hope to have clearance well before the end of the year.
In the meantime, we remain focused on execution and integration planning. On that front, I want to share that Ben Minicucci, our Chief Operating Officer will be leading the charge on integration. He understands operations very well. And while he drives hard for results, he cares a lot about people, and that is the real key to success. We are all fully invested in this, but we are also very excited to see Ben do great things with his responsibility.
We're working hard to lay out the groundwork for swift integration, and part of that is making sure our stand-alone business is humming along nicely. So let's talk about the business that our team of 15,000 people is running today. Lavanya just shared the numbers, and it's evidence that we're performing well financially. But it's also important to note that industry as a whole is a lot healthier and producing strong results. What I'm really proud of is that our team is continuously moving the ball forward. We're off to a strong start in 2016 on almost every front.
Let's start with the operations. Our people continue to do a great job of running a good operation. 87.5% of our mainline flights arrived on time in the quarter, and that's up 2.5 points from 2015, and I think Horizon's on-time performance -- on-time performance will be even higher than that. And our completion rate was 99.3%. We expect that both our mainline on-time performance and our completion rate will lead the 8 largest the domestic airlines.
Now let's talk about customer service, which we believe is what really differentiates airlines. Our people are taking great care of our customers in providing them experience that is unique in this industry. Our customer's satisfaction rating of 86.3% is a new record for the first quarter and reflects the time and effort spent by our team last year conducting customer service workshops, which we call Beyond Service. Our customers are rewarding us with their loyalty and voting with their wallets literally by signing up to the Alaska Airlines credit card. Both programs continue to grow at unprecedented rates and is providing us loyal customers, which make our network growth more successful and more profitable. Andrew will talk more about this in a moment.
Our growth is providing greater options to our customers and generating strong returns for our owners. Our network team does a great job of identifying demand and then matching that demand with the right amount of capacity or supply. Sometimes, this means getting out of routes the don't meet return targets like L.A. to Vancouver. Sometimes, this means making refinements -- making small refinements to the schedule, and sometimes it means tapping into new opportunities.
We've added 41 new markets over the last 2 years, and 5 of them came in the most recent quarter. 41 markets in the aggregate are not only profitable but are producing fully allocated returns that are meaningful to our overall business and well above our cost of capital. What's more remarkable is that the 5 markets added in the last quarter are already profitable, and 3 of them are producing returns that are higher than our cost of capital. So our strategy is working. Our folks are running a strong operation and taking care of customers on board and on the ground. And we're deploying capacity in markets where we enjoy strong customer loyalty and our assets of producing returns that exceed our cost of capital. And these returns are reflected in the numbers that you saw this morning.
Now let's look at those numbers. Our net income for the quarter was $183 million, which was 23% higher than 2015. When we factor in the 7.3 million shares we bought back over the last 12 months, our earnings per share of $1.45 increased 29.5%. We expect this EPS growth to lead all but 36 companies in the S&P 500. In fact, our strong EPS growth stands in contrast to the average company in the S&P 500 where earnings are expected to shrink by 3.5%.
Our pretax margin grew by 260 basis points to 21.5%, bringing our trailing 12-month pretax margin to 24.5%. We expect this to be one of the best margins in the industry, and we also expect it to lead about 80% of the companies in the S&P 500.
And finally, our ROIC for the trailing 12 months of 25.6% is more than 3x our cost of capital and substantially higher than high-quality industrials in the S&P 500.
As we look forward, our 15,000 employees are operating safely and are taking care of our customers and each other. Our core business is strong, and we're seeing robust demand for our product. And as a result, our business is producing the sort of returns they should expect from high-quality industrials.
I want to thank everybody here. Our very talented and dedicated frontline employees as well as a terrific leadership team, all of whom are working very hard to produce these strong results and just as importantly, to position us to continue to do so in the future.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Andrew"
248501,329837839,960863,"Alaska Air Group, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2016",2016-04-21,"Earnings Calls","Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Executives","Thinks Brad, and good morning, everyone. Our first quarter revenue performance was solid, especially when compared to the industry. We grew revenues by $78 million or 6.1%, while industry revenues declined 1%. We're able to achieve these revenue results i",906,"Thinks Brad, and good morning, everyone. Our first quarter revenue performance was solid, especially when compared to the industry. We grew revenues by $78 million or 6.1%, while industry revenues declined 1%. We're able to achieve these revenue results in the face of 13% competitive capacity [indiscernible].
Our load factors remain high while growing our own capacity at 12.9%. Despite expanding capacity over 2x the industry, our RASM decline of 6.1% was within 50 basis points of the industry. Our growth is enabling us to continue to offer our customers more destinations, grow our revenues and most importantly, grow a diverse and stable earnings stream. Our strong business performance is a result of a number of key drivers.
First, adding new markets is giving our customers more nonstop choices as well as providing greater options for connecting passengers. In the last 12 months, we've added 23 new markets to our network. In retail power lines, we're putting new products on the shelf, and they're selling.
Second, we have new regional jets that enable us to provide customers with nonstop service to destinations they previously could only access via 1 or 2 stops seven of our 23 markets launched in the past 12 months were only made available through the introduction of the Embraer 175. This aircraft delivers the trip costs and range to ensure long end markets can be served profitably. We're excited about the possibility of this aircraft, and Brandon will share a little more about our delivery stream in just a minute.
Third, our cost have come down approximately 1% for the 12-month period ending March 2016. While we expect industry costs have risen by about 3%. That's a net gap of 4 points in just 1 year. Our low costs are a sustainable advantage, allowing us to offer low fares and enabling our growth.
Fourth, the combination of a reliable operation, customer-friendly service, growing destinations and low fares is helping us continue to grow our loyalty customer base. Our loyalty program gives members access to over 950 destinations worldwide. We grew our active membership another 12% on the heels of 15.5% [ph] growth in 2015. Our base of loyalty members is actually 30% larger today than it was 2 years ago. This is remarkable for a mature program, especially in the face of vigorous competition.
And then lastly with respect to the credit card accounts, they're up over 12% for the quarter. That's the highest growth since 2010. In addition, the revised economics of our new us credit card agreement is helping our revenue performance. For the first quarter, we are tracking ahead of plan and on track to achieve our annual run rate of $60 million.
We expect our growth in card members to remain strong because come June 1, we'll be able to go to market with new cardholder products we negotiated with our new agreement. That includes a 30,000 bonus miles on approval. That's an increase of 20% from today and a free bag. In addition, new and existing members will no longer incur international transaction fees. We believe that this is the best airline credit card offering in the market bar none.
As we shift our focus to the second quarter, I want to highlight a few data points around capacity and demand. Let's start with capacity. Alaska's capacity will be up approximately 11% in the second quarter. Almost half of that growth is driven by new markets we launched over the last year, and about 1/3 is driven by the increase in [indiscernible]. Said another way, ASM growth from core departures will only contribution 2%, which we believe is in line with the strength of the economy in the markets we serve. We expect capacity growth in the second half of 2016 to slow down to 5.5% to 6.5%, which puts our expectation for the full year capacity growth at 8%.
Moving to competitive outlook. We expect competitive capacity to remain elevated through the summer, up 14% for Q2 and Q3. This is 1 point higher than competitive capacity in the first quarter. Also, as a reminder, the shift of the Easter holiday to March is expected to reduce April PRASM by about a point.
As we look ahead to the rest of 2016, we will continue to grow our revenue base and deliver strong results. And here's why. First, over 90% of our capacity is deployed in domestic markets. Nearly all U.S. point-of-sale and demand continues to remain solid. Secondly, you might recall that 18 of the 21 new markets added last year started in the last 6 months of 2015. So as we move through this year, the percentage of our capacity end markets that have operated less than 12 months drops from 5.5% in the first half of this year to 2.5% in the second half of 2016. Third, we expect to introduce premium class in September with 75 aircraft in service by year end. This will help with both revenue and loyalty growth. While the contribution in 2016 is marginal, we expect premium class add about $85 million in annual profit by 2018.
So in summary, we're running a solid operation, taking great care of our customers. The first quarter saw us adding new aircraft, cities, customers, loyalty members, revenue and profit, all against the backdrop of an industry that shrank revenue this quarter.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Brandon."

Our trailing 12-month ROIC of 25.6% was 550 basis points higher than at the end of this point last year.On an adjusted",1055,"Thanks, Andrew, and hey, everyone. As you heard Air Group's adjusted net profit improved by 23%, and EPS grew by 29% to $1.45 a share. Our trailing 12-month ROIC of 25.6% was 550 basis points higher than at the end of this point last year.
On an adjusted pretax basis, we earned $290 million, a $50 million or 21% increase over prior year. Revenues grew by $78 million. Yield costs declined by $66 million, and those gains were offset by a $94 million increase in nonfuel costs. This is the seventh consecutive year of profitability in the seasonally weak first quarter, and profit has increased steadily for each of those 7 years.
Consolidated nonfuel unit costs were down 1.2%. Our leaders are doing a good job managing the virtual cost of budget and hitting productivity metrics. For example, our broadest measure of productivity passengers per FTE, is tracking at 1.8% better than plan on mainline. Our flights ops group is spot on their hard plan, and our maintenance division productive is tracking ahead of plan, just to name a few. Our people understand how high productivity is an important source of our cost advantage.
For the second quarter, we forecast unit costs ex fuel to be down 1%. And for the full year, we now expect ex fuel cost to decline by 0.5%. There are 3 main drivers from the change from our initial full year guidance.
First, we have changed our performance base pay or PBP plan to increase the participation level for our supervisors and our managers. These are incredibly important roles, and our board wanted to have their PBP participation better reflect their level of responsibility. PBP has been and continues to be a very strong driver of engagement among our employees.
Next, third party regional expense was understated in our initial guidance. The new guidance now properly reflects the increase in SkyWest CPA flying costs through the year. And finally, new minimum wage requirements in certain markets are having a greater impact than we initially modeled. In addition, our results in Q1 and, thus, our full year forecast includes some costs associated with our Virgin America deal.
Going forward, we will be excluding deal and integration costs from our guidance since the timing and amount of these costs are variable. We'll also begin excluding them from our adjusted results.
Even with the revised cost guidance, 2016 will be the 14th year out of the last 15 for mainline cost reduction and the seventh year in a row for Air Group. As a result, our cost advantage over the legacy carriers will further widen in this year.
Turning to fuel. Our economic fuel cost per gallon was $1.29, down from $1.98 in Q1 of last year, which contributed to the $66 million decline in economic fuel expense. Our fuel burn on an ASM per gallon basis improved by another 1.8% since Q1 last year and will just continue to get better as we work through the retirement of the 737-400 classics by the end of 2017 and replace them with 737-900ERs, which are 25% more fuel efficient.
Our cash flow from operations was $527 million, and we ended the quarter with nearly $1.6 billion in cash. Even after adjusting for leases, we're in a net cash position of almost $600 million. Our debt to cap including leases now stands at 26%. Our net cash position, the 95 unencumbered aircraft in our fleet, our investment-grade balance sheet and our long track record of conservative financial management processes in a strong position to raise the capital necessary to fund the proposed acquisition of Virgin America. Our treasury team is hard art work with potential lenders. Initial results are very encouraging in terms of the number of and diversity of lenders that want to work with us.
Andrew mentioned the order for E175s. We're excited to have this jet for the Horizon fleet and the profit opportunity that it opens up in new markets. We're impressed with Embraer's commitment to working by our side as the Horizon team incorporates the E175 efficiently into our operation. We currently have 7 SkyWest E175s operating in our network and expect to have 15 by the end of the year. Horizon will start taking delivery of the E175 in 2017. The Q400 will continue to fly our shorter routes, and Bombardier will remain an important business partner of ours.
In the mainline operation, we took delivery of 6 737-900ERs in the first quarter and will take another 13 by year-end. 
On an Air Group stand-alone basis, we're currently expecting CapEx to be approximately $750 million this year, which includes $685 million of CapEx associated with firm orders and $70 million of CapEx for Boeing 737 options that we are likely to exercise. We've produced over $400 million of free cash flow in the first quarter of 2016 alone, further strengthening our balance sheet while allowing us to continue to return capital to our owners. Through yesterday, we've repurchased a total of 2.1 million shares for $161 million or 1.7% of the shares outstanding as of the beginning of the year. We also paid $34 million in dividends so far this year.
As we announced on April 4, the slow share repurchases in order to help fund the acquisition, we expect total share repurchases for 2016 to be between $190 million and $200 million. So when combined with our dividend, which will continue and is currently yielding 1.4%, we expect total return to shareholders to be about $325 million this year.
We're off to a great start in 2016, but we have much work ahead as we get integration. Although there's a lot going on, we're mindful the we need to remain focused in the core business. We're going to maintain the same level of discipline and budget rigor, so that we hit our operational and financial results. I'm super focused on the risk that we lose a bit of budget disciplined with integration work, and we're setting up controls that ensure that, that does not happen.
I want to thank everyone involved in the integration in advance for the huge effort that they're about to undertake to combine Alaska and Virgin America into the premier airline for people on the West Coast.
And with that, let's get to questions."

Nearly all of that is related to the E175 purchase. So if you just look at those 30 firms, kind of the way it staggers out is $40 million in 2016, $280 million in 2017 and roughly $250 million in 2018 and 2019. So the big increase in CapEx is simply related to the regional jet order that we placed."

And then the credit card, really the Mileage Plan overall sort of on the other line item really was up about $25 million, $30 million for the quarter. So that was kind of the contribution there. And a lot of that was driven by again the new credit card deal that we had in the new economics on that deal started in January and then just the volume.

I think Alaska's position on that has been misunderstood. When that actually started, it started in the city of Sea-Tac, which is a community here with 11 square miles, and our minimum wage at that time went from something like $9 and changed to $15. Alaska's position is this is kind of -- the playing field isn't level. This is sort of a patchwork way of rolling out a new idea for our society. And so we've sort of said this does have the ability to penalize a hometown airline and an airline that we think is a tremendous -- we think we bring a lot of value to the community, for customers, employees and so forth. So we just said we didn't push back on the Sea-Tac minimum wage ordinance, but its really in the sense of let's just do something in a less patchwork fashion. As you know, I think, we, at the same time as we did that, we asked our contractors 2 or 3 years ago to take their own minimum wage up from the rates they were to $12 an hour, and I think they've gone to $15 an hour now. I think they've all got $15 an hour. I think in that sense, we're not fighting it anymore. They are at $15 an hour. But yes, the other point, Dominic, the other point that we try to make about this thing, I think there's a challenge for all of us right now to work with our economy so these economies benefit everybody who's participating in the economy, but we don't damage the businesses too much in the process. And that's another point Alaska's tried to make as we roll through this, but I don't know. Maybe to summarize, we're -- society is going through a process here. We're participants in that process. We want to be -- we want to do our civic duty. We want these jobs to be good jobs for people. What we do want to do is make sure we have a environment or an economy or businesses can thrive and grow and bring value to customers and employees and owners."

Our Chief Commercial Officer, Andrew Harrison, will share the revenue results for the quarter, followed by Brandon Pedersen, our CFO, who will discuss our financial results, capital allocation plans and outlook 2016.
Several members of our senior management team are also on hand to help answer your questions.
As a reminder, our comments today will include forward-looking statements regarding our future expectations, which may differ significantly from actual results. Information on risk factors that could affect our business can be found in our SEC filings.
We will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures such as adjusted earnings and unit costs, excluding fuel. We've provided a reconciliation between the most directly comparable GAAP and non-GAAP measures in our earnings release.
In addition, today's call may be deemed a solicitation in respect of Alaska Air Group's contemplated acquisition of Virgin America. The information discussed today is qualified in its entirety by the proxy statement that Virgin America will be filing in the future, and that will be available on Virgin America's Investor Relations page at ir.virginamerica.com. 
All right. With that lengthy disclosure done, let's look at results. This morning, Alaska Air Group reported a first quarter GAAP net profit of $184 million. Excluding the small impact of mark-to-market adjustments related to our fuel hedge portfolio, Air Group reported a record adjusted net income of $183 million, that's up 23%.
Earnings per share grew by 29.5% to $1.45 per share. Higher growth rate in EPS is driven by over 7.3 million shares that we have repurchased during the last 12 months. Additional information about cost expectations, capacity plans, fuel hedging, capital expenditures and other items can be found in our investor update included in our Form 8-K issued this morning and available on our website at alaskaair.com.

Before I jump into the results for this quarter, I want to talk for a minute about our proposed acquisition of Virgin America.

Before I jump into the results for this quarter, I want to talk for a minute about our proposed acquisition of Virgin America. Virgin America and Alaska share similar philosophies about building alignment with and taking care of our people and about putting customers first. Both of us run strong operations. We're both recognized for our terrific customer service. We both have a great onboard product, and we've 2 of the youngest and most fuel-efficient fleets in the industry. We're excited about bringing together 2 great airlines to create an airline that will have a national footprint and one that we believe will be the premier airline for people who live anywhere along the West Coast. The next steps in the process involve a vote by Virgin America shareholders sometime in the second quarter and a review by the Department of Justice. We believe this combination strengthens our 2 airlines and enhances competition from the innovative and low-fare segment of the market. So we are hoping for swift clearance to close, which could be 60 days or less. Even if the DOJ decides that the deal warrants a closer look, we hope to have clearance well before the end of the year.
In the meantime, we remain focused on execution and integration planning. On that front, I want to share that Ben Minicucci, our Chief Operating Officer, will be leading the charge on integration. He understands operations very well and while he drives hard for results, he cares a lot about people. And that is the real key to success. We are all fully invested in this, but we're also very excited to see Ben do great things with this responsibility.
We're working hard to lay out the groundwork for smooth integration and part of that is making sure our stand-alone business is humming along nicely. So let's talk about the business that our team of 15,000 people is running today. Lavanya just shared the numbers, and it's evidence that we're performing well financially. But it's also important to note that the industry as a whole is lot healthier and producing strong results. What I'm really proud of is that our team is continuously moving the ball forward. We're off to a strong start in 2016 on almost every front.
Let's start with the operations. Our people continue to do a great job of running a good operation. 87.5% of our mainline flights arrived on time in the quarter, and that's up 2.5 points from 2015. And I think Horizon's on-time performance will be even higher than that. And our completion rate was 99.3%. We expect that both our mainline on-time performance and our completion rate will lead the 8 largest domestic airlines.
Now let's talk about customer service, which we believe is what really differentiates airlines. Our people are taking great care of our customers and providing them an experience that is unique in this industry. Our customer satisfaction rating of 86.3% is a new record for the first quarter and reflects the time and effort spent by our team last year conducting customer service workshops, which we call Beyond Service. Our customers are rewarding us with their loyalty and voting with their wallets literally by signing up to the Alaska Airlines credit card. Both programs continue to grow at unprecedented rates and are providing us loyal customers, which make our network growth more successful and more profitable. Andrew will talk more about this in a moment.
Our growth is providing greater options to our customers and generating strong returns for our owners. Our network team does a great job of identifying demand and then matching that demand with the right amount of capacity or supply. Sometimes, this means getting out of routes that don't meet our return targets like L.A. to Vancouver. Sometimes, this means making refinements -- making small refinements to the schedule. And sometimes, it means tapping into new opportunities.
We've added 41 new markets over the last 2 years, and 5 of them came in the most recent quarter. 41 markets in the aggregate are not only profitable but are producing fully allocated returns that are meaningful to our overall business and well above our cost of capital. What's more remarkable is that the 5 markets added in the last quarter are already profitable, and 3 of them are producing returns that are higher than our cost of capital. So our strategy is working. Our folks are running a strong operation and taking care of customers on-board and on the ground. And we're deploying capacity in markets where we enjoy strong customer loyalty, and our assets are producing returns that exceed our cost of capital. And these returns are reflected in the numbers that you saw this morning.
Now let's look at those numbers. Our net income for the quarter was $183 million, which was 23% higher than 2015. When we factor in the 7.3 million shares we bought back over the last 12 months, our earnings per share of $1.45 increased 29.5%. We expect this EPS growth to lead all but 36 companies in the S&P 500. In fact, our strong EPS growth stands in contrast to the average company in the S&P 500 where earnings are expected to shrink by 3.5%.
Our pretax margin grew by 260 basis points to 21.5%, bringing our trailing 12-month pretax margin to 24.5%. We expect this to be one of the best margins in the industry, and we also expect it to lead about 80% of the companies in the S&P 500.
And finally, our ROIC for the trailing 12 months of 25.6% is more than 3x our cost of capital and substantially higher than high-quality industrials in the S&P 500.
As we look forward, our 15,000 employees are operating safely and are taking care of our customers and each other. Our core business is strong, and we're seeing robust demand for our product. And as a result, our business is producing the sort of returns that you should expect from high-quality industrials.
I want to thank everybody here. Our very talented and dedicated frontline employees as well as a terrific leadership team, all of whom are working very hard to produce these strong results and just as importantly, to position us to continue to do so in the future.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Andrew."

Our first quarter revenue performance was solid, especially when compared to the industry. We grew revenues by $78 million or 6.1%, while industry revenues declined 1%. We're able to achieve these revenue results",902,"Thinks, Brad, and good morning, everyone. Our first quarter revenue performance was solid, especially when compared to the industry. We grew revenues by $78 million or 6.1%, while industry revenues declined 1%. We're able to achieve these revenue results in the face of 13% competitive [indiscernible].
Our load factors remained high, while growing our own capacity at 12.9%. Despite expanding capacity over 2x the industry, our RASM decline of 6.1% was within 50 basis points of the industry. Our growth is enabling us to continue to offer our customers more destinations, grow our revenues and most importantly, grow a diverse and stable earnings stream. Our strong business performance is a result of a number of key drivers.
First, adding new markets is giving our customers more nonstop choices as well as providing greater options for connecting passengers. In the last 12 months, we've added 23 new markets to our network. In retail [indiscernible], we're putting new products on the shelf, and they're selling.
Second, we have new regional jets that enable us to provide customers with nonstop service to destinations they previously could only access via 1 or 2 stops. Seven of our 23 markets launched in the past 12 months were only made available due to the introduction of the Embraer E175s. This aircraft delivers the trip costs and range to ensure longer thin markets can be served profitably. We're excited about the possibilities of this aircraft, and Brandon will share a little more about our delivery stream in just a minute.
Third, our costs have come down approximately 1% for the 12-month period ending March 2016, while we expect industry costs have risen by about 3%. That's a net gap of 4 points in just 1 year. Our low costs are a sustainable advantage, allowing us to offer low fares and enabling our growth.
Fourth, the combination of a reliable operation, customer-friendly service, growing destinations and low fares is helping us continue to grow our loyalty customer base. Our loyalty program gives members access to over 950 destinations worldwide. We grew our active membership another 12% on the heels of 15.5% growth in 2015. Our base of loyalty members is actually 30% larger today than it was 2 years ago. This is remarkable for a mature program, especially in the face of vigorous competition.
And then lastly, with respect to the credit card accounts, they're up over 12% for the quarter. That's the highest growth since 2010. In addition, the revised economics of our newest credit card agreement is helping our revenue performance. For the first quarter, we're tracking ahead of plan and on track to achieve our annual run rate of $60 million.
We expect growth in card members to remain strong because come June 1, we'll be able to go to market with new cardholder products we negotiated with our new agreement. That includes a 30,000 bonus miles on approval. That's an increase of 20% from today and a free bag. In addition, new and existing members will no longer incur international transaction fees. We believe that this is the best airline credit card offering in the market [indiscernible].
As we shift our focus to the second quarter, I want to highlight a few data points around capacity and demand. Let's start with capacity. Alaska's capacity will be up approximately 11% in the second quarter. Almost half of that growth is driven by new markets we launched over the last year and about 1/3 is driven by the increase in our stage length. Said another way, ASM growth from core departures will only contribute 2%, which we believe is in line with the strength of the economy in the markets we serve. We expect capacity growth in the second half of 2016 to slow down to 5.5% to 6.5%, which puts our expectation for the full year capacity growth at 8%.
Moving to competitive outlook. We expect competitive capacity to remain elevated through the summer, up 14% for Q2 and Q3. This is 1 point higher than competitive capacity in the first quarter. Also, as a reminder, the shift of the Easter holiday to March is expected to reduce April PRASM by about a point.
As we look ahead to the rest of 2016, we will continue to grow our revenue base and deliver strong results. And here's why. First, over 90% of our capacity is deployed in domestic markets. Nearly all U.S. point-of-sale and demand continues to remain solid. Secondly, you might recall that 18 of the 21 new markets added last year started in the last 6 months of 2015. So as we move through this year, the percentage of our capacity in markets that have operated less than 12 months drops from 5.5% in the first half of this year to 2.5% in the second half of 2016. Third, we expect to introduce premium class in September with 75 aircraft in service by year-end. This will help with both revenue and loyalty growth. While the contribution in 2016 is marginal, we expect premium class to add about $85 million in annual profit by 2018.
So in summary, we're running a solid operation, taking great care of our customers. The first quarter saw us adding new aircraft, cities, customers, loyalty members, revenue and profit, all against the backdrop of an industry that shrank revenue this quarter.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Brandon."

As you heard, Air Group's adjusted net profit improved by 23%, and EPS grew by 29% to $1.45 a share. Our trailing 12-month ROIC of 25.6% was 550 basis points higher than at the end of this point last year.On an adjuste",1058,"Thanks, Andrew, and hey, everyone. As you heard, Air Group's adjusted net profit improved by 23%, and EPS grew by 29% to $1.45 a share. Our trailing 12-month ROIC of 25.6% was 550 basis points higher than at the end of this point last year.
On an adjusted pretax basis, we earned $290 million, a $50 million or 21% increase over prior year. Revenues grew by $78 million. Yield costs declined by $66 million, and those gains were offset by a $94 million increase in nonfuel costs. This is the seventh consecutive year of profitability in the seasonally weak first quarter, and profit has increased steadily for each of those 7 years.
Consolidated nonfuel unit costs were down 1.2%. Our leaders are doing a good job managing divisional cost of budget and hitting productivity metrics. For example, our broadest measure of productivity, passengers per FTE, is tracking at 1.8% better than plan on mainline. Our flight ops group is spot on their hard-time plan, and our maintenance division productivity is tracking slightly ahead of plan, just to name a few. Our people understand how high productivity is an important source of our cost advantage.
For the second quarter, we forecast unit costs ex fuel to be down 1%. And for the full year, we now expect ex fuel cost to decline by 0.5%. There are 3 main drivers from the change from our initial full year guidance.
First, we've changed our performance-base pay or PBP plan to increase the participation level for our supervisors and our managers. These are incredibly important roles, and our board wanted to have their PBP participation better reflect their level of responsibility. PBP has been and continues to be a very strong driver of engagement among our employees.
Next, third-party regional expense was understated in our initial guidance. The new guidance now properly reflects the increase in SkyWest CPA flying costs through the year. And finally, new minimum wage requirements in certain markets are having a greater impact than we initially modeled. In addition, our results in Q1 and thus our full year forecast includes some costs associated with our Virgin America deal.
Going forward, we'll be excluding deal and integration costs from our guidance since the timing and amount of these costs are variable. We'll also begin excluding them from our adjusted results.
Even with the revised cost guidance, 2016 will be the 14th year out of the last 15 for mainline cost reduction and the seventh year in a row for Air Group. As a result, our cost advantage over the legacy carriers will further widen this year.
Turning to fuel. Our economic fuel cost per gallon was $1.29, down from $1.98 in Q1 of last year, which contributed to the $66 million decline in economic fuel expense. Our fuel burn on an ASM per gallon basis improved by another 1.8% since Q1 last year and will just continue to get better as we work through the retirement of the 737-400 classics by the end of 2017 and replace them with 737-900ERs, which are 25% more fuel efficient.
Our cash flow from operations was $527 million, and we ended the quarter with nearly $1.6 billion in cash. Even after adjusting for leases, we're in a net cash position of almost $600 million. Our debt to cap, including leases, now stands at 26%. Our net cash position, the 95 unencumbered aircraft in our fleet, our investment-grade balance sheet and our long track record of conservative financial management put us in a strong position to raise the capital necessary to fund the proposed acquisition of Virgin America. Our treasury team is hard at work with potential lenders. Initial results are very encouraging both in terms of the number of and diversity of lenders that want to work with us.
Andrew mentioned the order for E175s. We're excited to add this jet to the Horizon fleet and the profit opportunity that it opens up in new markets. We're impressed with Embraer's commitment to working by our side as the Horizon team incorporates the E175 efficiently into our operation. We currently have 7 SkyWest E175s operating in our network and expect to have 15 by the end of the year. Horizon will start taking delivery of the E175 in 2017. The Q400 will continue to fly our shorter routes, and Bombardier remains an important business partner of ours.
In the mainline operation, we took delivery of 6 737-900ERs in the first quarter and will take another 13 by year-end. 
On an Air Group stand-alone basis, we're currently expecting CapEx to be approximately $750 million this year, which includes $685 million of CapEx associated with firm orders and $70 million of CapEx for Boeing 737 options that we are likely to exercise. We've produced over $400 million of free cash flow in the first quarter of 2016 alone, further strengthening our balance sheet while allowing us to continue to return capital to our owners. Through yesterday, we've repurchased a total of 2.1 million shares for $161 million or 1.7% of the shares outstanding as of the beginning of the year. We also paid $34 million in dividends so far this year.
As we announced on April 4, we're planning to slow share repurchases in order to help fund the acquisition. We expect total share repurchases for 2016 to be between $190 million and $200 million. So when combined with our dividend, which will continue and is currently yielding 1.4%, we expect total return to shareholders to be about $325 million this year.
We're off to a great start in 2016, but we have much work ahead as we go through the integration effort. Although there's a lot going on, we're mindful that we need to remain focused on the core business. We're going to maintain the same level of discipline and budget rigor so that we hit our operational and financial goals. I'm super focused on the risk that we lose a bit of budget discipline with the integration work, and we're setting up controls now to ensure that, that does not happen.
I want to thank everyone involved in the integration in advance for the huge effort that they're about to undertake to combine Alaska and Virgin America into the premier airline for people on the West Coast.
And with that, let's go to questions."

So if you just look at those 30 firms, kind of the way it staggers out is $40 million in 2016, $280 million in 2017 and roughly $250 million in 2018 and 2019. So the big increase in CapEx is simply related to the regional jet order that we placed."

And then the credit card, really the Mileage Plan overall sort of on the other line item really was up about $25 million, $30 million for the quarter. So that was kind of the contribution there. And a lot of that was driven by again the new credit card deal that we have in the new economics and that deal was started in January and then just the volume. As Andrew mentioned in his remarks, credit cardholders are up 12%. So that really drove volume and the number of miles we sold to the Affinity card partner.

There are a lot of overlap in some of the tech companies between Seattle and the Bay Area. So we'll have a little bit of a head start in the relationship there. So I would just say that we don't have exact numbers today, but that is going to evolve and I think corporate will become a more important part of our network going forward."

It's -- business travel will be important, and we will, want to be the go-to airline for business travel up and down the West Coast. But [indiscernible] some updated information. We sort of confirm something a lot of us already knew. It basically showed roughly 70% of the market -- I think the survey period was the last 12 months. 70% of the market in the last 12 months was leisure, and that's up from 50%. Joe, you might remember, but it's 20 years ago or something like that. But the business has just moved more and more towards leisure. And for leisure work, you got to have a strong economy, businesses need to be doing well, you got to have people with money in their pockets to buy tickets. The point I'm making is that we feel really good about this combination with Virgin because we're really well set to serve the high end of that leisure market as well as the business market. So we think we're really in the sweet spot of where the demand is and perhaps in even an underserved segment of the market here."

When that actually started, it started in the city of Sea-Tac, which is a community here with 11 square miles. And our minimum wage at that time went from something like $9 something change to $15. Alaska's position was, a, this is kind of -- the playing field isn't level. This is sort of a patchwork way of rolling out a new idea for our society. And so we've sort of said this does have the ability to penalize a hometown airline and an airline that we think is a tremendous -- we think we bring a lot of value to the community, for customers, employees and so forth. So we just said we didn't push back on the Sea-Tac minimum wage ordinance, but it was really in the sense of less just something in a less patchwork fashion. As you know, I think, we, at the same time as we did that, we asked our contractors 2 or 3 years ago to take their own minimum wages up from the rates they were to $12 an hour, and I think they've gone to $15 an hour now. I think they've all gone to $15 an hour. So, I guess, in that sense, we're not fighting it anymore. They are at $15 an hour. But yes, the other point, Dominic, that we try to make throughout this thing is to, I think there's a challenge for all of us right now to work with our economy so that these economies benefit everybody who's participating in the economy. But we don't damage the businesses too much in the process. And that's another point Alaska's tried to make as we roll through this, but I don't. Maybe to summarize, we're -- society is going through a process here. We're participants in that process. We want to be -- we want to do our civic duty. We want these jobs to be good jobs for people.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for Alaska Air Group's first quarter 2016 earnings call.
On the call today, our CEO, Brad Tilden, will provide an overview of the business; our Chief Commercial Officer, Andrew Harrison, will share the revenue results for the quarter; followed by Brandon Pedersen, our CFO, who will discuss our financial results, capital allocation plans and outlook 2016.
Several members of our senior management team are also on hand to help answer your questions.
As a reminder, our comments today will include forward-looking statements regarding our future expectations, which may differ significantly from actual results. Information on risk factors that could affect our business can be found in our SEC filings.
We will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures such as adjusted earnings and unit costs, excluding fuel. We've provided a reconciliation between the most directly comparable GAAP and non-GAAP measures in our earnings release.
In addition, today's call may be deemed a solicitation in respect of Alaska Air Group's contemplated acquisition of Virgin America. The information discussed today is qualified in its entirety by the proxy statement that Virgin America will be filing in the future, and that will be available on Virgin America's Investor Relations page at ir.virginamerica.com. 
All right. With that lengthy disclosure done, let's look at results. This morning, Alaska Air Group reported a first quarter GAAP net profit of $184 million. Excluding the small impact of mark-to-market adjustments related to our fuel hedge portfolio, Air Group reported a record adjusted net income of $183 million, that's up 23%.
Earnings per share grew by 29.5% to $1.45 per share. The higher growth rate in EPS is driven by over 7.3 million shares that we have repurchased during the last 12 months. Additional information about cost expectations, capacity plans, fuel hedging, capital expenditures and other items can be found in our investor update included in our Form 8-K issued this morning and available on our website at alaskaair.com.

Before I jump into the results for this quarter, I want to talk for a minute about our proposed acquisition of Virgin America.

Before I jump into the results for this quarter, I want to talk for a minute about our proposed acquisition of Virgin America. Virgin America and Alaska share similar philosophies about building alignment with and taking care of our people and about putting customers first. Both of us run strong operations. We're both recognized for our terrific customer service. We both have a great onboard product, and we have 2 of the youngest and most fuel-efficient fleets in the industry. We're excited about bringing together 2 great airlines to create an airline that will have a national footprint and one that we believe will be the premier airline for people who live anywhere along the West Coast. The next steps in the process involve a vote by Virgin America shareholders sometime in the second quarter and a review by the Department of Justice. We believe this combination strengthens our 2 airlines and enhances competition from the innovative and low-fare segment of the market. So we are hoping for swift clearance to close, which could be 60 days or less. Even if the DOJ decides that the deal warrants a closer look, we hope to have clearance well before the end of the year.
In the meantime, we remain focused on execution and integration planning. On that front, I want to share that Ben Minicucci, our Chief Operating Officer, will be leading the charge on integration. He understands operations very well and while he drives hard for results, he cares a lot about people. And that is the real key to success. We are all fully invested in this, but we're also very excited to see Ben do great things with this responsibility.
We're working hard to lay out the groundwork for a smooth integration and part of that is making sure our stand-alone business is humming along nicely. So let's talk about the business that our team of 15,000 people is running today. Lavanya just shared the numbers, and it's evident that we're performing well financially. But it's also important to note that the industry as a whole is lot healthier and producing strong results. What I'm really proud of is that our team is continuously moving the ball forward. We're off to a strong start in 2016 on almost every front.
Let's start with the operations. Our people continue to do a great job of running a good operation. 87.5% of our mainline flights arrived on time in the quarter, and that's up 2.5 points from 2015. And I think Horizon's on-time performance will be even higher than that. And our completion rate was 99.3%. We expect that both our mainline on-time performance and our completion rate will lead the 8 largest domestic airlines.
Now let's talk about customer service, which we believe is what really differentiates airlines. Our people are taking great care of our customers and providing them an experience that is unique in this industry. Our customer satisfaction rating of 86.3% is a new record for the first quarter and reflects the time and effort spent by our team last year conducting customer service workshops, which we call Beyond Service. Our customers are rewarding us with their loyalty and voting with their wallets literally by signing up to the Alaska Airlines credit card. Both programs continue to grow at unprecedented rates and are providing us loyal customers, which make our network growth more successful and more profitable. Andrew will talk more about this in a moment.
Our growth is providing greater options to our customers and generating strong returns for our owners. Our network team does a great job of identifying demand and then matching that demand with the right amount of capacity or supply. Sometimes this means getting out of routes that don't meet our return targets like L.A. to Vancouver. Sometimes, this means making refinements -- making small refinements to the schedule. And sometimes, it means tapping into new opportunities.
We've added 41 new markets over the last 2 years, and 5 of them came in the most recent quarter. 41 markets in the aggregate are not only profitable but are producing fully allocated returns that are meaningful to our overall business and well above our cost of capital. What's more remarkable is that the 5 markets added in the last quarter are already profitable, and 3 of them are producing returns that are higher than our cost of capital. So our strategy is working. Our folks are running a strong operation and taking care of customers on-board and on the ground. And we're deploying capacity in markets where we enjoy strong customer loyalty, and our assets are producing returns that exceed our cost of capital. And these returns are reflected in the numbers that you saw this morning.
Now let's look at those numbers. Our net income for the quarter was $183 million, which was 23% higher than 2015. When we factor in the 7.3 million shares we bought back over the last 12 months, our earnings per share of $1.45 increased 29.5%. We expect this EPS growth to lead all but 36 companies in the S&P 500. In fact, our strong EPS growth stands in contrast to the average company in the S&P 500, where earnings are expected to shrink by 3.5%.
Our pretax margin grew by 260 basis points to 21.5%, bringing our trailing 12-month pretax margin to 24.5%. We expect this to be one of the best margins in the industry, and we also expect it to lead about 80% of the companies in the S&P 500.
And finally, our ROIC for the trailing 12 months of 25.6% is more than 3x our cost of capital and substantially higher than high-quality industrials in the S&P 500.
As we look forward, our 15,000 employees are operating safely and are taking care of our customers and each other. Our core business is strong, and we're seeing robust demand for our product. And as a result, our business is producing the sort of returns that you should expect from high-quality industrials.
I want to thank everybody here. Our very talented and dedicated frontline employees as well as a terrific leadership team, all of whom are working very hard to produce these strong results and just as importantly, to position us to continue to do so in the future.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Andrew."
248501,329837839,961407,"Alaska Air Group, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2016",2016-04-21,"Earnings Calls","Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Executives","Thinks, Brad, and good morning, everyone. Our first quarter revenue performance was solid, especially when compared to the industry. We grew revenues by $78 million or 6.1%, while industry revenues declined 1%. We're able to achieve these revenue results",906,"Thinks, Brad, and good morning, everyone. Our first quarter revenue performance was solid, especially when compared to the industry. We grew revenues by $78 million or 6.1%, while industry revenues declined 1%. We're able to achieve these revenue results in the face of 13% competitive [indiscernible].
Our load factors remained high, while growing our own capacity at 12.9%. Despite expanding capacity over 2x the industry, our RASM decline of 6.1% was within 50 basis points of the industry. Our growth is enabling us to continue to offer our customers more destinations, grow our revenues and most importantly, grow a diverse and stable earnings stream. Our strong business performance is a result of a number of key drivers.
First, adding new markets is giving our customers more nonstop choices as well as providing greater options for connecting passengers. In the last 12 months, we've added 23 new markets to our network. In retail parlance, we are putting new products on the shelf and they're selling.
Second, we have new regional jets that enable us to provide customers with nonstop service to destinations they previously could only access via 1 or 2 stops. Seven of our 23 markets launched in the past 12 months were only made available due to the introduction of the Embraer E175s. This aircraft delivers the trip costs and range to ensure longer thin markets can be served profitably. We're excited about the possibilities of this aircraft, and Brandon will share a little more about our delivery stream in just a minute.
Third, our costs have come down approximately 1% for the 12-month period ending March 2016, while we expect industry costs have risen by about 3%. That's a net gap of 4 points in just 1 year. Our low costs are a sustainable advantage, allowing us to offer low fares and enabling our growth.
Fourth, the combination of a reliable operation, customer-friendly service, growing destinations and low fares is helping us continue to grow our loyalty customer base. Our loyalty program gives members access to over 950 destinations worldwide. We grew our active membership another 12% on the heels of 15.5% growth in 2015. Our base of loyalty members is actually 30% larger today than it was 2 years ago. This is remarkable for a mature program, especially in the face of vigorous competition.
And then lastly, with respect to the credit card accounts, they're up over 12% for the quarter. That's the highest growth since 2010. In addition, the revised economics of our newest credit card agreement is helping our revenue performance. For the first quarter, we're tracking ahead of plan and on track to achieve our annual run rate of $60 million.
We expect our growth in card members to remain strong because come June 1, we'll be able to go to market with new cardholder products we negotiated with our new agreement. That includes a 30,000 bonus miles on approval -- that's an increase of 20% from today, and a free bag. In addition, new and existing members will no longer incur international transaction fees. We believe that this is the best airline credit card offering in the market bar none.
As we shift our focus to the second quarter, I want to highlight a few data points around capacity and demand. Let's start with capacity. Alaska's capacity will be up approximately 11% in the second quarter. Almost half of that growth is driven by new markets we launched over the last year and about 1/3 is driven by the increase in our stage length. Said another way, ASM growth from core departures will only contribute 2%, which we believe is in line with the strength of the economy in the markets we serve. We expect capacity growth in the second half of 2016 to slow down to 5.5% to 6.5%, which puts our expectation for the full year capacity growth at 8%.
Moving to competitive outlook. We expect competitive capacity to remain elevated through the summer, up 14% for Q2 and Q3. This is 1 point higher than competitive capacity in the first quarter. Also, as a reminder, the shift of the Easter holiday to March is expected to reduce April PRASM by about a point.
As we look ahead to the rest of 2016, we will continue to grow our revenue base and deliver strong results. And here's why. First, over 90% of our capacity is deployed in domestic markets. Nearly all U.S. point-of-sale and demand continues to remain solid. Secondly, you might recall that 18 of the 21 new markets added last year started in the last 6 months of 2015. So as we move through this year, the percentage of our capacity in markets that have operated less than 12 months drops from 5.5% in the first half of this year to 2.5% in the second half of 2016. Third, we expect to introduce premium class in September, with 75 aircraft in service by year-end. This will help with both revenue and loyalty growth. While the contribution in 2016 is marginal, we expect premium class to add about $85 million in annual profit by 2018.
So in summary, we're running a solid operation, taking great care of our customers. The first quarter saw us adding new aircraft, cities, customers, loyalty members, revenue and profit, all against the backdrop of an industry that shrank revenue this quarter.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Brandon."

As you heard, Air Group's adjusted net profit improved by 23%, and EPS grew by 29% to $1.45 a share. Our trailing 12-month ROIC of 25.6% was 550 basis points higher than at the end of this point last year.On an adjuste",1058,"Thanks, Andrew, and hey, everyone. As you heard, Air Group's adjusted net profit improved by 23%, and EPS grew by 29% to $1.45 a share. Our trailing 12-month ROIC of 25.6% was 550 basis points higher than at the end of this point last year.
On an adjusted pretax basis, we earned $290 million, a $50 million or 21% increase over prior year. Revenues grew by $78 million. Yield costs declined by $66 million, and those gains were offset by a $94 million increase in nonfuel costs. This is the seventh consecutive year of profitability in the seasonally weak first quarter, and profit has increased steadily for each of those 7 years.
Consolidated nonfuel unit costs were down 1.2%. Our leaders are doing a good job managing divisional cost to budget and hitting productivity metrics. For example, our broadest measure of productivity, passengers per FTE, is tracking at 1.8% better than plan on mainline. Our flight ops group is spot on their hard-time plan, and our maintenance division productivity is tracking slightly ahead of plan, just to name a few. Our people understand how high productivity is an important source of our cost advantage.
For the second quarter, we forecast unit costs ex fuel to be down 1%. And for the full year, we now expect ex fuel cost to decline by 0.5%. There are 3 main drivers from the change from our initial full year guidance.
First, we've changed our performance-base pay or PBP plan to increase the participation level for our supervisors and our managers. These are incredibly important roles, and our board wanted to have their PBP participation better reflect their level of responsibility. PBP has been and continues to be a very strong driver of engagement among our employees.
Next, third-party regional expense was understated in our initial guidance. The new guidance now properly reflects the increase in SkyWest CPA flying costs through the year. And finally, new minimum wage requirements in certain markets are having a greater impact than we initially modeled. In addition, our results in Q1 and thus our full year forecast includes some costs associated with our Virgin America deal.
Going forward, we'll be excluding deal and integration costs from our guidance since the timing and amount of these costs are variable. We'll also begin excluding them from our adjusted results.
Even with the revised cost guidance, 2016 will be the 14th year out of the last 15 for mainline cost reduction and the seventh year in a row for Air Group. As a result, our cost advantage over the legacy carriers will further widen this year.
Turning to fuel. Our economic fuel cost per gallon was $1.29, down from $1.98 in Q1 of last year, which contributed to the $66 million decline in economic fuel expense. Our fuel burn on an ASM per gallon basis improved by another 1.8% since Q1 last year and will just continue to get better as we work through the retirement of the 737-400 classics by the end of 2017 and replace them with 737-900ERs, which are 25% more fuel efficient.
Our cash flow from operations was $527 million, and we ended the quarter with nearly $1.6 billion in cash. Even after adjusting for leases, we're in a net cash position of almost $600 million. Our debt to cap, including leases, now stands at 26%. Our net cash position, the 95 unencumbered aircraft in our fleet, our investment-grade balance sheet and our long track record of conservative financial management put us in a strong position to raise the capital necessary to fund the proposed acquisition of Virgin America. Our treasury team is hard at work with potential lenders. Initial results are very encouraging both in terms of the number of and diversity of lenders that want to work with us.
Andrew mentioned the order for E175s. We're excited to add this jet to the Horizon fleet and the profit opportunity that it opens up in new markets. We're impressed with Embraer's commitment to working by our side as the Horizon team incorporates the E175 efficiently into our operation. We currently have 7 SkyWest E175s operating in our network and expect to have 15 by the end of the year. Horizon will start taking delivery of the E175 in 2017. The Q400 will continue to fly our shorter routes, and Bombardier remains an important business partner of ours.
In the mainline operation, we took delivery of 6 737-900ERs in the first quarter and will take another 13 by year-end. 
On an Air Group stand-alone basis, we're currently expecting CapEx to be approximately $750 million this year, which includes $685 million of CapEx associated with firm orders and $70 million of CapEx for Boeing 737 options that we are likely to exercise. We've produced over $400 million of free cash flow in the first quarter of 2016 alone, further strengthening our balance sheet while allowing us to continue to return capital to our owners. Through yesterday, we've repurchased a total of 2.1 million shares for $161 million or 1.7% of the shares outstanding as of the beginning of the year. We also paid $34 million in dividends so far this year.
As we announced on April 4, we're planning to slow share repurchases in order to help fund the acquisition. We expect total share repurchases for 2016 to be between $190 million and $200 million. So when combined with our dividend, which will continue and is currently yielding 1.4%, we expect total return to shareholders to be about $325 million this year.
We're off to a great start in 2016, but we have much work ahead as we go through the integration effort. Although there's a lot going on, we're mindful that we need to remain focused on the core business. We're going to maintain the same level of discipline and budget rigor so that we hit our operational and financial goals. I'm super focused on the risk that we lose a bit of budget discipline with the integration work, and we're setting up controls now to ensure that, that does not happen.
I want to thank everyone involved in the integration in advance for the huge effort that they're about to undertake to combine Alaska and Virgin America into the premier airline for people on the West Coast.
And with that, let's go to questions."

And if you want -- we don't give guidance, but what I would say is yields most likely to come when and if capacity sort of slows down and oil starts to go up. And the only other thing I just -- I would want to say is we're here today due to low costs and low fares.

Joe, you might remember, but it's 20 years ago or something like that. But the business has just moved more and more towards leisure. And for leisure to work, you've got to have a strong economy, businesses need to be doing well, you got to have people with money in their pockets to buy tickets. The point I'm making is that we feel really good about this combination with Virgin because we're really well set to serve the high end of that leisure market as well as the business market.

But we really, the reason we're doing this is to get a foothold in -- a bigger foothold in the State of California, something that we can grow in the decades ahead. And I mean, the good news is that Alaska Airlines is good in building loyalty and growing customers, and that's what we're going to be doing in California. And what I'll just say is, we're all really looking forward to that. Anything you want to add, Ben?"

When that actually started, it started in the city of Sea-Tac, which is a community here with 11 square miles. And our minimum wage at that time went from something like $9 and change to $15. Alaska's position was, a, this is kind of -- the playing field isn't level. This is sort of a patchwork way of rolling out a new idea for our society. And so what we've sort of said is this does have the ability to penalize a hometown airline and an airline that we think is a tremendous -- we think we bring a lot of value to the community, for customers, employees and so forth. So we just said -- we did push back on the Sea-Tac minimum wage ordinance, but it was really in the sense of let's do something in a less patchwork fashion. As you know, I think, we, at the same time as we did that, we asked our contractors 2 or 3 years ago to take their own minimum wages up from the rates they were to $12 an hour, and I think they've gone to $15 an hour now, if I'm not -- I think they've all gone to $15 an hour. So, I guess, in that sense, we're not fighting it anymore. They are at $15 an hour. But yes, the other point, Dominic, that we've tried to make throughout this thing is to, I think there's a challenge for all of us right now to work with our economy so that these economies benefit everybody who's participating in the economy. But we don't damage the businesses too much in the process. And that's another point Alaska's tried to make as we roll through this, but I don't know. Maybe to summarize, we're -- society is going through a process here. We're participants in that process. We want to be -- we want to do our civic duty. We want these jobs to be good jobs for people. But what we do want to do is make sure you've got an environment or an economy where businesses can thrive and grow and bring value to customers and employees and owners."

As we progress through 2016 and look forward to the second half of the year, we know that investors have a lot in their minds and the equity market certainly reflect that. As you know, we try to stay focused and concentrated our efforts here on building a fundamentally good business. As we look ahead, we feel very good about our underlying business, and all of us here are very said about the future. The fundament of our business are strong, we're running a great airline, and we believe the merger with Virgin America is going to create a very strong airlines, with reach across the entire country and with real strength in originating traffic up and down the West Coast. 
I'll start up today by talking about the underlying business and then share an update on the merger. First, we are operating safely and on time. Our folks are doing an outstanding job, and I want to thank them. 88.7% of our flights arrived on time in the second quarter, and we did this with much less block time than the average airlines, which is a credit to how efficient and consistent we are in the ground. We expect this on-time performance will lead the 6 largest domestic airlines. We also completed 99.8% of our flights in the second quarter, canceling on average only one mainline flight per day. 
Second, our employees are taking great care of our customers. We spent a lot of time with our frontline employees building alignment and talking with them about the sort of airline we want to be for our customers. We're seeing substantial evidence that these investments are paying off. Our customer satisfaction scores, which have been on the 7 or 8-year run continue to improve. In fact, our score for the second quarter was the highest second quarter score ever. And as you know, we also won our ninth consecutive J.D. Power award for customer service during the quarter. We earned the highest score of any airline included in the survey in each of the 7 areas measured, including a move from fourth place to first place for in-flight service, which reflects investments we've made in food and beverage service, in-flight entertainment, seating, seat power and bins. This award is a fantastic recognition for our employees, and I want to congratulate them and thank them for everything they are doing to make Alaska stand out in the eyes of our customers. 
Our model is based on building preference for our airlines, and we build this preference with on-time operations, fantastic customer service and, of course, low [indiscernible] This model has worked, not only in the last couple of years, but in the last 15 to 20 years. 
Since the first quarter of 2010, we have launched 100 new markets and we've outpaced industry revenue growth by a factor of 3. This in the midst of one of the bigger competitive Anchorage in this industry has seen in years. This growth would have been possible without our mentality of continually reducing cost, which allows us to offer customers low fares, while still maintaining industry-leading margins. Brendan is going to share more detail in a moment on what the compounding effects of cost reductions since 2008 has meant to our financial performance. 
But to give you a sense of how powerful a low-cost structure is, even if we adjust our fuel prices to $2 a gallon, markets representing 97% of our revenue for the last 12 months would still be profitable. And it's important to know that this is done with the full allocation of all cost. 
This model is also delivering returns that are consistently in excess of our cost to capital. In fact, our trailing 12-month ROIC of 25.9% puts us in a top 10% of all S&P 500 companies. Our successful growth showed that providing customers with a high value experience at low fares is a winning formula that, especially in the upper end leisure in business segments or what we call the leisure market. And this is a great platform for our future, combining our network, which has strengthened the Pacific Northwest and Alaska, with Virgin America's strength in California. We will be a very strong airline with strength up-and-down the West Coast and, of course, we will have a national reach. For example, in the future, will have 25 flights a day to New York City from 7 West Coast airports and 10 flights a day to Boston from 5 West Coast airports. 
We also see the increased choice and competition the merger will provide that's fundamentally good for consumers. Speaking of bringing the 2 to come to this together, I want to share a few thoughts around timing and the integration process. First, timing. We have an agreement in place with the Justice Department concerning the timing of their review, and we're forecasting the close will occur in the fourth quarter. When the deal closes, Virgin America will operate as a subsidiary of Alaska Air Group until achieve a single operating certificate, which we expect in the first quarter of 2018. We are committed to making this a very successful integration. 
During the post-close transition period, Ben will be the CEO of Virgin America and in addition to his role as President and CEO of Alaska Airlines. And Peter Hunt, who is currently virgin America's CFO, will be his President, and is responsible for day-to-day operations. Ben and Peter are proven leaders who will do a great job leading Virgin America during this time. The integration management office is up and running and is being led by [indiscernible] While there's a lot of functional work going on behind the scenes, I want to share a brief update with you on the key areas of culture, labor and brand. 
Starting with culture. We know that when mergers don't succeed especially in our industry, often people, or in other words, the culture, is the culprit. This in an area where we're spending a lot of time. Our high level goal is simply to retain the best of Alaska Airlines and the best of Virgin America and position the new combined company to be aligned, to be bold and to grow successfully well into the future. 
Moving to labor, we're meeting with labor leaders and have a positive discussions. We appreciate all the work the labor relations team and our labor leaders are doing to make this a smooth integration, and we are optimistic that the process will go well. 
And finally, I know a lot of you were curious about the brand. And as we said before, the Alaska brands is staying. We're also doing in-depth aftermarket research to better understand the elements of Virgin America's product and brand that customers love most, especially in California, and we expect to have a final decision on the brand in early 2017. 
To summarize, whether we're talking about Alaska as it stands today or the combined company post-merger, we're focused on the same bedrock principles. First, we want to be safe and on-time; second, we want to get the culture right and we want to build alignment with our people; third, we want to protect and grow our customer base; fourth, we want to maintain our low-cost structure and low fares; and finally, we want to consistently generate the level of returns that you expect from high-quality industrial companies. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Andrew."
248501,370612534,1009507,"Alaska Air Group, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 21, 2016",2016-07-21,"Earnings Calls","Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Brad, and good morning, everyone. Total second quarter revenue increased $57 million or 4%. This contrast with the industry revenue shrinking by about 2%.

This contrast with the industry revenue shrinking by about 2%. Over the past 5 years, our revenues are growing 35%, outpacing the industry by 3 to 1. This growth comes with strong return that resemble high-quality companies. 
Our second quarter PRASM was down 7.7%. We are very pleased that although our unti revenue performance was within the 150 basis points in the industry, notwithstanding the fact that we grew capacity by 11% with competitive capacity growing 13%. We're also very pleased to see our load factor at 85%, which was flat for the first time since the first quarter of 2013. That said, closing pricing has been showing weakness for reasons you are already familiar with. 
While we remain mindful of the environment we operate in, the fundamentals of Alaska are sound for several reasons. First, we're offering a high value product to customers at low fares. Our low fares are enabled by low costs and have allowed us to grow profitably. The 100 new markets Brad referenced earlier, in aggregate, our [indiscernible] margins at system average levels and represents approximately 20% of our annual revenues. I am also pleased to announce that we just learned we received approval for 4 additional flights to [indiscernible]. We plan to launch Portland and San Diego [indiscernible] this November and then San Jose and the third Seattle [indiscernible] in March and May, respectively. Secondly, when speaking of operate options our customers, partnerships are key. Earlier in June, we launched new Mileage Plan partnership with the Japan Airlines, making it the third international partner we've added in the last 12 months, Hainan and Iceland there being the other 2. That brings our total partners to 17, and allows us to serve over 950 destinations worldwide. A combination of greater reach and targeted promotion has helped increase the number of our members flying on our international partners by 32%. It is an interesting fact, our international partners, along with American Airlines on a combined basis, account for 34% of all international seats in the U.S. That's more than 81 of the global alliances. We expect the benefits of this offering to our customers to take a step change forward with our acquisition of Virgin America. This acquisition will result in us having a strong presence in the largest international West Coast gateways of Los Angeles and San Francisco. 
And lastly, membership in our Frequent-Flier Program is up 11%, and our credit card portfolio grew by 12%, both outpacing passenger growth in our network. Our loyalty program generated $200 million in cash for the second quarter, that's an increase of 16%. We expect this growth to continue giving our card offering, which includes 30,000 bonus miles, annual companion ticket, free bags, no international transaction fees and the lowest annual fees of 80 comparable airtime card. In addition, Costco, an iconic Pacific Northwest brand was a strong West Coast presence, moved to exclusive acceptance of Visa card at its warehouses last month, which has come as no surprise that our customers also shop at Costco for its great products and prices. We have seen spend on our card increasing diffidently as a result. 
Shifting our focus to the back half of the year. Here are a few things to be mindful of. We expect competitive capacity in our markets to be up 13% in Q3 and 12% in Q4, that's about the same as we face for more than a year and a half now. As others make post summer [indiscernible] to their schedules, competitive capacity has come down by 1 point in the third quarter and by 4 points for the fourth quarter since we last spoke to you in April. 
Moving to Alaska's capacity. It will moderate significantly as we move through the rest of the year. Our capacity will be up about 8% in the third quarter and only 3% in the fourth quarter, which is a significant reduction from the 12% we grew during the first half of the year. Our full year guidance sits at about 8.5%, which includes the New York flight I just mentioned, as well as Cuba. 
In summary, the fundamentals of our delight business are strong. We're growing and diversifying revenues, while continuing to build brand loyalty. We have confidence in our process model to continue to grow profitably and strong returns for our owners. I'm personally excited about speaking with you next quarter as we expect to have closed on Virgin America, which will begin the next chapter of our journey. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Brandon."

It's a fabulous sunny morning here in Seattle, and it's great to be speaking with you today.

It's a fabulous sunny morning here in Seattle, and it's great to be speaking with you today. As Brad said, Air Group's adjusted net profit improved by 14% to $263 million and earnings per share improved by more than 20%. Our pretax margin was a strong 28.4% and grew by 260 basis points and should be among the best in the domestic industry. 
Trailing 12 ROIC grew by a nearly 400 basis points to just under 26%. On an adjusted pretax basis, we are in $424 million, an increase of $54 million over the second quarter of last year. As Andrew said, revenues grew by 4% or $57 million, a result that we're happy with considering aggregate revenues across the S&P 500 are projected to shrink by 0.6% in the second quarter. Fuel cost declined by $56 million and nonfuel cost increased by about the same amount. Our unit -- our nonfuel unit costs performance in the quarter was really strong, with unit cost declining by 3.7%. We did see a shift in some of the cost into the back half of the year, so our full year guidance remains unchanged at this point. 
We continue to believe that our model of high productivity and low overhead is a winning combination to keep nonfuel costs in check. Passengers per FTE, our broadest measure of productivity, improved by another 2.7% to $1.99, a new Q2 record for us. And it's working at a division level, too. I want to gave a shout out to our flight ops team, pilots hard time this quarter was better in both budget and prior year. 
We've been shipping away on our costs slowly each year going back to 2009 and, in fact, even back to 2003, and sometimes it helps to go up to 41,000 feet to look at the progress we've made. Recently, our FDA team [indiscernible] that and made a really important observation. If our ex- fuel unit cost had grown in line with the rest of the industry instead of the gradual decline we've seen each year since 2009, our pretax profit this year would be almost $800 million lower. That translates to about $4 a share or more than $4 billion of market cap accurate multiples. So while each individual year of 0.5%  or 1% cost reduction doesn't sound like a lot, the cumulative impact is enormous. 
Looking forward, we'll see the backside of that cost shift and currently expect ex fuel cost to be up about 3% in Q3 and up about 0.5% in Q4, which keeps our full year unit cost declines to about 0.5% in line with prior guidance, as I said. 
Cash flow from operations for the first half of the year was $900 million, and we ended the June quarter with over $1.6 billion of cash on hand. Adjusted for leases, we have a net cash position of approximately $700 million, and our debt to cap is at the 25%. Our balance sheet is in the best shape it's ever been, and it positions us well for our planned merger with Virgin America in the fourth quarter. Our treasury team has now obtains committed financing for the deal. Interest was very strong, we ended up over subscribed, and we were able to partner with a diverse set of leading aviation lenders. I want to thank our lenders for their partnership and support. We're finding that it's an excellent time to raise money, market rates are at historic lows and spreads for investment grade secured loans are tight. Alaska's all-in interest rate will be low. I want to compliment  our treasury and legal teams for doing such a fabulous job in this process. 
Air Group  has built a repetition with both lenders and investors as a conservatively managed company with a strong balance sheet, and that's not going to change. After we complete the transaction, we'll still have about 20 unencumbered Nexgen Boeing 737s, and we're going to redeleveraging the balance sheet. 
And speaking of fleet, we've taken delivery of 12 737-900ER so far this year, and have 7 additional 900ERs coming in the back half of the year. As a reminder, many of these deliveries are replacements for older 737-400s. 
During the quarter, we also exercised 3 options for E175s for deliver in 2017. This is not new capital. Instead, we've chosen to buy them rather than lease them because we prefer the economics of buying. 
We expect total CapEx for the year to be approximately $750 million, consistent with prior guidance. As a result of the 3 E175 auctions I just talked about, our CapEx for 2017 ticks up slightly to just above $1 billion. And again, this is not new capital in our plan. As a reminder, we have 2 big fleet initiatives in process. Four retirement of the 737-300s by the end of 2017, which will be good for reliability, passenger comfort and costs, and introduction of 33 E175s into the Horizon fleet, which will help us grow into it longer, thinner markets, where we believe we have significant opportunity to expand profitably. 
So far this year, we've generated $559 million of free cash flow. We paused on the share repurchase program following the announcement of our planned merger, but continue to pay a meaningful dividend, which is currently yielding about 1.7%. I agree with Andrew. Our business is humming along nicely, and we're taking advantage of the profitable growth opportunities. The resulting strong cash flow and our fortress balance sheet have positioned us well to complete the planned merger and set us set up for long-term success.

We're going to make profit maximizing decisions, and some of that is going to come from PRASM and some of that is going to come from CASM. I think, the danger in focusing just on PRASM is that you don't know what happens in any particular market, you don't know what happens with fuel prices, and I think, you're seeing a lot of that now but I then day, it's really MASM that matters and profit on the bottom line and the actual cash that goes into your checking account that you can use to delever the balance sheet and payback debt and returning capital to shareholders.

As we progress through 2016 and look forward to the second half of the year, we know that investors have a lot in their minds, and the equity market certainly reflects that. As you know, we try to stay focused",1247,"Thanks, Lavanya, and good morning, everybody. As we progress through 2016 and look forward to the second half of the year, we know that investors have a lot in their minds, and the equity market certainly reflects that. As you know, we try to stay focused and concentrated our efforts here on building a fundamentally good business. As we look ahead, we feel very good about our underlying business, and all of us here are very excited about the future. The fundamentals of our business are strong. We're running a great airline, and we believe the merger with Virgin America is going to create a very strong airlines, with reach across the entire country and with real strength in originating traffic up and down the West Coast.
I'll start off today by talking about the underlying business and then share an update on the merger. First, we are operating safely and on time. Our folks are doing an outstanding job, and I want to thank them. 88.7% of our flights arrived on time in the second quarter, and we did this with much less block time than the average airline, which is a credit to how efficient and consistent we are in the ground. We expect this on-time performance will lead the 6 largest domestic airlines. We also completed 99.8% of our flights in the second quarter, canceling on average only one mainline flight per day.
Second, our employees are taking great care of our customers. We spent a lot of time with our frontline employees building alignment and talking with them about the sort of airline we want to be for our customers. We're seeing substantial evidence that these investments are paying off. Our customer satisfaction scores, which have been on the 7 or 8-year run continue to improve. In fact, our score for the second quarter was the highest second quarter score ever. And as you know, we also won our ninth consecutive J.D. Power award for customer service during the quarter. We earned the highest score of any airline included in the survey in each of the 7 areas measured, including a move from fourth place to first place for in-flight service, which reflects investments we've made in food and beverage service, in-flight entertainment, seating, seat power and bins. This award is a fantastic recognition for employees, and I want to congratulate them and thank them for everything they are doing to make Alaska stand out in the eyes of our customers.
Our model is based on building preference for our airlines, and we build this preference with on-time operations, fantastic customer service and, of course, low fares. This model has worked not only in the last couple of years, but in the last 15 to 20 years.
Since the first quarter of 2010, we've launched 100 new markets, and we've outpaced industry revenue growth by a factor of 3. This in the midst of one of the bigger competitive [indiscernible] this industry has seen in years. This growth would not have been possible without our mentality of continually reducing costs, which allows us to offer customers low fares, while still maintaining industry-leading margins. Brandon is going to share more detail in a moment on what the compounding effect of cost reductions since 2008 has meant to our financial performance.  But to give you a sense of how powerful a low-cost structure is, even if we adjust our fuel prices to $2 a gallon, markets representing 97% of our revenue for the last 12 months would still be profitable. And it's important to know that this is done with a full allocation of all costs. 
This model is also delivering returns that are consistently in excess of our cost to capital. In fact, our trailing 12-month ROIC of 25.9% puts us in a top 10% of all S&P 500 companies. Our successful growth shows the providing customers with a high-value experience at low fares is a winning formula, especially in the upper-end leisure in business segments or what we call the leisure market. And this is a great platform for our future, combining our network, which has strengthened the Pacific Northwest and Alaska with Virgin America's strength in California. We will be a very strong airline with strength up and down the West Coast and, of course, we'll have national reach. For example, in the future we will have 25 flights a day to New York City from 7 West Coast airports and 10 flights a day to Boston from 5 West Coast airports.
We also see the increased choice and competition the merger will provide that's fundamentally good for consumers. Speaking of bringing the 2 companies together, I want to share a few thoughts around timing and the integration process. 
First, timing. We have an agreement in place with the Justice Department concerning the timing of their review, and we're forecasting the close will occur in the fourth quarter. When the deal closes, Virgin America will operate as a subsidiary of Alaska Air Group until we achieve a single operating certificate, which we expect in the first quarter of 2018. We are committed to making this a very successful integration.
During the post-close transition period, Ben will be the CEO of Virgin America, in addition to his role as President and COO of Alaska Airlines. And Peter Hunt, who is currently Virgin America's CFO, will be his President and responsible for day-to-day operations. Ben and Peter are proven leaders who will do a great job leading Virgin America during this time. The integration management office is up and running and is being led by Torque Zubeck. While there's a lot of functional work going on behind the scenes, I want to share a brief update with you on the key areas of culture, labor and brand.
Starting with culture. We know that when mergers don't succeed, especially in our industry, often people, or in other words, the culture, is the culprit. This in an area where we're spending a lot of time. Our high-level goal is simply to retain the best of Alaska Airlines and the best of Virgin America and position the new combined company to be aligned, to be bold and to grow successfully well into the future.
Moving to labor. We're meeting with labor leaders and have positive discussions. We appreciate all the work the labor relations team and other -- our labor leaders are doing to make this a smooth integration, and we are optimistic that the process will go well. 
And finally, I know a lot of you are curious about the brand. And as we said before, the Alaska brand is staying. We're also doing in-depth market research to better understand the elements of Virgin America's product and brand that customers love most, especially in California. And we expect to have a final decision on the brand in early 2017.
To summarize, whether we're talking about Alaska as it stands today or the combined company post-merger, we're focused on the same bedrock principles. First, we want to be safe and on time; second, we want to get the culture right, and we want to build alignment with our people; third, we want to protect and grow our customer base; fourth, we want to maintain our low-cost structure and low fares; and finally, we want to consistently generate the level of returns that you expect from high-quality industrial companies.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Andrew."
248501,370612534,1009879,"Alaska Air Group, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 21, 2016",2016-07-21,"Earnings Calls","Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Brad, and good morning, everyone. Total second quarter revenue increased $57 million or 4%. This contrast with the industry revenue shrinking by about 2%. Over the past 5 years, our revenues are growing 35%, outpacing the industry by 3 to 1. This",775,"Thanks, Brad, and good morning, everyone. Total second quarter revenue increased $57 million or 4%. This contrast with the industry revenue shrinking by about 2%. Over the past 5 years, our revenues are growing 35%, outpacing the industry by 3 to 1. This growth has come with strong returns that resemble high-quality companies.
Our second quarter PRASM was down 7.7%. We are very pleased now that our unit revenue performance was within 150 basis points in the industry, notwithstanding the fact that we grew capacity by 11%, with competitive capacity growing 13%. We're also very pleased to see our load factors at 85%, which was flat for the first time since the first quarter of 2013. That said, closing pricing has been showing weakness for reasons you are already familiar with.
While we're always mindful of the environment we operate in, the fundamentals of Alaska are sound for several reasons. First, we're offering a high-value product to customers at low fares. Our low fares are enabled by low costs and have allowed us to grow profitably. The 100 new markets Brad referenced earlier, in aggregate, our owning margins are at system average levels and represent approximately 20% of our annual revenues. I'm also pleased to announce that we just learned we've received approval for 4 additional flights to Newark [ph]. We plan to launch Portland and San Diego and Newark [ph] this November and then San Jose and a third Seattle-Newark [ph] in March and May, respectively. Secondly, when speaking of offering options to our customers, partnerships are key. 
Earlier in June, we launched new Mileage Plan partnership with Japan Airlines, making it the third international partner we've added in the last 12 months, Hainan and Iceland there being the other 2. That brings our total partners to 17 and allows us to serve over 950 destinations worldwide. A combination of greater reach and targeted promotion has helped increase the number of our members flying on our international partners by 32%. It is an interesting fact, our international partners, along with American Airlines, on a combined basis, account for 34% of all international seats in the U.S. That's more than 81 of the global alliances. We expect the benefit of this offering to our customers to take a step change forward with our acquisition of Virgin America. This acquisition will result in us having a strong presence in the largest international West Coast gateways of Los Angeles and San Francisco.
And lastly, membership in our Frequent-Flier Program is up 11%, and our credit card portfolio grew by 12%, both outpacing passenger growth in our network. Our loyalty program generated $200 million in cash for the second quarter, that's an increase of 16%. We expect this growth to continue giving our card offering, which includes 30,000 bonus miles, annual companion ticket, free bags, no international transactions fees and the lowest annual fees of 80 comparable airline card. In addition, Costco, an iconic Pacific Northwest brand with a strong West Coast presence, moved to exclusive acceptance of Visa Cards at its warehouses last month. It should come as no surprise that our customers also shop at Costco for its great products and prices. We've seen spend on their card increased significantly as a result.
Shifting our focus to the back half of the year. Here are a few things to be mindful of. We expect competitive capacity in our markets to be up 13% in Q3 and 12% in Q4, that's about the same as we face for more than 1.5 years now. As others make post-summer trims to their schedules, competitive capacity has come down by 1 point in the third quarter and by 4 points for the fourth quarter since we last spoke to you in April.
Moving to Alaska's capacity. It will moderate significantly as we move through the rest of the year. Our capacity will be up about 8% in the third quarter and only 3% in the fourth quarter, which is significant reduction from the 12% we grew during the first half of the year. Our full year guidance sits at about 8.5%, which includes the New York flight I just mentioned as well as Cuba. 
In summary, the fundamentals of our underlying business are strong. We're growing and diversifying revenues, while continuing to build brand loyalty. We've confidence in our business model to continue to grow profitably and owning strong returns for our owners. I'm personally excited about speaking with you next quarter as we expect to have closed on Virgin America, which will begin the next chapter of our journey.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Brandon."

It's a fabulous sunny morning here in Seattle, and it's great to be speaking with you today. As Brad said, Air Group's adjusted net profit improved by 14% to $263 million, and earnings per share improved by more than 20%. Our pretax margin was a strong 28.4% and grew by 260 basis points and should be among the best in the domestic industry.
Trailing 12 ROIC grew by a nearly 400 basis points to just under 26%. On an adjusted pretax basis, we are in $424 million, an increase of $54 million over the second quarter of last year. 
As Andrew said, revenues grew by 4% or $57 million, a result that we're happy with considering aggregate revenues across the S&P 500 are projected to shrink by 0.6% in the second quarter. Fuel cost declined by $56 million, and nonfuel cost increased by about the same amount. Our unit -- our nonfuel unit cost performance in the quarter was really strong with unit cost declining by 3.7%. We did see a shift in some of the cost into the back half of the year. So our full year guidance remains unchanged at this point.  We continue to believe that our model of high productivity and low overhead is a winning combination to keep nonfuel cost in check. 
Passengers per FTE, our broadest measure of productivity, improved by another 2.7% to 199 [ph], a new Q2 record for us. And it's working at a division level, too. I want to gave a shout out to our flight ops team, pilots hard time this quarter was better than both budget and prior year. 
We've been shipping away at our costs slowly each year going back to 2009 and, in fact, even back to 2003. And sometimes it helps to go up to 41,000 feet to look at the progress we've made. Recently, our FP&A team just add and made a really important observation. If our ex fuel unit cost had grown in line with the rest of the industry instead of the gradual decline we've seen each year since 2009, our pretax profit this year would be almost $800 million lower. That translates to about $4 a share or more than $4 billion of market cap at current multiples. So while each individual year of 0.5%  or 1% cost reduction doesn't sound like a lot, the cumulative impact is enormous.
Looking forward, we'll see the backside of that cost shift and currently expect ex fuel cost to be up about 3% in Q3 and up about 0.5% in Q4, which keeps our full year unit cost declined to about 0.5% in line with prior guidance, as I said.
Cash flow from operations for the first half of the year was $900 million, and we ended the June quarter with over $1.6 billion of cash on hand. Adjusted for leases, we have a net cash position of approximately $700 million, and our debt-to-cap is at the 25%. Our balance sheet is in the best shape it's ever been, and it positions us well for our planned merger with Virgin America in the fourth quarter. Our treasury team has now obtained committed financing for the deal. Interest was very strong. We ended up over subscribed, and we were able to partner with a diverse set of leading aviation lenders. I want to thank our lenders for their partnership and support. We're finding that it's an excellent time to raise money, market rates are at historic lows and spreads for investment-grade secured loans are tight. Alaska's all-in interest rate will be low. I want to compliment  our treasury and legal teams for doing such a fabulous job in this process.
Air Group has built a repetition with both lenders and investors as a conservatively managed company with a strong balance sheet, and that's not going to change. After we complete the transaction, we'll still have about 20 unencumbered next-gen Boeing 737s, and we're going to return to redeleveraging the balance sheet.
Speaking of fleet, we've taken delivery of 12 737-900ERs so far this year and have 7 additional 900ERs coming in the back half of the year. As a reminder, many of these deliveries are replacements for older 737-400s.
During the quarter, we also exercised 3 options for E175s for delivery in 2017. This is not new capital. Instead, we've chosen to buy them rather than lease them because we prefer the economics of owning.
We expect total CapEx for the year to be approximately $750 million, consistent with prior guidance. As a result of the 3 E175 auctions I just talked about, our CapEx for 2017 kicks up slightly to just about $1 billion. And again, this is not new capital in our plan. As a reminder, we have 2 big fleet initiatives in process. Full retirement of the 737-400s by the end of 2017, which will be good for reliability, passenger comfort and costs; and introduction of 3 -- 33 E175s into the Horizon fleet, which will help us grow into longer, thinner markets, where we believe we have significant opportunity to expand profitably.
So far this year, we've generated $559 million of free cash flow. We paused on the share repurchase program following the announcement of our planned merger, but continue to pay a meaningful dividend, which is currently yielding about 1.7%. I agree with Andrew. Our business is humming along nicely, and we're taking advantage of profitable growth opportunities. The resulting strong cash flow and our fortress balance sheet have positioned us well to complete the planned merger and set us up for long-term success. Everyone around the company is working extra hard as we prepare to combine 2 great airlines, and I want to thank our 15,000 employees for their efforts and congratulate them once again on a record, fabulous quarter.
And with that, we'd like to open it up to questions."

On the call today, our CEO, Brad Tilden, will provide an overview of the business and share our progress on the proposed acquisition of Virgin America; our Chief Commercial Officer, Andrew Harrison, who will share revenue results for the quarter; followed by Brandon Pedersen, our CFO, who will discuss our financial results, capital allocation plans and outlook for the second half of 2016. Several members of our senior management team are also on hand to help answer your questions.
As a reminder, our comments today will include forward-looking statements regarding our future expectations, which may differ significantly from actual results. Information on risk factors that could affect our business can be found in our SEC filings.
We will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures such as adjusted earnings and unit costs, excluding fuel. We have provided a reconciliation between the most directly comparable GAAP and non-GAAP measures in our earnings release.
In addition, today's call may be deemed a solicitation in respect of Alaska Air Group's contemplated acquisition of Virgin America. The information discussed today is qualified in its entirety by Virgin America's definitive proxy statement that was filed with the SEC on June 20, along with other relevant solicitation materials, which are all available on Virgin America's Investor Relations page at ir.virginamerica.com.
And now that I have complied with our GC's request in completeness, we will move to the results. This morning, Alaska Air Group reported a second quarter GAAP net profit of $260 million. Excluding the $6 million impact of mark-to-market adjustments related to our fuel hedge portfolio and a $9 million impact associated with merger-related costs, Air Group recorded a record adjusted net income of $263 million, up 14%. Earnings per share grew by 20% to $2.12 per share. Additional information about cost expectations, capacity plans, fuel hedging, capital expenditures and other items can be found in our investor update included in our Form 8-K issued this morning and available on our website at alaskaair.com. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Brad."

As we progress through 2016 and look forward to the second half of the year, we know that investors have a lot in their minds, and the equity market certainly reflects that. As you know, we try to stay focused",1250,"Thanks, Lavanya, and good morning, everybody. As we progress through 2016 and look forward to the second half of the year, we know that investors have a lot in their minds, and the equity market certainly reflects that. As you know, we try to stay focused and concentrated our efforts here on building a fundamentally good business. As we look ahead, we feel very good about our underlying business, and all of us here are very excited about the future. The fundamentals of our business are strong. We're running a great airline, and we believe the merger with Virgin America is going to create a very strong airlines, with reach across the entire country and with real strength in originating traffic up and down the West Coast.
I'll start off today by talking about the underlying business and then share an update on the merger. First, we are operating safely and on time. Our ops folks are doing an outstanding job, and I want to thank them. 88.7% of our flights arrived on time in the second quarter, and we did this with much less block time than the average airline, which is a credit to how efficient and consistent we are in the ground. We expect this on-time performance will lead the 6 largest domestic airlines. We also completed 99.8% of our flights in the second quarter, canceling on average only one mainline flight per day.
Second, our employees are taking great care of our customers. We spend a lot of time with our frontline employees building alignment and talking with them about the sort of airline we want to be for our customers. We're seeing substantial evidence that these investments are paying off. Our customer satisfaction scores, which have been on a 7- or 8-year run, continue to improve. In fact, our score for the second quarter was the highest second quarter score ever. And as you know, we also won our ninth consecutive J.D. Power award for customer service during the quarter. We earned the highest score of any airline included in the survey in each of the 7 areas measured, including a move from fourth place to first place for in-flight service, which reflects investments we've made in food and beverage service, in-flight entertainment, seating, seat power and bins. This award is a fantastic recognition for our employees, and I want to congratulate them and thank them for everything they are doing to make Alaska stand out in the eyes of our customers.
Our model is based on building preference for our airline, and we build this preference with on-time operations, fantastic customer service and, of course, low fares. This model has worked not only in the last couple of years, but in the last 15 to 20 years.
Since the first quarter of 2010, we've launched 100 new markets, and we've outpaced industry revenue growth by a factor of 3. This in the midst of one of the bigger competitive incursions this industry has seen in years. This growth would not have been possible without our mentality of continually reducing costs, which allows us to offer customers low fares while still maintaining industry-leading margins. Brandon is going to share more detail in a moment on what the compounding effect of cost reductions since 2008 has meant to our financial performance. But to give you a sense of how powerful a low-cost structure is, even if we adjust our fuel prices to $2 a gallon, markets representing 97% of our revenue for the last 12 months would still be profitable. And it's important to note that this is done with a full allocation of all costs. 
This model is also delivering returns that are consistently in excess of our cost to capital. In fact, our trailing 12-month ROIC of 25.9% puts us in the top 10% of all S&P 500 companies. Our successful growth shows that providing customers with a high-value experience at low fares is a winning formula, especially in the upper-end leisure and business segments or what we call the bleisure market. And this is a great platform for our future, combining our network, which has strength in the Pacific Northwest and Alaska, with Virgin America's strength in California. We will be a very strong airline with strength up and down the West Coast and, of course, we'll have national reach. For example, in the future we will have 25 flights a day to New York City from 7 West Coast airports and 10 flights a day to Boston from 5 West Coast airports.
We also see the increased choice and competition the merger will provide as fundamentally good for consumers. Speaking of bringing the 2 companies together, I want to share a few thoughts around timing and the integration process. 
First, timing. We have an agreement in place with the Justice Department concerning the timing of their review, and we're forecasting the close will occur in the fourth quarter. When the deal closes, Virgin America will operate as a subsidiary of Alaska Air Group until we achieve a single operating certificate, which we expect in the first quarter of 2018. We are committed to making this a very successful integration.
During the post-close transition period, Ben will be the CEO of Virgin America, in addition to his role as President and COO of Alaska Airlines. And Peter Hunt, who is currently Virgin America's CFO, will be its President and responsible for day-to-day operations. Ben and Peter are proven leaders who will do a great job leading Virgin America during this time. The integration management office is up and running and is being led by Torque Zubeck. While there's a lot of functional work going on behind the scenes, I want to share a brief update with you on the key areas of culture, labor and brand.
Starting with culture. We know that when mergers don't succeed, especially in our industry, often people, or in other words, the culture, is the culprit. This in an area where we're spending a lot of time. Our high-level goal is simply to retain the best of Alaska Airlines and the best of Virgin America and position the new combined company to be aligned, to be bold and to grow successfully well into the future.
Moving to labor. We're meeting with labor leaders and having positive discussions. We appreciate all the work the labor relations team and other -- our labor leaders are doing to make this a smooth integration, and we are optimistic that the process will go well. 
And finally, I know a lot of you are curious about the brand. And as we said before, the Alaska brand is staying. We're also doing in-depth market research to better understand the elements of Virgin America's product and brand that customers love most, especially in California. And we expect to have a final decision on the brand in early 2017.
To summarize, whether we're talking about Alaska as it stands today or the combined company post-merger, we're focused on the same bedrock principles. First, we want to be safe and on time; second, we want to get the culture right, and we want to build alignment with our people; third, we want to protect and grow our customer base; fourth, we want to maintain our low-cost structure and low fares; and finally, we want to consistently generate the level of returns that you expect from high-quality industrial companies.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Andrew."
248501,370612534,1010012,"Alaska Air Group, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 21, 2016",2016-07-21,"Earnings Calls","Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Brad, and good morning, everyone. Total second quarter revenue increased $57 million or 4%. This contrasts with the industry revenue shrinking by about 2%. Over the past 5 years, our revenues are growing 35%, outpacing the industry by 3 to 1. This",770,"Thanks, Brad, and good morning, everyone. Total second quarter revenue increased $57 million or 4%. This contrasts with the industry revenue shrinking by about 2%. Over the past 5 years, our revenues are growing 35%, outpacing the industry by 3 to 1. This growth has come with strong returns that resemble high-quality companies.
Our second quarter PRASM was down 7.7%. We were very pleased, though, that our unit revenue performance was within 150 basis points in the industry, notwithstanding the fact that we grew capacity by 11%, with competitive capacity growing 13%. We're also very pleased to see our load factors at 85%, which was flat for the first time since the first quarter of 2013. That said, close-in pricing has been showing weakness for reasons you are already familiar with.
While we're always mindful of the environment we operate in, the fundamentals of Alaska are sound for several reasons. First, we're offering a high-value product to customers at low fares. Our low fares are enabled by low costs and have allowed us to grow profitably. The 100 new markets Brad referenced earlier, in aggregate, are earning margins at system average levels and represent approximately 20% of our annual revenues. I'm also pleased to announce that we just learned we've received approval for 4 additional flights to Newark. We plan to launch Portland and San Diego and Newark this November and then San Jose and a third Seattle-Newark in March and May, respectively. Secondly, when speaking of offering options to our customers, partnerships are key. 
Earlier in June, we launched new Mileage Plan partnership with Japan Airlines, making it the third international partner we've added in the last 12 months, Hainan and Icelandair being the other 2. That brings our total partners to 17 and allows us to serve over 950 destinations worldwide. A combination of greater reach and targeted promotion has helped increase the number of our members flying on our international partners by 32%. It is an interesting fact, our international partners, along with American Airlines, on a combined basis, account for 34% of all international seats in the U.S. That's more than any one of the global alliances. We expect the benefit of this offering to our customers to take a step change forward with our acquisition of Virgin America. This acquisition will result in us having a strong presence in the largest international West Coast gateways of Los Angeles and San Francisco.
And lastly, membership in our Frequent-Flier Program is up 11%, and our credit card portfolio grew by 12%, both outpacing passenger growth in our network. Our loyalty program generated $200 million in cash for the second quarter, that's an increase of 16%. We expect this growth to continue giving our card offering, which includes 30,000 bonus miles, annual companion ticket, free bags, no international transactions fees and the lowest annual fees of any comparable airline card. In addition, Costco, an iconic Pacific Northwest brand with a strong West Coast presence, moved to exclusive acceptance of Visa Cards at its warehouses last month. It should come as no surprise that our customers also shop at Costco for its great products and prices. We've seen spend on their card increase significantly as a result.
Shifting our focus to the back half of the year. Here are a few things to be mindful of. We expect competitive capacity in our markets to be up 13% in Q3 and 12% in Q4, that's about the same as we face for more than 1.5 years now. As others make post-summer trims to their schedules, competitive capacity has come down by 1 point in the third quarter and by 4 points for the fourth quarter since we last spoke to you in April.
Moving to Alaska's capacity. It will moderate significantly as we move through the rest of the year. Our capacity will be up about 8% in the third quarter and only 3% in the fourth quarter, which is significant reduction from the 12% we grew during the first half of the year. Our full year guidance sits at about 8.5%, which includes the Newark flight I just mentioned as well as Cuba. 
In summary, the fundamentals of our underlying business are strong. We're growing and diversifying revenues, while continuing to build brand loyalty. We've confidence in our business model to continue to grow profitably and earn strong returns for our owners. I'm personally excited about speaking with you next quarter as we expect to have closed on Virgin America, which will begin the next chapter of our journey.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Brandon."
248501,370612534,1010012,"Alaska Air Group, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 21, 2016",2016-07-21,"Earnings Calls","Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Andrew, and good morning, everyone. It's a fabulous sunny morning here in Seattle, and it's great to be speaking with you today.

It's a fabulous sunny morning here in Seattle, and it's great to be speaking with you today. As Brad said, Air Group's adjusted net profit improved by 14% to $263 million, and earnings per share improved by more than 20%. Our pretax margin was a strong 28.4% and grew by 260 basis points and should be among the best in the domestic industry.
Trailing 12 ROIC grew by a nearly 400 basis points to just under 26%. On an adjusted pretax basis, we earned $424 million, an increase of $54 million over the second quarter of last year. 
As Andrew said, revenues grew by 4% or $57 million, a result that we're happy with considering aggregate revenues across the S&P 500 are projected to shrink by 0.6% in the second quarter. Fuel cost declined by $56 million, and nonfuel cost increased by about the same amount. Our unit -- our nonfuel unit cost performance in the quarter was really strong with unit cost declining by 3.7%. We did see a shift in some of the cost into the back half of the year. So our full year guidance remains unchanged at this point.  We continue to believe that our model of high productivity and low overhead is a winning combination to keep nonfuel cost in check. 
Passengers per FTE, our broadest measure of productivity, improved by another 2.7% to 199, a new Q2 record for us. And it's working at the division level, too. I want to give a shout out to our flight ops team. Pilot hard time this quarter was better than both budget and prior year. 
We've been chipping away at our costs slowly each year going back to 2009 and, in fact, even back to 2003. And sometimes it helps to go up to 41,000 feet to look at the progress we've made. Recently, our FP&A team just that and made a really important observation. If our ex fuel unit cost had grown in line with the rest of the industry instead of the gradual decline we've seen each year since 2009, our pretax profit this year would be almost $800 million lower. That translates to about $4 a share or more than $4 billion of market cap at current multiples. So while each individual year of 0.5% or 1% cost reduction doesn't sound like a lot, the cumulative impact is enormous.
Looking forward, we'll see the backside of that cost shift and currently expect ex fuel cost to be up about 3% in Q3 and up about 0.5% in Q4, which keeps our full year unit cost decline to about 0.5%, in line with prior guidance, as I said.
Cash flow from operations for the first half of the year was $900 million, and we ended the June quarter with over $1.6 billion of cash on hand. Adjusted for leases, we have a net cash position of approximately $700 million, and our debt-to-cap sits at 25%. Our balance sheet is in the best shape it's ever been, and it positions us well for our planned merger with Virgin America in the fourth quarter. Our treasury team has now obtained committed financing for the deal. Interest was very strong. We ended up over subscribed, and we were able to partner with a diverse set of leading aviation lenders. I want to thank our lenders for their partnership and support. We're finding that it's an excellent time to raise money. Market rates are at historic lows and spreads for investment-grade secured loans are tight. Alaska's all-in interest rate will be low. I want to compliment our treasury and legal teams for doing such a fabulous job in this process.
Air Group has built a reputation with both lenders and investors as a conservatively managed company with a strong balance sheet, and that's not going to change. After we complete the transaction, we'll still have about 20 unencumbered next-gen Boeing 737s, and we're going to return to redeleveraging the balance sheet.
Speaking of fleet, we've taken delivery of 12 737-900ERs so far this year and have 7 additional 900ERs coming in the back half of the year. As a reminder, many of these deliveries are replacements for older 737-400s.
During the quarter, we also exercised 3 options for E175s for delivery in 2017. This is not new capital. Instead, we've chosen to buy them rather than lease them because we prefer the economics of owning.
We expect total CapEx for the year to be approximately $750 million, consistent with prior guidance. As a result of the 3 E175 auctions I just talked about, our CapEx for 2017 kicks up slightly to just above $1 billion. And again, this is not new capital in our plan. As a reminder, we have 2 big fleet initiatives in process: full retirement of the 737-400s by the end of 2017, which will be good for reliability, passenger comfort and costs; and introduction of 3 -- 33 E175s into the Horizon fleet, which will help us grow into longer, thinner markets, where we believe we have significant opportunity to expand profitably.
So far this year, we've generated $559 million of free cash flow. We paused on the share repurchase program following the announcement of our planned merger, but continue to pay a meaningful dividend, which is currently yielding about 1.7%. I agree with Andrew. Our business is humming along nicely, and we're taking advantage of profitable growth opportunities. The resulting strong cash flow and our fortress balance sheet have positioned us well to complete the planned merger and set us up for long-term success. Everyone around the company is working extra hard as we prepare to combine 2 great airlines, and I want to thank our 15,000 employees for their efforts and congratulate them once again on a record, fabulous quarter.
And with that, we'd like to open it up to questions."

As a reminder, our comments today will include forward-looking statements regarding our future expectations, which may differ significantly from actual results. Information on risk factors that could affect our business can be found in our SEC filings.
We will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures such as adjusted earnings and unit costs, excluding fuel. We have provided a reconciliation between the most directly comparable GAAP and non-GAAP measures in our earnings release.
In addition, today's call may be deemed a solicitation in respect of Alaska Air Group's contemplated acquisition of Virgin America. The information discussed today is qualified in its entirety by Virgin America's definitive proxy statement that was filed with the SEC on June 20, along with other relevant solicitation materials, which are all available on Virgin America's Investor Relations page at ir.virginamerica.com.
And now that I have complied with our GC's request in completeness, we will move to the results. This morning, Alaska Air Group reported a second quarter GAAP net profit of $260 million. Excluding the $6 million impact of mark-to-market adjustments related to our fuel hedge portfolio and a $9 million impact associated with merger-related costs, Air Group recorded a record adjusted net income of $263 million, up 14%. Earnings per share grew by 20% to $2.12 per share.

As we progress through 2016 and look forward to the second half of the year, we know that investors have a lot in their minds, and the equity market certainly reflects that. As you know, we try to stay focused",1250,"Thanks, Lavanya, and good morning, everybody. As we progress through 2016 and look forward to the second half of the year, we know that investors have a lot in their minds, and the equity market certainly reflects that. As you know, we try to stay focused and concentrated our efforts here on building a fundamentally good business. As we look ahead, we feel very good about our underlying business, and all of us here are very excited about the future. The fundamentals of our business are strong. We're running a great airline, and we believe the merger with Virgin America is going to create a very strong airlines, with reach across the entire country and with real strength in originating traffic up and down the West Coast.
I'll start off today by talking about the underlying business and then share an update on the merger. First, we are operating safely and on time. Our ops folks are doing an outstanding job, and I want to thank them. 88.7% of our flights arrived on time in the second quarter, and we did this with much less block time than the average airline, which is a credit to how efficient and consistent we are in the ground. We expect this on-time performance will lead the 6 largest domestic airlines. We also completed 99.8% of our flights in the second quarter, canceling on average only one mainline flight per day.
Second, our employees are taking great care of our customers. We spend a lot of time with our frontline employees building alignment and talking with them about the sort of airline we want to be for our customers. We're seeing substantial evidence that these investments are paying off. Our customer satisfaction scores, which have been on a 7- or 8-year run, continue to improve. In fact, our score for the second quarter was the highest second quarter score ever. And as you know, we also won our ninth consecutive J.D. Power award for customer service during the quarter. We earned the highest score of any airline included in the survey in each of the 7 areas measured, including a move from fourth place to first place for in-flight service, which reflects investments we've made in food and beverage service, in-flight entertainment, seating, seat power and bins. This award is a fantastic recognition for our employees, and I want to congratulate them and thank them for everything they are doing to make Alaska stand out in the eyes of our customers.
Our model is based on building preference for our airline, and we build this preference with on-time operations, fantastic customer service and, of course, low fares. This model has worked not only in the last couple of years, but in the last 15 to 20 years.
Since the first quarter of 2010, we've launched 100 new markets, and we've outpaced industry revenue growth by a factor of 3. This in the midst of one of the bigger competitive incursions this industry has seen in years. This growth would not have been possible without our mentality of continually reducing costs, which allows us to offer customers low fares while still maintaining industry-leading margins. Brandon is going to share more detail in a moment on what the compounding effect of cost reductions since 2008 has meant to our financial performance. But to give you a sense of how powerful a low-cost structure is, even if we adjust our fuel prices to $2 a gallon, markets representing 97% of our revenue for the last 12 months would still be profitable. And it's important to note that this is done with a full allocation of all costs. 
This model is also delivering returns that are consistently in excess of our cost to capital. In fact, our trailing 12-month ROIC of 25.9% puts us in the top 10% of all S&P 500 companies. Our successful growth shows that providing customers with a high-value experience at low fares is a winning formula, especially in the upper-end leisure and business segments or what we call the bleisure market. And this is a great platform for our future, combining our network, which has strength in the Pacific Northwest and Alaska, with Virgin America's strength in California. We will be a very strong airline with strength up and down the West Coast and, of course, we'll have national reach. For example, in the future we will have 25 flights a day to New York City from 7 West Coast airports and 10 flights a day to Boston from 5 West Coast airports.
We also see the increased choice and competition the merger will provide as fundamentally good for consumers. Speaking of bringing the 2 companies together, I want to share a few thoughts around timing and the integration process. 
First, timing. We have an agreement in place with the Justice Department concerning the timing of their review, and we're forecasting the close will occur in the fourth quarter. When the deal closes, Virgin America will operate as a subsidiary of Alaska Air Group until we achieve a single operating certificate, which we expect in the first quarter of 2018. We are committed to making this a very successful integration.
During the post-close transition period, Ben will be the CEO of Virgin America, in addition to his role as President and COO of Alaska Airlines. And Peter Hunt, who is currently Virgin America's CFO, will be its President and responsible for day-to-day operations. Ben and Peter are proven leaders who will do a great job leading Virgin America during this time. The integration management office is up and running and is being led by Torque Zubeck. While there's a lot of functional work going on behind the scenes, I want to share a brief update with you on the key areas of culture, labor and brand.
Starting with culture. We know that when mergers don't succeed, especially in our industry, often people, or in other words, the culture, is the culprit. This in an area where we're spending a lot of time. Our high-level goal is simply to retain the best of Alaska Airlines and the best of Virgin America and position the new combined company to be aligned, to be bold and to grow successfully well into the future.
Moving to labor. We're meeting with labor leaders and having positive discussions. We appreciate all the work the labor relations team and other -- our labor leaders are doing to make this a smooth integration, and we are optimistic that the process will go well. 
And finally, I know a lot of you are curious about the brand. And as we said before, the Alaska brand is staying. We're also doing in-depth market research to better understand the elements of Virgin America's product and brand that customers love most, especially in California. And we expect to have a final decision on the brand in early 2017.
To summarize, whether we're talking about Alaska as it stands today or the combined company post-merger, we're focused on the same bedrock principles. First, we want to be safe and on time; second, we want to get the culture right, and we want to build alignment with our people; third, we want to protect and grow our customer base; fourth, we want to maintain our low-cost structure and low fares; and finally, we want to consistently generate the level of returns that you expect from high-quality industrial companies.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Andrew."
248501,370612534,1010297,"Alaska Air Group, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 21, 2016",2016-07-21,"Earnings Calls","Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Brad, and good morning, everyone. Total second quarter revenue increased $57 million or 4%. This contrasts with the industry revenue shrinking by about 2%. Over the past 5 years, our revenues are growing 35%, outpacing the industry by 3 to 1. This",770,"Thanks, Brad, and good morning, everyone. Total second quarter revenue increased $57 million or 4%. This contrasts with the industry revenue shrinking by about 2%. Over the past 5 years, our revenues are growing 35%, outpacing the industry by 3 to 1. This growth has come with strong returns that resemble high-quality companies.
Our second quarter PRASM was down 7.7%. We were very pleased, though, that our unit revenue performance was within 150 basis points in the industry, notwithstanding the fact that we grew capacity by 11%, with competitive capacity growing 13%. We're also very pleased to see our load factors at 85%, which was flat for the first time since the first quarter of 2013. That said, close-in pricing has been showing weakness for reasons you are already familiar with.
While we're always mindful of the environment we operate in, the fundamentals of Alaska are sound for several reasons. First, we're offering a high-value product to customers at low fares. Our low fares are enabled by low costs and have allowed us to grow profitably. The 100 new markets Brad referenced earlier, in aggregate, are earning margins at system average levels and represent approximately 20% of our annual revenues. I'm also pleased to announce that we just learned we've received approval for 4 additional flights to Newark. We plan to launch Portland and San Diego and Newark this November and then San Jose and a third Seattle-Newark in March and May, respectively. Secondly, when speaking of offering options to our customers, partnerships are key. 
Earlier in June, we launched new Mileage Plan partnership with Japan Airlines, making it the third international partner we've added in the last 12 months, Hainan and Icelandair being the other 2. That brings our total partners to 17 and allows us to serve over 950 destinations worldwide. A combination of greater reach and targeted promotion has helped increase the number of our members flying on our international partners by 32%. It is an interesting fact, our international partners, along with American Airlines, on a combined basis, account for 34% of all international seats in the U.S. That's more than any one of the global alliances. We expect the benefit of this offering to our customers to take a step change forward with our acquisition of Virgin America. This acquisition will result in us having a strong presence in the largest international West Coast gateways of Los Angeles and San Francisco.
And lastly, membership in our Frequent-Flier Program is up 11%, and our credit card portfolio grew by 12%, both outpacing passenger growth in our network. Our loyalty program generated $200 million in cash for the second quarter, that's an increase of 16%. We expect this growth to continue giving our card offering, which includes 30,000 bonus miles, annual companion ticket, free bags, no international transactions fees and the lowest annual fees of any comparable airline card. In addition, Costco, an iconic Pacific Northwest brand with a strong West Coast presence, moved to exclusive acceptance of Visa Cards at its warehouses last month. It should come as no surprise that our customers also shop at Costco for its great products and prices. We've seen spend on their card increase significantly as a result.
Shifting our focus to the back half of the year. Here are a few things to be mindful of. We expect competitive capacity in our markets to be up 13% in Q3 and 12% in Q4, that's about the same as we face for more than 1.5 years now. As others make post-summer trims to their schedules, competitive capacity has come down by 1 point in the third quarter and by 4 points for the fourth quarter since we last spoke to you in April.
Moving to Alaska's capacity. It will moderate significantly as we move through the rest of the year. Our capacity will be up about 8% in the third quarter and only 3% in the fourth quarter, which is significant reduction from the 12% we grew during the first half of the year. Our full year guidance sits at about 8.5%, which includes the Newark flight I just mentioned as well as Cuba. 
In summary, the fundamentals of our underlying business are strong. We're growing and diversifying revenues, while continuing to build brand loyalty. We've confidence in our business model to continue to grow profitably and earn strong returns for our owners. I'm personally excited about speaking with you next quarter as we expect to have closed on Virgin America, which will begin the next chapter of our journey.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Brandon."
248501,370612534,1010297,"Alaska Air Group, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 21, 2016",2016-07-21,"Earnings Calls","Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Andrew, and good morning, everyone. It's a fabulous sunny morning here in Seattle, and it's great to be speaking with you today.

It's a fabulous sunny morning here in Seattle, and it's great to be speaking with you today. As Brad said, Air Group's adjusted net profit improved by 14% to $263 million, and earnings per share improved by more than 20%. Our pretax margin was a strong 28.4% and grew by 260 basis points and should be among the best in the domestic industry.
Trailing 12 ROIC grew by a nearly 400 basis points to just under 26%. On an adjusted pretax basis, we earned $424 million, an increase of $54 million over the second quarter of last year. 
As Andrew said, revenues grew by 4% or $57 million, a result that we're happy with considering aggregate revenues across the S&P 500 are projected to shrink by 0.6% in the second quarter. Fuel cost declined by $56 million, and nonfuel cost increased by about the same amount. Our unit -- our nonfuel unit cost performance in the quarter was really strong with unit cost declining by 3.7%. We did see a shift in some of the cost into the back half of the year. So our full year guidance remains unchanged at this point.  We continue to believe that our model of high productivity and low overhead is a winning combination to keep nonfuel cost in check. 
Passengers per FTE, our broadest measure of productivity, improved by another 2.7% to 199, a new Q2 record for us. And it's working at the division level, too. I want to give a shout out to our flight ops team. Pilot hard time this quarter was better than both budget and prior year. 
We've been chipping away at our costs slowly each year going back to 2009 and, in fact, even back to 2003. And sometimes it helps to go up to 41,000 feet to look at the progress we've made. Recently, our FP&A team just that and made a really important observation. If our ex fuel unit cost had grown in line with the rest of the industry instead of the gradual decline we've seen each year since 2009, our pretax profit this year would be almost $800 million lower. That translates to about $4 a share or more than $4 billion of market cap at current multiples. So while each individual year of 0.5% or 1% cost reduction doesn't sound like a lot, the cumulative impact is enormous.
Looking forward, we'll see the backside of that cost shift and currently expect ex fuel cost to be up about 3% in Q3 and up about 0.5% in Q4, which keeps our full year unit cost decline to about 0.5%, in line with prior guidance, as I said.
Cash flow from operations for the first half of the year was $900 million, and we ended the June quarter with over $1.6 billion of cash on hand. Adjusted for leases, we have a net cash position of approximately $700 million, and our debt-to-cap sits at 25%. Our balance sheet is in the best shape it's ever been, and it positions us well for our planned merger with Virgin America in the fourth quarter. Our treasury team has now obtained committed financing for the deal. Interest was very strong. We ended up over subscribed, and we were able to partner with a diverse set of leading aviation lenders. I want to thank our lenders for their partnership and support. We're finding that it's an excellent time to raise money. Market rates are at historic lows and spreads for investment-grade secured loans are tight. Alaska's all-in interest rate will be low. I want to compliment our treasury and legal teams for doing such a fabulous job in this process.
Air Group has built a reputation with both lenders and investors as a conservatively managed company with a strong balance sheet, and that's not going to change. After we complete the transaction, we'll still have about 20 unencumbered next-gen Boeing 737s, and we're going to return to redeleveraging the balance sheet.
Speaking of fleet, we've taken delivery of 12 737-900ERs so far this year and have 7 additional 900ERs coming in the back half of the year. As a reminder, many of these deliveries are replacements for older 737-400s.
During the quarter, we also exercised 3 options for E175s for delivery in 2017. This is not new capital. Instead, we've chosen to buy them rather than lease them because we prefer the economics of owning.
We expect total CapEx for the year to be approximately $750 million, consistent with prior guidance. As a result of the 3 E175 auctions I just talked about, our CapEx for 2017 kicks up slightly to just above $1 billion. And again, this is not new capital in our plan. As a reminder, we have 2 big fleet initiatives in process: full retirement of the 737-400s by the end of 2017, which will be good for reliability, passenger comfort and costs; and introduction of 3 -- 33 E175s into the Horizon fleet, which will help us grow into longer, thinner markets, where we believe we have significant opportunity to expand profitably.
So far this year, we've generated $559 million of free cash flow. We paused on the share repurchase program following the announcement of our planned merger, but continue to pay a meaningful dividend, which is currently yielding about 1.7%. I agree with Andrew. Our business is humming along nicely, and we're taking advantage of profitable growth opportunities. The resulting strong cash flow and our fortress balance sheet have positioned us well to complete the planned merger and set us up for long-term success. Everyone around the company is working extra hard as we prepare to combine 2 great airlines, and I want to thank our 15,000 employees for their efforts and congratulate them once again on a record, fabulous quarter.
And with that, we'd like to open it up to questions."

As Lavanya just shared, our third quarter net income was $272 million, a bit below last year, but our earnings per share of $2.20 were 2% higher than last year and our highest quarterly earnings per share ever.
2016 is shaping up to be a year of record profitability. Pretax income for the first 9 months of the year was over $1 billion and $90 million higher than last year. And on a trailing 12-month basis, our pretax margin now stands at just under 25%. This is an extraordinary level of performance, not only in relation to our industry, but also in relation to other high-quality industrial companies.
Some have asked what Alaska's margin should be over the longer term. This is a good question and one that we can all speculate about. What we can say definitively is that our goal is to be a leader in this industry, and that means we need to be safe, be on time, provide great service and very importantly, have both low fares and low costs. If we do these things well, we'll be in a position to lead the industry in terms of financial performance, regardless of what part of the cycle we're in.
Before we get into the details of the quarter, I'd like to touch briefly on Virgin America. Many of you have asked questions about the timing of the merger and about our ongoing discussions with the Justice Department. As to timing, we were hoping to get this done a couple of weeks ago, and we're obviously not there quite yet. The scope of issues that remain with the Justice Department is manageable, but they're important matters, and we want to take the time that's necessary to work through them. It's hard to predict the exact timing from when we'll wrap up since there are 2 parties involved. There's a process at play, and we're working through that process and we're respectful of that process. Our hope is that we'll have antitrust clearance soon.
All that said, we continue to be very confident that the deal will get done and get done in a way that benefits all of our stakeholders, most importantly, our customers. This is a pro-consumer merger of 2 smaller airlines that will bring new low-fare competition, industry-leading service and innovative product offerings for the customers we serve.
And unfortunately, what I've just shared is the extent of the comments that we're going to be able to make this morning about the review process.
As we prepare for the merger, there are 2 things our leadership team has really focused on. First, bringing together these 2 teams so everyone is aligned, motivated and working on the same things, or pulling together in other words. And doing this well lays the groundwork for number two, which is achieving the synergies of the deal, which based on everything we've seen to date, we feel confident about doing.
Ben Minicucci and his team have been working hard on the integration planning, and Ben and others will be happy to share details of the planning work during the Q&A. 
And as a reminder, this commendation ultimately positions us as the fifth largest airline in the country, an airline with a national footprint and an unmatched ability to serve West Coast travelers.
And with that, I'd like to turn the focus of this call back to our stand-alone business and our Q3 performance. It's football season, and we're all cheering on the Seahawks and our other CFO, Russell Wilson. One of the things the Seahawks do well is stick to their game plan, and I'm really proud of our folks for sticking to our game plan during our busiest summer yet.
A big part of Alaska's success is built on being safe, on being on time and on taking great care of our customers. Our team flat-delivered during the third quarter. 
Let me start with safety. You've heard us say that safety is our #1 priority. And last quarter, we were the first airline to have our new Safety Management System, or SMS, accepted by the FAA. This system was the FAA's, mandating for all airlines as the new way of monitoring, managing and mitigating safety risks, and it's a project that we've been working on for almost 5 years. I'm really proud of the teams at Alaska and Horizon for being the first airlines to have this in place. And again, leading the industry on this underscores our commitment to operating safely and to doing things right.
Second, we continue to run a solid operation, and in fact, this was one of our best quarters operationally ever. 89.1% of Alaska's flights arrived on time during the quarter, and we completed 99.8% of our flights. On a year-to-date basis, our on-time rate is 88.5%, and we expect it will be the best among the 6 largest carriers for the seventh year in a row.
Over at Horizon. David and his team have been focused on improving their operation, and their efforts are paying off as our third quarter performance went from 79.9% last year to 85.3% this year. This is especially important as we continue to grow the regional side of the business, including the addition of new Embraer jets.
And third, our people are taking care of customers. Our internal customer satisfaction score for the third quarter was 87.3%, our highest score since we started tracking this back in 2007. This is a fantastic achievement, and I want to thank our employees for taking great care of our customers over the summer.
It's no surprise that how you treat people matters. We're seeing the results as active members in our Mileage Plan have increased by 35% in the last 2 years and this in the face of intense competition in some of our markets.
Being safe, being on time and offering great service and low fares are the key ingredients of our game plan not only for customers, but also for our owners. Looking at the most recent quarter, we expect our trailing 12-month ROIC of 24% and our third quarter pretax margin of 27% will be among the very best in the industry. These are strong results, and you'll hear more from Andrew and Brandon next on the underlying actions that drove these outcomes.
As I look to the future, I'm very confident about our core business and even more excited about the future when the Virgin America merger is complete. A lot of people will say this, but I really feel it's true with Alaska. We have a fantastic group of people here who are working together, and I want to thank them for everything they're doing to make us the best airline that we can possibly be for our customers.
Now I'll turn the call over to Andrew."
248501,404678309,1057799,"Alaska Air Group, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 20, 2016",2016-10-20,"Earnings Calls","Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Brad, and good morning, everyone. Our third quarter revenue performance was solid, with growth of 3.4% or $51.2 million. This contrasts with the industry revenue contraction of approximately 2%. We were able to sustain high load factors while incr",941,"Thanks, Brad, and good morning, everyone. Our third quarter revenue performance was solid, with growth of 3.4% or $51.2 million. This contrasts with the industry revenue contraction of approximately 2%. We were able to sustain high load factors while increasing capacity at a rate more than 2x that of the industry. Our present change improved about 200 basis points from the prior quarter and outperformed the industry by approximately 40 basis points despite competitive capacity growing double digits in our markets once again.
Looking at monthly trends. RASM was down by an average of 6.5% in both July and August, yet it was up 0.5% in September. Lower September growth and strong bookings within the month, along with an improved closing yield trajectory, contributed to the strong performance during the period -- during this shoulder period. Our September load factor of 84.1% was up 2.5 points year-over-year. And while fares remain low, they appear to be stable, and we're not seeing anything to suggest that this will not continue into the fourth quarter.
Our underlying business remains sound, and we expect to continue our current momentum for several reasons. First, our revenue streams continue to grow and diversify due to our growth. We started our transcon service 15 years ago in September of 2001, with 1 flight from Seattle to DCA. Today, we serve 15 cities in this region, with 33 flights a day. And transcon service now accounts for approximately 15% of our revenues and a similar amount of our profits. We're continuing this growth with new flights to Newark from Portland, San Diego, San Jose and a third daily departure from Seattle. And here's a little fun fact. If you combined our net worth with Virgin America, we'd have up to 31 flights a day to the New York City area alone.
Second, we added Embraer 175 into our fleet a year ago, and this has been a fantastic aircraft for reaching markets in the Mid-Continent, which were too fast for Q400 and too thin for the 737. We have rapidly grown the number of markets served by the Embraer to 29. These aircraft are delivering the results we hoped for as they are creating new and profitable revenue streams supporting our mainline growth and providing greater nonstop convenience for our customers.
Even though many of our Embraer 175 markets are still maturing, in aggregate, they are profitable and already earning their cost of capital. We take delivery of 18 175s next year.
Third, this growth is buttressed by the loyalty we enjoy from our members. We believe we have the most generous and far-reaching loyalty program in the industry. Members in our credit card portfolio grew 11.5% for the quarter, with retail spend on the portfolio outpacing this membership growth. And additionally, our Frequent-Flier members grew 10%.
And fourth, our growth is enabled by offering low fares. In some recent analysis we conducted, we found Alaska's one-way fares were more than $40 or 23% lower than each of the 3 network carriers on a systemwide stage length adjusted basis. Our low fares are enabled by our low costs. We remain focused on bringing these low fares to our customers and maintaining the cost advantage that enables these fares.
I want to move to the fourth quarter now. Our Q4 growth will slow substantially to just over 3%. This brings our full year capacity growth to about 8.5%, in line with our previous guidance. However, our competitive capacity is expected to stay elevated for the remainder of the year at about 10%.
While we expect to close in bookings strengths we have seen in September to carry through to the fourth quarter, December is expected to be softer than October and November on a relative basis as both Christmas and New Year's fall on a weekend this year, compressing the holiday travel season. We estimate this will lower PRASM for the quarter by about 0.5 point.
I also want to update you on the progress we are making on our premium cost product. We expect to complete the conversion of all 61 737-800s by year-end. We'll start selling tickets for premium class in early November for travel starting January 5, 2017. As a reminder, we expect this to add approximately $50 million in revenue next year and achieve $85 million on new run rate by the end of 2018.
With that, I'd like to touch on 2017. On a stand-alone basis, that is excluding any impact from the acquisition of Virgin America, we expect our growth to slow by about 150 basis points versus this year to slightly more than 7%. This growth comprises approximately 2 points from longer stage length and a point from the annualization of markets we already launched in 2016.
As we look at published schedules, we expect Q1 2017 competitive capacity to come down slightly to 9% in our markets, still elevated but a nice change from the double-digit increases we have been seeing for quite a while.
As we enter the last quarter of the year and look to 2017, we remain confident in our business. We are operating well, fundamentals in the economies we serve are strong, our loyal customer base continues to grow, and we continue to add new and profitable revenue streams to our portfolio.
Like everyone else at Alaska, the rest of my commercial team and I are excited about the opportunity that Virgin America presents for our business, which will allow us to accelerate our growth while bringing low fares to more customers and strong returns for our shareholders.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Brandon."
248501,404678309,1057799,"Alaska Air Group, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 20, 2016",2016-10-20,"Earnings Calls","Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Andrew, and good morning, everybody. We're pleased to report another very strong quarter financially, punctuated by the 2% increase in earnings per share. Even though net profit declined very slightly, we're benefiting from the significant share r",912,"Thanks, Andrew, and good morning, everybody. We're pleased to report another very strong quarter financially, punctuated by the 2% increase in earnings per share. Even though net profit declined very slightly, we're benefiting from the significant share repurchases that we've made since the end of the third quarter of last year.
As Andrew said, revenues grew by more than 3%. And although our nonfuel costs grew by nearly 10%, we were nonetheless pleased with our cost performance. Our nonfuel unit costs were up 1.6%, but that was lower than we initially expected for the quarter. We remain on track to have a full year unit cost reduction of about 0.5%, which would make the seventh -- this the seventh straight year of unit cost reduction.
Andrew offered some early guidance on next year's growth, but we aren't yet able to share initial 2017 unit cost guidance. Our leaders are busy compiling budgets right now. Folks across both Alaska and Horizon recognize that low costs create an important competitive advantage for higher-cost legacy carriers and are required for us to grow. We're planning to provide 2017 cost guidance on our fourth quarter call.
And speaking of guidance, I want to remind everyone that we're taking a little different approach this year by having our Investor Day in March. We're looking forward to sharing much more with you about our post-merger plan at that time.
Our earnings benefited less of a -- from less of a tailwind of lower fuel prices than in Q1 or Q2. Economic fuel costs declined by $18 million this quarter, where the year-over-year declines in Q1 and Q2 were more than 3x that amount.
With oil prices now over $50 a barrel, it's worth mentioning the improving efficiency of our fleet that will help offset rising fuel costs. ASMs per gallon improved by another 2% this quarter because of the ongoing retirement of the 737-400s and the addition of fuel-efficient 900ERs.
In fact, we've taken delivery of 21 737-900ERs since the end of the third quarter of last year. And our mainline efficiency should just should continue to get better as we finish retiring the 400s and add another 13 900ERs by the end of 2017.
As we've told you before, these new aircraft are 37 seats larger, they're more comfortable, they're more reliable and sip fuel like a Prius with wings. A 900ER brings less than 910 gallons per flight compared to 940 gallons per flight hour burned by the smaller 737-400.
Turning to the balance sheet. You might have noticed that we ended the quarter with more than $3.2 billion of cash. That total includes more than $1.5 billion that we had raised at quarter end to fund the Virgin America acquisition. At this point, we're fully prepared to close the deal once we have DOJ approval. Our treasury and legal teams did an incredible job putting all this together, and I wanted to extend a huge thanks to both of them.
We're using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt, and our weighted average interest rate on this new money currently stands at 2.37%, even after the financing. We still have more than 40 unencumbered Boeing 737 aircraft, including 20 next-generation 800s and 900ERs. The borrowing rate and the fact that we have so much remaining collateral are both a testament to the great balance sheet that we've built and incredible amount of cash flow we've been able to generate over the last 5 years.
Cash flow from operations for the first 9 months of the year was $1.2 billion, about flat compared to the first 9 months of last year. Year-to-date CapEx is just over $500 million, resulting in about $700 million of free cash flow. We expect full year CapEx to now be $680 million, down slightly from prior guidance.
There are 2 drivers. First, we elected to defer our first step -- our first 737 MAX aircraft from the fall of 2017 to early '18. The MAX will be a great airplane for Alaska, with an extra range and lower fuel burn, but with so much going on, we wanted a bit more time to bring it into service. We want to thank Boeing for accommodating our request. And second, we've lowered our estimate of non-aircraft spending as certain projects have shifted to the right. Looking forward, and as we told you last quarter, we're planning for 2017 CapEx to be about $1.1 billion, which, of course, is current Air Group hold.
Andrew and I have thrown out a lot of information on fleet changes, so I thought I'd might recap. On the mainline side, in 2016, we're adding a total of 19 new aircraft and retiring 10. And in 2017, we're adding 12 new aircraft and retiring 16, which is the rest of the 737-400 fleet.
On the regional side, we'll take delivery of our first 13 E175 jets into the Horizon fleet. And by the way, I want to recognize the Horizon team that's working on entry into service. And we'll add another 5 through our capacity and purchase arrangement with SkyWest.
We're very pleased with the strong results, both operational and financial, and our people should celebrate the great summer we had. We're mindful that there's a lot going on, a lot of hard work lies ahead, and we need to keep executing on the things that continue to make us successful.
And with that, let's go to questions."

I think if this is the place where we're all expecting higher [ph], you guys probably have a better view of what's going to happen with long-term margins in our industry than we do. But we do look at other industries. We look at higher -- other high-quality industrials. We look at sort of gaps that people are earning over their cost of capital. And so I think the industry, you would hope that as we settle down and have capacity controll and have consolidation that we settle into a place where we're earning as an industry margins that are several hundred points above our cost of capital. And then what we're saying is Alaska should be above that. That's sort of how we see ourselves. That's what we want to do. How you do that math, I don't think I want to be the one -- I think I told you what we know and we've won -- We've always done is try to talk about what we know and not talk about what we don't know. So I think that's where I might leave it. Is the Virgin just be really candidate, you add the 2 together. We're not issuing 1 new share for this acquisition. So any profit that they bring into the company is accretive to our profit. But I think you have seen the math versus historical margins are lower than Alaska. So I would expect that our company-wide margins will dilute a little bit. And Brandon, I can't remember the exact numbers, but it's not huge.

I'll keep it high level I think, and I'll just speak for Alaska Air Group. A couple of key things here that codeshares provide us. Firstly, domestically, we can connect into our partners' hubs in the middle of the country and then connect our customers to anywhere in the rest of the country. So firstly, these codeshare agreements domestically give us a lot of ability to be able to get our passengers everywhere they need to go at the times they need to go and give them plenty of choice of fares when they need to go. I think the other key component of that is also obviously the loyalty side so our customers can still accrue [indiscernible] that miles when they fly when our partners medal or on their own medal. And of course, redemptions. Our customers want to redeem -- 85% of our customers redeem on us still. And the last piece is really international. And the international is really, really important. For our international partners, we provide huge value to help them fill our airplanes. I mean, the statistics are quite significant in our hubs, especially on how many passengers we put on our foreign flag friend. But for Alaska customers, it allows them to both redeem globally 800-plus destinations globally as well as earn and redeem miles. So overall, I would say that these codeshare relationships provide great utility. But at the end of the day, Alaska Air Group is built on its fundamental product and the majority of customers, majority of loyalty, the majority of revenue is all based on Alaska Air Group's medal and what we do."

This morning, Alaska Air Group reported a third quarter GAAP net profit of $256 million, excluding $14 million in merger-related costs and a $2 million impact of mark-to-market adjustments related to our fuel hedge portfolio. Air Group reported an adjusted net income of $272 million. And earnings per share grew by 2% to $2.20 per share. That compares to First Call lien estimate of $2.09 per share.

As Lavanya just shared, our third quarter net income was $272 million, a bit below last year, but our earnings per share of $2.20 were 2% higher than last year and our highest quarterly earnings per share ever.
2016 is shaping up to be a year of record profitability. Pretax income for the first 9 months of the year was over $1 billion and $90 million higher than last year. And on a trailing 12-month basis, our pretax margin now stands at just under 25%. This is an extraordinary level of performance, not only in relation to our industry, but also in relation to other high-quality industrial companies.
Some have asked what Alaska's margin should be over the longer term. This is a good question and one that we can all speculate about. What we can say definitively is that our goal is to be a leader in this industry, and that means we need to be safe, be on time, provide great service and very importantly, have both low fares and low costs. If we do these things well, we'll be in a position to lead the industry in terms of financial performance, regardless of what part of the cycle we're in.
Before we get into the details of the quarter, I'd like to touch briefly on Virgin America. Many of you have asked questions about the timing of the merger and about our ongoing discussions with the Justice Department. As to timing, we were hoping to get this done a couple of weeks ago, and we're obviously not there quite yet. The scope of issues that remain with the Justice Department is manageable, but they're important matters, and we want to take the time that's necessary to work through them. It's hard to predict the exact timing from when we'll wrap up since there are 2 parties involved. There's a process at play, and we're working through that process and we're respectful of that process. Our hope is that we'll have antitrust clearance soon.
All that said, we continue to be very confident that the deal will get done and get done in a way that benefits all of our stakeholders, most importantly, our customers. This is a pro-consumer merger of 2 smaller airlines that will bring new low-fare competition, industry-leading service and innovative product offerings for the customers we serve.
And unfortunately, what I've just shared is the extent of the comments that we're going to be able to make this morning about the review process.
As we prepare for the merger, there are 2 things our leadership team has really focused on. First, bringing together these 2 teams so everyone is aligned, motivated and working on the same things, or pulling together in other words. And doing this well lays the groundwork for number two, which is achieving the synergies of the deal, which based on everything we've seen to date, we feel confident about doing.
Ben Minicucci and his team have been working hard on the integration planning, and Ben and others will be happy to share details of the planning work during the Q&A. 
And as a reminder, this commendation ultimately positions us as the fifth largest airline in the country, an airline with a national footprint and an unmatched ability to serve West Coast travelers.
And with that, I'd like to turn the focus of this call back to our stand-alone business and our Q3 performance. It's football season, and we're all cheering on the Seahawks and our other CFO, Russell Wilson. One of the things the Seahawks do well is stick to their game plan, and I'm really proud of our folks for sticking to our game plan during our busiest summer yet.
A big part of Alaska's success is built on being safe, on being on time and on taking great care of our customers. Our team flat-delivered during the third quarter. 
Let me start with safety. You've heard us say that safety is our #1 priority. And last quarter, we were the first airline to have our new Safety Management System, or SMS, accepted by the FAA. This system was the FAA's, mandating for all airlines as the new way of monitoring, managing and mitigating safety risks, and it's a project that we've been working on for almost 5 years. I'm really proud of the teams at Alaska and Horizon for being the first airlines to have this in place. And again, leading the industry on this underscores our commitment to operating safely and to doing things right.
Second, we continue to run a solid operation, and in fact, this was one of our best quarters operationally ever. 89.1% of Alaska's flights arrived on time during the quarter, and we completed 99.8% of our flights. On a year-to-date basis, our on-time rate is 88.5%, and we expect it will be the best among the 6 largest carriers for the seventh year in a row.
Over at Horizon. David and his team have been focused on improving their operation, and their efforts are paying off as our third quarter performance went from 79.9% last year to 85.3% this year. This is especially important as we continue to grow the regional side of the business, including the addition of new Embraer jets.
And third, our people are taking care of customers. Our internal customer satisfaction score for the third quarter was 87.3%, our highest score since we started tracking this back in 2007. This is a fantastic achievement, and I want to thank our employees for taking great care of our customers over the summer.
It's no surprise that how you treat people matters. We're seeing the results as active members in our Mileage Plan have increased by 35% in the last 2 years and this in the face of intense competition in some of our markets.
Being safe, being on time and offering great service and low fares are the key ingredients of our game plan not only for customers, but also for our owners. Looking at the most recent quarter, we expect our trailing 12-month ROIC of 24% and our third quarter pretax margin of 27% will be among the very best in the industry. These are strong results, and you'll hear more from Andrew and Brandon next on the underlying actions that drove these outcomes.
As I look to the future, I'm very confident about our core business and even more excited about the future when the Virgin America merger is complete. A lot of people will say this, but I really feel it's true with Alaska. We have a fantastic group of people here who are working together, and I want to thank them for everything they're doing to make us the best airline that we can possibly be for our customers.
Now I'll turn the call over to Andrew."
248501,404678309,1057953,"Alaska Air Group, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 20, 2016",2016-10-20,"Earnings Calls","Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Brad, and good morning, everyone. Our third quarter revenue performance was solid, with growth of 3.4% or $51.2 million. This contrasts with the industry revenue contraction of approximately 2%. We were able to sustain high load factors while incr",940,"Thanks, Brad, and good morning, everyone. Our third quarter revenue performance was solid, with growth of 3.4% or $51.2 million. This contrasts with the industry revenue contraction of approximately 2%. We were able to sustain high load factors while increasing capacity at a rate more than 2x that of the industry. Our present change improved about 200 basis points from the prior quarter and outperformed the industry by approximately 40 basis points despite competitive capacity growing double digits in our markets once again.
Looking at monthly trends. RASM was down by an average of 6.5% in both July and August, yet it was up 0.5% in September. Lower September growth and strong bookings within the month, along with an improved closing yield trajectory, contributed to the strong performance during the period -- during this shoulder period. Our September load factor of 84.1% was up 2.5 points year-over-year. And while fares remain low, they appear to be stable, and we're not seeing anything to suggest that this will not continue into the fourth quarter.
Our underlying business remains sound, and we expect to continue our current momentum for several reasons. First, our revenue streams continue to grow and diversify due to our growth. We started our transcon service 15 years ago in September of 2001, with 1 flight from Seattle to DCA. Today, we serve 15 cities in this region, with 33 flights a day. And transcon service now accounts for approximately 15% of our revenues and a similar amount of our profits. We're continuing this growth with new flights to Newark from Portland, San Diego, San Jose and a third daily departure from Seattle. And here's a little fun fact. If you combined our net worth with Virgin America, we'd have up to 31 flights a day to the New York City area alone.
Second, we added Embraer 175 into our fleet a year ago, and this has been a fantastic aircraft for reaching markets in the Mid-Continent, which were too fast for Q400 and too thin for the 737. We have rapidly grown the number of markets served by the Embraer to 29. These aircraft are delivering the results we hoped for as they are creating new and profitable revenue streams supporting our mainline growth and providing greater nonstop convenience for our customers.
Even though many of our Embraer 175 markets are still maturing, in aggregate, they are profitable and already earning their cost of capital. We take delivery of 18 175s next year.
Third, this growth is buttressed by the loyalty we enjoy from our members. We believe we have the most generous and far-reaching loyalty program in the industry. Members in our credit card portfolio grew 11.5% for the quarter, with retail spend on the portfolio outpacing this membership growth. And additionally, our Frequent-Flier members grew 10%.
And fourth, our growth is enabled by offering low fares. In some recent analysis we conducted, we found Alaska's one-way fares were more than $40 or 23% lower than each of the 3 network carriers on a systemwide stage length adjusted basis. Our low fares are enabled by our low costs. We remain focused on bringing these low fares to our customers and maintaining the cost advantage that enables these fares.
I want to move to the fourth quarter now. Our Q4 growth will slow substantially to just over 3%. This brings our full year capacity growth to about 8.5%, in line with our previous guidance. However, our competitive capacity is expected to stay elevated for the remainder of the year at about 10%.
While we expect to close-in bookings strengths we have seen in September to carry through to the fourth quarter, December is expected to be softer than October and November on a relative basis as both Christmas and New Year's fall on a weekend this year, compressing the holiday travel season. We estimate this will lower PRASM for the quarter by about 0.5 point.
I also want to update you on the progress we are making on our premium cost product. We expect to complete the conversion of all 61 737-800s by year-end. We'll start selling tickets for premium class in early November for travel starting January 5, 2017. As a reminder, we expect this to add approximately $50 million in revenue next year and achieve $85 million on new run rate by the end of 2018.
With that, I'd like to touch on 2017. On a stand-alone basis, that is excluding any impact from the acquisition of Virgin America, we expect our growth to slow by about 150 basis points versus this year to slightly more than 7%. This growth comprises approximately 2 points from longer stage length and a point from the annualization of markets we already launched in 2016.
As we look at published schedules, we expect Q1 2017 competitive capacity to come down slightly to 9% in our markets, still elevated but a nice change from the double-digit increases we have been seeing for quite a while.
As we enter the last quarter of the year and look to 2017, we remain confident in our business. We are operating well, fundamentals in the economies we serve are strong, our loyal customer base continues to grow, and we continue to add new and profitable revenue streams to our portfolio.
Like everyone else at Alaska, the rest of my commercial team and I are excited about the opportunity that Virgin America presents for our business, which will allow us to accelerate our growth while bringing low fares to more customers and strong returns for our shareholders.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Brandon."

We're pleased to report another very strong quarter financially, punctuated by the 2% increase in earnings per share. Even though net profit declined very slightly, we're benefiting from the significant share repurchases that we've made since the end of the third quarter of last year.
As Andrew said, revenues grew by more than 3%. And although our nonfuel costs grew by nearly 10%, we were nonetheless pleased with our cost performance. Our nonfuel unit costs were up 1.6%, but that was lower than we initially expected for the quarter. We remain on track to have a full year unit cost reduction of about 0.5%, which would make the seventh -- this the seventh straight year of unit cost reduction.
Andrew offered some early guidance on next year's growth, but we aren't yet able to share initial 2017 unit cost guidance. Our leaders are busy compiling budgets right now. Folks across both Alaska and Horizon recognize that low costs create an important competitive advantage for higher-cost legacy carriers and are required for us to grow. We're planning to provide 2017 cost guidance on our fourth quarter call.
And speaking of guidance, I want to remind everyone that we're taking a little different approach this year by having our Investor Day in March. We're looking forward to sharing much more with you about our post-merger plan at that time.
Our earnings benefited less of a -- from less of a tailwind of lower fuel prices than in Q1 or Q2. Economic fuel costs declined by $18 million this quarter, where the year-over-year declines in Q1 and Q2 were more than 3x that amount.
With oil prices now over $50 a barrel, it's worth mentioning the improving efficiency of our fleet that will help offset rising fuel costs. ASMs per gallon improved by another 2% this quarter because of the ongoing retirement of the 737-400s and the addition of fuel-efficient 900ERs.
In fact, we've taken delivery of 21 737-900ERs since the end of the third quarter of last year. And our mainline efficiency should just should continue to get better as we finish retiring the 400s and add another 13 900ERs by the end of 2017.
As we've told you before, these new aircraft are 37 seats larger, they're more comfortable, they're more reliable and sip fuel like a Prius with wings. A 900ER brings less than 910 gallons per flight compared to 940 gallons per flight hour burned by the smaller 737-400.
Turning to the balance sheet. You might have noticed that we ended the quarter with more than $3.2 billion of cash. That total includes more than $1.5 billion that we had raised at quarter end to fund the Virgin America acquisition. At this point, we're fully prepared to close the deal once we have DOJ approval. Our treasury and legal teams did an incredible job putting all this together, and I wanted to extend a huge thanks to both of them.
We're using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt, and our weighted average interest rate on this new money currently stands at 2.37%, even after the financing. We still have more than 40 unencumbered Boeing 737 aircraft, including 20 next-generation 800s and 900ERs. The borrowing rate and the fact that we have so much remaining collateral are both a testament to the great balance sheet that we've built and incredible amount of cash flow we've been able to generate over the last 5 years.
Cash flow from operations for the first 9 months of the year was $1.2 billion, about flat compared to the first 9 months of last year. Year-to-date CapEx is just over $500 million, resulting in about $700 million of free cash flow. We expect full year CapEx to now be $680 million, down slightly from prior guidance.
There are 2 drivers. First, we elected to defer our first step -- our first 737 MAX aircraft from the fall of 2017 to early '18. The MAX will be a great airplane for Alaska, with an extra range and lower fuel burn, but with so much going on, we wanted a bit more time to bring it into service. We want to thank Boeing for accommodating our request. And second, we've lowered our estimate of non-aircraft spending as certain projects have shifted to the right. Looking forward, and as we told you last quarter, we're planning for 2017 CapEx to be about $1.1 billion, which, of course, is current Air Group hold.
Andrew and I have thrown out a lot of information on fleet changes, so I thought I'd might recap. On the mainline side, in 2016, we're adding a total of 19 new aircraft and retiring 10. And in 2017, we're adding 12 new aircraft and retiring 16, which is the rest of the 737-400 fleet.
On the regional side, we'll take delivery of our first 13 E175 jets into the Horizon fleet. And by the way, I want to recognize the Horizon team that's working on entry into service. And we'll add another 5 through our capacity and purchase arrangement with SkyWest.
We're very pleased with the strong results, both operational and financial, and our people should celebrate the great summer we had. We're mindful that there's a lot going on, a lot of hard work lies ahead, and we need to keep executing on the things that continue to make us successful.
And with that, let's go to questions."

I think if this is the place where we're all speculating higher, you guys probably have a better view of what's going to happen with long-term margins in our industry than we do. But we do look at other industries. We look at other high-quality industrials. We look at sort of gaps that people are earning over their cost of capital. And so I think the industry, you would hope that as we settle down and have capacity control and have consolidation, that we settle into a place where we're earning, as an industry, margins that are several hundred points above our cost of capital. And then what we're saying is Alaska should be above that. That's sort of how we see ourselves. That's what we want to do. How you do that math, I don't think I want to be the one -- I'll just -- I think I've told you what we know and we've -- what we've always done is tried to talk about what we know and not talk about what we don't know. So I think that's where I might leave it. As to Virgin, just to be really candid, you add the 2 together. We're not issuing one new share for this acquisition. So any profit that they bring into the company is accretive to our profit. But I think you have seen the math. Virgin's historical margins are lower than Alaska. So I would expect that our company-wide margins will dilute a little bit. And Brandon, I can't remember the exact numbers, but it's not huge.

That's obviously dependent on the economic environment. But if we do it right, that's where we'll be. And then I think we'll stay there for a while. I think we like leverage in the mid -- low to mid-40% range. I don't see us going back down to 28% like we were pre-deal. But I think we can get there quick. And at that level, we'll have a balance sheet that looks a lot like another high -- or other high-quality industrials, and it will look very favorable compared to other carriers in the industry."

And I'm just curious, I mean, I know that under the new rules, Horizon doesn't meet the new threshold. But it looks like it's actually very close to the threshold, so maybe it's a 2017, 2018 type event.

So Horizon, I'm looking forward to Horizon to get in the 175s, the more reliable airplane. In fact, we'd include SkyWest in that total as well. So I think it's a good thing, what the DOT has done. I mean, the customer, when they book on an airline, they really don't distinguish whether they're flying a regional airplane or a mainline airplane.

I'll keep it high level, I think, and I'll just speak for Alaska Air Group. A couple of key things here that codeshares provide us, firstly, domestically, we can connect into our partners' hubs in the middle of the country and then connect our customers to anywhere in the rest of the country. So firstly, these codeshare agreements domestically give us a lot of ability to be able to get our passengers everywhere they need to go at the times they need to go and give them plenty of choice of fares when they need to go. I think the other key component of that is also obviously the loyalty side, so our customers can still accrue elite status and miles when they fly on our partner's medal or on our own medal. And of course, redemptions. If customers want to redeem, 85% of our customers redeem on us still. And then the last piece is really international. And the international is really, really important. For our international partners, we provide huge value to help them fill airplanes. I mean, the statistics are quite significant in our hubs, especially on how many passengers we put on our foreign flag friends. In fact, for Alaska customers, it allows them to both redeem globally, 800-plus destinations globally, as well as earn and redeem miles. So overall, I would say that these codeshare relationships provide great utility. But at the end of the day, Alaska Air Group is built on its fundamental product, and the majority of customers, majority of loyalty, the majority of revenue is all based on Alaska Air Group's medal and what we do."

This morning, Alaska Air Group reported a third quarter GAAP net profit of $256 million, excluding $14 million in merger-related costs and a $2 million impact of mark-to-market adjustments related to our fuel hedge portfolio. Air Group reported an adjusted net income of $272 million. And earnings per share grew by 2% to $2.20 per share. That compares to First Call mean estimate of $2.09 per share.

As Lavanya just shared, our third quarter net income was $272 million, a bit below last year, but our earnings per share of $2.20 were 2% higher than last year and our highest quarterly earnings per share ever.
2016 is shaping up to be a year of record profitability. Pretax income for the first 9 months of the year was over $1 billion and $90 million higher than last year. And on a trailing 12-month basis, our pretax margin now stands at just under 25%. This is an extraordinary level of performance, not only in relation to our industry, but also in relation to other high-quality industrial companies.
Some have asked what Alaska's margin should be over the longer term. This is a good question and one that we can all speculate about. What we can say definitively is that our goal is to be a leader in this industry, and that means we need to be safe, be on time, provide great service and very importantly, have both low fares and low costs. If we do these things well, we'll be in a position to lead the industry in terms of financial performance, regardless of what part of the cycle we're in.
Before we get into the details of the quarter, I'd like to touch briefly on Virgin America. Many of you have asked questions about the timing of the merger and about our ongoing discussions with the Justice Department. As to timing, we were hoping to get this done a couple of weeks ago, and we're obviously not there quite yet. The scope of issues that remain with the Justice Department is manageable, but they're important matters, and we want to take the time that's necessary to work through them. It's hard to predict the exact timing from when we'll wrap up since there are 2 parties involved. There's a process at play, and we're working through that process and we're respectful of that process. Our hope is that we'll have antitrust clearance soon.
All that said, we continue to be very confident that the deal will get done and get done in a way that benefits all of our stakeholders, most importantly, our customers. This is a pro-consumer merger of 2 smaller airlines that will bring new low-fare competition, industry-leading service and innovative product offerings for the customers we serve.
And unfortunately, what I've just shared is the extent of the comments that we're going to be able to make this morning about the review process.
As we prepare for the merger, there are 2 things our leadership team has really focused on. First, bringing together these 2 teams so everyone is aligned, motivated and working on the same things, or pulling together in other words. And doing this well lays the groundwork for number two, which is achieving the synergies of the deal, which based on everything we've seen to date, we feel confident about doing.
Ben Minicucci and his team have been working hard on integration planning, and Ben and others will be happy to share details of the planning work during the Q&A. 
And as a reminder, this commendation ultimately positions us as the fifth largest airline in the country, an airline with a national footprint and an unmatched ability to serve West Coast travelers.
And with that, I'd like to turn the focus of this call back to our stand-alone business and our Q3 performance. It's football season, and we're all cheering on the Seahawks and our other CFO, Russell Wilson. One of the things the Seahawks do well is stick to their game plan, and I'm really proud of our folks for sticking to our game plan during our busiest summer yet.
A big part of Alaska's success is built on being safe, on being on time and on taking great care of our customers. Our team flat-delivered during the third quarter. 
Let me start with safety. You've heard us say that safety is our #1 priority. And last quarter, we were the first airline to have our new Safety Management System, or SMS, accepted by the FAA. This system, which was the FAA is mandating for all airlines is the new way of monitoring, managing and mitigating safety risks, and it's a project that we've been working on for almost 5 years. I'm really proud of the teams at Alaska and Horizon for being the first airlines to have this in place. And again, leading the industry on this underscores our commitment to operating safely and to doing things right.
Second, we continue to run a solid operation, and in fact, this was one of our best quarters operationally ever. 89.1% of Alaska's flights arrived on time during the quarter, and we completed 99.8% of our flights. On a year-to-date basis, our on-time rate is 88.5%, and we expect it will be the best among the 6 largest carriers for the seventh year in a row.
Over at Horizon, David and his team have been focused on improving their operation, and their efforts are paying off as our third quarter performance went from 79.9% last year to 85.3% this year. This is especially important as we continue to grow the regional side of the business, including the addition of new Embraer jets.
And third, our people are taking care of customers. Our internal customer satisfaction score for the third quarter was 87.3%, our highest score since we started tracking this back in 2007. This is a fantastic achievement, and I want to thank our employees for taking great care of our customers over the summer.
It's no surprise that how you treat people matters. We're seeing the results as active members in our Mileage Plan have increased by 35% in the last 2 years and this in the face of intense competition in some of our markets.
Being safe, being on time and offering great service and low fares are the key ingredients of our game plan not only for customers, but also for our owners. Looking at the most recent quarter, we expect our trailing 12-month ROIC of 24% and our third quarter pretax margin of 27% will be among the very best in the industry. These are strong results, and you'll hear more from Andrew and Brandon next on the underlying actions that drove these outcomes.
As I look to the future, I'm very confident about our core business and even more excited about the future when the Virgin America merger is complete. A lot of people will say this, but I really feel it's true with Alaska. We have a fantastic group of people here who are working together, and I want to thank them for everything they're doing to make us the best airline that we can possibly be for our customers.
Now I'll turn the call over to Andrew."
248501,404678309,1058079,"Alaska Air Group, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 20, 2016",2016-10-20,"Earnings Calls","Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Brad, and good morning, everyone. Our third quarter revenue performance was solid, with growth of 3.4% or $51.2 million. This contrasts with the industry revenue contraction of approximately 2%. We were able to sustain high load factors while incr",939,"Thanks, Brad, and good morning, everyone. Our third quarter revenue performance was solid, with growth of 3.4% or $51.2 million. This contrasts with the industry revenue contraction of approximately 2%. We were able to sustain high load factors while increasing capacity at a rate more than 2x that of the industry. Our present change improved about 200 basis points from the prior quarter and outperformed the industry by approximately 40 basis points despite competitive capacity growing double digits in our markets once again.
Looking at monthly trends. RASM was down by an average of 6.5% in both July and August, yet it was up 0.5% in September. Lower September growth and strong bookings within the month, along with an improved closing yield trajectory, contributed to the strong performance during the period -- during this shoulder period. Our September load factor of 84.1% was up 2.5 points year-over-year. And while fares remain low, they appear to be stable, and we're not seeing anything to suggest that this will not continue into the fourth quarter.
Our underlying business remains sound, and we expect to continue our current momentum for several reasons. First, our revenue streams continue to grow and diversify due to our growth. We started our transcon service 15 years ago in September of 2001, with 1 flight from Seattle to DCA. Today, we serve 15 cities in this region, with 33 flights a day. And transcon service now accounts for approximately 15% of our revenues and a similar amount of our profits. We're continuing this growth with new flights to Newark from Portland, San Diego, San Jose and a third daily departure from Seattle. And here's a little fun fact. If you combined our network with Virgin America, we'd have up to 31 flights a day to the New York City area alone.
Second, we added Embraer 175s into our fleet a year ago, and this has been a fantastic aircraft for reaching markets in the Mid-Continent, which were too far for Q400 and too thin for the 737. We have rapidly grown the number of markets served by the Embraer to 29. These aircraft are delivering the results we hoped for as they are creating new and profitable revenue streams supporting our mainline growth and providing greater nonstop convenience for our customers.
Even though many of our Embraer 175 markets are still maturing, in aggregate, they are profitable and already earning their cost of capital. We take delivery of 18 175s next year.
Third, this growth is buttressed by the loyalty we enjoy from our members. We believe we have the most generous and far-reaching loyalty program in the industry. Members in our credit card portfolio grew 11.5% for the quarter, with retail spend on the portfolio outpacing this membership growth. And additionally, our Frequent-Flier members grew 10%.
And fourth, our growth is enabled by offering low fares. In some recent analysis we conducted, we found Alaska's one-way fares were more than $40 or 23% lower than each of the 3 network carriers on a systemwide stage length adjusted basis. Our low fares are enabled by our low costs. We remain focused on bringing these low fares to our customers and maintaining the cost advantage that enables these fares.
I want to move to the fourth quarter now. Our Q4 growth will slow substantially to just over 3%. This brings our full year capacity growth to about 8.5%, in line with our previous guidance. However, our competitive capacity is expected to stay elevated for the remainder of the year at about 10%.
While we expect to close-in bookings strengths we have seen in September to carry through to the fourth quarter, December is expected to be softer than October and November on a relative basis as both Christmas and New Year's fall on a weekend this year, compressing the holiday travel season. We estimate this will lower PRASM for the quarter by about 0.5 point.
I also want to update you on the progress we are making on our premium class product. We expect to complete the conversion of all 61 737-800s by year-end. We'll start selling tickets for premium class in early November for travel starting January 5, 2017. As a reminder, we expect this to add approximately $50 million in revenue next year and achieve $85 million on new run rate by the end of 2018.
With that, I'd like to touch on 2017. On a stand-alone basis, that is excluding any impact from the acquisition of Virgin America, we expect our growth to slow by about 150 basis points versus this year to slightly more than 7%. This growth comprises approximately 2 points from longer stage length and a point from the annualization of markets we already launched in 2016.
As we look at published schedules, we expect Q1 2017 competitive capacity to come down slightly to 9% in our markets, still elevated but a nice change from the double-digit increases we have been seeing for quite a while.
As we enter the last quarter of the year and look to 2017, we remain confident in our business. We are operating well, fundamentals in the economies we serve are strong, our loyal customer base continues to grow, and we continue to add new and profitable revenue streams to our portfolio.
Like everyone else at Alaska, the rest of my commercial team and I are excited about the opportunity that Virgin America presents for our business, which will allow us to accelerate our growth while bringing low fares to more customers and strong returns for our shareholders.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Brandon."

We're pleased to report another very strong quarter financially, punctuated by the 2% increase in earnings per share. Even though net profit declined very slightly, we're benefiting from the significant share repurchases that we've made since the end of the third quarter of last year.
As Andrew said, revenues grew by more than 3%. And although our nonfuel costs grew by nearly 10%, we were nonetheless pleased with our cost performance. Our nonfuel unit costs were up 1.6%, but that was lower than we initially expected for the quarter. We remain on track to have a full year unit cost reduction of about 0.5%, which would make the seventh -- this the seventh straight year of unit cost reduction.
Andrew offered some early guidance on next year's growth, but we aren't yet able to share initial 2017 unit cost guidance. Our leaders are busy compiling budgets right now. Folks across both Alaska and Horizon recognize that low costs create an important competitive advantage over higher-cost legacy carriers and are required for us to grow. We're planning to provide 2017 cost guidance on our fourth quarter call.
And speaking of guidance, I want to remind everyone that we're taking a little different approach this year by having our Investor Day in March. We're looking forward to sharing much more with you about our post-merger plans at that time.
Our earnings benefited less of a -- from less of a tailwind of lower fuel prices than in Q1 or Q2. Economic fuel costs declined by $18 million this quarter, where the year-over-year declines in Q1 and Q2 were more than 3x that amount.
With oil prices now over $50 a barrel, it's worth mentioning the improving efficiency of our fleet that will help offset rising fuel costs. ASMs per gallon improved by another 2% this quarter because of the ongoing retirement of the 737-400s and the addition of fuel-efficient 900ERs.
In fact, we've taken delivery of 21 737-900ERs since the end of the third quarter of last year. And our mainline efficiency should just should continue to get better as we finish retiring the 400s and add another 13 900ERs by the end of 2017.
As we've told you before, these new aircraft are 37 seats larger, they're more comfortable, they're more reliable and sip fuel like a Prius with wings. A 900ER brings less than 910 gallons per flight compared to 940 gallons per flight hour burned by the smaller 737-400.
Turning to the balance sheet. You might have noticed that we ended the quarter with more than $3.2 billion of cash. That total includes more than $1.5 billion that we had raised at quarter end to fund the Virgin America acquisition. At this point, we're fully prepared to close the deal once we have DOJ approval. Our treasury and legal teams did an incredible job putting all this together, and I wanted to extend a huge thanks to both of them.
We're using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt, and our weighted average interest rate on this new money currently stands at 2.37%, even after the financing. We still have more than 40 unencumbered Boeing 737 aircraft, including 20 next-generation 800s and 900ERs. The borrowing rate and the fact that we have so much remaining collateral are both a testament to the great balance sheet that we've built and incredible amount of cash flow we've been able to generate over the last 5 years.
Cash flow from operations for the first 9 months of the year was $1.2 billion, about flat compared to the first 9 months of last year. Year-to-date CapEx is just over $500 million, resulting in about $700 million of free cash flow. We expect full year CapEx to now be $680 million, down slightly from prior guidance.
There are 2 drivers. First, we elected to defer our first step -- our first 737 MAX aircraft from the fall of 2017 to early '18. The MAX will be a great airplane for Alaska, with an extra range and lower fuel burn, but with so much going on, we wanted a bit more time to bring it into service. We want to thank Boeing for accommodating our request. And second, we've lowered our estimate of non-aircraft spending as certain projects have shifted to the right. Looking forward, and as we told you last quarter, we're planning for 2017 CapEx to be about $1.1 billion, which, of course, is current Air Group only.
Andrew and I have thrown out a lot of information on fleet changes, so I thought I'd might recap. On the mainline side, in 2016, we're adding a total of 19 new aircraft and retiring 10. And in 2017, we're adding 12 new aircraft and retiring 16, which is the rest of the 737-400 fleet.
On the regional side, we'll take delivery of our first 13 E175 jets into the Horizon fleet. And by the way, I want to recognize the Horizon team that's working on entry into service. And we'll add another 5 through our capacity and purchase arrangement with SkyWest.
We're very pleased with the strong results, both operational and financial, and our people should celebrate the great summer we had. We're mindful that there's a lot going on, a lot of hard work lies ahead, and we need to keep executing on the things that continue to make us successful.
And with that, let's go to questions."

I think if this is the place where we're all speculating, Hunter, you guys probably have a better view of what's going to happen with long-term margins in our industry than we do. But we do look at other industries. We look at other high-quality industrials. We look at sort of gaps that people are earning over their cost of capital. And so I think the industry, you would hope that as we settle down and have capacity control and have consolidation, that we settle into a place where we're earning, as an industry, margins that are several hundred points above our cost of capital. And then what we're saying is Alaska should be above that. That's sort of how we see ourselves. That's what we want to do. How you do that math, I don't think I want to be the one -- I'll just -- I think I've told you what we know and we've -- what we've always done is tried to talk about what we know and not talk about what we don't know. So I think that's where I might leave it. As to Virgin, just to be really candid, you add the 2 together. We're not issuing one new share for this acquisition. So any profit that they bring into the company is accretive to our profit. But I think you have seen the math. Virgin's historical margins are lower than Alaska. So I would expect that our company-wide margins will dilute a little bit. And Brandon, I can't remember the exact numbers, but it's not huge.

And so we are pushing. There are some things that we feel are important to our future success and our ability to do good things for customers, and that's what's motivating us here. But -- and I'll just say, we do have a pretty strong internal compass about what has worked for us and what will work for us in the future. So if that's an answer to your question, there you have it, but there's just not a lot more that we can say about this."

And I'm just curious, I mean, I know that under the new rules, Horizon doesn't meet the new threshold. But it looks like it's actually very close to the threshold, so maybe it's a 2017, 2018 type event. But if you were to include Horizon in with the Alaska numbers, where would you stack up on on-time completion factor?

I mean, the customer, when they book on an airline, they really don't distinguish whether they're flying a regional airplane or a mainline airplane.

I'll keep it high level, I think, and I'll just speak for Alaska Air Group. A couple of key things here that codeshares provide us, firstly, domestically, we can connect into our partners' hubs in the middle of the country and then connect our customers to anywhere in the rest of the country. So firstly, these codeshare agreements domestically give us a lot of ability to be able to get our passengers everywhere they need to go at the times they need to go and give them plenty of choice of fares when they need to go. I think the other key component of that is also obviously the loyalty side, so our customers can still accrue elite status and miles when they fly on our partner's medal or on our own medal. And of course, redemptions. If customers want to redeem, 85% of our customers redeem on us still. And then the last piece is really international. And the international is really, really important. For our international partners, we provide huge value to help them fill their airplanes. I mean, the statistics are quite significant in our hubs, especially on how many passengers we put on our foreign flag friends. In fact, for Alaska customers, it allows them to both redeem globally, 800-plus destinations globally, as well as earn and redeem miles. So overall, I would say that these codeshare relationships provide great utility. But at the end of the day, Alaska Air Group is built on its fundamental product, and the majority of customers, majority of loyalty, the majority of revenue is all based on Alaska Air Group's medal and what we do."

So those are the things that we're going to be balancing as we think about this decision. And I think you'll hear us say more about this in the next few months, but it is an open question and I think you know the 2 sides, the 2 arguments for each side of it."

The Havanas, all the Newarks, each of those were a point of growth, or 3/4 of a point of growth. So it's not hard to get to 7% already with what we've already done. We will continue to monitor this. And of course, with the new combined entity, we'll take a hard look at it. But what we've seen to date is our growth has provided good economics for this company.

We will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures such as adjusted earnings and unit costs, excluding fuel. We have provided a reconciliation between the most directly comparable GAAP and non-GAAP measures in our earnings release.
This morning, Alaska Air Group reported a third quarter GAAP net profit of $256 million, excluding $14 million in merger-related costs and a $2 million impact of mark-to-market adjustments related to our fuel hedge portfolio. Air Group reported an adjusted net income of $272 million. And earnings per share grew by 2% to $2.20 per share. That compares to First Call mean estimate of $2.09 per share.

As Lavanya just shared, our third quarter net income was $272 million, a bit below last year, but our earnings per share of $2.20 were 2% higher than last year and our highest quarterly earnings per share ever.
2016 is shaping up to be a year of record profitability. Pretax income for the first 9 months of the year was over $1 billion and $90 million higher than last year. And on a trailing 12-month basis, our pretax margin now stands at just under 25%. This is an extraordinary level of performance, not only in relation to our industry, but also in relation to other high-quality industrial companies.
Some have asked what Alaska's margin should be over the longer term. This is a good question and one that we can all speculate about. What we can say definitively is that our goal is to be a leader in this industry, and that means we need to be safe, be on time, provide great service and very importantly, have both low fares and low costs. If we do these things well, we'll be in a position to lead the industry in terms of financial performance, regardless of what part of the cycle we're in.
Before we get into the details of the quarter, I'd like to touch briefly on Virgin America. Many of you have asked questions about the timing of the merger and about our ongoing discussions with the Justice Department. As to timing, we were hoping to get this done a couple of weeks ago, and we're obviously not there quite yet. The scope of issues that remain with the Justice Department is manageable, but they're important matters, and we want to take the time that's necessary to work through them. It's hard to predict the exact timing from when we'll wrap up since there are 2 parties involved. There's a process at play, and we're working through that process and we're respectful of that process. Our hope is that we'll have antitrust clearance soon.
All that said, we continue to be very confident that the deal will get done and get done in a way that benefits all of our stakeholders, most importantly, our customers. This is a pro-consumer merger of 2 smaller airlines that will bring new low-fare competition, industry-leading service and innovative product offerings for the customers we serve.
And unfortunately, what I've just shared is the extent of the comments that we're going to be able to make this morning about the review process.
As we prepare for the merger, there are 2 things our leadership team has really focused on. First, bringing together these 2 teams so everyone is aligned, motivated and working on the same things, or pulling together in other words. And doing this well lays the groundwork for number two, which is achieving the synergies of the deal, which based on everything we've seen to date, we feel confident about doing.
Ben Minicucci and his team have been working hard on integration planning, and Ben and others will be happy to share details of the planning work during the Q&A. 
And as a reminder, this commendation ultimately positions us as the fifth largest airline in the country, an airline with a national footprint and an unmatched ability to serve West Coast travelers.
And with that, I'd like to turn the focus of this call back to our stand-alone business and our Q3 performance. It's football season, and we're all cheering on the Seahawks and our other CFO, Russell Wilson. One of the things the Seahawks do well is stick to their game plan, and I'm really proud of our folks for sticking to our game plan during our busiest summer yet.
A big part of Alaska's success is built on being safe, on being on time and on taking great care of our customers. Our team flat-delivered during the third quarter. 
Let me start with safety. You've heard us say that safety is our #1 priority. And last quarter, we were the first airline to have our new Safety Management System, or SMS, accepted by the FAA. This system, which was the FAA is mandating for all airlines is the new way of monitoring, managing and mitigating safety risks, and it's a project that we've been working on for almost 5 years. I'm really proud of the teams at Alaska and Horizon for being the first airlines to have this in place. And again, leading the industry on this underscores our commitment to operating safely and to doing things right.
Second, we continue to run a solid operation, and in fact, this was one of our best quarters operationally ever. 89.1% of Alaska's flights arrived on time during the quarter, and we completed 99.8% of our flights. On a year-to-date basis, our on-time rate is 88.5%, and we expect it will be the best among the 6 largest carriers for the seventh year in a row.
Over at Horizon, David and his team have been focused on improving their operation, and their efforts are paying off as our third quarter performance went from 79.9% last year to 85.3% this year. This is especially important as we continue to grow the regional side of the business, including the addition of new Embraer jets.
And third, our people are taking care of customers. Our internal customer satisfaction score for the third quarter was 87.3%, our highest score since we started tracking this back in 2007. This is a fantastic achievement, and I want to thank our employees for taking great care of our customers over the summer.
It's no surprise that how you treat people matters. We're seeing the results as active members in our Mileage Plan have increased by 35% in the last 2 years and this in the face of intense competition in some of our markets.
Being safe, being on time and offering great service and low fares are the key ingredients of our game plan not only for customers, but also for our owners. Looking at the most recent quarter, we expect our trailing 12-month ROIC of 24% and our third quarter pretax margin of 27% will be among the very best in the industry. These are strong results, and you'll hear more from Andrew and Brandon next on the underlying actions that drove these outcomes.
As I look to the future, I'm very confident about our core business and even more excited about the future when the Virgin America merger is complete. A lot of people will say this, but I really feel it's true with Alaska. We have a fantastic group of people here who are working together, and I want to thank them for everything they're doing to make us the best airline that we can possibly be for our customers.
Now I'll turn the call over to Andrew."
248501,404678309,1058355,"Alaska Air Group, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 20, 2016",2016-10-20,"Earnings Calls","Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Brad, and good morning, everyone. Our third quarter revenue performance was solid, with growth of 3.4% or $51.2 million. This contrasts with the industry revenue contraction of approximately 2%.

This contrasts with the industry revenue contraction of approximately 2%. We were able to sustain high load factors while increasing capacity at a rate more than 2x that of the industry. Our present change improved about 200 basis points from the prior quarter and outperformed the industry by approximately 40 basis points despite competitive capacity growing double digits in our markets once again.
Looking at monthly trends. RASM was down by an average of 6.5% in both July and August, yet it was up 0.5% in September. Lower September growth and strong bookings within the month, along with an improved closing yield trajectory, contributed to the strong performance during the period -- during this shoulder period. Our September load factor of 84.1% was up 2.5 points year-over-year. And while fares remain low, they appear to be stable, and we're not seeing anything to suggest that this will not continue into the fourth quarter.
Our underlying business remains sound, and we expect to continue our current momentum for several reasons. First, our revenue streams continue to grow and diversify due to our growth. We started our transcon service 15 years ago in September of 2001, with 1 flight from Seattle to DCA. Today, we serve 15 cities in this region, with 33 flights a day. And transcon service now accounts for approximately 15% of our revenues and a similar amount of our profits. We're continuing this growth with new flights to Newark from Portland, San Diego, San Jose and a third daily departure from Seattle. And here's a little fun fact. If you combined our network with Virgin America, we'd have up to 31 flights a day to the New York City area alone.
Second, we added Embraer 175s into our fleet a year ago, and this has been a fantastic aircraft for reaching markets in the Mid-Continent, which were too far for Q400 and too thin for the 737. We have rapidly grown the number of markets served by the Embraer to 29. These aircraft are delivering the results we hoped for as they are creating new and profitable revenue streams supporting our mainline growth and providing greater nonstop convenience for our customers.
Even though many of our Embraer 175 markets are still maturing, in aggregate, they are profitable and already earning their cost of capital. We take delivery of 18 175s next year.
Third, this growth is buttressed by the loyalty we enjoy from our members. We believe we have the most generous and far-reaching loyalty program in the industry. Members in our credit card portfolio grew 11.5% for the quarter, with retail spend on the portfolio outpacing this membership growth. And additionally, our Frequent-Flier members grew 10%.
And fourth, our growth is enabled by offering low fares. In some recent analysis we conducted, we found Alaska's one-way fares were more than $40 or 23% lower than each of the 3 network carriers on a systemwide stage length adjusted basis. Our low fares are enabled by our low costs. We remain focused on bringing these low fares to our customers and maintaining the cost advantage that enables these fares.
I want to move to the fourth quarter now. Our Q4 growth will slow substantially to just over 3%. This brings our full year capacity growth to about 8.5%, in line with our previous guidance. However, our competitive capacity is expected to stay elevated for the remainder of the year at about 10%.
While we expect to close-in bookings strengths we have seen in September to carry through to the fourth quarter, December is expected to be softer than October and November on a relative basis as both Christmas and New Year's fall on a weekend this year, compressing the holiday travel season. We estimate this will lower PRASM for the quarter by about 0.5 point.
I also want to update you on the progress we are making on our premium class product. We expect to complete the conversion of all 61 737-800s by year-end. We'll start selling tickets for premium class in early November for travel starting January 5, 2017. As a reminder, we expect this to add approximately $50 million in revenue next year and achieve $85 million on new run rate by the end of 2018.
With that, I'd like to touch on 2017. On a stand-alone basis, that is excluding any impact from the acquisition of Virgin America, we expect our growth to slow by about 150 basis points versus this year to slightly more than 7%. This growth comprises approximately 2 points from longer stage length and a point from the annualization of markets we already launched in 2016.
As we look at published schedules, we expect Q1 2017 competitive capacity to come down slightly to 9% in our markets, still elevated but a nice change from the double-digit increases we have been seeing for quite a while.
As we enter the last quarter of the year and look to 2017, we remain confident in our business. We are operating well, fundamentals in the economies we serve are strong, our loyal customer base continues to grow, and we continue to add new and profitable revenue streams to our portfolio.
Like everyone else at Alaska, the rest of my commercial team and I are excited about the opportunity that Virgin America presents for our business, which will allow us to accelerate our growth while bringing low fares to more customers and strong returns for our shareholders.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Brandon."

We're pleased to report another very strong quarter financially, punctuated by the 2% increase in earnings per share. Even though net profit declined very slightly, we're benefiting from the significant share repurchases that we've made since the end of the third quarter of last year.
As Andrew said, revenues grew by more than 3%. And although our nonfuel costs grew by nearly 10%, we were nonetheless pleased with our cost performance. Our nonfuel unit costs were up 1.6%, but that was lower than we initially expected for the quarter. We remain on track to have a full year unit cost reduction of about 0.5%, which would make the seventh -- this the seventh straight year of unit cost reduction.
Andrew offered some early guidance on next year's growth, but we aren't yet able to share initial 2017 unit cost guidance. Our leaders are busy compiling budgets right now. Folks across both Alaska and Horizon recognize that low costs create an important competitive advantage over higher-cost legacy carriers and are required for us to grow. We're planning to provide 2017 cost guidance on our fourth quarter call.
And speaking of guidance, I want to remind everyone that we're taking a little different approach this year by having our Investor Day in March. We're looking forward to sharing much more with you about our post-merger plans at that time.
Our earnings benefited less of a -- from less of a tailwind of lower fuel prices than in Q1 or Q2. Economic fuel costs declined by $18 million this quarter, where the year-over-year declines in Q1 and Q2 were more than 3x that amount.
With oil prices now over $50 a barrel, it's worth mentioning the improving efficiency of our fleet that will help offset rising fuel costs. ASMs per gallon improved by another 2% this quarter because of the ongoing retirement of the 737-400s and the addition of fuel-efficient 900ERs.
In fact, we've taken delivery of 21 737-900ERs since the end of the third quarter of last year. And our mainline efficiency should just should continue to get better as we finish retiring the 400s and add another 13 900ERs by the end of 2017.
As we've told you before, these new aircraft are 37 seats larger, they're more comfortable, they're more reliable and sip fuel like a Prius with wings. A 900ER brings less than 910 gallons per flight compared to 940 gallons per flight hour burned by the smaller 737-400.
Turning to the balance sheet. You might have noticed that we ended the quarter with more than $3.2 billion of cash. That total includes more than $1.5 billion that we had raised at quarter end to fund the Virgin America acquisition. At this point, we're fully prepared to close the deal once we have DOJ approval. Our treasury and legal teams did an incredible job putting all this together, and I wanted to extend a huge thanks to both of them.
We're using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt, and our weighted average interest rate on this new money currently stands at 2.37%, even after the financing. We still have more than 40 unencumbered Boeing 737 aircraft, including 20 next-generation 800s and 900ERs. The borrowing rate and the fact that we have so much remaining collateral are both a testament to the great balance sheet that we've built and incredible amount of cash flow we've been able to generate over the last 5 years.
Cash flow from operations for the first 9 months of the year was $1.2 billion, about flat compared to the first 9 months of last year. Year-to-date CapEx is just over $500 million, resulting in about $700 million of free cash flow. We expect full year CapEx to now be $680 million, down slightly from prior guidance.
There are 2 drivers. First, we elected to defer our first step -- our first 737 MAX aircraft from the fall of 2017 to early '18. The MAX will be a great airplane for Alaska, with an extra range and lower fuel burn, but with so much going on, we wanted a bit more time to bring it into service. We want to thank Boeing for accommodating our request. And second, we've lowered our estimate of non-aircraft spending as certain projects have shifted to the right. Looking forward, and as we told you last quarter, we're planning for 2017 CapEx to be about $1.1 billion, which, of course, is current Air Group only.
Andrew and I have thrown out a lot of information on fleet changes, so I thought I'd might recap. On the mainline side, in 2016, we're adding a total of 19 new aircraft and retiring 10. And in 2017, we're adding 12 new aircraft and retiring 16, which is the rest of the 737-400 fleet.
On the regional side, we'll take delivery of our first 13 E175 jets into the Horizon fleet. And by the way, I want to recognize the Horizon team that's working on entry into service. And we'll add another 5 through our capacity and purchase arrangement with SkyWest.
We're very pleased with the strong results, both operational and financial, and our people should celebrate the great summer we had. We're mindful that there's a lot going on, a lot of hard work lies ahead, and we need to keep executing on the things that continue to make us successful.
And with that, let's go to questions."

I think if this is the place where we're all speculating, Hunter, you guys probably have a better view of what's going to happen with long-term margins in our industry than we do. But we do look at other industries. We look at other high-quality industrials. We look at sort of gaps that people are earning over their cost of capital. And so I think the industry, you would hope that as we settle down and have capacity control and have consolidation, that we settle into a place where we're earning, as an industry, margins that are several hundred points above our cost of capital. And then what we're saying is Alaska should be above that. That's sort of how we see ourselves. That's what we want to do. How you do that math, I don't think I want to be the one -- I'll just -- I think I've told you what we know and we've -- what we've always done is tried to talk about what we know and not talk about what we don't know. So I think that's where I might leave it. As to Virgin, just to be really candid, you add the 2 together. We're not issuing one new share for this acquisition. So any profit that they bring into the company is accretive to our profit. But I think you have seen the math. Virgin's historical margins are lower than Alaska. So I would expect that our company-wide margins will dilute a little bit. And Brandon, I can't remember the exact numbers, but it's not huge.

So we're going to get there, and we're confident that the rating agencies will come around when they see that and they know us well, and they will see that we're going to just revert back to our pattern. One point I'll make about the -- we aren't going to have additional debt, but because the interest rate is quite a bit lower than what we had before, our actual interest expense will be right in the range of what we've had historically. So that's a good thing even though our leverage is a little bit higher."

And while there was kind of a lot of verbiage, a lot of noise, it seemed like that there were a couple of things that are going to come into play here, and one of it has to deal with the on-time performance. And I'm just curious, I mean, I know that under the new rules, Horizon doesn't meet the new threshold. But it looks like it's actually very close to the threshold, so maybe it's a 2017, 2018 type event. But if you were to include Horizon in with the Alaska numbers, where would you stack up on on-time completion factor? Like how would you compare -- and I realize you probably have to do that analysis for the other carriers, but does it enhance? Does it -- is it neutral? Or does it take away from the numbers?"

So Horizon, I'm looking forward to Horizon getting the 175s, the more reliable airplane. In fact, we'd include SkyWest in that total as well. So I think it's a good thing, what the DOT has done. I mean, the customer, when they book on an airline, they really don't distinguish whether they're flying a regional airplane or a mainline airplane.

But everything else that we can control, we're driving a much, much stronger process in place. So I'm pretty excited about the focus.

I'll keep it high level, I think, and I'll just speak for Alaska Air Group. A couple of key things here that codeshares provide us, firstly, domestically, we can connect into our partners' hubs in the middle of the country and then connect our customers to anywhere in the rest of the country. So firstly, these codeshare agreements domestically give us a lot of ability to be able to get our passengers everywhere they need to go at the times they need to go and give them plenty of choice of fares when they need to go. I think the other key component of that is also obviously the loyalty side, so our customers can still accrue elite status and miles when they fly on our partner's medal or on our own medal. And of course, redemptions. If customers want to redeem, 85% of our customers redeem on us still. And then the last piece is really international. And the international is really, really important. For our international partners, we provide huge value to help them fill their airplanes. I mean, the statistics are quite significant in our hubs, especially on how many passengers we put on our foreign flag friends. In fact, for Alaska customers, it allows them to both redeem globally, 800-plus destinations globally, as well as earn and redeem miles. So overall, I would say that these codeshare relationships provide great utility. But at the end of the day, Alaska Air Group is built on its fundamental product, and the majority of customers, majority of loyalty, the majority of revenue is all based on Alaska Air Group's medal and what we do."

So there's some good growth there. A lot of our growth is really transcon and midcon. 80% of it was this quarter. 100% of it will be next quarter. We'll give more details later on. But these are markets that we found to be very, very good for us and adding a lot of new revenue. As Brandon shared, these are high-level estimates again as we stand today. The Havanas, all the Newarks, each of those were a point of growth, or 3/4 of a point of growth. So it's not hard to get to 7% already with what we've already done. We will continue to monitor this. And of course, with the new combined entity, we'll take a hard look at it. But what we've seen to date is our growth has provided good economics for this company. And if these economic conditions and the continuing strengthening of close-in bookings and the environment are still there next year, we'll continue on with our plan."
