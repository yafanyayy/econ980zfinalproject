Thank you for joining us on the call today. First fiscal year quarter results were better than expected, primarily as a result of significantly reduced daily rig expenses in our U.S. land segment. Unfortu",762,"Thank you, Juan Pablo, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today. First fiscal year quarter results were better than expected, primarily as a result of significantly reduced daily rig expenses in our U.S. land segment. Unfortunately, U.S. land drilling activity has declined to levels not seen since 1999 as very low oil and gas prices are forcing customers to make further reductions in the drilling budgets. The tone in 2016 has shifted to lower for longer. The industry has idled over 1400 rigs in the U.S. since the peak rig count in October of 2014. And it continues to decline. Of those 1400 rigs that have been idled, approximately 900 are legacy SCR mechanical rigs and approximately 500 are AC drive rigs. The industry is experiencing dramatic reductions in personnel and investments and clearly a number of companies are struggling to survive. 
We are unable to predict to the future, but perspective is necessary in both good and bad times. Recently, oil prices traded below $30 a barrel and a few see the possibility of $20 oil. We are predicting an immediate oil price improvement, but we do believe pricing are below the level required to sustain a stable, let alone growing supply over a long period of time. In the meantime, the capabilities of the oilfield service providers are being reduced significantly. At some point, the question will be who is in the best position for the eventual return of drilling demand. We believe that we will be well positioned and that this is simply not a time for us to hunker down and wait for things to get better. While continuing to thoughtfully manage costs, we will prudently investing opportunities that will enhance the key competitive advantages we have in the company.
Let me talk briefly about a few of those opportunities. Our fleet profile is a competitive advantage as the FlexRig design allows us to provide a family of solutions for our customers. For several years now, the industry has been trending toward longer laterals, multi-well pads, and generally, more complex for designs, which require AC drive rigs with 1500-horsepower specifications. We have over 320 AC drive FlexRigs with 1500 horsepower ratings, and over 180 of those rigs are optimized for multi-well pad operations, and we continue to add 7500 psi systems to a large portion of the fleet as well. The advanced fleet of FlexRigs supported by organizational capabilities enables the company to do to remain laser focused on delivering wells safely, quickly and efficiently, while continuing to innovate by providing technology solutions and enhancing our service offering.
Our strategy has been successful. Our market share in the U.S. has increased from 15% in 2014 to 18% today and has doubled since 2008. We will also continue to invest in the organizational capabilities that I just mentioned. This means enhancing our best-in-class reputation for service and the way we create value for our customers., while our organizational infrastructure has been built over the past 10 years, we continue to make investments to improve and deleverage the learnings we captured from the fleet on a daily basis. This allows us to partner more closely with the customer to provide greater efficiencies, reliability and safety. These improvements are all aimed at drilling the lowest cost well for our customers and maximizing the number of wells customers can deliver in a budget year.
And finally, maintaining a strong balance sheet and a disciplined approach to cost management remain a companywide priority. It is in times like that the practice of maintaining a strong balance sheet becomes the key to future success. Along with this, it's having a balanced perspective on cost management so that we're making prudent reductions that loan ended costing us more than the initial saving some somewhere down the line. We're also rightsizing the organization and along the same principles with the end goal of enhancing our performance and developing opportunities for future growth.
Before I turn the call back to Juan Pablo, clearly the first quarter of our 2016 fiscal year has been very challenging start to the year. We are fortunate to have a very strong and liquid balance sheet, a firm backlog of term contracts and the flexibility to significantly reduce spending levels during a soft market. Our approach to capital allocation will remain prudent and should allow us to effectively manage our business through this downturn and a merge from it with even greater competitive advantages. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Juan Pablo."

The company reported $16 million in net income for the first quarter of fiscal 2016. Given the deterioration of market conditions since late 2014, the average quarterly level of drilling activity for the company has continued to decline d",1568,"Thank you, John. The company reported $16 million in net income for the first quarter of fiscal 2016. Given the deterioration of market conditions since late 2014, the average quarterly level of drilling activity for the company has continued to decline down 53% from last year's first fiscal quarter and down 11% from last year's fourth fiscal quarter. Unfortunately, activity is expected to continue to significantly decline across our drilling segments during the second fiscal quarter.
Following on some comments on each of our drilling segments. Our U.S. land drilling operations generated approximately $56 million in segment operating income during the first fiscal quarter. The number of quarterly revenue days declined by 11.5% as compared to the prior quarter resulting in an average of approximately 130 rigs generating revenue days during the first fiscal year -- pardon me, during the first fiscal quarter. On average, approximately 104 of these rigs were under our term contract and approximately 26 rigs were in the spot market.
Excluding the impact of early termination revenues, the average rig revenue per day slightly increased to the $26,234 in the first fiscal quarter and the average rig expense per day significantly decreased by $933 to $12,890, resulting in an average rig margin per day of $13,344 in the first fiscal quarter. The decline in the average rig expense per day was primarily a result of continued efforts to reduce field overhead cost and direct operating cost on active rigs. H&P managers and employees across our organization reserve the credit for these very challenging and significant efforts. 
Unfortunately, as I'll mention later -- as I'll also mentioned later, we expect the per day impact of these ongoing efforts to be offset during the second fiscal quarter as our activity levels continue to decline.
During the quarter, the segment generated approximately $29 million in revenues corresponding to early termination of long-term contracts. Given existing notifications for early terminations, we expect to generate over $78 million during the second fiscal quarter, about $77 million during the second half of fiscal 2016 and over $40 million thereafter in early termination revenues. Since the peak in late 2014, we have received early termination notification for a total of 77 rigs under long-term contracts in the segment, up 17 rigs since our last conference call in mid-November. Total early termination revenues related to these 77 contracts are now estimated at approximately $429 million, about $88 million of which corresponds to cash flow previously expected to be generated to normal operations during fiscal 2015, $166 million during fiscal 2016 and $175 million after that. As of today, our 347 available rigs in the U.S. land segment include approximately 121 rigs generating revenue and 226 idle rigs. Included in the 121 rigs generating revenue, are 93 rigs under term contracts, 87 of which are generating revenue days. In addition, 28 rigs are currently active in the spot market for a total of 115 rigs generating revenue days in the segment. Some raids that generate revenue days are on standby type rigs.
Rigs generating revenue and not generating revenue days include 6 new build rigs with deliveries that have been delayed and exchanged for compensation from customers.
Looking ahead to the second quarter of fiscal 2016, we expect revenue days to decrease by close to 20% quarter-to-quarter. Excluding the impact of revenues corresponding to early terminated long-term contracts, we expect our average rig revenue per day to be roughly flat. The average rig expense per day level is expected to increase to roughly $13,600. This expected increase is primarily attributable to the relatively large number of rigs becoming idle during the quarter and impacting total expenses, which are then allocated to a smaller number of expected revenue days. Subject to additional early terminations and excluding rigs for which we have received early termination notifications, the segment already has term contract commitments in place for an average of approximately 87 rigs during the second fiscal quarter, 79 rigs during the second half of fiscal 2016, 66 rigs during fiscal 2017 and 34 rigs during fiscal 2018.
The average pricing for these rigs that are already under term contract is expected to slightly increase and remain strong during the next several quarters as some rigs roll off and the remaining new builds are deployed. The average pricing for H&P rigs in the spot market declined by approximately 5% from last year's fourth fiscal quarter to the first quarter of fiscal 2016 and may continue to decline during the second fiscal quarter. Average spot pricing today is over 30% lower as compared to spot pricing at the peak last November.
Let me now transition to our offshore operations. Segment operating income declined to approximately $8 million from $13 million during the prior quarter. Total revenue days remain flat and the average rig margin per day declined from $13,296 to $7,920 per day during the first fiscal quarter. The decline was mostly attributable to expenses associated with 1 rig mobilizing from shore to a new platform, a second rig of moving from an operating rate to lower standby type day rate and some unexpected downtime during the first quarter. As we look at the second quarter of fiscal 2016, we expect revenue days to decline by 5% to 10% to slightly increase approximately $8,250 during the quarter.
The expected changes are primarily attributable to the full effect of the previously mentioned day rate changes during the first quarter, and 1 rig expected to be mobilized and stacked onshore during the quarter. Management contracts on platform rigs continues to contribute to our offshore segment operating income. Their contribution during the first fiscal quarter was approximately $6 million. Management contracts are expected to generate approximately $3 million during each of the remaining 3 quarters of fiscal 2016.
Moving on to our international land operations. This segment reported operating income of approximately $2 million during the first fiscal quarter, excluding a currency exchange loss of $8.5 million, which was primarily due to the devaluation of the Argentine peso during the quarter. As announced earlier today and starting this fiscal -- this first fiscal quarter, the company eliminated a legacy 1 month lag period between its U.S. fiscal year and its international operations fiscal years. In the past fiscal years for the international operations ended on August 31 instead of September 30 to facilitate reporting of consolidated returns -- sorry, it's the consolidated results. And required, the company applied the elimination of the one-month lag retrospectively to all presented in press release. The average rig margin per day increased sequentially from $8,129 to $11,811 per day excluding the impact of charges related to the allowance for counts during the fourth fiscal quarter. The increase was primarily a result of better-than-expected contribution from multiple rigs in different countries, including rigs that were working on relatively short-term contracts. Revenue days sequentially decreased to an average of 15.3 active rigs during the first fiscal quarter.
As of today, our international land segment have 14 active rigs including 10 in Argentina, 2 in the UAE, 1 in Columbia and 1 in Bahrain. All 14 active rates rigs are under long-term contracts. 24 rigs are idle including 9 in Argentina, 7 in Columbia, 6 in and 2 in Bahrain. We expect international land revenue days to be down 5% to 10% during the second quarter of fiscal 2016. The average rig margin per day is expected to decline to close to $7,500 per day and no early termination revenues are expected during the second fiscal quarter in this segment. The expected decline in average rig margin is primarily attributable to the reduction in activity and day rates of some of our contracted rigs from operating rates to standby type day rates.
Let me now comment on the corporate level details. Our strong liquidity position along with our firm backlog of long-term contracts and reduced CapEx requirements is expected to allow us to sustain our regular dividend dollar per share levels and our intent to is to continue with that plan. Capital expenditures for fiscal 2016 are still expected to be in the range of $300 million to $400 million. Our FlexRigs construction cadence plan remains generally the same with only a few contracted FlexRigs to be completed between now and the end of March 2016. Including these remaining long-term contracts and combining all 3 of our drilling segments, we have an average of approximately 104 rigs under term contract expected to be active in fiscal 2016, 81 in fiscal 2017 and 47 in fiscal 2018.
Given market conditions during the last several months and the early termination of additional long-term contracts, our backlog decreased from approximately $3.1 billion as of September 30, 2015, to approximately $2.7 billion as of December 31, 2015. As mentioned in the past, we expect our total annual depreciation expense for fiscal 2016 to be approximately $580 million, and our general and administrative expenses to be approximately $125 million. The effective income tax rate for the first quarter of fiscal 2016 was higher-than-expected, primarily as a result of adjustments related to the recent tax law changed extending bonus appreciation alliances that expired at the end of 2014.
We expect that effective tax rate for each of the remaining 3 quarters of fiscal 2016 to be in the range of 32% to 35%. With that, let me turn the call back to John."

And before opening the call to Q&A, I want to reiterate the challenging oil and gas market today that may be on par with the oil market in the 1980s. But there are key differences and one big difference is the age, size and capability of today's rig fleet. The AC drive rig replacement cycle of the legacy fleet is ongoing. At the peak of activity in 2014, approximately 41% of the fleet was AC drive. And today, over 63% of the active fleet is AC drive technology. The remaining fleet is legacy SCR and mechanical rigs, and the question remains what will be the marketable legacy fleet at the end of the downtown.

On the other hand, if you might recall in years past when we've had a transmission from 1 region to another region, whether it's from related to preference of price for oil as compared to gas and we have a lot of transition, that adds up to our cost and has typically an unfavorable impact on our average rig expense per day for the quarter.

When you consider the amount of footage that we drilled in a year-to-date compared to what we did 3 years ago, these rigs are working somewhat harder, that rig more times are much less frequent, you're spending less time moving, you're spending more time drilling. And you're using for example, much more frequently. So the fact that we've able to get our cost over time is pretty amazing.

Then if you also subtract other revenue that we -- that may relate to that rig, whether it's related to H&P trucking or whether it's related to other services, whether it's rentals, et cetera, then that number continues to go down. And it also depends on the region that you are in and the cost structure between regions, of course, as you know, it's significantly different. So I think, a fair assumption is that the cash cost directly associated with the rig and without any other ancillary revenues is significantly lower than our average rig expense per day. But then of course, you also have maintenance CapEx consideration that, of course, you'll probably included -- including conceptually on that cash cost question and that depends on the rig that you're looking at, if it's a new rig, your maintenance CapEx is much lower if you can imagine to unfold the rig, et cetera. So too many moving variables to give you an answer, but I think, it's a fair question and it's an important consideration in terms of pricing and competitive advantageous going forward, we think, we're very well positioned in that regard given uniformity of our fleet, the way that we maintain our rigs and several other considerations."

Unfortun",763,"Thank you, Juan Pablo, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today. Our first fiscal quarter results were better than expected, primarily as a result of significantly reduced daily rig expenses in our U.S. land segment. Unfortunately, U.S. land drilling activity has declined to levels not seen since 1999 as very low oil and gas prices are forcing customers to make further reductions in the drilling budgets. 
The tone in 2016 has shifted to lower for longer. The industry has idled over 1,400 rigs in the U.S. since the peak rig count in October of 2014, and it continues to decline. Of those 1,400 rigs that have been idled, approximately 900 are legacy SCR and mechanical rigs, and approximately 500 are AC drive rigs. The industry is experiencing dramatic reductions in personnel and investments. And clearly, a number of companies are struggling to survive.
We are unable to predict to the future, but perspective is necessary in both good and bad times. Recently, oil prices traded below $30 a barrel, and a few pundits see the possibility of $20 oil. We are predicting an immediate oil price improvement, but we do believe prices are below the level required to sustain a stable, let alone growing supply over a long period of time. In the meantime, the capabilities of the oilfield service providers are being reduced significantly. 
At some point, the question will be who is in the best position for the eventual return of drilling demand. We believe that we will be well positioned and that this is simply not a time for us to hunker down and wait for things to get better. While continuing to thoughtfully manage costs, we will prudently invest in opportunities that will enhance the key competitive advantages we have in the company.
Let me talk briefly about a few of those opportunities. Our fleet profile is a competitive advantage as the FlexRig design allows us to provide a family of solutions for our customers. For several years now, the industry has been trending toward longer laterals, multi-well pads, and generally, more complex for designs, which require AC drive rigs with 1,500-horsepower specifications. We have over 320 AC drive FlexRigs with 1,500-horsepower rating. And over 180 of those rigs are optimized for multi-well pad operations. And we continue to add 7,500 psi mud systems to a large portion of the fleet as well. 
The advanced fleet of FlexRigs, supported by our organizational capabilities, enables the company to remain laser focused on delivering wells safely, quickly and efficiently while continuing to innovate by providing technology solutions and enhancing our service offering.
Our strategy has been successful. Our market share in the U.S. has increased from 15% in 2014 to 18% today and has doubled since 2008. We will also continue to invest in the organizational capability that I just mentioned. This means enhancing our best-in-class reputation for service and the way we create value for our customers. 
While our organizational infrastructure has been built over the past 10 years, we continue to make investments to improve and deleverage the learnings we capture from the fleet on a daily basis. This allows us to partner more closely with the customer to provide greater efficiencies, reliability and safety. These improvements are all aimed at drilling the lowest-cost well for our customers and maximizing the number of wells customers can deliver in a budget year.
And finally, maintaining a strong balance sheet and a disciplined approach to cost management remain a company-wide priority. It is in times like these that the practice of maintaining a strong balance sheet becomes the key to future success. Along with this, it's having a balanced perspective on cost management, so that we're making prudent reductions that won't end up costing us more than the initial saving somewhere down the line. We're also rightsizing the organization along these same principles with the end goal of enhancing our performance and developing opportunities for future growth.
Before I turn the call back to Juan Pablo, clearly, the first quarter of our 2016 fiscal year has been a very challenging start to the year. We are fortunate to have a very strong and liquid balance sheet, a firm backlog of term contracts and the flexibility to significantly reduce spending levels during a soft market. Our approach to capital allocation will remain prudent and should allow us to effectively manage our business through this downturn and emerge from it with even greater competitive advantages. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Juan Pablo."
278341,321971962,922808,"Helmerich & Payne, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Jan 28, 2016",2016-01-28,"Earnings Calls","Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, John. The company reported $16 million in net income for the first quarter of fiscal 2016. Given the deterioration of market conditions since late 2014, the average quarterly level of drilling activity for the company has continued to decline,",1570,"Thank you, John. The company reported $16 million in net income for the first quarter of fiscal 2016. Given the deterioration of market conditions since late 2014, the average quarterly level of drilling activity for the company has continued to decline, down 53% from last year's first fiscal quarter and down 11% from last year's fourth fiscal quarter. Unfortunately, activity is expected to continue to significantly decline across our drilling segments during the second fiscal quarter.
Following are some comments on each of our drilling segments. Our U.S. land drilling operations generated approximately $56 million in segment operating income during the first fiscal quarter. The number of quarterly revenue days declined by 11.5% as compared to the prior quarter, resulting in an average of approximately 130 rigs generating revenue days during the first fiscal year -- pardon me, during the first fiscal quarter. On average, approximately 104 of these rigs were under term contracts, and approximately 26 rigs were in the spot market.
Excluding the impact of early termination revenues, the average rig revenue per day slightly increased to $26,234 in the first fiscal quarter. And the average rig expense per day significantly decreased by $933 to $12,890, resulting in an average rig margin per day of $13,344 in the first fiscal quarter. The decline in the average rig expense per day was primarily a result of continued efforts to reduce field overhead cost and direct operating cost on active rigs. 
H&P managers and employees across our organization reserve the credit for these very challenging and significant efforts.
Unfortunately, as I'll also mention later, we expect the per-day impact of these ongoing efforts to be offset during the second fiscal quarter as our activity levels continue to decline.
During the quarter, the segment generated approximately $29 million in revenues corresponding to early termination of long-term contracts. Given existing notifications for early terminations, we expect to generate over $78 million during the second fiscal quarter, about $77 million during the second half of fiscal 2016, and over $40 million thereafter in early termination revenues. 
Since the peak in late 2014, we have received early termination notifications for a total of 77 rigs under long-term contracts in the segment, up 17 rigs since our last conference call in mid-November. 
Total early termination revenues related to these 77 contracts are now estimated at approximately $429 million, about $88 million of which corresponds to cash flow previously expected to be generated through normal operations during fiscal 2015, $166 million during fiscal 2016, and $175 million after that. 
As of today, our 347 available rigs in the U.S. land segment include approximately 121 rigs generating revenue and 226 idle rigs. Included in the 121 rigs generating revenue are 93 rigs under term contracts, 87 of which are generating revenue days. In addition, 28 rigs are currently active in the spot market, for a total of 115 rigs generating revenue days in the segment. Some rigs that generate revenue days are on standby-type day rates.
Rigs generating revenue and not generating revenue days include 6 new build rigs with deliveries that have been delayed and exchanged for compensation from customers.
Looking ahead to the second quarter of fiscal 2016, we expect revenue days to decrease by close to 20% quarter-to-quarter. Excluding the impact of revenues corresponding to early terminated long-term contracts, we expect our average rig revenue per day to be roughly flat. The average rig expense per day level is expected to increase to roughly $13,600. This expected increase is primarily attributable to the relatively large number of rigs becoming idle during the quarter and impacting total expenses, which are then allocated to a smaller number of expected revenue days. 
Subject to additional early terminations and excluding rigs for which we have received early termination notifications, the segment already has term contract commitments in place for an average of approximately 87 rigs during the second fiscal quarter; 79 rigs during the second half of fiscal 2016; 66 rigs during fiscal 2017; and 34 rigs during fiscal 2018.
The average pricing for these rigs that are already under term contract is expected to slightly increase and remain strong during the next several quarters as some rigs roll off and the remaining new builds are deployed. 
The average pricing for H&P rigs in the spot market declined by approximately 5% from last year's fourth fiscal quarter to the first quarter of fiscal 2016 and may continue to decline during the second fiscal quarter. Average spot pricing today is over 30% lower as compared to spot pricing at the peak last November.
Let me now transition to our offshore operations. Segment operating income declined to approximately $8 million from $13 million during the prior quarter. Total revenue days remained flat, and the average rig margin per day declined from $13,296 to $7,920 per day during the first fiscal quarter. The decline was mostly attributable to expenses associated with one rig mobilizing from shore to a new platform, a second rig moving from an operating rate to lower standby-type day rate and some unexpected downtime during the first quarter. 
As we look at the second quarter of fiscal 2016, we expect revenue days to decline by 5% to 10% and the average rig margin per day to slightly increase approximately to $8,250 during the quarter.
The expected changes are primarily attributable to the full effect of the previously mentioned day rate changes during the first quarter and one rig expected to be demobilized and stacked onshore during the quarter. 
Management contracts from platform rigs continue to contribute to our offshore segment operating income. Their contribution during the first fiscal quarter was approximately $6 million. Management contracts are expected to generate approximately $3 million during each of the remaining 3 quarters of fiscal 2016.
Moving on to our international land operations. This segment reported operating income of approximately $2 million during the first fiscal quarter, excluding a currency exchange loss of $8.5 million, which was primarily due to the devaluation of the Argentine peso during the quarter. 
As announced earlier today and starting this fiscal -- this first fiscal quarter, the company eliminated a legacy 1-month lag period between its U.S. fiscal year and its international operations' fiscal years. And the past fiscal years for the international operations ended on August 31 instead of September 30 to facilitate reporting of consolidated returns -- that is of consolidated results. 
As required, the company applied the elimination of the 1-month lag retrospectively to all periods presented in today's press release. The average rig margin per day increased sequentially from $8,129 to $11,811 per day, excluding the impact of charges related to the allowance for doubtful accounts during the fourth fiscal quarter. The increase was primarily a result of better-than-expected contribution from multiple rigs in different countries, including rigs that were working on relatively short-term contracts. Revenue days sequentially decreased to an average of 15.3 active rigs during the first fiscal quarter.
As of today, our international land segment have 14 active rigs, including 10 in Argentina, 2 in the UAE, 1 in Columbia and 1 in Bahrain. All 14 active rigs are under long-term contracts. 24 rigs are idle, including 9 in Argentina, 7 in Columbia, 6 in Ecuador and 2 in Bahrain. 
We expect international land quarterly revenue days to be down 5% to 10% during the second quarter of fiscal 2016. The average rig margin per day is expected to decline to close to $7,500 per day, and no early termination revenues are expected during the second fiscal quarter in the segment. The expected decline in average rig margin is primarily attributable to the reduction in activity and to day rates for some of our contracted rigs moving from operating rates to standby-type day rates.
Let me now comment on the corporate-level details. Our strong liquidity position, along with our firm backlog of long-term contracts and reduced CapEx requirement, is expected to allow us to sustain our regular dividend dollar-per-share levels, and our intent to is to continue with that plan. 
Capital expenditures for fiscal 2016 are still expected to be in the range of $300 million to $400 million. Our FlexRig construction cadence plan remains generally the same, with only a few contracted FlexRigs to be completed between now and the end of March of 2016. 
Including these remaining long-term contracts and combining all 3 of our drilling segments, we have an average of approximately 104 rigs under termed contracts expected to be active in fiscal 2016, 81 in fiscal 2017 and 47 in fiscal 2018.
Given market conditions during the last several months and the early termination of additional long-term contracts, our backlog decreased from approximately $3.1 billion as of September 30, 2015, to approximately $2.7 billion as of December 31, 2015. As mentioned in the past, we expect our total annual depreciation expense for fiscal 2016 to be approximately $580 million, and our general and administrative expenses to be approximately $135 million. The effective income tax rate for the first quarter of fiscal 2016 was higher than expected, primarily as a result of adjustments related to the recent tax law change extending bonus appreciation allowances that expired at the end of 2014. We expect that effective tax rate for each of the remaining 3 quarters of fiscal 2016 to be in the range of 32% to 35%. 
With that, let me turn the call back to John."

And before opening the call to Q&A, I want to reiterate the challenging oil and gas market today that may be on par with the oil market in the 1980s. But there are key differences, and one big difference is the age, size and capability of today's rig fleet. The AC drive rig replacement cycle of the legacy fleet is ongoing. At the peak of activity in 2014, approximately 41% of the fleet was AC drive. And today, over 63% of the active fleet is AC drive technology. The remaining fleet is legacy SCR and mechanical rigs. And the question remains, what will be the marketable legacy fleet at the end of the downturn? We believe it will be a very small portion of the marketable fleet, and those rigs will have a very difficult time competing in the world of complex, unconventional horizontal wells. 
And we will now open the call for questions, Keith."

However, we -- going forward, it all depends on the number of idle rigs and active rigs and the corresponding proportion, of course. In terms of how many idle rigs we will have, that will be subject to some small level of fixed expenses that will impact the total expenses that will then be allocated only among the very smaller or relatively small number of revenue days. As that denominator gets smaller, it just has an impact on the total average. And that's what we see happening the following quarter. But I think your point is a good one that in general, we've made great strides as an organization to continue to reduce the average expense per active rig.

On the other hand, you might recall in years past, when we've had a transition from one region to another region, whether it's from -- related to preference of price for oil as compared to gas, and we have a lot of transition, that adds up to our cost and has typically an unfavorable impact on our average rig expense per day for the quarter.

So the wells we're drilling today are nothing like the wells we drilled 2 years ago. So when you look at our cost trends over time -- Juan Pablo said that our folks have done a great job. But when you consider the amount of footage that we drilled in a year-to-date compared to what we did 3 years ago, these rigs are working so much harder. The rig move times are much less frequent. You're spending less time moving. You're spending more time drilling. So you're using expendables, as an example, much more frequently. So the fact that we've able to get our costs down over time is pretty amazing.

That's a very fair question because it goes to the heart of some of the moving considerations or variables related to our total average expense per day. Some of those expenses relate to rigs that are not active. So if you were talking only about active rigs, then the number would be lower. Then if you also subtract other revenue that we -- that may relate to that rig, whether it's related to H&P trucking or whether it's related to other services, whether it's rentals, et cetera, then that number continues to go down. And it also depends on the region that you are in. And the cost structure between regions, of course, as you know, is significantly different. So I think a fair assumption is that the cash cost directly associated with the rig, and without any other ancillary revenues, is significantly lower than our average rig expense per day. But then of course, you also have maintenance CapEx considerations, that, of course, you'll probably included -- including conceptually in that cash cost question. And that depends on the rig that you're looking at. If it's a new rig, your maintenance CapEx will be much lower, as you can imagine, as compared to an older rig, et cetera. So too many moving variables to give you an answer, but I think it's a fair question, and it's an important consideration in terms of pricing and competitive advantages going forward. We think we're very well positioned in that regard, given the uniformity of our fleet, the way that we maintain our rigs and several other considerations."

Unfortun",762,"Thank you, Juan Pablo, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today. Our first fiscal quarter results were better than expected, primarily as a result of significantly reduced daily rig expenses in our U.S. land segment. Unfortunately, U.S. land drilling activity has declined to levels not seen since 1999 as very low oil and gas prices are forcing customers to make further reductions in their drilling budgets. 
The tone in 2016 has shifted to lower for longer. The industry has idled over 1,400 rigs in the U.S. since the peak rig count in October of 2014, and it continues to decline. Of those 1,400 rigs that have been idled, approximately 900 are legacy SCR and mechanical rigs, and approximately 500 are AC drive rigs. The industry is experiencing dramatic reductions in personnel and investments. And clearly, a number of companies are struggling to survive.
We are unable to predict the future, but perspective is necessary in both good and bad times. Recently, oil prices traded below $30 a barrel, and a few pundits see the possibility of $20 oil. We are predicting an immediate oil price improvement, but we do believe prices are below the level required to sustain a stable, let alone growing supply over a long period of time. In the meantime, the capabilities of the oilfield service providers are being reduced significantly. 
At some point, the question will be who is in the best position for the eventual return of drilling demand. We believe that we will be well positioned and that this is simply not a time for us to hunker down and wait for things to get better. While continuing to thoughtfully manage costs, we will prudently invest in opportunities that will enhance the key competitive advantages we have as a company.
Let me talk briefly about a few of those opportunities. Our fleet profile is a competitive advantage as the FlexRig design allows us to provide a family of solutions for our customers. For several years now, the industry has been trending toward longer laterals, multi-well pads, and generally, more complex well designs, which require AC drive rigs with 1,500-horsepower specifications. We have over 320 AC drive FlexRigs with 1,500-horsepower rating. And over 180 of those rigs are optimized for multi-well pad operations. And we continue to add 7,500 psi mud systems to a large portion of the fleet as well. 
The advanced fleet of FlexRigs, supported by our organizational capabilities, enables the company to remain laser focused on delivering wells safely, quickly and efficiently while continuing to innovate by providing technology solutions and enhancing our service offering.
Our strategy has been successful. Our market share in the U.S. has increased from 15% in 2014 to 18% today and has doubled since 2008. We will also continue to invest in the organizational capability that I just mentioned. This means enhancing our best-in-class reputation for service and the way we create value for our customers. 
While our organizational infrastructure has been built over the past 10 years, we continue to make investments to improve and deleverage the learnings we capture from the fleet on a daily basis. This allows us to partner more closely with the customer to provide greater efficiencies, reliability and safety. These improvements are all aimed at drilling the lowest-cost well for our customers and maximizing the number of wells customers can deliver in a budget year.
And finally, maintaining a strong balance sheet and a disciplined approach to cost management remain a company-wide priority. It is in times like these that the practice of maintaining a strong balance sheet becomes the key to future success. Along with this, it's having a balanced perspective on cost management, so that we're making prudent reductions that won't end up costing us more than the initial savings somewhere down the line. We're also rightsizing the organization along these same principles with the end goal of enhancing our performance and developing opportunities for future growth.
Before I turn the call back to Juan Pablo, clearly, the first quarter of our 2016 fiscal year has been a very challenging start to the year. We are fortunate to have a very strong and liquid balance sheet, a firm backlog of term contracts and the flexibility to significantly reduce spending levels during a soft market. Our approach to capital allocation will remain prudent and should allow us to effectively manage our business through this downturn and emerge from it with even greater competitive advantages. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Juan Pablo."
278341,321971962,923043,"Helmerich & Payne, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Jan 28, 2016",2016-01-28,"Earnings Calls","Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, John. The company reported $16 million in net income for the first quarter of fiscal 2016. Given the deterioration of market conditions since late 2014, the average quarterly level of drilling activity for the company has continued to decline,",1570,"Thank you, John. The company reported $16 million in net income for the first quarter of fiscal 2016. Given the deterioration of market conditions since late 2014, the average quarterly level of drilling activity for the company has continued to decline, down 53% from last year's first fiscal quarter and down 11% from last year's fourth fiscal quarter. Unfortunately, activity is expected to continue to significantly decline across our drilling segments during the second fiscal quarter.
Following are some comments on each of our drilling segments. Our U.S. land drilling operations generated approximately $56 million in segment operating income during the first fiscal quarter. The number of quarterly revenue days declined by 11.5% as compared to the prior quarter, resulting in an average of approximately 130 rigs generating revenue days during the first fiscal year -- pardon me, during the first fiscal quarter. On average, approximately 104 of these rigs were under term contracts, and approximately 26 rigs worked in the spot market.
Excluding the impact of early termination revenues, the average rig revenue per day slightly increased to $26,234 in the first fiscal quarter. And the average rig expense per day significantly decreased by $933 to $12,890, resulting in an average rig margin per day of $13,344 in the first fiscal quarter. The decline in the average rig expense per day was primarily a result of continued efforts to reduce field overhead cost and direct operating cost on active rigs. 
H&P managers and employees across our organization deserve the credit for these very challenging and significant efforts.
Unfortunately, as I'll also mention later, we expect the per-day impact of these ongoing efforts to be offset during the second fiscal quarter as our activity levels continue to decline.
During the quarter, the segment generated approximately $29 million in revenues corresponding to early termination of long-term contracts. Given existing notifications for early terminations, we expect to generate over $78 million during the second fiscal quarter, about $77 million during the second half of fiscal 2016, and over $40 million thereafter in early termination revenues. 
Since the peak in late 2014, we have received early termination notifications for a total of 77 rigs under long-term contracts in the segment, up 17 rigs since our last conference call in mid-November. 
Total early termination revenues related to these 77 contracts are now estimated at approximately $429 million, about $88 million of which correspond to cash flow previously expected to be generated through normal operations during fiscal 2015, $166 million during fiscal 2016, and $175 million after that. 
As of today, our 347 available rigs in the U.S. land segment include approximately 121 rigs generating revenue and 226 idle rigs. Included in the 121 rigs generating revenue are 93 rigs under term contracts, 87 of which are generating revenue days. In addition, 28 rigs are currently active in the spot market, for a total of 115 rigs generating revenue days in the segment. Some rigs that generate revenue days are on standby-type day rates.
Rigs generating revenue and not generating revenue days include 6 new build rigs with deliveries that have been delayed in exchange for compensation from customers.
Looking ahead to the second quarter of fiscal 2016, we expect revenue days to decrease by close to 20% quarter-to-quarter. Excluding the impact of revenues corresponding to early-terminated long-term contracts, we expect our average rig revenue per day to be roughly flat. The average rig expense per day level is expected to increase to roughly $13,600. This expected increase is primarily attributable to the relatively large number of rigs becoming idle during the quarter and impacting total expenses, which are then allocated to a smaller number of expected revenue days. 
Subject to additional early terminations and excluding rigs for which we have received early termination notifications, the segment already has term contract commitments in place for an average of approximately 87 rigs during the second fiscal quarter; 79 rigs during the second half of fiscal 2016; 66 rigs during fiscal 2017; and 34 rigs during fiscal 2018.
The average pricing for these rigs that are already under term contract is expected to slightly increase and remain strong during the next several quarters as some rigs roll off and the remaining new builds are deployed. 
The average pricing for H&P rigs in the spot market declined by approximately 5% from last year's fourth fiscal quarter to the first quarter of fiscal 2016 and may continue to decline during the second fiscal quarter. Average spot pricing today is over 30% lower as compared to spot pricing at the peak last November.
Let me now transition to our offshore operations. Segment operating income declined to approximately $8 million from $13 million during the prior quarter. Total revenue days remained flat, and the average rig margin per day declined from $13,296 to $7,920 per day during the first fiscal quarter. The decline was mostly attributable to expenses associated with one rig mobilizing from shore to a new platform, a second rig moving from an operating rate to a lower standby-type day rate and some unexpected downtime during the first quarter. 
As we look at the second quarter of fiscal 2016, we expect revenue days to decline by 5% to 10% and the average rig margin per day to slightly increase to approximately $8,250 during the quarter.
The expected changes are primarily attributable to the full effect of the previously mentioned day rate changes during the first quarter and one rig expected to be demobilized and stacked onshore during the quarter. 
Management contracts on platform rigs continue to contribute to our offshore segment operating income. Their contribution during the first fiscal quarter was approximately $6 million. Management contracts are expected to generate approximately $3 million during each of the remaining 3 quarters of fiscal 2016.
Moving on to our international land operations. This segment reported operating income of approximately $2 million during the first fiscal quarter, excluding a currency exchange loss of $8.5 million, which was primarily due to the devaluation of the Argentine peso during the quarter. 
As announced earlier today and starting this fiscal -- this first fiscal quarter, the company eliminated a legacy 1-month lag period between its U.S. fiscal year and its international operations' fiscal years. In the past, fiscal years for the international operations ended on August 31 instead of September 30 to facilitate reporting of consolidated returns -- that is of consolidated results. 
As required, the company applied the elimination of the 1-month lag retrospectively to all periods presented in today's press release. The average rig margin per day increased sequentially from $8,129 to $11,811 per day, excluding the impact of charges related to the allowance for doubtful accounts during the fourth fiscal quarter. The increase was primarily a result of better-than-expected contribution from multiple rigs in different countries, including rigs that were working on relatively short-term contracts. Revenue days sequentially decreased to an average of 15.3 active rigs during the first fiscal quarter.
As of today, our international land segment has 14 active rigs, including 10 in Argentina, 2 in the UAE, 1 in Columbia and 1 in Bahrain. All 14 active rigs are under long-term contracts. 24 rigs are idle, including 9 in Argentina, 7 in Columbia, 6 in Ecuador and 2 in Bahrain. 
We expect international land quarterly revenue days to be down 5% to 10% during the second quarter of fiscal 2016. The average rig margin per day is expected to decline to close to $7,500 per day, and no early termination revenues are expected during the second fiscal quarter in the segment. The expected decline in average rig margin is primarily attributable to the reduction in activity and to day rates for some of our contracted rigs moving from operating rates to standby-type day rates.
Let me now comment on the corporate-level details. Our strong liquidity position, along with our firm backlog of long-term contracts and reduced CapEx requirement, is expected to allow us to sustain our regular dividend dollar-per-share levels, and our intent to is to continue with that plan. 
Capital expenditures for fiscal 2016 are still expected to be in the range of $300 million to $400 million. Our FlexRig construction cadence plan remains generally the same, with only a few contracted FlexRigs to be completed between now and the end of March of 2016. 
Including these remaining long-term contracts and combining all 3 of our drilling segments, we have an average of approximately 104 rigs under term contracts expected to be active in fiscal 2016, 81 in fiscal 2017 and 47 in fiscal 2018.
Given market conditions during the last several months and the early termination of additional long-term contracts, our backlog decreased from approximately $3.1 billion as of September 30, 2015, to approximately $2.7 billion as of December 31, 2015. As mentioned in the past, we expect our total annual depreciation expense for fiscal 2016 to be approximately $580 million, and our general and administrative expenses to be approximately $135 million. The effective income tax rate for the first quarter of fiscal 2016 was higher than expected, primarily as a result of adjustments related to the recent tax law change extending bonus depreciation allowances that expired at the end of 2014. We expect that effective tax rate for each of the remaining 3 quarters of fiscal 2016 to be in the range of 32% to 35%. 
With that, let me turn the call back to John."

And before opening the call to Q&A, I want to reiterate the challenging oil and gas market today that may be on par with the oil market in the 1980s. But there are key differences, and one big difference is the age, size and capability of today's rig fleet. The AC drive rig replacement cycle of the legacy fleet is ongoing. At the peak of activity in 2014, approximately 41% of the fleet was AC drive. And today, over 63% of the active fleet is AC drive technology. The remaining fleet is legacy SCR and mechanical rigs. And the question remains, what will be the marketable legacy fleet at the end of the downturn? We believe it will be a very small portion of the marketable fleet, and those rigs will have a very difficult time competing in the world of complex, unconventional horizontal wells. 
And we will now open the call for questions, Keith."

But it almost sounds as though you've gotten that average rig expense per day for a typical FlexRig down to maybe a lower sustainable level. So again, I hear the March quarter guidance on the cost front. But is it fair to think that you've gotten that normalized cost down if you were to back out any costs associated with the rigs that will be laid down in the March quarter? I'm just trying to think about how that flows as we get deeper into this fiscal year and beyond."

However, we -- going forward, it all depends on the number of idle rigs and active rigs and the corresponding proportion, of course. In terms of how many idle rigs we will have, that will be subject to some small level of fixed expenses that will impact the total expenses that will then be allocated only among a very small or relatively small number of revenue days. As that denominator gets smaller, it just has an impact on the total average. And that's what we see happening the following quarter. But I think your point is a good one that in general, we've made great strides as an organization to continue to reduce the average expense per active rig. It's just that the inactive ones are creating some volatility."

On the other hand, you might recall in years past, when we've had a transition from one region to another region, whether it's from -- related to preference of price for oil as compared to gas, and we have a lot of transition, that adds up to our cost and has typically an unfavorable impact on our average rig expense per day for the quarter. That's what we see happening in the second fiscal quarter.

But when you consider the amount of footage that we drill in a year today compared to what we did 3 years ago, these rigs are working so much harder. The rig move times are much less frequent. You're spending less time moving. You're spending more time drilling. So you're using expendables, as an example, much more frequently. So the fact that we've able to get our costs down over time is pretty amazing.

We continue to believe that international has some real upside for us. You've probably heard us say for a long time now that when unconventional resource plays become more popular, become more economic, if you will, internationally, that gosh, we ought to be in a position to take advantage of that opportunity. Obviously, the work in Argentina is really the first kind of large-scale, unconventional resource play opportunity, and we have more market share there than anybody else. So I think it presents some great opportunities in the future. We've worked internationally for over 50 years. We have a lot of experience, and of course, we have a lot more we can learn. We know we can do better. So it is a desire of the company to continue to try to grow our footprint internationally. And obviously, we have the assets and the personnel to make that happen."

That's a very fair question because it goes to the heart of some of the moving considerations or variables related to our total average expense per day. Some of those expenses relate to rigs that are not active. So if you were talking only about active rigs, then the number would be lower. Then if you also subtract other revenue that we -- that may relate to that rig, whether it's related to H&P trucking or whether it's related to other services, whether it's rentals, et cetera, then that number continues to go down. And it also depends on the region that you are in. And the cost structure between regions, of course, as you know, is significantly different. So I think a fair assumption is that the cash cost directly associated with the rig, and without any other ancillary revenues, is significantly lower than our average rig expense per day. But then of course, you also have maintenance CapEx considerations, that, of course, you're probably included -- including conceptually in that cash cost question. And that depends on the rig that you're looking at. If it's a new rig, your maintenance CapEx will be much lower, as you can imagine, as compared to an older rig, et cetera. So too many moving variables to give you an answer, but I think it's a fair question, and it's an important consideration in terms of pricing and competitive advantages going forward. We think we're very well positioned in that regard, given the uniformity of our fleet, the way that we maintain our rigs and several other considerations."

Thank you for joining us on the call today. Our first fiscal quarter results were better than expected, primarily as a result of significantly reduced daily rig expenses in our U.S. land segment. Unfortun",762,"Thank you, Juan Pablo, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today. Our first fiscal quarter results were better than expected, primarily as a result of significantly reduced daily rig expenses in our U.S. land segment. Unfortunately, U.S. land drilling activity has declined to levels not seen since 1999 as very low oil and gas prices are forcing customers to make further reductions in their drilling budgets. 
The tone in 2016 has shifted to lower for longer. The industry has idled over 1,400 rigs in the U.S. since the peak rig count in October of 2014, and it continues to decline. Of those 1,400 rigs that have been idled, approximately 900 are legacy SCR and mechanical rigs, and approximately 500 are AC drive rigs. The industry is experiencing dramatic reductions in personnel and investments. And clearly, a number of companies are struggling to survive.
We are unable to predict the future, but perspective is necessary in both good and bad times. Recently, oil prices traded below $30 a barrel, and a few pundits see the possibility of $20 oil. We are predicting an immediate oil price improvement, but we do believe prices are below the level required to sustain a stable, let alone growing supply over a long period of time. In the meantime, the capabilities of the oilfield service providers are being reduced significantly. 
At some point, the question will be who is in the best position for the eventual return of drilling demand. We believe that we will be well positioned and that this is simply not a time for us to hunker down and wait for things to get better. While continuing to thoughtfully manage costs, we will prudently invest in opportunities that will enhance the key competitive advantages we have as a company.
Let me talk briefly about a few of those opportunities. Our fleet profile is a competitive advantage as the FlexRig design allows us to provide a family of solutions for our customers. For several years now, the industry has been trending toward longer laterals, multi-well pads, and generally, more complex well designs, which require AC drive rigs with 1,500-horsepower specifications. We have over 320 AC drive FlexRigs with 1,500-horsepower rating. And over 180 of those rigs are optimized for multi-well pad operations. And we continue to add 7,500 psi mud systems to a large portion of the fleet as well. 
The advanced fleet of FlexRigs, supported by our organizational capabilities, enables the company to remain laser focused on delivering wells safely, quickly and efficiently while continuing to innovate by providing technology solutions and enhancing our service offering.
Our strategy has been successful. Our market share in the U.S. has increased from 15% in 2014 to 18% today and has doubled since 2008. We will also continue to invest in the organizational capability that I just mentioned. This means enhancing our best-in-class reputation for service and the way we create value for our customers. 
While our organizational infrastructure has been built over the past 10 years, we continue to make investments to improve and deleverage the learnings we capture from the fleet on a daily basis. This allows us to partner more closely with the customer to provide greater efficiencies, reliability and safety. These improvements are all aimed at drilling the lowest-cost well for our customers and maximizing the number of wells customers can deliver in a budget year.
And finally, maintaining a strong balance sheet and a disciplined approach to cost management remain a company-wide priority. It is in times like these that the practice of maintaining a strong balance sheet becomes the key to future success. Along with this, it's having a balanced perspective on cost management, so that we're making prudent reductions that won't end up costing us more than the initial savings somewhere down the line. We're also rightsizing the organization along these same principles with the end goal of enhancing our performance and developing opportunities for future growth.
Before I turn the call back to Juan Pablo, clearly, the first quarter of our 2016 fiscal year has been a very challenging start to the year. We are fortunate to have a very strong and liquid balance sheet, a firm backlog of term contracts and the flexibility to significantly reduce spending levels during a soft market. Our approach to capital allocation will remain prudent and should allow us to effectively manage our business through this downturn and emerge from it with even greater competitive advantages. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Juan Pablo."
278341,321971962,923374,"Helmerich & Payne, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Jan 28, 2016",2016-01-28,"Earnings Calls","Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, John. The company reported $16 million in net income for the first quarter of fiscal 2016. Given the deterioration of market conditions since late 2014, the average quarterly level of drilling activity for the company has continued to decline,",1569,"Thank you, John. The company reported $16 million in net income for the first quarter of fiscal 2016. Given the deterioration of market conditions since late 2014, the average quarterly level of drilling activity for the company has continued to decline, down 53% from last year's first fiscal quarter and down 11% from last year's fourth fiscal quarter. Unfortunately, activity is expected to continue to significantly decline across our drilling segments during the second fiscal quarter.
Following are some comments on each of our drilling segments. Our U.S. land drilling operations generated approximately $56 million in segment operating income during the first fiscal quarter. The number of quarterly revenue days declined by 11.5% as compared to the prior quarter, resulting in an average of approximately 130 rigs generating revenue days during the first fiscal year -- pardon me, during the first fiscal quarter. On average, approximately 104 of these rigs were under term contracts, and approximately 26 rigs worked in the spot market.
Excluding the impact of early termination revenues, the average rig revenue per day slightly increased to $26,234 in the first fiscal quarter. And the average rig expense per day significantly decreased by $933 to $12,890, resulting in an average rig margin per day of $13,344 in the first fiscal quarter. The decline in the average rig expense per day was primarily a result of continued efforts to reduce field overhead cost and direct operating cost on active rigs. 
H&P managers and employees across our organization deserve the credit for these very challenging and significant efforts.
Unfortunately, as I'll also mention later, we expect the per-day impact of these ongoing efforts to be offset during the second fiscal quarter as our activity levels continue to decline.
During the quarter, the segment generated approximately $29 million in revenues corresponding to early termination of long-term contracts. Given existing notifications for early terminations, we expect to generate over $78 million during the second fiscal quarter, about $77 million during the second half of fiscal 2016, and over $40 million thereafter in early termination revenues. 
Since the peak in late 2014, we have received early termination notifications for a total of 77 rigs under long-term contracts in the segment, up 17 rigs since our last conference call in mid-November. 
Total early termination revenues related to these 77 contracts are now estimated at approximately $429 million, about $88 million of which correspond to cash flow previously expected to be generated through normal operations during fiscal 2015, $166 million during fiscal 2016, and $175 million after that. 
As of today, our 347 available rigs in the U.S. land segment include approximately 121 rigs generating revenue and 226 idle rigs. Included in the 121 rigs generating revenue are 93 rigs under term contracts, 87 of which are generating revenue days. In addition, 28 rigs are currently active in the spot market, for a total of 115 rigs generating revenue days in the segment. Some rigs that generate revenue days are on standby-type day rates.
Rigs generating revenue and not generating revenue days include 6 new build rigs with deliveries that have been delayed in exchange for compensation from customers.
Looking ahead to the second quarter of fiscal 2016, we expect revenue days to decrease by close to 20% quarter-to-quarter. Excluding the impact of revenues corresponding to early-terminated long-term contracts, we expect our average rig revenue per day to be roughly flat. The average rig expense per day level is expected to increase to roughly $13,600. This expected increase is primarily attributable to the relatively large number of rigs becoming idle during the quarter and impacting total expenses, which are then allocated to a smaller number of expected revenue days. 
Subject to additional early terminations and excluding rigs for which we have received early termination notifications, the segment already has term contract commitments in place for an average of approximately 87 rigs during the second fiscal quarter; 79 rigs during the second half of fiscal 2016; 66 rigs during fiscal 2017; and 34 rigs during fiscal 2018.
The average pricing for these rigs that are already under term contract is expected to slightly increase and remain strong during the next several quarters as some rigs roll off and the remaining new builds are deployed. 
The average pricing for H&P rigs in the spot market declined by approximately 5% from last year's fourth fiscal quarter to the first quarter of fiscal 2016 and may continue to decline during the second fiscal quarter. Average spot pricing today is over 30% lower as compared to spot pricing at the peak last November.
Let me now transition to our offshore operations. Segment operating income declined to approximately $8 million from $13 million during the prior quarter. Total revenue days remained flat, and the average rig margin per day declined from $13,296 to $7,920 per day during the first fiscal quarter. The decline was mostly attributable to expenses associated with one rig mobilizing from shore to a new platform, a second rig moving from an operating rate to a lower standby-type day rate and some unexpected downtime during the first quarter. 
As we look at the second quarter of fiscal 2016, we expect revenue days to decline by 5% to 10% and the average rig margin per day to slightly increase to approximately $8,250 during the quarter.
The expected changes are primarily attributable to the full effect of the previously mentioned day rate changes during the first quarter and one rig expected to be demobilized and stacked onshore during the quarter. 
Management contracts on platform rigs continue to contribute to our offshore segment operating income. Their contribution during the first fiscal quarter was approximately $6 million. Management contracts are expected to generate approximately $3 million during each of the remaining 3 quarters of fiscal 2016.
Moving on to our international land operations. This segment reported operating income of approximately $2 million during the first fiscal quarter, excluding a currency exchange loss of $8.5 million, which was primarily due to the devaluation of the Argentine peso during the quarter. 
As announced earlier today and starting this fiscal -- this first fiscal quarter, the company eliminated a legacy 1-month lag period between its U.S. fiscal year and its international operations' fiscal years. In the past, fiscal years for the international operations ended on August 31 instead of September 30 to facilitate reporting of consolidated returns -- that is of consolidated results. 
As required, the company applied the elimination of the 1-month lag retrospectively to all periods presented in today's press release. The average rig margin per day increased sequentially from $8,129 to $11,811 per day, excluding the impact of charges related to the allowance for doubtful accounts during the fourth fiscal quarter. The increase was primarily a result of better-than-expected contribution from multiple rigs in different countries, including rigs that were working on relatively short-term contracts. Revenue days sequentially decreased to an average of 15.3 active rigs during the first fiscal quarter.
As of today, our international land segment has 14 active rigs, including 10 in Argentina, 2 in the UAE, 1 in Columbia and 1 in Bahrain. All 14 active rigs are under long-term contracts. 24 rigs are idle, including 9 in Argentina, 7 in Columbia, 6 in Ecuador and 2 in Bahrain. 
We expect international land quarterly revenue days to be down 5% to 10% during the second quarter of fiscal 2016. The average rig margin per day is expected to decline to close to $7,500 per day, and no early termination revenues are expected during the second fiscal quarter in the segment. The expected decline in average rig margin is primarily attributable to the reduction in activity and to day rates for some of our contracted rigs moving from operating rates to standby-type day rates.
Let me now comment on the corporate-level details. Our strong liquidity position, along with our firm backlog of long-term contracts and reduced CapEx requirement, is expected to allow us to sustain our regular dividend dollar-per-share levels, and our intent is to continue with that plan. 
Capital expenditures for fiscal 2016 are still expected to be in the range of $300 million to $400 million. Our FlexRig construction cadence plan remains generally the same, with only a few contracted FlexRigs to be completed between now and the end of March of 2016. 
Including these remaining long-term contracts and combining all 3 of our drilling segments, we have an average of approximately 104 rigs under term contracts expected to be active in fiscal 2016, 81 in fiscal 2017 and 47 in fiscal 2018.
Given market conditions during the last several months and the early termination of additional long-term contracts, our backlog decreased from approximately $3.1 billion as of September 30, 2015, to approximately $2.7 billion as of December 31, 2015. As mentioned in the past, we expect our total annual depreciation expense for fiscal 2016 to be approximately $580 million, and our general and administrative expenses to be approximately $135 million. The effective income tax rate for the first quarter of fiscal 2016 was higher than expected, primarily as a result of adjustments related to the recent tax law change extending bonus depreciation allowances that expired at the end of 2014. We expect that effective tax rate for each of the remaining 3 quarters of fiscal 2016 to be in the range of 32% to 35%. 
With that, let me turn the call back to John."

And before opening the call to Q&A, I want to reiterate the challenging oil and gas market today that may be on par with the oil market in the 1980s. But there are key differences, and one big difference is the age, size and capability of today's rig fleet. The AC drive rig replacement cycle of the legacy fleet is ongoing. At the peak of activity in 2014, approximately 41% of the fleet was AC drive. And today, over 63% of the active fleet is AC drive technology. The remaining fleet is legacy SCR and mechanical rigs. And the question remains, what will be the marketable legacy fleet at the end of the downturn? We believe it will be a very small portion of the marketable fleet, and those rigs will have a very difficult time competing in the world of complex, unconventional horizontal wells. 
And we will now open the call for questions, Keith."

But it almost sounds as though you've gotten that average rig expense per day for a typical FlexRig down to maybe a lower sustainable level. So again, I hear the March quarter guidance on the cost front. But is it fair to think that you've gotten that normalized cost down if you were to back out any costs associated with the rigs that will be laid down in the March quarter? I'm just trying to think about how that flows as we get deeper into this fiscal year and beyond."

However, we -- going forward, it all depends on the number of idle rigs and active rigs and the corresponding proportion, of course. In terms of how many idle rigs we will have, that will be subject to some small level of fixed expenses that will impact the total expenses that will then be allocated only among a very small or relatively small number of revenue days. As that denominator gets smaller, it just has an impact on the total average. And that's what we see happening the following quarter. But I think your point is a good one that in general, we've made great strides as an organization to continue to reduce the average expense per active rig. It's just that the inactive ones are creating some volatility."

On the other hand, you might recall in years past, when we've had a transition from one region to another region, whether it's from -- related to preference of price for oil as compared to gas, and we have a lot of transition, that adds up to our cost and has typically an unfavorable impact on our average rig expense per day for the quarter. That's what we see happening in the second fiscal quarter.

But when you consider the amount of footage that we drill in a year today compared to what we did 3 years ago, these rigs are working so much harder. The rig move times are much less frequent. You're spending less time moving. You're spending more time drilling. So you're using expendables, as an example, much more frequently.

So I think it presents some great opportunities in the future. We've worked internationally for over 50 years. We have a lot of experience, and of course, we have a lot more we can learn. We know we can do better. So it is a desire of the company to continue to try to grow our footprint internationally. And obviously, we have the assets and the personnel to make that happen."

That's a very fair question because it goes to the heart of some of the moving considerations or variables related to our total average expense per day.

Then if you also subtract other revenue that we -- that may relate to that rig, whether it's related to H&P trucking or whether it's related to other services, whether it's rentals, et cetera, then that number continues to go down. And it also depends on the region that you are in. And the cost structure between regions, of course, as you know, is significantly different. So I think a fair assumption is that the cash cost directly associated with the rig, and without any other ancillary revenues, is significantly lower than our average rig expense per day. But then of course, you also have maintenance CapEx considerations, that, of course, you're probably included -- including conceptually in that cash cost question. And that depends on the rig that you're looking at. If it's a new rig, your maintenance CapEx will be much lower, as you can imagine, as compared to an older rig, et cetera. So too many moving variables to give you an answer, but I think it's a fair question, and it's an important consideration in terms of pricing and competitive advantages going forward.

Last week, [indiscernible], a well-known investor, dubbed the American oil industry as dead on the water that for multiple quarters of capital starvation and deteriorating rig counts. While we don't agree with the characterization of the industry being dead, that you may fit non-Tier 1 legacy SCR and mechanical rigs in the U.S. We have long believed Tier 1 AC drive rigs, which constitute nearly 100% of H&P's and 64% of the working industry fleet today, are the relevant rig assets for drilling horizontal wells in the U.S. land segment. After hearing many the comments from this earnings season about the importance of Tier 1 rigs for drilling most efficient horizontal wells, these appears to be the consensus for you today.
Since 2002, our strategy has been designing, building and operating Tier 1 rigs. Over the past 5 years, the industry has gone through on energy renaissance and well complexity has dramatically increased right along with efficiency. H&P has led the way with innovative solutions that have set H&P apart from its peers, particularly in how we have leveraged AC drive technology.
First, by taking ownership, by internalizing expertise in the areas of equipment performance, capital repairs and more practical vertical integration.
Second, providing support services. Our electrical and mechanical staff enable us to leverage knowledge and lifecycle learnings of equipment and our performance groups are proactively engaged in helping our customers to lower total well cost.
Finally, we are committed to a process I will call continuous evolution, where in-house technical resources collaborate with their operational counterparts to enhance existing technology by adding new capability and functionality, as well as leveraging data more effectively to the benefit of those -- of our customers and the company. As in the past, we will continue to invest through the cycles. We have had great success in partnering with customers and moving ideas quickly and to operational deployment. We are developing solutions that will add incremental capacity and/or capability to address market requirements, and we can do this in a scalable and cost-effective way by leveraging our uniform base of existing FlexRig designs to provide value for customers.
We've also taken leadership positions in other areas. Our many first included integrated casing rig services, scripting of wells for enhanced reliability and efficiency, enhance software control capability, integrated sticks lift mitigation and many other technology solutions that today are standard offerings.
The industry has also formed a consensus view that 1,500-horsepower AC drive Tier 1 rigs provide the best drilling performance for drilling the most challenging horizontal wells. H&P's fleet has over 30% of the estimated 700 rigs in the U.S. market today that fit that description. We believe H&P's rigs are strategically placed and ready to mobilize quickly.
Let me use the Permian basin as the example of strategically placed and ready to mobilize quickly. The Permian, by all accounts, is the premier basin in the U.S. and somewhat argued in the top 3 of oil basis in the world. No drilling contractor has a stronger Tier 1 footprint there than H&P. Today, we have a total of 39 FlexRigs on contract in the Permian, more than our top 3 peers combined.
Additionally, we have over 60 idle FlexRigs available with 1,500-horsepower AC drive capability that are ready to work. Let me also make a point for ready to mobilize quickly. We've made prudent investments and taking great care to idle and maintain the FlexRigs properly. Field-tested processes are used to clean and preserve the equipment. In addition, the rigs have been assembled and maintained as needed, so we are ready for the most efficient and cost-effective deployment when the market improves.
For good or bad, H&P's Permian facility has become one of the photographic symbols of this downturn. And as many can see, our FlexRigs are standing tall and ready to go to work.
We often get questions regarding how quickly we can respond to demand with our idle fleet of FlexRigs. We feel very confident we are positioned and better to respond as a result of the investments made in the fleet as described. Whatever the demand might be going forward, we believe we can grow our market share in an improving market as a result of the mentioned characteristics, strategic placement and the ready state of our rig fleet.
In addition to rigs being ready and obvious need and a key advantage in ramping up activity is the availability of quality people. We have done everything in our power to keep our best people clearly in a downturn of this magnitude, it is impossible to keep everyone. Like all companies in the energy sector, we've had to made significant cuts in spending and personnel. It has been very difficult to say goodbye to so many, but we are thankful for having such great people today and look forward to the opportunity of bringing back to work many of those former employees once the cycle turns.
Before turning the call back to Juan Pablo, I want to recognize that in the face of adversity, I've been very pleased with our folks response in dealing with the downturn. Our focus has remained on doing the right things and retaining the right people to enhance our competitive advantages going forward.

278341,330156988,969444,"Helmerich & Payne, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, May 02, 2016",2016-05-02,"Earnings Calls","Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, John.The company reported $21 million in net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2016. Compensation from customers, corresponding to early termination of long-term contracts, once again allowed us to report quarterly profits. Nevertheless",1518,"Thank you, John.
The company reported $21 million in net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2016. Compensation from customers, corresponding to early termination of long-term contracts, once again allowed us to report quarterly profits. Nevertheless, market conditions continued to deteriorate and drilling activity for the company continued to decline.
Following are some comments on each of our drilling segments. Our U.S. land drilling operations generated approximately $63 million in segment operating income during the second fiscal quarter. The number of revenue days declined by approximately 20% as compared to the prior quarter, resulting in an average of close to 106 rigs generating revenue days during the second fiscal quarter. On average, approximately 84 of these rigs were under term contracts and approximately 22 rigs worked in the spot market. In addition to rigs that are no longer contracted and became idle during the quarter, several more rigs became idle that remain under long-term contracts and that are generating revenue days at standby-type day rates, protecting the expected daily cash margin during the term duration of the contracts. This increasing number of rigs was [indiscernible] by top day rates represented approximately 17% of the rigs that were generating revenue days in the segment at the end of the second fiscal quarter.
Excluding the impact of early termination revenues, the average rig revenue per day declined by approximately 1% to $25,931 in the second fiscal quarter and the average rig expense per day increased by approximately 10% to $14,139, resulting in an average rig margin per day of $11,792 in the second fiscal quarter. The increase in the average rig expense per day was primarily attributable to the large number of rigs that became idle during the quarter, generating expenses related to personnel management and rig stacking, which were then allocated across the smaller number of revenue days for the quarter.
It was not a surprise to see our quarter-to-quarter daily expenses increase as we had guided toward $13,600 per day for the quarter. But the increase was higher-than-expected as we experienced some unfavorable volatility during the quarter, related to different type of expenses that we expect will return to more normal levels during the following quarter.
The segment generated approximately $80 million in revenues corresponding to early termination of long-term contracts during the second fiscal quarter. Given existing notifications for early terminations, we expect to generate over $80 million during the third fiscal quarter, about $20 million during the fourth fiscal quarter and over $40 million thereafter in early termination revenues. Nevertheless, about 60% of the mentioned early termination revenues that we expect to be recognized after the second fiscal quarter of 2016 are attributable to compensation that, as of March 31, has already been invoiced and collected and that is included in the current liability section of our March 31, 2016 balance sheet as the deferred revenue. We cannot fully recognize the early termination revenue on a rig until all contractual customer options to pay that rig back to work at full day rates have expired.
Since the peak in late 2014, we have received early termination notifications for a total of 87 rigs under long-term contracts in the segment, up 10 rigs since our last conference call in late January.
Total early termination revenues related to these 87 contracts are now estimated at approximately $460 million, about $88 million of which corresponds to cash flow originally expected to be generated through normal operations during fiscal 2015, $183 million during fiscal 2016 and $189 million after that.
As of today, our 347 available rigs in the U.S. land segment include approximately 84 rigs generating revenue and 263 idle rigs. Included in the 84 rigs generating revenue are 77 rigs under term contracts, 72 of which are generating revenue days. In addition, 7 rigs are currently active in the spot market for a total of 79 rigs generating revenue days in the segment. Nevertheless, approximately 18% of these 79 rigs are now idle and on standby-type day rates reflecting daily cash margins under long-term contracts. Separately, the 5 rigs generating revenue and not generating revenue days include newbuild rigs with deliveries that have been delayed in exchange for compensation from customers.
Looking ahead to the third quarter of fiscal 2016, we expect the decline in the range of 25% to 28% in the number of total revenue days quarter-to-quarter. Excluding the impact of revenues corresponding to early terminated long-term contracts, we expect our average rig revenue per day to decline to approximately $25,000, partly as a result of the relatively high proportion of rigs generating revenue days under standby-type day rates. The average rig expense per day is expected to decrease to roughly $13,800. And these expected decreases is primarily attributable to a greater proportion of rigs on standby-type day rates, which is partly offset by expenses related to the growing proportion of total idle rigs.
Our third fiscal quarter average rig expense per day estimate also includes the impact of a relatively high level of expenses related to a significant ongoing reduction of field personnel positions and employee early retirements.
Absent any additional early terminations and excluding the mentioned rigs for which we have received early termination notifications, the segment currently has term contract commitments in place for an average of approximately 71 rigs during the third fiscal quarter, 69 rigs during the fourth fiscal quarter, 63 rigs during fiscal 2017 and 33 rigs during fiscal 2018. The average daily margins for these rigs that are currently under long-term contracts is expected to remain strong during the next several quarters as some rigs roll off and the remaining newbuilds are deployed.
The average pricing today for the 7 rigs in the spot market remains over 30% lower as compared to the spot pricing at the peak in late 2014.
Let me now transition to our offshore operations. Segment operating income declined to approximately $3 million from $8 million during the prior quarter. Total revenue days declined by about 6% and average rig margin per day declined by about 7% to $7,346 per day during the second fiscal quarter. Most of the rigs that generated revenue during the second fiscal quarter were rigs that remained idle in customer-owned platforms and are generating standby-type day rates.
As we look at the third quarter of fiscal 2016, we expect quarterly revenue days to decline by approximately 8% as 7 of our 9 offshore platform rigs generate revenue days during the quarter. The average rig margin per day is expected to increase to approximately $8,000 during the third fiscal quarter. The expected decline in activity is attributable to a rig that will demobilize and stack onshore during the second fiscal quarter.
Management contracts on platform rigs continued to contribute to our offshore segment operating income. Their contributions during the second fiscal quarter was approximately $2 million. Management contracts are expected to generate approximately $3 million during each of the remaining 2 quarters of fiscal 2016.
Moving on to our international land operations. This segment reported operating losses of approximately $2 million during the second fiscal quarter. The average rig margin per day decreased sequentially from $11,811 to $10,487 per day during the second fiscal quarter. Quarterly revenue days decreased sequentially by approximately 7% to 1,307 days during the same quarter.
As of today, our international then segment has 14 rigs generating revenue days including 10 in Argentina, 2 in the UAE, 1 in Colombia and 1 in Bahrain. All 14 rigs are in their long-term contracts. The 24 remaining rigs are idle.
We expect international land quarterly revenue days to be slightly down by approximately 3% during the third quarter of fiscal 2016 and the average rig margin per day to slightly increase to approximately $11,000 per day.
Let me now comment on corporate level details. Our strong balance sheet and high liquidity position, along with our firm backlog of long-term contracts and reduced CapEx requirements, should continue to allow us to return cash to shareholders by sustaining the level of our regular dividend payments as previously discussed. Excluding rigs with long-term contracts that have already been early terminated and combining all 3 of our drilling segments, we currently have an average of approximately 99 rigs under term contracts expected to be active in fiscal 2016, 78 in fiscal 2017 and 47 in fiscal 2018. Our backlog level as of March 31, 2016, was at approximately $2.3 billion.
Capital expenditures for fiscal 2016 are now expected to be in the range of $300 million to $350 million as compared to our prior guidance of $300 million to $400 million. As mentioned in the past, we expect our total annual depreciation expense for fiscal 2016 to be approximately $580 million and our general and administrative expenses to be approximately $135 million. The effective income tax rate for the second quarter of fiscal 2016 was 32.6%, and we expect the effective tax rate for each of the remaining 2 quarters of fiscal 2016 to be in the range of 33% to 36%. 
With that, let me turn the call back to John."

I wanted to mention a couple of comments before we open it up to Q&A. As you know, the U.S. land rig count today is comparable to the all-time record low reached in 1999 and some are comparing the cycle to the 1980s. Even with the recent oil price rebound of $45 a barrel, sharp reductions in personnel expenses and investments are continuing worldwide.
With the market intelligence we have today, we expect to see further deterioration in terms of drilling activity during the third fiscal quarter. That said, we are seeing more indications that the bottom of the cycle is nearing. The question remains how quickly E&P companies gain enough confidence in the market to begin investing back into the business and putting idle FlexRigs back to work.

So I sure wouldn't want to leave with you with the impression that we're not looking at other designs and other opportunities. The fact of the matter is, I think, the industry has all of the Tier 1 type rig assets that are needed. The question is, which are those assets are going to work. Obviously, we feel very confident that our rigs are the ones that are going to be most sought after. So we are continuing to invest, but I don't see any real, based on what I've seen, I don't see any real breakthroughs in terms of technologies that are being talked about after."

Can you continue to use South America, for example, as kind of a relief valve as it relates to put clearly an oversaturated U.S. land complex? And maybe talk about the appetite for a Tier 1 rigs internationally? Do you see that changing and evolving? I recall you're able to send, I think it was 10, 12 rigs down to South America recently over the last couple of years. But what other opportunities do you see? Can you maybe expand more in the Eastern Hemisphere? As you look at international rigs, a lot of it is South America. How can we view the kind of international business for H&P in the longer term do you think?"

As you know, international markets are struggling right now as well. But we do see the current fleet that we have in the U.S. being able to expand internationally with those opportunities arise. We keep thinking that it will be growth in the international area in terms of unconventional resource plays, and really that's what the 10 rigs, the growth in Argentina for the Flex 3, that's what that was all about. And so hopefully, we'll see that happen. I think there's nobody better position in H&P to take advantage of that. As you know, we've been working internationally for over 50 years so we have a lot of experience and capabilities. So we're just waiting for those opportunities."

There are so many moving pieces there that we have to take there that I would hesitate to start outlining those because there's not just 1 or 2 that I could mention that, that would bring clarity to that. I think your overall assumption is true. Obviously, if we enter a recovery and we put the rigs back to work, those rigs will probably go back to work at day rates and margins that relates closely to where we are in the spot market today. And as that happens, the impact of that will be probably negative on the margin as we have a higher proportion of rigs in the spot market going forward assuming, of course, that we have recovery. The only other factor that I'll mention is what John already mentioned and that is, that as we put rigs back to work and total number of idle rigs begins to decline, that in general will have a favorable impact on margins as some of those fixed costs related to the idle fleet will start to be reabsorbed.

I think what may be an important part of the question is, related to the rigs that we already have under term contracts and what those margins might be. And the answer to that is that the margins, the rigs that are on term contracts that are currently operating or that are on standby-type day rates, those are as strong as we expected. We have not seen any deterioration in there as expected. Obviously, we benefited from early terminations and vary significantly.

Last week, a former oilman [ph] and well-known investor, dubbed the American oil industry as dead in the water that for multiple quarters of capital starvation and deteriorating rig counts. While we don't agree with the characterization of the industry being dead, that shoe [ph] may fit non-Tier 1 legacy SCR and mechanical rigs in the U.S. We have long believed Tier 1, AC drive rigs, which constitute nearly 100% of H&P's fleet and 64% of the working industry fleet today, are the relevant rig assets for drilling horizontal wells in the U.S. land segment. After hearing many the comments from this earnings season about the importance of Tier 1 rigs for drilling the most efficient horizontal wells, these appears to be the consensus for you today.
Since 2002, our strategy has been designing, building and operating Tier 1 rigs. Over the past 5 years, the industry has gone through on energy renaissance and well complexity has dramatically increased right along with efficiency. H&P has led the way with innovative solutions that have set H&P apart from its peers, particularly in how we have leveraged AC drive technology.
First, by taking ownership, by internalizing expertise in the areas of equipment performance, capital repairs and more practical vertical integration.
Second, providing support services. Our electrical and mechanical staff enable us to leverage knowledge and life cycle learnings of equipment, and our performance groups are proactively engaged in helping our customers to lower total well cost.
Finally, we are committed to a process I will call continuous evolution, where in-house technical resources collaborate with their operational counterparts to enhance existing technology by adding new capability and functionality, as well as leveraging data more effectively to the benefit of both our customer and the company. As in the past, we will continue to invest through the cycles. We have had great success in partnering with customers and moving ideas quickly and to operational deployment. We are developing solutions that will add incremental capacity and/or capability to address market requirements, and we can do this in a scalable and cost-effective way by leveraging our uniform base of existing FlexRig designs to provide value for customers.
We've also taken leadership positions in other areas. Our many first include integrated casing rig [ph] services, scripting of wells for enhanced reliability and efficiency, enhance software control capability, integrated sticks lift mitigation and many other technology solutions that today are standard offerings.
The industry has also formed a consensus view that 1,500-horsepower AC drive, Tier 1 rigs provide the best drilling performance for drilling the most challenging horizontal wells. H&P's fleet has over 30% of the estimated 700 rigs in the U.S. market today that fit that description. We believe H&P's rigs are strategically placed and ready to mobilize quickly.
Let me use the Permian basin as the example of strategically placed and ready to mobilize quickly. The Permian, by all accounts, is the premier basin in the U.S. and somewhat argued in the top 3 of oil basins in the world. No drilling contractor has a stronger Tier 1 footprint there than H&P. Today, we have a total of 39 FlexRigs on contract in the Permian, more than our top 3 peers combined.
Additionally, we have over 60 idle FlexRigs available with 1,500-horsepower AC drive capability that are ready to work. Let me also make the point for ready to mobilize quickly. We've made prudent investments and taking great care to idle and maintain the FlexRigs properly. Field-tested processes are used to clean and preserve the equipment. In addition, the rigs have been assembled and maintained as needed, so we are ready for the most efficient and cost-effective deployment when the market improves.
For good or bad, H&P's Permian facility has become one of the photographic symbols of this downturn. And as many can see, our FlexRigs are standing tall and ready to go to work.
We often get questions regarding how quickly we can respond to demand with our idle fleet of FlexRigs. We feel very confident, we are positioned better to respond than others as a result of the investments made in the fleet as described. Whatever the demand might be going forward, we believe we can grow our market share in an improving market as a result of the mentioned characteristics, strategic placement and the ready state of our rig fleet.
In addition to rigs being ready and obvious need and a key advantage in ramping up activity is the availability of quality people. We have done everything in our power to keep our best people. Clearly, in a downturn of this magnitude, it is impossible to keep everyone. Like all companies in the energy sector, we've had to made significant cuts in spending and personnel. It has been very difficult to say goodbye to so many, but we are thankful for having such great people today and look forward to the opportunity of bringing back to work many of those former employees once the cycle turns.
Before turning the call back to Juan Pablo, I want to recognize that in the face of adversity, I've been very pleased with our folk's response in dealing with the downturn. Our focus has remained on doing the right things and retaining the right people to enhance our competitive advantages going forward.

Compensation from customers, corresponding to early termination of long-term contracts, once again allowed us to report quarterly profits. Nevertheless",1514,"Thank you, John.
The company reported $21 million in net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2016. Compensation from customers, corresponding to early termination of long-term contracts, once again allowed us to report quarterly profits. Nevertheless, market conditions continued to deteriorate and drilling activity for the company continued to decline.
Following are some comments on each of our drilling segments. Our U.S. land drilling operations generated approximately $63 million in segment operating income during the second fiscal quarter. The number of revenue days declined by approximately 20% as compared to the prior quarter, resulting in an average of close to 106 rigs generating revenue days during the second fiscal quarter. On average, approximately 84 of these rigs were under term contracts and approximately 22 rigs worked in the spot market. In addition to rigs that are no longer contracted and became idle during the quarter, several more rigs became idle that remain under long-term contracts and that are generating revenue days at standby-type day rates, protecting the expected daily cash margin during the term duration of the contracts. This increasing number of rigs was standby-type day rates represented approximately 17% of the rigs that were generating revenue days in the segment at the end of the second fiscal quarter.
Excluding the impact of early termination revenues, the average rig revenue per day declined by approximately 1% to $25,931 in the second fiscal quarter and the average rig expense per day increased by approximately 10% to $14,139, resulting in an average rig margin per day of $11,792 in the second fiscal quarter. The increase in the average rig expense per day was primarily attributable to the large number of rigs that became idle during the quarter, generating expenses related to personnel management and rig stacking, which were then allocated across the smaller number of revenue days for the quarter.
It was not a surprise to see our quarter-to-quarter daily expenses increase as we had guided toward $13,600 per day for the quarter. But the increase was higher-than-expected as we experienced some unfavorable volatility during the quarter, related to different type of expenses that we expect will return to more normal levels during the following quarter.
The segment generated approximately $80 million in revenues corresponding to early termination of long-term contracts during the second fiscal quarter. Given existing notifications for early termination, we expect to generate over $80 million during the third fiscal quarter, about $20 million during the fourth fiscal quarter and over $40 million thereafter in early termination revenues. Nevertheless, about 60% of the mentioned early termination revenues that we expect to be recognized after the second fiscal quarter of 2016 are attributable to compensation that, as of March 31, had already been invoiced and collected and that is included in the current liability section of our March 31, 2016 balance sheet as deferred revenue. We cannot fully recognize the early termination revenue on a rig until all contractual customer options to pay that rig back to work at full day rates have expired.
Since the peak in late 2014, we have received early termination notifications for a total of 87 rigs under long-term contracts in the segment, up 10 rigs since our last conference call in late January.
Total early termination revenues related to these 87 contracts are now estimated at approximately $460 million, about $88 million of which corresponds to cash flow originally expected to be generated through normal operations during fiscal 2015, $183 million during fiscal 2016 and $189 million after that.
As of today, our 347 available rigs in the U.S. land segment include approximately 84 rigs generating revenue and 263 idle rigs. Included in the 84 rigs generating revenue are 77 rigs under term contracts, 72 of which are generating revenue days. In addition, 7 rigs are currently active in the spot market for a total of 79 rigs generating revenue days in the segment. Nevertheless, approximately 18% of these 79 rigs are now idle and on standby-type day rates protecting daily cash margins under long-term contracts. Separately, the 5 rigs generating revenue and not generating revenue days include newbuild rigs with deliveries that have been delayed in exchange for compensation from customers.
Looking ahead to the third quarter of fiscal 2016, we expect the decline in the range of 25% to 28% in the number of total revenue days quarter-to-quarter. Excluding the impact of revenues corresponding to early terminated long-term contracts, we expect our average rig revenue per day to decline to approximately $25,000, partly as a result of the relatively high proportion of rigs generating revenue days under standby-type day rates. The average rig expense per day is expected to decrease to roughly $13,800. This expected decrease is primarily attributable to a greater proportion of rigs on standby-type day rates, which is partly offset by expenses related to the growing proportion of total idle rigs.
Our third fiscal quarter average rig expense per day estimate also includes the impact of a relatively high level of expenses related to a significant ongoing reduction of field personnel positions and employee early retirements.
Absent any additional early terminations and excluding the mentioned rigs for which we have received early termination notifications, the segment currently has term contract commitments in place for an average of approximately 71 rigs during the third fiscal quarter, 69 rigs during the fourth fiscal quarter, 63 rigs during fiscal 2017 and 33 rigs during fiscal 2018. The average daily margins for these rigs that are currently under long-term contracts is expected to remain strong during the next several quarters as some rigs roll off and the remaining newbuilds are deployed.
The average pricing today for the 7 rigs in the spot market remains over 30% lower as compared to the spot pricing at the peak in late 2014.
Let me now transition to our offshore operations. Segment operating income declined to approximately $3 million from $8 million during the prior quarter. Total revenue days declined by about 6% and average rig margin per day declined by about 7% to $7,346 per day during the second fiscal quarter. Most of the rigs that generated revenue during the second fiscal quarter were rigs that remained idle in customer-owned platforms and are generating standby-type day rates.
As we look at the third quarter of fiscal 2016, we expect quarterly revenue days to decline by approximately 8% as 7 of our 9 offshore platform rigs generate revenue days during the quarter. The average rig margin per day is expected to increase to approximately $8,000 during the third fiscal quarter. The expected decline in activity is attributable to a rig that will demobilize and stacked onshore during the second fiscal quarter.
Management contracts on platform rigs continued to contribute to our offshore segment operating income. Their contribution during the second fiscal quarter was approximately $2 million. Management contracts are expected to generate approximately $3 million during each of the remaining 2 quarters of fiscal 2016.
Moving on to our international land operations. This segment reported operating losses of approximately $2 million during the second fiscal quarter. The average rig margin per day decreased sequentially from $11,811 to $10,487 per day during the second fiscal quarter. Quarterly revenue days decreased sequentially by approximately 7% to 1,307 days during the same quarter.
As of today, our international land segment has 14 rigs generating revenue days including 10 in Argentina, 2 in the UAE, 1 in Colombia and 1 in Bahrain. All 14 rigs are in their long-term contracts. The 24 remaining rigs are idle.
We expect international land quarterly revenue days to be slightly down by approximately 3% during the third quarter of fiscal 2016 and the average rig margin per day to slightly increase to approximately $11,000 per day.
Let me now comment on corporate level details. Our strong balance sheet and high liquidity position, along with our firm backlog of long-term contracts and reduced CapEx requirements, should continue to allow us to return cash to shareholders by sustaining the level of our regular dividend payments as previously discussed. Excluding rigs with long-term contracts that have already been early terminated and combining all 3 of our drilling segments, we currently have an average of approximately 99 rigs under term contracts expected to be active in fiscal 2016, 78 in fiscal 2017 and 47 in fiscal 2018. Our backlog level as of March 31, 2016, was at approximately $2.3 billion.
Capital expenditures for fiscal 2016 are now expected to be in the range of $300 million to $350 million as compared to our prior guidance of $300 million to $400 million. As mentioned in the past, we expect our total annual depreciation expense for fiscal 2016 to be approximately $580 million and our general and administrative expenses to be approximately $135 million. The effective income tax rate for the second quarter of fiscal 2016 was 32.6%, and we expect the effective tax rate for each of the remaining 2 quarters of fiscal 2016 to be in the range of 33% to 36%. 
With that, let me turn the call back to John."

Even with the recent oil price rebound of $45 a barrel, sharp reductions in personnel expenses and investments are continuing worldwide.
With the market intelligence we have today, we expect to see further deterioration in terms of drilling activity during the third fiscal quarter. That said, we are seeing more indications that the bottom of the cycle is nearing. The question remains how quickly E&P companies gain enough confidence in the market to begin investing back into the business and putting idle FlexRigs back to work.

We continue to add technology, and we have over the past 10-plus years, we've continued to have innovations that improve our systems and we're continually upgrading and high-grading. So I sure wouldn't -- I wouldn't want to leave you with the impression that we're not looking at other designs and other opportunities. The fact of the matter is, I think, the industry has all of the Tier 1 type rig assets that are needed. The question is, which of those assets are going to work. Obviously, we feel very confident that our rigs are the ones that are going to be most sought after. So we are continuing to invest, but I don't see any real, based on what I've seen, I don't see any real breakthroughs in terms of technologies that are being talked about out there."

But I think the other thing to keep in mind is, in contrast to previous cycles where really every rig out there was out there fighting for that type of work for the more difficult, unconventional horizontal wells, that's a fairly small subset, as you know, of the total rig fleet if you were to look back to the peak activity in October 2014. So I think it's a -- we've described it as around 700 rigs or so, that are 1,500-horsepower and, of course, you're going to have a subset of those rigs that are going to the top performers, that are going to have the best equipment.

And the first one has to do with a growing proportion of idle rigs and expenses associated with those idle rigs. Some of those expenses are fixed, some relate to the process that we are going through. The transition as rig become idle, as you know, there are stacking expenses, there are personnel expenses that we incur and so that impacts the average unfavorably. We also have a couple of other things going on. One is related to a higher-than-normal number of personnel positions in the field and early retirements related to employees. So that's what is impacting the average rig margin, the 13,800 that we guided toward in the way that is unfavorable. Hopefully, as John mentioned, as we have seen more stability and, hopefully, see rigs going back to the field, we hope to have a favorable movement in the average rig expense per day."

The only other factor that I'll mention is what John already mentioned and that is, that as we put rigs back to work and then total number of idle rigs begins to decline, that in general will have a favorable impact on margins as some of those fixed costs related to the idle fleet will start to be reabsorbed.

I think what may be an important part of the question is, related to the rigs that we already have under term contracts and what those margins might be. And the answer to that is that the margins, the rigs that are on term contracts that are currently operating or that are on standby-type day rates, those are as strong as we expected. We have not seen any deterioration there as expected. Obviously, we benefited from early terminations in a very significant way. And so our backlog is a very important piece of the equation for us, and it has been strong and we expect for that to continue to be strong.

Last week, a former oilman and well-known investor, dubbed the American oil industry as dead in the water after multiple quarters of capital starvation and deteriorating rig counts. While we don't agree with the characterization of the industry being dead, that shoe may fit non-Tier 1 legacy SCR and mechanical rigs in the U.S. We have long believed Tier 1, AC drive rigs, which constitute nearly 100% of H&P's fleet and 64% of the working industry fleet today, are the relevant rig assets for drilling horizontal wells in the U.S. land segment. After hearing many of the comments from this earnings season about the importance of Tier 1 rigs for drilling the most efficient horizontal wells, this appears to be the consensus view today.
Since 2002, our strategy has been designing, building and operating Tier 1 rigs. Over the past 5 years, the industry has gone through an energy renaissance and well complexity has dramatically increased right along with efficiency. H&P has led the way with innovative solutions that have set H&P apart from its peers, particularly in how we have leveraged AC drive technology.
First, by taking ownership, by internalizing expertise in the areas of equipment performance, capital repairs and, where practical, vertical integration.
Second, providing support services. Our electrical and mechanical staff enable us to leverage knowledge and life cycle learnings of equipment, and our performance groups are proactively engaged in helping our customers to lower total well costs.
Finally, we are committed to a process I will call continuous evolution, where in-house technical resources collaborate with their operational counterparts to enhance existing technology by adding new capability and functionality, as well as leveraging data more effectively to the benefit of both our customer and the company. As in the past, we will continue to invest through the cycles. We have had great success in partnering with customers and moving ideas quickly into operational deployment. We are developing solutions that will add incremental capacity and/or capability to address market requirements, and we can do this in a scalable and cost-effective way by leveraging our uniform base of existing FlexRig designs to provide value for customers.
We've also taken leadership positions in other areas. Our many firsts include integrated casing running services, scripting of wells for enhanced reliability and efficiency, enhanced software control capability, integrated stick-slip mitigation and many other technology solutions that today are standard offerings.
The industry has also formed a consensus view that 1,500-horsepower AC drive, Tier 1 rigs provide the best drilling performance for drilling the most challenging horizontal wells. H&P's fleet has over 30% of the estimated 700 rigs in the U.S. market today that fit that description. We believe H&P's rigs are strategically placed and ready to mobilize quickly.
Let me use the Permian basin as the example of strategically placed and ready to mobilize quickly. The Permian, by all accounts, is the premier basin in the U.S. and somewhat argued in the top 3 of oil basins in the world. No drilling contractor has a stronger Tier 1 footprint there than H&P. Today, we have a total of 39 FlexRigs on contract in the Permian, more than our top 3 peers combined.
Additionally, we have over 60 idle FlexRigs available with 1,500-horsepower AC drive capability that are ready to work. Let me also make the point for ready to mobilize quickly. We've made prudent investments and taken great care to idle and maintain the FlexRigs properly. Field-tested processes are used to clean and preserve the equipment. In addition, the rigs have been assembled and maintained as needed, so we are ready for the most efficient and cost-effective deployment when the market improves.
For good or bad, H&P's Permian facility has become one of the photographic symbols of this downturn. And as many can see, our FlexRigs are standing tall and ready to go to work.
We often get questions regarding how quickly we can respond to demand with our idle fleet of FlexRigs. We feel very confident we are positioned better to respond than others as a result of the investments made in the fleet as described. Whatever the demand might be going forward, we believe we can grow our market share in an improving market as a result of the mentioned characteristics, strategic placement and the ready state of our rig fleet.
In addition to rigs being ready, an obvious need and a key advantage in ramping up activity is the availability of quality people. We have done everything in our power to keep our best people. Clearly, in a downturn of this magnitude, it is impossible to keep everyone. Like all companies in the energy sector, we've had to made significant cuts in spending and personnel. It has been very difficult to say goodbye to so many, but we are thankful for having such great people today and look forward to the opportunity of bringing back to work many of those former employees once the cycle turns.
Before turning the call back to Juan Pablo, I want to recognize that in the face of adversity, I've been very pleased with our folks' response in dealing with the downturn. Our focus has remained on doing the right things and retaining the right people to enhance our competitive advantages going forward.

278341,330156988,970009,"Helmerich & Payne, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, May 02, 2016",2016-05-02,"Earnings Calls","Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, John.The company reported $21 million in net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2016. Compensation from customers, corresponding to early termination of long-term contracts, once again allowed us to report quarterly profits. Nevertheless",1514,"Thank you, John.
The company reported $21 million in net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2016. Compensation from customers, corresponding to early termination of long-term contracts, once again allowed us to report quarterly profits. Nevertheless, market conditions continued to deteriorate and drilling activity for the company continued to decline.
Following are some comments on each of our drilling segments. Our U.S. land drilling operations generated approximately $63 million in segment operating income during the second fiscal quarter. The number of revenue days declined by approximately 20% as compared to the prior quarter, resulting in an average of close to 106 rigs generating revenue days during the second fiscal quarter. On average, approximately 84 of these rigs were under term contracts and approximately 22 rigs worked in the spot market. In addition to rigs that are no longer contracted and became idle during the quarter, several more rigs became idle that remain under long-term contracts and that are generating revenue days at standby-type day rates, protecting the expected daily cash margin during the term duration of the contracts. This increasing number of rigs with standby-type day rates represented approximately 17% of the rigs that were generating revenue days in the segment at the end of the second fiscal quarter.
Excluding the impact of early termination revenues, the average rig revenue per day declined by approximately 1% to $25,931 in the second fiscal quarter and the average rig expense per day increased by approximately 10% to $14,139, resulting in an average rig margin per day of $11,792 in the second fiscal quarter. The increase in the average rig expense per day was primarily attributable to the large number of rigs that became idle during the quarter, generating expenses related to personnel management and rig stacking, which were then allocated across a smaller number of revenue days for the quarter.
It was not a surprise to see our quarter-to-quarter daily expenses increase as we had guided toward $13,600 per day for the quarter. But the increase was higher-than-expected as we experienced some unfavorable volatility during the quarter, related to different type of expenses that we expect will return to more normal levels during the following quarter.
The segment generated approximately $80 million in revenues corresponding to early termination of long-term contracts during the second fiscal quarter. Given existing notifications for early terminations, we expect to generate over $80 million during the third fiscal quarter, about $20 million during the fourth fiscal quarter and over $40 million thereafter in early termination revenues. Nevertheless, about 60% of the mentioned early termination revenues that we expect to be recognized after the second fiscal quarter of 2016 are attributable to compensation that, as of March 31, had already been invoiced and collected and that is included in the current liability section of our March 31, 2016 balance sheet as deferred revenue. We cannot fully recognize the early termination revenue on a rig until all contractual customer options to pay that rig back to work at full day rates have expired.
Since the peak in late 2014, we have received early termination notifications for a total of 87 rigs under long-term contracts in the segment, up 10 rigs since our last conference call in late January.
Total early termination revenues related to these 87 contracts are now estimated at approximately $460 million, about $88 million of which corresponds to cash flow originally expected to be generated through normal operations during fiscal 2015, $183 million during fiscal 2016 and $189 million after that.
As of today, our 347 available rigs in the U.S. land segment include approximately 84 rigs generating revenue and 263 idle rigs. Included in the 84 rigs generating revenue are 77 rigs under term contracts, 72 of which are generating revenue days. In addition, 7 rigs are currently active in the spot market for a total of 79 rigs generating revenue days in the segment. Nevertheless, approximately 18% of these 79 rigs are now idle and on standby-type day rates protecting daily cash margins under long-term contracts. Separately, the 5 rigs generating revenue and not generating revenue days include newbuild rigs with deliveries that have been delayed in exchange for compensation from customers.
Looking ahead to the third quarter of fiscal 2016, we expect the decline in the range of 25% to 28% in the number of total revenue days quarter-to-quarter. Excluding the impact of revenues corresponding to early terminated long-term contracts, we expect our average rig revenue per day to decline to approximately $25,000, partly as a result of the relatively high proportion of rigs generating revenue days under standby-type day rates. The average rig expense per day is expected to decrease to roughly $13,800. This expected decrease is primarily attributable to a greater proportion of rigs on standby-type day rates, which is partly offset by expenses related to the growing proportion of total idle rigs.
Our third fiscal quarter average rig expense per day estimate also includes the impact of a relatively high level of expenses related to a significant ongoing reduction of field personnel positions and employee early retirements.
Absent any additional early terminations and excluding the mentioned rigs for which we have received early termination notifications, the segment currently has term contract commitments in place for an average of approximately 71 rigs during the third fiscal quarter, 69 rigs during the fourth fiscal quarter, 63 rigs during fiscal 2017 and 33 rigs during fiscal 2018. The average daily margins for these rigs that are currently under long-term contracts is expected to remain strong during the next several quarters as some rigs roll off and the remaining newbuilds are deployed.
The average pricing today for the 7 rigs in the spot market remains over 30% lower as compared to the spot pricing at the peak in late 2014.
Let me now transition to our offshore operations. Segment operating income declined to approximately $3 million from $8 million during the prior quarter. Total revenue days declined by about 6% and the average rig margin per day declined by about 7% to $7,346 per day during the second fiscal quarter. Most of the rigs that generated revenue during the second fiscal quarter were rigs that remained idle on customer-owned platforms and are generating standby-type day rates.
As we look at the third quarter of fiscal 2016, we expect quarterly revenue days to decline by approximately 8% as 7 of our 9 offshore platform rigs generate revenue days during the quarter. The average rig margin per day is expected to increase to approximately $8,000 during the third fiscal quarter. The expected decline in activity is attributable to a rig that will demobilize and stacked onshore during the second fiscal quarter.
Management contracts on platform rigs continued to contribute to our offshore segment operating income. Their contribution during the second fiscal quarter was approximately $2 million. Management contracts are expected to generate approximately $3 million during each of the remaining 2 quarters of fiscal 2016.
Moving on to our international land operations. This segment reported operating losses of approximately $2 million during the second fiscal quarter. The average rig margin per day decreased sequentially from $11,811 to $10,487 per day during the second fiscal quarter. Quarterly revenue days decreased sequentially by approximately 7% to 1,307 days during the same quarter.
As of today, our international land segment has 14 rigs generating revenue days including 10 in Argentina, 2 in the UAE, 1 in Colombia and 1 in Bahrain. All 14 rigs are under long-term contracts. The 24 remaining rigs are idle.
We expect international land quarterly revenue days to be slightly down by approximately 3% during the third quarter of fiscal 2016 and the average rig margin per day to slightly increase to approximately $11,000 per day.
Let me now comment on corporate level details. Our strong balance sheet and high liquidity position, along with our firm backlog of long-term contracts and reduced CapEx requirements, should continue to allow us to return cash to shareholders by sustaining the level of our regular dividend payments as previously discussed. Excluding rigs with long-term contracts that have already been early terminated and combining all 3 of our drilling segments, we currently have an average of approximately 99 rigs under term contracts expected to be active in fiscal 2016, 78 in fiscal 2017 and 47 in fiscal 2018. Our backlog level as of March 31, 2016, was at approximately $2.3 billion.
Capital expenditures for fiscal 2016 are now expected to be in the range of $300 million to $350 million as compared to our prior guidance of $300 million to $400 million. As mentioned in the past, we expect our total annual depreciation expense for fiscal 2016 to be approximately $580 million and our general and administrative expenses to be approximately $135 million. The effective income tax rate for the second quarter of fiscal 2016 was 32.6%, and we expect the effective tax rate for each of the remaining 2 quarters of fiscal 2016 to be in the range of 33% to 36%. 
With that, let me turn the call back to John."

I wanted to mention a couple of comments before we open it up to Q&A. As you know, the U.S. land rig count today is comparable to the all-time record lows reached in 1999 and some are comparing this cycle to the 1980s. Even with the recent oil price rebound of $45 a barrel, sharp reductions in personnel expenses and investments are continuing worldwide.
With the market intelligence we have today, we expect to see further deterioration in terms of drilling activity during the third fiscal quarter. That said, we are seeing more indications that the bottom of the cycle is nearing. The question remains how quickly E&P companies gain enough confidence in the market to begin investing back into the business and putting idle FlexRigs back to work.

We continue to add technology, and we have over the past 10-plus years, we've continued to have innovations that improve our systems and we're continually upgrading and high-grading. So I sure wouldn't -- I wouldn't want to leave you with the impression that we're not looking at other designs and other opportunities. The fact of the matter is, I think, the industry has all of the Tier 1 type rig assets that are needed. The question is, which of those assets are going to work. Obviously, we feel very confident that our rigs are the ones that are going to be most sought after. So we are continuing to invest, but I don't see any real -- based on what I've seen, I don't see any real breakthroughs in terms of technologies that are being talked about out there."

But I think the other thing to keep in mind is, in contrast to previous cycles where really every rig out there was out there fighting for that type of work for the more difficult, unconventional horizontal wells, that's a fairly small subset, as you know, of the total rig fleet if you were to look back to the peak activity in October of 2014. So I think it's a -- we've described it as around 700 rigs or so, that are 1,500-horsepower and, of course, you're going to have a subset of those rigs that are going to the top performers, that are going to have the best equipment.

Hopefully, as John mentioned, as we see more stability and, hopefully, see rigs going back to the field, we hope to have a favorable movement in the average rig expense per day."

Obviously, if we enter a recovery and we put rigs back to work, those rigs will probably go back to work at day rates and margins that relate closely to where we are in the spot market today. And as that happens, the impact of that will be probably negative on the margin as we have a higher proportion of rigs in the spot market going forward assuming, of course, that we -- there is that recovery. The only other factor that I'll mention is what John already mentioned and that is, that as we put rigs back to work and the total number of idle rigs begins to decline, that in general will have a favorable impact on margins as some of those fixed costs related to the idle fleet will start to be reabsorbed.

But that's yet one more moving piece as we go forward. I think what may be an important part of the question is, related to the rigs that we already have under term contracts and what those margins might be. And the answer to that is that the margins for the rigs that are on term contracts that are currently operating or that are on standby-type day rates, those are as strong as we expected. We have not seen any deterioration there as expected. Obviously, we benefited from early terminations in a very significant way. And so our backlog is a very important piece of the equation for us, and it has been strong and we expect for that to continue to be strong. But other expenses related to transitionary expenses, related to all of the aspects that we've already mentioned are also an important part of the equation.

Last week, a former oilman and well-known investor, dubbed the American oil industry as dead in the water after multiple quarters of capital starvation and deteriorating rig counts. While we don't agree with the characterization of the industry being dead, that shoe may fit non-Tier 1 legacy SCR and mechanical rigs in the U.S. We have long believed Tier 1, AC drive rigs, which constitute nearly 100% of H&P's fleet and 64% of the working industry fleet today, are the relevant rig assets for drilling horizontal wells in the U.S. land segment. After hearing many of the comments from this earnings season about the importance of Tier 1 rigs for drilling the most efficient horizontal wells, this appears to be the consensus view today.
Since 2002, our strategy has been designing, building and operating Tier 1 rigs. Over the past 5 years, the industry has gone through an energy renaissance and well complexity has dramatically increased right along with efficiency. H&P has led the way with innovative solutions that have set H&P apart from its peers, particularly in how we have leveraged AC drive technology.
First, by taking ownership, by internalizing expertise in the areas of equipment performance, capital repairs and, where practical, vertical integration.
Second, providing support services. Our electrical and mechanical staff enable us to leverage knowledge and life cycle learnings of equipment, and our performance groups are proactively engaged in helping our customers to lower total well costs.
Finally, we are committed to a process I will call continuous evolution, where in-house technical resources collaborate with their operational counterparts to enhance existing technology by adding new capability and functionality, as well as leveraging data more effectively to the benefit of both our customer and the company. As in the past, we will continue to invest through the cycles. We have had great success in partnering with customers and moving ideas quickly into operational deployment. We are developing solutions that will add incremental capacity and/or capability to address market requirements, and we can do this in a scalable and cost-effective way by leveraging our uniform base of existing FlexRig designs to provide value for customers.
We've also taken leadership positions in other areas. Our many firsts include integrated casing running services, scripting of wells for enhanced reliability and efficiency, enhanced software control capability, integrated stick-slip mitigation and many other technology solutions that today are standard offerings.
The industry has also formed a consensus view that 1,500-horsepower AC drive, Tier 1 rigs provide the best drilling performance for drilling the most challenging horizontal wells. H&P's fleet has over 30% of the estimated 700 rigs in the U.S. market today that fit that description. We believe H&P's rigs are strategically placed and ready to mobilize quickly.
Let me use the Permian basin as the example of strategically placed and ready to mobilize quickly. The Permian, by all accounts, is the premier basin in the U.S. and somewhat argued in the top 3 of oil basins in the world. No drilling contractor has a stronger Tier 1 footprint there than H&P. Today, we have a total of 39 FlexRigs on contract in the Permian, more than our top 3 peers combined.
Additionally, we have over 60 idle FlexRigs available with 1,500-horsepower AC drive capability that are ready to work. Let me also make the point for ready to mobilize quickly. We've made prudent investments and taken great care to idle and maintain the FlexRigs properly. Field-tested processes are used to clean and preserve the equipment. In addition, the rigs have been assembled and maintained as needed, so we are ready for the most efficient and cost-effective deployment when the market improves.
For good or bad, H&P's Permian facility has become one of the photographic symbols of this downturn. And as many can see, our FlexRigs are standing tall and ready to go to work.
We often get questions regarding how quickly we can respond to demand with our idle fleet of FlexRigs. We feel very confident we are positioned better to respond than others as a result of the investments made in the fleet as described. Whatever the demand might be going forward, we believe we can grow our market share in an improving market as a result of the mentioned characteristics, strategic placement and the ready state of our rig fleet.
In addition to rigs being ready, an obvious need and a key advantage in ramping up activity is the availability of quality people. We have done everything in our power to keep our best people. Clearly, in a downturn of this magnitude, it is impossible to keep everyone. Like all companies in the energy sector, we've had to made significant cuts in spending and personnel. It has been very difficult to say goodbye to so many, but we are thankful for having such great people today and look forward to the opportunity of bringing back to work many of those former employees once the cycle turns.
Before turning the call back to Juan Pablo, I want to recognize that in the face of adversity, I've been very pleased with our folks' response in dealing with the downturn. Our focus has remained on doing the right things and retaining the right people to enhance our competitive advantages going forward.

278341,330156988,970026,"Helmerich & Payne, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, May 02, 2016",2016-05-02,"Earnings Calls","Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, John.The company reported $21 million in net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2016. Compensation from customers, corresponding to early termination of long-term contracts, once again allowed us to report quarterly profits. Nevertheless",1514,"Thank you, John.
The company reported $21 million in net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2016. Compensation from customers, corresponding to early termination of long-term contracts, once again allowed us to report quarterly profits. Nevertheless, market conditions continued to deteriorate and drilling activity for the company continued to decline.
Following are some comments on each of our drilling segments. Our U.S. land drilling operations generated approximately $63 million in segment operating income during the second fiscal quarter. The number of revenue days declined by approximately 20% as compared to the prior quarter, resulting in an average of close to 106 rigs generating revenue days during the second fiscal quarter. On average, approximately 84 of these rigs were under term contracts and approximately 22 rigs worked in the spot market. In addition to rigs that are no longer contracted and became idle during the quarter, several more rigs became idle that remain under long-term contracts and that are generating revenue days at standby-type day rates, protecting the expected daily cash margin during the term duration of the contracts. This increasing number of rigs with standby-type day rates represented approximately 17% of the rigs that were generating revenue days in the segment at the end of the second fiscal quarter.
Excluding the impact of early termination revenues, the average rig revenue per day declined by approximately 1% to $25,931 in the second fiscal quarter and the average rig expense per day increased by approximately 10% to $14,139, resulting in an average rig margin per day of $11,792 in the second fiscal quarter. The increase in the average rig expense per day was primarily attributable to the large number of rigs that became idle during the quarter, generating expenses related to personnel management and rig stacking, which were then allocated across a smaller number of revenue days for the quarter.
It was not a surprise to see our quarter-to-quarter daily expenses increase as we had guided toward $13,600 per day for the quarter. But the increase was higher-than-expected as we experienced some unfavorable volatility during the quarter, related to different type of expenses that we expect will return to more normal levels during the following quarter.
The segment generated approximately $80 million in revenues corresponding to early termination of long-term contracts during the second fiscal quarter. Given existing notifications for early terminations, we expect to generate over $80 million during the third fiscal quarter, about $20 million during the fourth fiscal quarter and over $40 million thereafter in early termination revenues. Nevertheless, about 60% of the mentioned early termination revenues that we expect to be recognized after the second fiscal quarter of 2016 are attributable to compensation that, as of March 31, had already been invoiced and collected and that is included in the current liability section of our March 31, 2016 balance sheet as deferred revenue. We cannot fully recognize the early termination revenue on a rig until all contractual customer options to pay that rig back to work at full day rates have expired.
Since the peak in late 2014, we have received early termination notifications for a total of 87 rigs under long-term contracts in the segment, up 10 rigs since our last conference call in late January.
Total early termination revenues related to these 87 contracts are now estimated at approximately $460 million, about $88 million of which corresponds to cash flow originally expected to be generated through normal operations during fiscal 2015, $183 million during fiscal 2016 and $189 million after that.
As of today, our 347 available rigs in the U.S. land segment include approximately 84 rigs generating revenue and 263 idle rigs. Included in the 84 rigs generating revenue are 77 rigs under term contracts, 72 of which are generating revenue days. In addition, 7 rigs are currently active in the spot market for a total of 79 rigs generating revenue days in the segment. Nevertheless, approximately 18% of these 79 rigs are now idle and on standby-type day rates protecting daily cash margins under long-term contracts. Separately, the 5 rigs generating revenue and not generating revenue days include newbuild rigs with deliveries that have been delayed in exchange for compensation from customers.
Looking ahead to the third quarter of fiscal 2016, we expect the decline in the range of 25% to 28% in the number of total revenue days quarter-to-quarter. Excluding the impact of revenues corresponding to early terminated long-term contracts, we expect our average rig revenue per day to decline to approximately $25,000, partly as a result of the relatively high proportion of rigs generating revenue days under standby-type day rates. The average rig expense per day is expected to decrease to roughly $13,800. This expected decrease is primarily attributable to a greater proportion of rigs on standby-type day rates, which is partly offset by expenses related to the growing proportion of total idle rigs.
Our third fiscal quarter average rig expense per day estimate also includes the impact of a relatively high level of expenses related to a significant ongoing reduction of field personnel positions and employee early retirements.
Absent any additional early terminations and excluding the mentioned rigs for which we have received early termination notifications, the segment currently has term contract commitments in place for an average of approximately 71 rigs during the third fiscal quarter, 69 rigs during the fourth fiscal quarter, 63 rigs during fiscal 2017 and 33 rigs during fiscal 2018. The average daily margins for these rigs that are currently under long-term contracts is expected to remain strong during the next several quarters as some rigs roll off and the remaining newbuilds are deployed.
The average pricing today for the 7 rigs in the spot market remains over 30% lower as compared to the spot pricing at the peak in late 2014.
Let me now transition to our offshore operations. Segment operating income declined to approximately $3 million from $8 million during the prior quarter. Total revenue days declined by about 6% and the average rig margin per day declined by about 7% to $7,346 per day during the second fiscal quarter. Most of the rigs that generated revenue during the second fiscal quarter were rigs that remained idle on customer-owned platforms and are generating standby-type day rates.
As we look at the third quarter of fiscal 2016, we expect quarterly revenue days to decline by approximately 8% as 7 of our 9 offshore platform rigs generate revenue days during the quarter. The average rig margin per day is expected to increase to approximately $8,000 during the third fiscal quarter. The expected decline in activity is attributable to a rig that will demobilize and stacked onshore during the second fiscal quarter.
Management contracts on platform rigs continued to contribute to our offshore segment operating income. Their contribution during the second fiscal quarter was approximately $2 million. Management contracts are expected to generate approximately $3 million during each of the remaining 2 quarters of fiscal 2016.
Moving on to our international land operations. This segment reported operating losses of approximately $2 million during the second fiscal quarter. The average rig margin per day decreased sequentially from $11,811 to $10,487 per day during the second fiscal quarter. Quarterly revenue days decreased sequentially by approximately 7% to 1,307 days during the same quarter.
As of today, our international land segment has 14 rigs generating revenue days including 10 in Argentina, 2 in the UAE, 1 in Colombia and 1 in Bahrain. All 14 rigs are under long-term contracts. The 24 remaining rigs are idle.
We expect international land quarterly revenue days to be slightly down by approximately 3% during the third quarter of fiscal 2016 and the average rig margin per day to slightly increase to approximately $11,000 per day.
Let me now comment on corporate level details. Our strong balance sheet and high liquidity position, along with our firm backlog of long-term contracts and reduced CapEx requirements, should continue to allow us to return cash to shareholders by sustaining the level of our regular dividend payments as previously discussed. Excluding rigs with long-term contracts that have already been early terminated and combining all 3 of our drilling segments, we currently have an average of approximately 99 rigs under term contracts expected to be active in fiscal 2016, 78 in fiscal 2017 and 47 in fiscal 2018. Our backlog level as of March 31, 2016, was at approximately $2.3 billion.
Capital expenditures for fiscal 2016 are now expected to be in the range of $300 million to $350 million as compared to our prior guidance of $300 million to $400 million. As mentioned in the past, we expect our total annual depreciation expense for fiscal 2016 to be approximately $580 million and our general and administrative expenses to be approximately $135 million. The effective income tax rate for the second quarter of fiscal 2016 was 32.6%, and we expect the effective tax rate for each of the remaining 2 quarters of fiscal 2016 to be in the range of 33% to 36%. 
With that, let me turn the call back to John."

I wanted to mention a couple of comments before we open it up to Q&A. As you know, the U.S. land rig count today is comparable to the all-time record lows reached in 1999 and some are comparing this cycle to the 1980s. Even with the recent oil price rebound of $45 a barrel, sharp reductions in personnel expenses and investments are continuing worldwide.
With the market intelligence we have today, we expect to see further deterioration in terms of drilling activity during the third fiscal quarter. That said, we are seeing more indications that the bottom of the cycle is nearing. The question remains how quickly E&P companies gain enough confidence in the market to begin investing back into the business and putting idle FlexRigs back to work.
And now Tanishia will open the call to Q&A."

So as far as just pure rig designs, and I'm speaking primarily to the drilling contractors, I'm not addressing some of the other rig designs out there described as futuristic-type designs, I'm speaking more to the contractors today. We continue to add technology, and we have over the past 10-plus years, we've continued to have innovations that improve our systems and we're continually upgrading and high-grading. So I sure wouldn't -- I wouldn't want to leave you with the impression that we're not looking at other designs and other opportunities. The fact of the matter is, I think, the industry has all of the Tier 1 type rig assets that are needed. The question is, which of those assets are going to work. Obviously, we feel very confident that our rigs are the ones that are going to be most sought after. So we are continuing to invest, but I don't see any real -- based on what I've seen, I don't see any real breakthroughs in terms of technologies that are being talked about out there."

But I think the other thing to keep in mind is, in contrast to previous cycles where really every rig out there was out there fighting for that type of work for the more difficult, unconventional horizontal wells, that's a fairly small subset, as you know, of the total rig fleet if you were to look back to the peak activity in October of 2014. So I think it's a -- we've described it as around 700 rigs or so, that are 1,500-horsepower and, of course, you're going to have a subset of those rigs that are going to the top performers, that are going to have the best equipment.

Obviously, if we enter a recovery and we put rigs back to work, those rigs will probably go back to work at day rates and margins that relate closely to where we are in the spot market today. And as that happens, the impact of that will be probably negative on the margin as we have a higher proportion of rigs in the spot market going forward assuming, of course, that we -- there is that recovery. The only other factor that I'll mention is what John already mentioned and that is, that as we put rigs back to work and the total number of idle rigs begins to decline, that in general will have a favorable impact on margins as some of those fixed costs related to the idle fleet will start to be reabsorbed.

But that's yet one more moving piece as we go forward. I think what may be an important part of the question is, related to the rigs that we already have under term contracts and what those margins might be. And the answer to that is that the margins for the rigs that are on term contracts that are currently operating or that are on standby-type day rates, those are as strong as we expected. We have not seen any deterioration there as expected. Obviously, we benefited from early terminations in a very significant way. And so our backlog is a very important piece of the equation for us, and it has been strong and we expect for that to continue to be strong.

Last week, a former oilman and well-known investor, dubbed the American oil industry as dead in the water after multiple quarters of capital starvation and deteriorating rig counts. While we don't agree with the characterization of the industry being dead, that shoe may fit non-Tier 1 legacy SCR and mechanical rigs in the U.S. We have long believed Tier 1, AC drive rigs, which constitute nearly 100% of H&P's fleet and 64% of the working industry fleet today, are the relevant rig assets for drilling horizontal wells in the U.S. land segment. After hearing many of the comments from this earnings season about the importance of Tier 1 rigs for drilling the most efficient horizontal wells, this appears to be the consensus view today.
Since 2002, our strategy has been designing, building and operating Tier 1 rigs. Over the past 5 years, the industry has gone through an energy renaissance and well complexity has dramatically increased right along with efficiency. H&P has led the way with innovative solutions that have set H&P apart from its peers, particularly in how we have leveraged AC drive technology.
First, by taking ownership, by internalizing expertise in the areas of equipment performance, capital repairs and, where practical, vertical integration.
Second, providing support services. Our electrical and mechanical staff enable us to leverage knowledge and life cycle learnings of equipment, and our performance groups are proactively engaged in helping our customers to lower total well costs.
Finally, we are committed to a process I will call continuous evolution, where in-house technical resources collaborate with their operational counterparts to enhance existing technology by adding new capability and functionality, as well as leveraging data more effectively to the benefit of both our customer and the company. As in the past, we will continue to invest through the cycles. We have had great success in partnering with customers and moving ideas quickly into operational deployment. We are developing solutions that will add incremental capacity and/or capability to address market requirements, and we can do this in a scalable and cost-effective way by leveraging our uniform base of existing FlexRig designs to provide value for customers.
We've also taken leadership positions in other areas. Our many firsts include integrated casing running services, scripting of wells for enhanced reliability and efficiency, enhanced software control capability, integrated stick-slip mitigation and many other technology solutions that today are standard offerings.
The industry has also formed a consensus view that 1,500-horsepower AC drive, Tier 1 rigs provide the best drilling performance for drilling the most challenging horizontal wells. H&P's fleet has over 30% of the estimated 700 rigs in the U.S. market today that fit that description. We believe H&P's rigs are strategically placed and ready to mobilize quickly.
Let me use the Permian basin as the example of strategically placed and ready to mobilize quickly. The Permian, by all accounts, is the premier basin in the U.S. and somewhat argued in the top 3 of oil basins in the world. No drilling contractor has a stronger Tier 1 footprint there than H&P. Today, we have a total of 39 FlexRigs on contract in the Permian, more than our top 3 peers combined.
Additionally, we have over 60 idle FlexRigs available with 1,500-horsepower AC drive capability that are ready to work. Let me also make the point for ready to mobilize quickly. We've made prudent investments and taken great care to idle and maintain the FlexRigs properly. Field-tested processes are used to clean and preserve the equipment. In addition, the rigs have been assembled and maintained as needed, so we are ready for the most efficient and cost-effective deployment when the market improves.
For good or bad, H&P's Permian facility has become one of the photographic symbols of this downturn. And as many can see, our FlexRigs are standing tall and ready to go to work.
We often get questions regarding how quickly we can respond to demand with our idle fleet of FlexRigs. We feel very confident we are positioned better to respond than others as a result of the investments made in the fleet as described. Whatever the demand might be going forward, we believe we can grow our market share in an improving market as a result of the mentioned characteristics, strategic placement and the ready state of our rig fleet.
In addition to rigs being ready, an obvious need and a key advantage in ramping up activity is the availability of quality people. We have done everything in our power to keep our best people. Clearly, in a downturn of this magnitude, it is impossible to keep everyone. Like all companies in the energy sector, we've had to made significant cuts in spending and personnel. It has been very difficult to say goodbye to so many, but we are thankful for having such great people today and look forward to the opportunity of bringing back to work many of those former employees once the cycle turns.
Before turning the call back to Juan Pablo, I want to recognize that in the face of adversity, I've been very pleased with our folks' response in dealing with the downturn. Our focus has remained on doing the right things and retaining the right people to enhance our competitive advantages going forward.

278341,330156988,970398,"Helmerich & Payne, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, May 02, 2016",2016-05-02,"Earnings Calls","Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, John.The company reported $21 million in net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2016. Compensation from customers, corresponding to early termination of long-term contracts, once again allowed us to report quarterly profits. Nevertheless",1514,"Thank you, John.
The company reported $21 million in net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2016. Compensation from customers, corresponding to early termination of long-term contracts, once again allowed us to report quarterly profits. Nevertheless, market conditions continued to deteriorate and drilling activity for the company continued to decline.
Following are some comments on each of our drilling segments. Our U.S. land drilling operations generated approximately $63 million in segment operating income during the second fiscal quarter. The number of revenue days declined by approximately 20% as compared to the prior quarter, resulting in an average of close to 106 rigs generating revenue days during the second fiscal quarter. On average, approximately 84 of these rigs were under term contracts and approximately 22 rigs worked in the spot market. In addition to rigs that are no longer contracted and became idle during the quarter, several more rigs became idle that remain under long-term contracts and that are generating revenue days at standby-type day rates, protecting the expected daily cash margin during the term duration of the contracts. This increasing number of rigs with standby-type day rates represented approximately 17% of the rigs that were generating revenue days in the segment at the end of the second fiscal quarter.
Excluding the impact of early termination revenues, the average rig revenue per day declined by approximately 1% to $25,931 in the second fiscal quarter and the average rig expense per day increased by approximately 10% to $14,139, resulting in an average rig margin per day of $11,792 in the second fiscal quarter. The increase in the average rig expense per day was primarily attributable to the large number of rigs that became idle during the quarter, generating expenses related to personnel management and rig stacking, which were then allocated across a smaller number of revenue days for the quarter.
It was not a surprise to see our quarter-to-quarter daily expenses increase as we had guided toward $13,600 per day for the quarter. But the increase was higher-than-expected as we experienced some unfavorable volatility during the quarter, related to different type of expenses that we expect will return to more normal levels during the following quarter.
The segment generated approximately $80 million in revenues corresponding to early termination of long-term contracts during the second fiscal quarter. Given existing notifications for early terminations, we expect to generate over $80 million during the third fiscal quarter, about $20 million during the fourth fiscal quarter and over $40 million thereafter in early termination revenues. Nevertheless, about 60% of the mentioned early termination revenues that we expect to be recognized after the second fiscal quarter of 2016 are attributable to compensation that, as of March 31, had already been invoiced and collected and that is included in the current liability section of our March 31, 2016 balance sheet as deferred revenue. We cannot fully recognize the early termination revenue on a rig until all contractual customer options to pay that rig back to work at full day rates have expired.
Since the peak in late 2014, we have received early termination notifications for a total of 87 rigs under long-term contracts in the segment, up 10 rigs since our last conference call in late January.
Total early termination revenues related to these 87 contracts are now estimated at approximately $460 million, about $88 million of which corresponds to cash flow originally expected to be generated through normal operations during fiscal 2015, $183 million during fiscal 2016 and $189 million after that.
As of today, our 347 available rigs in the U.S. land segment include approximately 84 rigs generating revenue and 263 idle rigs. Included in the 84 rigs generating revenue are 77 rigs under term contracts, 72 of which are generating revenue days. In addition, 7 rigs are currently active in the spot market for a total of 79 rigs generating revenue days in the segment. Nevertheless, approximately 18% of these 79 rigs are now idle and on standby-type day rates protecting daily cash margins under long-term contracts. Separately, the 5 rigs generating revenue and not generating revenue days include newbuild rigs with deliveries that have been delayed in exchange for compensation from customers.
Looking ahead to the third quarter of fiscal 2016, we expect the decline in the range of 25% to 28% in the number of total revenue days quarter-to-quarter. Excluding the impact of revenues corresponding to early terminated long-term contracts, we expect our average rig revenue per day to decline to approximately $25,000, partly as a result of the relatively high proportion of rigs generating revenue days under standby-type day rates. The average rig expense per day is expected to decrease to roughly $13,800. This expected decrease is primarily attributable to a greater proportion of rigs on standby-type day rates, which is partly offset by expenses related to the growing proportion of total idle rigs.
Our third fiscal quarter average rig expense per day estimate also includes the impact of a relatively high level of expenses related to a significant ongoing reduction of field personnel positions and employee early retirements.
Absent any additional early terminations and excluding the mentioned rigs for which we have received early termination notifications, the segment currently has term contract commitments in place for an average of approximately 71 rigs during the third fiscal quarter, 69 rigs during the fourth fiscal quarter, 63 rigs during fiscal 2017 and 33 rigs during fiscal 2018. The average daily margins for these rigs that are currently under long-term contracts is expected to remain strong during the next several quarters as some rigs roll off and the remaining newbuilds are deployed.
The average pricing today for the 7 rigs in the spot market remains over 30% lower as compared to the spot pricing at the peak in late 2014.
Let me now transition to our offshore operations. Segment operating income declined to approximately $3 million from $8 million during the prior quarter. Total revenue days declined by about 6% and the average rig margin per day declined by about 7% to $7,346 per day during the second fiscal quarter. Most of the rigs that generated revenue during the second fiscal quarter were rigs that remained idle on customer-owned platforms and are generating standby-type day rates.
As we look at the third quarter of fiscal 2016, we expect quarterly revenue days to decline by approximately 8% as 7 of our 9 offshore platform rigs generate revenue days during the quarter. The average rig margin per day is expected to increase to approximately $8,000 during the third fiscal quarter. The expected decline in activity is attributable to a rig that will demobilize and stacked onshore during the second fiscal quarter.
Management contracts on platform rigs continued to contribute to our offshore segment operating income. Their contribution during the second fiscal quarter was approximately $2 million. Management contracts are expected to generate approximately $3 million during each of the remaining 2 quarters of fiscal 2016.
Moving on to our international land operations. This segment reported operating losses of approximately $2 million during the second fiscal quarter. The average rig margin per day decreased sequentially from $11,811 to $10,487 per day during the second fiscal quarter. Quarterly revenue days decreased sequentially by approximately 7% to 1,307 days during the same quarter.
As of today, our international land segment has 14 rigs generating revenue days including 10 in Argentina, 2 in the UAE, 1 in Colombia and 1 in Bahrain. All 14 rigs are under long-term contracts. The 24 remaining rigs are idle.
We expect international land quarterly revenue days to be slightly down by approximately 3% during the third quarter of fiscal 2016 and the average rig margin per day to slightly increase to approximately $11,000 per day.
Let me now comment on corporate level details. Our strong balance sheet and high liquidity position, along with our firm backlog of long-term contracts and reduced CapEx requirements, should continue to allow us to return cash to shareholders by sustaining the level of our regular dividend payments as previously discussed. Excluding rigs with long-term contracts that have already been early terminated and combining all 3 of our drilling segments, we currently have an average of approximately 99 rigs under term contracts expected to be active in fiscal 2016, 78 in fiscal 2017 and 47 in fiscal 2018. Our backlog level as of March 31, 2016, was at approximately $2.3 billion.
Capital expenditures for fiscal 2016 are now expected to be in the range of $300 million to $350 million as compared to our prior guidance of $300 million to $400 million. As mentioned in the past, we expect our total annual depreciation expense for fiscal 2016 to be approximately $580 million and our general and administrative expenses to be approximately $135 million. The effective income tax rate for the second quarter of fiscal 2016 was 32.6%, and we expect the effective tax rate for each of the remaining 2 quarters of fiscal 2016 to be in the range of 33% to 36%. 
With that, let me turn the call back to John."

So as far as just pure rig designs, and I'm speaking primarily to the drilling contractors, I'm not addressing some of the other rig designs out there described as futuristic-type designs, I'm speaking more to the contractors today. We continue to add technology, and we have over the past 10-plus years, we've continued to have innovations that improve our systems and we're continually upgrading and high-grading. So I sure wouldn't -- I wouldn't want to leave you with the impression that we're not looking at other designs and other opportunities. The fact of the matter is, I think, the industry has all of the Tier 1 type rig assets that are needed. The question is, which of those assets are going to work. Obviously, we feel very confident that our rigs are the ones that are going to be most sought after. So we are continuing to invest, but I don't see any real -- based on what I've seen, I don't see any real breakthroughs in terms of technologies that are being talked about out there."

But I think the other thing to keep in mind is, in contrast to previous cycles where really every rig out there was out there fighting for that type of work for the more difficult, unconventional horizontal wells, that's a fairly small subset, as you know, of the total rig fleet if you were to look back to the peak activity in October of 2014. So I think it's a -- we've described it as around 700 rigs or so, that are 1,500-horsepower and, of course, you're going to have a subset of those rigs that are going to the top performers, that are going to have the best equipment.

I think your overall assumption is true. Obviously, if we enter a recovery and we put rigs back to work, those rigs will probably go back to work at day rates and margins that relate closely to where we are in the spot market today. And as that happens, the impact of that will be probably negative on the margin as we have a higher proportion of rigs in the spot market going forward assuming, of course, that we -- there is that recovery. The only other factor that I'll mention is what John already mentioned and that is, that as we put rigs back to work and the total number of idle rigs begins to decline, that in general will have a favorable impact on margins as some of those fixed costs related to the idle fleet will start to be reabsorbed.

But that's yet one more moving piece as we go forward. I think what may be an important part of the question is, related to the rigs that we already have under term contracts and what those margins might be. And the answer to that is that the margins for the rigs that are on term contracts that are currently operating or that are on standby-type day rates, those are as strong as we expected. We have not seen any deterioration there as expected. Obviously, we benefited from early terminations in a very significant way. And so our backlog is a very important piece of the equation for us, and it has been strong and we expect for that to continue to be strong. But other expenses related to transitionary expenses, related to all of the aspects that we've already mentioned are also an important part of the equation.

Even though oil prices have pulled back over the past several weeks, it is still encouraging to see signs of optimism in the market. 
In May, the Baker Hughes U.S. land rig count hit a low of 380 rigs and had since increase from what everyone hopes was the absolute bottom of this market cycle. Recently, some E&P companies have announced budget increases and rig count additions. It is a positive sign, although many still remain on the sidelines. This has been an extraordinary downturn. Over 1,400 rigs have been idled in the U.S. and tens of thousands of industry participants have been laid off. The impact has been pervasive and has affected every enterprise within the industry. 
H&P remains very strong and has been proactive and effective in adjusting to this environment, but the declines in activity and spot pricing have significantly impacted our bottom line and the size of our organization. An improving market holds these two trends, I believe that H&P is uniquely positioned to grow market share in the increasingly complex drilling environment that will attend most, if not all, of the unconventional shale plays going forward. 
Operational excellence is one of our competitive advantages in capturing market share. Part of our core purpose is to manage and improve performance in all aspects of the well cycle and we continue to invest in tools and processes that will increase our reliability for customers. The industry had long held to a show-up and fix-it model when dealing with rig equipment downturn. But our model is preemptive and predictive. Developing systems that utilize predictive analytics, reduces nonproductive time, enhances reliability and optimizes operational performance. 
The complexity of horizontal shale wells demand advanced technology solutions to drive high levels of performance and reliability. Shale customers have high expectations and, concurrently, well complexity is increasing as a result of extended laterals. From a rig requirement perspective, extended laterals require more hydraulic horsepower and greater capability, which is why 1,500 horsepower AC rigs are the rig of choice. H&P has close to 50% of the available 1,500 horsepower AC rakes in U.S. land. So we're positioned very well in the market. We currently have 90 1,580 horsepower AC rigs under contract and 234 idle AC FlexRigs available to go to work. 
While we aren't building new rigs, we are investing to enhance capabilities that will benefit our customers in this more challenging and complex environment. Not only are we investing to enhance our fleet, we are having great success in partnering with customers and moving new ideas quickly into operational deployment. We can do this in a scalable and cost-effective way by leveraging our uniform base of existing FlexRig designs. Our spare capacity, combined with our strong balance sheet, gives us great flexibility to invest through cycle and with our eyes on the future. 
Before turning the call to Juan Pablo, I'd like to end by saying this downturn has lingered on for over 20 months. And very recently, some respected companies have called the bottom of the market. If that is the case, H&P has operational capacity to respond quickly, given the investments we have been making in the fleet and our organization throughout the cycle. Whatever the demand might be going forward, we believe that the strategies we are employing, coupled with our financial strength, give us superior competitive to grow market share in an improving market. We have the largest spare capacity of 1,500 horsepower AC rigs, strategically located in the strongest basins and an unmatched ready state of our rig fleet to return to work. 
And now I'll turn the call over to Juan Pablo."
278341,374129323,1015370,"Helmerich & Payne, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2016",2016-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, John. As reported this morning, the company had a net loss of approximately $21 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2016. Nevertheless, after 6 consecutive quarters of reduced drilling activity, we are now expecting slight quarter-to-qua",1691,"Thank you, John. As reported this morning, the company had a net loss of approximately $21 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2016. Nevertheless, after 6 consecutive quarters of reduced drilling activity, we are now expecting slight quarter-to-quarter improvements in the number of revenue days during the quarter fourth fiscal quarter. Following are some details on each of our 3 drilling segments. 
Our U.S. land drilling operations generated approximately $26 million in segment operating income during the third fiscal quarter. The number of revenue days declined by approximately 22% compared to the prior quarter, resulting in an average of close to 82 rigs generating revenue days within the third fiscal quarter. On average, approximately 72 of these rigs were under term contracts and approximately 10 rigs worked in the spot market. 
Excluding the impact of early termination revenues, the average rig revenue per day declined by approximately 5% to $24,684 in the third fiscal quarter as a proportion of rigs generating revenue days under standby type day rates increased significantly quarter-to-quarter. The average rig expense per day decreased by approximately 4% to $13,417, excluding employee severance expenses. The decrease in the average rig expense per day was also attributable to a greater proportion of rigs on standby type day rates, which was partly offset by expenses related to the growing proportion of total idle rigs. 
The corresponding average rig margin per day during the third fiscal quarter was $11,267. The segment generated approximately $81 million in revenues corresponding to early termination of long-term contracts during the third fiscal quarter. Given the existing notifications for early terminations, we expect to generate approximately $30 million during the fourth fiscal quarter and over $40 million thereafter in early termination revenues. 
Nevertheless, about half of the mentioned early termination revenues that we expect to be recognized after the third fiscal quarter of 2016 are attributable to compensation that as of June 30 had already been invoiced and collected and that is included in the current liability section of our June 30, 2016, balance sheet as deferred revenue. 
As mentioned in the past, we cannot fully recognize the early termination revenue on a rig until all contractual customer options take that rig back to work at full day rates have expired. Since the peak in late 2014, we have received early termination notifications for a total of a 88 rigs under long-term contracts in the segment, up 1 rig since our last conference call in early May. Total early termination revenues related to these 88 contracts are now estimated at approximately $466 million, about $88 million of which corresponds to cash flow originally expected to be generated through normal operations during fiscal 2015, $179 million during fiscal 2016 and $199 million after that. 
As of today, our 348 available rigs in the U.S. land segment include approximately 91 rigs generating revenue and 257 idle rigs. Included in the 91 rigs generating revenue are 72 rigs under term contracts, 67 of which are generating revenue days. In addition, 19 rigs are currently active in the spot market for a total of 86 rigs generating revenue days in the segment as compared to 78 rigs during our last update in early June. Nevertheless, approximately 14% of these 86 rigs are now idle and on standby type day rates, which protect daily margins under long-term contract. Separately, the 5 rigs that are not generating revenue days include new build rigs with deliveries that have been delayed in exchange for compensation from customers. Of note, the number of our rigs active in the spot market has increased from 8 to 19 rigs since our latest update in early June. 
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, we expect a quarter-to-quarter increase in the range of 3% to 7% in the number of total revenue days. Excluding the impact of revenues corresponding to early terminated long-term contracts, we expect our average rig revenue per day to decline to approximately $24,000, primarily as a result of a higher proportion of rigs working in the spot market. The average pricing today for the 19 rigs in the spot market is over 35% lower as compared to spot pricing at the peak in late 2014. The average rig expense per day is expected to decrease to roughly $13,300. This expected decrease is primarily attributable to ongoing efforts to effectively manage our costs. 
Absent any additional early terminations and excluding the mentioned rigs for which we have received early termination notifications, the segment currently has term contract commitments in place for an average of approximately 67 rigs during the fourth fiscal quarter, 62 rigs during fiscal 2017 and 34 rigs during fiscal 2018. The average daily margin for these rigs that are currently under term contract is expected to remain strong at over $50,000 per day during the next several quarters as some rigs roll off and the remaining new builds are deployed. 
Let me now transition to our offshore operations. Segment operating income slightly declined to approximately $2 million from $3 million during the prior quarter. Total revenue days declined by about 8% and the average rig margin per day increased by about 1% during the third fiscal quarter to $7,981 per day, excluding employee severance expenses. Most of the rigs that generated revenue during the third fiscal quarter were rigs that remained idle on customer owned platforms and are generating standby type day rates. 
As we look at the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, we expect quarterly revenue days to slightly increase by approximately 1% as 7 of our 9 offshore platform rigs continue to generate revenue days during the quarter. The average rig margin per day is expected to remain relatively flat at approximately $8,000 per day during the fourth fiscal quarter. 
Management contracts on platform rigs continue to contribute to our offshore segment operating income. Excluding the impact of employee severance expenses, their contribution during the third fiscal quarter was approximately $3 million. Management contracts are [indiscernible] quarters. 
Turning now to our international land operations. The segment reported operating loss of approximately $5 million during the third fiscal quarter. Excluding the impact of employee severance expenses, the average rig margin per day decreased sequentially by approximately 12% to $9,461 per day, partly as a result of a greater number of rigs generating standby type day rates during the third fiscal quarter. Quarterly revenue days decreased sequentially by approximately 3% to 1,274 days during the same quarter. As of today, our international land segment has 14 rigs generating revenue days, including 10 in Argentina, 2 in the UAE, 1 in Colombia and 1 and Bahrain. All 14 rigs are under a long-term contract. 
The 24 remaining rigs include 22 rigs that are idle and 2 rigs, 1 in Argentina and 1 in Colombia, that are now contracted and expected to commence operations during the quarter. We expect international land quarterly revenue days to increase by approximately 5% to 10% during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 and the average rig margin per day to decline to approximately $8,300 per day as a result of several factors, including a temporary rate reduction for one of our rigs. 
Let me now comment on corporate level details. We're pleased to announce -- we were pleased to announce last month a slight increase to our quarterly dividend to $0.70 per share. As previously discussed, our strong balance sheet and high liquidity position, along with our firm backlog of long-term contracts and reduced CapEx requirements should continue to allow us to sustain the level of our regular dividend payments during the foreseeable future. Excluding rigs with long-term contracts that have been early terminated and combining all 3 of our drilling segments, we currently have an average of approximately 77 rigs under term contracts expected to be active in fiscal 2017 and 47 in fiscal 2018. Our backlog level as of June 30, 2016, was approximately $2 billion. Capital expenditures for fiscal 2016 are expected to be in the range of $300 million to $350 million. 
We were also pleased to announced earlier this month a new 5-year $300 million revolving credit facility that essentially replaced a very similar facility issued in 2012 that was set to expire in May of 2017. Over recent years, we have only been using our revolving credit facility to support the issuance of letters of credit. We are reducing our total annual depreciation expense estimate for fiscal 2016 to approximately $565 million and we are increasing our total general and administrative expenses estimate to approximately $150 million. The reduction in the depreciation expense estimate is primarily attributable to a lower capital expenditure levels and to new arrangements and customer requested delivery delays related to some of our new build FlexRigs under long-term contracts. The increase in the G&A expenses estimate for the year is mostly attributable to items related to employee workforce reductions including required employer 401(k) plan matching contributions, pension settlements and employee severance expenses. The effective income tax rate for the first 9 months of fiscal 2016 was 63%, and we expect the effective tax rate for all of fiscal 2016 to be in the range of 75% to 80% at this point. These effective tax rates are higher than expected, primarily as a result of significantly reduced earnings before taxes, combined with prior year tax adjustments that impact this year's tax rate, such as the fiscal 2015 adjustment to the domestic production deduction mentioned earlier this year that resulted from a U.S. law -- from a U.S. tax law change in December 2015, extending bonus depreciation allowances that had expired December 31, 2014. 
You may recall that this bonus depreciation adjustment had the very favorable impact in reducing our cash tax obligations by roughly $60 million. This adjustment allowed us to benefit from a tax refund this year and to currently have a significant prepaid tax balance. 
The quarter-to-quarter increase in the line item Other Current Assets in our condensed balance sheet is primarily a result of the corresponding increase in prepaid taxes and taxes receivable. 
With that, let me turn the call back to John."

There is some concern and I think drives a little bit of -- lower confidence levels as it relates to this oil -- lower oil price environment."

It wasn't that long that we just delivered that last new build. So we can sure do that. Obviously, there's -- from a timing perspective, we could do that in '17, we can do it in '18, obviously, it's in require, I think -- it's going to require strong enough market to deliver much higher day rates than what we see today. I think in terms of the rig that we would build, I would think more than likely, it would be FlexRig5s as well as some other ideas that we have out there that, obviously, there's not the market to build those rigs into. But again, in an improving market, in a market that required more AC drive rigs or at least quality AC drive rigs, I think we'd be very well positioned to respond to that."

I think we felt pretty -- or consistently said that coming off of bottom pricing is going to be highly competitive. At the same time, as we described in our remarks, the drilling environment is becoming more and more complex, which means that contractors are having to upgrade rigs. And so I think that, in and of itself, would potentially drive some higher rates, again, not bottom but maybe earlier in the cycle. We've described or it's been described as 700 AC rigs at 1,500 horsepower. And I think, what is it, around 250 or so that are working today. Ballpark range, 250 to 300. So clearly, there will need to be some rigs that will go back -- need to go back to work in order to begin to drive pricing power. But again, I think this cycle is much different than previous cycles because the legacy rigs really aren't playing a role in that they're drilling -- I don't believe those rigs are targeting the more complex well designs. Most of the mechanical rigs, I think over 70% of the mechanical rigs have been reactivated since the the bottom of the cycle, assuming that is the bottom of the cycle. Most of those are going to vertical type work. So I know it's not a direct answer. I don't think anybody has a direct answer. But I think in general, it's going to be different than previous cycles. I do think pricing kicks in at a much lower rig count than what we've seen historically."

And not all rigs, not all AC rigs are capable of handling that sort of a setback upgrade. And so then you begin to ask yourself, do you really want to invest in 7,500 and then not also be able to do the setback. So there's a lot of variability. Fortunately, for us, we have that capability with our engineering staff and as I've mentioned earlier, the manufacturing capability. I think we're able to do that much more efficiently and more cost effectively than most. But no, I do. I think it's going to be a bigger driver.

Even though oil prices have pulled back over the past several weeks, it is still encouraging to see signs of optimism in the market. 
In May, the Baker Hughes U.S. land rig count hit a low of 380 rigs and has since increased from what everyone hopes was the absolute bottom of this market cycle. Recently, some E&P companies have announced budget increases and rig count additions. It is a positive sign, although many still remain on the sidelines. This has been an extraordinary downturn. Over 1,400 rigs have been idled in the U.S. and tens of thousands of industry participants have been laid off. The impact has been pervasive and has affected every enterprise within the industry. 
H&P remains very strong and has been proactive and effective in adjusting to this new environment, but the declines in activity and spot pricing have significantly impacted our bottom line and the size of our organization. An improving market halts these two trends, I believe that H&P is uniquely positioned to grow market share in the increasingly complex drilling environment that will attend most, if not all, of the unconventional shale plays going forward. 
Operational excellence is one of our competitive advantages in capturing market share. Part of our core purpose is to manage and improve performance and all aspects of the well cycle and we continue to invest in tools and processes that will increase our reliability for customers. The industry has long held to a show-up and fix-it model when dealing with rig equipment downturn. But our model is preemptive and predictive. Developing systems that utilize predictive analytics, reduces nonproductive time, enhances reliability and optimizes operational performance. 
The complexity of horizontal shale wells demand advanced technology solutions to drive high levels of performance and reliability. Shale customers have high expectations and concurrently, well complexity is increasing as a result of extended laterals. From a rig requirement perspective, extended laterals require more hydraulic horsepower and greater capability, which is why 1,500 horsepower AC rigs are the rig of choice. H&P has close to 50% of the available 1,500 horsepower AC rigs in U.S. land. So we're positioned very well in the market. We currently have 90 1,500 horsepower AC rigs under contract, and 234 idle AC FlexRigs available to go to work. 
While we aren't building new rigs, we are investing to enhance capabilities that will benefit our customers in this more challenging and complex environment. Not only are we investing to enhance our fleet, we are having great success in partnering with customers and moving new ideas quickly in their operational deployment. We can do this in a scalable and cost-effective way by leveraging our uniform base of existing FlexRig designs. Our spare capacity, combined with our strong balance sheet, gives us great flexibility to invest through the cycle and with our eyes on the future. 
Before turning the call to Juan Pablo, I'd like to end by saying this downturn has lingered on for over 20 months. And very recently, some respected companies have called the bottom of the market. If that is the case, H&P has the operational capacity to respond quickly, given the investments we have been making in the fleet and our organization throughout the cycle. Whatever the demand might be going forward, we believe that the strategies we are employing, coupled with our financial strength, give us superior competitive footing to grow market share in an improving market. We have the largest spare capacity of 1,500 horsepower AC rigs, strategically located in the strongest basins and an unmatched ready state of our rig fleet to return to work. 
And now I'll turn the call over to Juan Pablo."
278341,374129323,1015788,"Helmerich & Payne, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2016",2016-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, John. As reported this morning, the company had a net loss of approximately $21 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2016. Nevertheless, after 6 consecutive quarters of reduced drilling activity, we are now expecting slight quarter-to-qua",1689,"Thank you, John. As reported this morning, the company had a net loss of approximately $21 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2016. Nevertheless, after 6 consecutive quarters of reduced drilling activity, we are now expecting slight quarter-to-quarter improvements in the number of revenue days during the fourth fiscal quarter. Following are some details on each of our 3 drilling segments. 
Our U.S. land drilling operations generated approximately $26 million in segment operating income during the third fiscal quarter. The number of revenue days declined by approximately 22% compared to the prior quarter, resulting in an average of close to 82 rigs generating revenue days within the third fiscal quarter. On average, approximately 72 of these rigs were under term contracts and approximately 10 rigs worked in the spot market. 
Excluding the impact of early termination revenues, the average rig revenue per day declined by approximately 5% to $24,684 in the third fiscal quarter as a proportion of rigs generating revenue days under standby-type day rates increased significantly quarter-to-quarter. The average rig expense per day decreased by approximately 4% to $13,417, excluding employee severance expenses. The decrease in the average rig expense per day was also attributable to a greater proportion of rigs on standby-type day rates, which was partly offset by expenses related to the growing proportion of total idle rigs. The corresponding average rig margin per day during the third fiscal quarter was $11,267. 
The segment generated approximately $81 million in revenues corresponding to early termination of long-term contracts during the third fiscal quarter. Given the existing notifications for early terminations, we expect to generate approximately $30 million during the fourth fiscal quarter and over $40 million thereafter in early termination revenues. 
Nevertheless, about half of the mentioned early termination revenues that we expect to be recognized after the third fiscal quarter of 2016 are attributable to compensation that as of June 30 had already been invoiced and collected and that is included in the current liability section of our June 30, 2016, balance sheet as deferred revenue. 
As mentioned in the past, we cannot fully recognize the early termination revenue on a rig until all contractual customer options take that rig back to work at full day rates have expired. Since the peak in late 2014, we have received early termination notifications for a total of 88 rigs under long-term contracts in the segment, up one rig since our last conference call in early May. Total early termination revenues related to these 88 contracts are now estimated at approximately $466 million, about $88 million of which corresponds to cash flow originally expected to be generated through normal operations during fiscal 2015, $179 million during fiscal 2016 and $199 million after that. 
As of today, our 348 available rigs in the U.S. land segment include approximately 91 rigs generating revenue and 257 idle rigs. Included in the 91 rigs generating revenue are 72 rigs under term contracts, 67 of which are generating revenue days. In addition, 19 rigs are currently active in the spot market for a total of 86 rigs generating revenue days in the segment as compared to 78 rigs during our last update in early June. Nevertheless, approximately 14% of these 86 rigs are now idle and on standby-type day rates, which protect daily margins under long-term contracts. 
Separately, the 5 rigs that are not generating revenue days include new build rigs with deliveries that have been delayed in exchange for compensation from customers. Of note, the number of our rigs active in the spot market has increased from 8 to 19 rigs since our latest update in early June. 
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, we expect a quarter-to-quarter increase in the range of 3% to 7% in the number of total revenue days. Excluding the impact of revenues corresponding to early terminated long-term contracts, we expect our average rig revenue per day to decline to approximately $24,000, primarily as a result of a higher proportion of rigs working in the spot market. The average pricing today for the 19 rigs in the spot market is over 35% lower as compared to spot pricing at the peak in late 2014. The average rig expense per day is expected to decrease to roughly $13,300. This expected decrease is primarily attributable to ongoing efforts to effectively manage our costs. 
Absent any additional early terminations and excluding the mentioned rigs for which we have received early termination notifications, the segment currently has term contract commitments in place for an average of approximately 67 rigs during the fourth fiscal quarter, 62 rigs during fiscal 2017 and 34 rigs during fiscal 2018. The average daily margin for these rigs that are currently under term contracts is expected to remain strong at over $50,000 per day during the next several quarters as some rigs roll off and the remaining new builds are deployed.
Let me now transition to our offshore operations. Segment operating income slightly declined to approximately $2 million from $3 million during the prior quarter. Total revenue days declined by about 8% and the average rig margin per day increased by about 1% during the third fiscal quarter to $7,981 per day, excluding employee severance expenses. Most of the rigs that generated revenue during the third fiscal quarter were rigs that remained idle on customer-owned platforms and are generating standby-type day rates. 
As we look at the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, we expect quarterly revenue days to slightly increase by approximately 1% as 7 of our 9 offshore platform rigs continue to generate revenue days during the quarter. The average rig margin per day is expected to remain relatively flat at approximately $8,000 per day during the fourth fiscal quarter. 
Management contracts on platform rigs continue to contribute to our offshore segment operating income. Excluding the impact of employee severance expenses, their contribution during the third fiscal quarter was approximately $3 million. Management contracts are [indiscernible] in each of the next few quarters. 
Turning now to our international land operations. The segment reported operating loss of approximately $5 million during the third fiscal quarter. Excluding the impact of employee severance expenses, the average rig margin per day decreased sequentially by approximately 12% to $9,461 per day, partly as a result of a greater number of rigs generating standby-type day rates during the third fiscal quarter. Quarterly revenue days decreased sequentially by approximately 3% to 1,274 days during the same quarter. As of today, our international land segment has 14 rigs generating revenue days, including 10 in Argentina, 2 in the UAE, one in Colombia and one in Bahrain. All 14 rigs are under a long-term contract. 
The 24 remaining rigs include 22 rigs that are idle and 2 rigs, one in Argentina and one in Colombia, that are now contracted and expected to commence operations during the quarter. We expect international land quarterly revenue days to increase by approximately 5% to 10% during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 and the average rig margin per day to decline to approximately $8,300 per day as a result of several factors, including a temporary rate reduction for one of our rigs.
Let me now comment on corporate level details. We're pleased to announce -- we were pleased to announce last month a slight increase to our quarterly dividend to $0.70 per share. As previously discussed, our strong balance sheet and high liquidity position, along with our firm backlog of long-term contracts and reduced CapEx requirements should continue to allow us to sustain the level of our regular dividend payments during the foreseeable future. Excluding rigs with long-term contracts that have been early terminated and combining all 3 of our drilling segments, we currently have an average of approximately 77 rigs under term contracts expected to be active in fiscal 2017 and 47 in fiscal 2018. Our backlog level as of June 30, 2016, was approximately $2 billion. Capital expenditures for fiscal 2016 are expected to be in the range of $300 million to $350 million. 
We were also pleased to announced earlier this month a new 5-year $300 million revolving credit facility that essentially replaced a very similar facility issued in 2012 that was set to expire in May of 2017. Over recent years, we have only been using our revolving credit facility to support the issuance of letters of credit. 
We are reducing our total annual depreciation expense estimate for fiscal 2016 to approximately $565 million, and we are increasing our total general and administrative expenses estimate to approximately $150 million. The reduction in the depreciation expense estimate is primarily attributable to a lower capital expenditure levels and to new arrangements and customer requested delivery delays related to some of our new build FlexRigs under long-term contracts. 
The increase in the G&A expenses estimate for the year is mostly attributable to items related to employee workforce reductions, including required employer 401(k) plan matching contributions, pension settlements and employee severance expenses. The effective income tax rate for the first 9 months of fiscal 2016 was 63%, and we expect the effective tax rate for all of fiscal 2016 to be in the range of 75% to 80% at this point. These effective tax rates are higher than expected, primarily as a result of significantly reduced earnings before taxes, combined with prior year tax adjustments that impact this year's tax rate, such as the fiscal 2015 adjustment to the domestic production deduction mentioned earlier this year that resulted from a U.S. law -- from a U.S. tax law change in December 2015, extending bonus depreciation allowances that had expired December 31, 2014. 
You may recall that this bonus depreciation adjustment had a very favorable impact in reducing our cash tax obligations by roughly $60 million. This adjustment allowed us to benefit from a tax refund this year and to currently have a significant prepaid tax balance. 
The quarter-to-quarter increase in the line item Other Current Assets in our condensed balance sheet is primarily a result of the corresponding increase in prepaid taxes and taxes receivable. 
With that, let me turn the call back to John."

We have reactivated 14 rigs in the spot market, 10 are FlexRig3s and 4 are FlexRig5s, and approximately 75% are pad-capable with 7,500 psi capability. 
In addition, we've added 6 new customers in the past quarter. One of the benefits of a downturn is having more opportunities to introduce and attract new customers to FlexRig technology. So we're hopeful the market has made its bottom, but regardless of the timing, we will continue to make every effort to emerge from this as a stronger company for customers, employees and shareholders.

Obviously, there's -- from a timing perspective, we could do that in '17, we can do it in '18, obviously, it's going to require, I think -- it's going to require a strong enough market to deliver much higher day rates than what we see today. I think in terms of the rig that we would build, I would think more than likely, it would be FlexRig5s as well as some other ideas that we have out there that, obviously, there's not the market to build those style of rigs into.

I think we felt pretty -- or consistently said that coming off of bottom pricing is going to be highly competitive. At the same time, as we described in our remarks, the drilling environment is becoming more and more complex, which means that contractors are having to upgrade rigs. And so I think that, in and of itself, would potentially drive some higher rates, again, not right off bottom, but maybe earlier in the cycle. We've described or it's been described as 700 AC rigs that are 1,500 horsepower. And I think, what is it, around 250 or so that are working today. Ballpark range, 250 to 300. So clearly, there will need to be some rigs that will go back -- need to go back to work in order to begin to drive pricing power. But again, I think this cycle is much different than previous cycles because the legacy rigs really aren't playing a role in that, they're drilling. I don't believe those rigs are targeting the more complex well designs. Most of the mechanical rigs, I think over 70% of the mechanical rigs that have been reactivated since the bottom of the cycle, assuming that is the bottom of the cycle. Most of those are going to vertical-type work. So I know it's not a direct answer. I don't think anybody has a direct answer. But I think, in general, it's going to be different than previous cycles. I do think pricing kicks in at a much lower rig count than what we've seen historically."

I think eventually, that begins to work itself out after putting a number of rigs to work.

Even though oil prices have pulled back over the past several weeks, it is still encouraging to see signs of optimism in the market. 
In May, the Baker Hughes U.S. land rig count hit a low of 380 rigs and has since increased from what everyone hopes was the absolute bottom of this market cycle. Recently, some E&P companies have announced budget increases and rig count additions. It is a positive sign, although many still remain on the sidelines. This has been an extraordinary downturn. Over 1,400 rigs have been idled in the U.S. and tens of thousands of industry participants have been laid off. The impact has been pervasive and has affected every enterprise within the industry. 
H&P remains very strong and has been proactive and effective in adjusting to this new environment, but the declines in activity and spot pricing have significantly impacted our bottom line and the size of our organization. An improving market halts these two trends, I believe that H&P is uniquely positioned to grow market share in the increasingly complex drilling environment that will attend most, if not all, of the unconventional shale plays going forward. 
Operational excellence is one of our competitive advantages in capturing market share. Part of our core purpose is to manage and improve performance and all aspects of the well cycle and we continue to invest in tools and processes that will increase our reliability for customers. The industry has long held to a show-up and fix-it model when dealing with rig equipment downtime. But our model is preemptive and predictive. Developing systems that utilize predictive analytics, reduces nonproductive time, enhances reliability and optimizes operational performance. 
The complexity of horizontal shale wells demand advanced technology solutions to drive high levels of performance and reliability. Shale customers have high expectations and concurrently, well complexity is increasing as a result of extended laterals. From a rig requirement perspective, extended laterals require more hydraulic horsepower and greater capability, which is why 1,500 horsepower AC rigs are the rig of choice. H&P has close to 50% of the available 1,500 horsepower AC rigs in U.S. land. So we're positioned very well in the market. We currently have 90 1,500 horsepower AC rigs under contract, and 234 idle AC FlexRigs available to go to work. 
While we aren't building new rigs, we are investing to enhance capabilities that will benefit our customers in this more challenging and complex environment. Not only are we investing to enhance our fleet, we are having great success in partnering with customers and moving new ideas quickly in their operational deployment. We can do this in a scalable and cost-effective way by leveraging our uniform base of existing FlexRig designs. Our spare capacity, combined with our strong balance sheet, gives us great flexibility to invest through the cycle and with our eyes on the future. 
Before turning the call to Juan Pablo, I'd like to end by saying this downturn has lingered on for over 20 months. And very recently, some respected companies have called the bottom of the market. If that is the case, H&P has the operational capacity to respond quickly, given the investments we have been making in the fleet and our organization throughout the cycle. Whatever the demand might be going forward, we believe that the strategies we are employing, coupled with our financial strength, give us superior competitive footing to grow market share in an improving market. We have the largest spare capacity of 1,500 horsepower AC rigs, strategically located in the strongest basins and an unmatched ready state of our rig fleet to return to work. 
And now I'll turn the call over to Juan Pablo."

As reported this morning, the company had a net loss of approximately $21 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2016. Nevertheless, after 6 consecutive quarters of reduced drilling activity, we are now expecting slight quarter-to-qua",1689,"Thank you, John. As reported this morning, the company had a net loss of approximately $21 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2016. Nevertheless, after 6 consecutive quarters of reduced drilling activity, we are now expecting slight quarter-to-quarter improvements in the number of revenue days during the fourth fiscal quarter. Following are some details on each of our 3 drilling segments. 
Our U.S. land drilling operations generated approximately $26 million in segment operating income during the third fiscal quarter. The number of revenue days declined by approximately 22% compared to the prior quarter, resulting in an average of close to 82 rigs generating revenue days within the third fiscal quarter. On average, approximately 72 of these rigs were under term contracts and approximately 10 rigs worked in the spot market. 
Excluding the impact of early termination revenues, the average rig revenue per day declined by approximately 5% to $24,684 in the third fiscal quarter as a proportion of rigs generating revenue days under standby-type day rates increased significantly quarter-to-quarter. The average rig expense per day decreased by approximately 4% to $13,417, excluding employee severance expenses. The decrease in the average rig expense per day was also attributable to a greater proportion of rigs on standby-type day rates, which was partly offset by expenses related to the growing proportion of total idle rigs. The corresponding average rig margin per day during the third fiscal quarter was $11,267. 
The segment generated approximately $81 million in revenues corresponding to early termination of long-term contracts during the third fiscal quarter. Given the existing notifications for early terminations, we expect to generate approximately $30 million during the fourth fiscal quarter and over $40 million thereafter in early termination revenues. 
Nevertheless, about half of the mentioned early termination revenues that we expect to be recognized after the third fiscal quarter of 2016 are attributable to compensation that as of June 30 had already been invoiced and collected and that is included in the current liability section of our June 30, 2016, balance sheet as deferred revenue. 
As mentioned in the past, we cannot fully recognize the early termination revenue on a rig until all contractual customer options take that rig back to work at full day rates have expired. Since the peak in late 2014, we have received early termination notifications for a total of 88 rigs under long-term contracts in the segment, up one rig since our last conference call in early May. Total early termination revenues related to these 88 contracts are now estimated at approximately $466 million, about $88 million of which corresponds to cash flow originally expected to be generated through normal operations during fiscal 2015, $179 million during fiscal 2016 and $199 million after that. 
As of today, our 348 available rigs in the U.S. land segment include approximately 91 rigs generating revenue and 257 idle rigs. Included in the 91 rigs generating revenue are 72 rigs under term contracts, 67 of which are generating revenue days. In addition, 19 rigs are currently active in the spot market for a total of 86 rigs generating revenue days in the segment as compared to 78 rigs during our last update in early June. Nevertheless, approximately 14% of these 86 rigs are now idle and on standby-type day rates, which protect daily margins under long-term contracts. 
Separately, the 5 rigs that are not generating revenue days include new build rigs with deliveries that have been delayed in exchange for compensation from customers. Of note, the number of our rigs active in the spot market has increased from 8 to 19 rigs since our latest update in early June. 
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, we expect a quarter-to-quarter increase in the range of 3% to 7% in the number of total revenue days. Excluding the impact of revenues corresponding to early terminated long-term contracts, we expect our average rig revenue per day to decline to approximately $24,000, primarily as a result of a higher proportion of rigs working in the spot market. The average pricing today for the 19 rigs in the spot market is over 35% lower as compared to spot pricing at the peak in late 2014. The average rig expense per day is expected to decrease to roughly $13,300. This expected decrease is primarily attributable to ongoing efforts to effectively manage our costs. 
Absent any additional early terminations and excluding the mentioned rigs for which we have received early termination notifications, the segment currently has term contract commitments in place for an average of approximately 67 rigs during the fourth fiscal quarter, 62 rigs during fiscal 2017 and 34 rigs during fiscal 2018. The average daily margin for these rigs that are currently under term contracts is expected to remain strong at over $15,000 per day during the next several quarters as some rigs roll off and the remaining new builds are deployed.
Let me now transition to our offshore operations. Segment operating income slightly declined to approximately $2 million from $3 million during the prior quarter. Total revenue days declined by about 8% and the average rig margin per day increased by about 1% during the third fiscal quarter to $7,981 per day, excluding employee severance expenses. Most of the rigs that generated revenue during the third fiscal quarter were rigs that remained idle on customer-owned platforms and are generating standby-type day rates. 
As we look at the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, we expect quarterly revenue days to slightly increase by approximately 1% as 7 of our 9 offshore platform rigs continue to generate revenue days during the quarter. The average rig margin per day is expected to remain relatively flat at approximately $8,000 per day during the fourth fiscal quarter. 
Management contracts on platform rigs continue to contribute to our offshore segment operating income. Excluding the impact of employee severance expenses, their contribution during the third fiscal quarter was approximately $3 million. Management contracts are [indiscernible] in each of the next few quarters. 
Turning now to our international land operations. The segment reported operating loss of approximately $5 million during the third fiscal quarter. Excluding the impact of employee severance expenses, the average rig margin per day decreased sequentially by approximately 12% to $9,461 per day, partly as a result of a greater number of rigs generating standby-type day rates during the third fiscal quarter. Quarterly revenue days decreased sequentially by approximately 3% to 1,274 days during the same quarter. As of today, our international land segment has 14 rigs generating revenue days, including 10 in Argentina, 2 in the UAE, one in Colombia and one in Bahrain. All 14 rigs are under a long-term contract. 
The 24 remaining rigs include 22 rigs that are idle and 2 rigs, one in Argentina and one in Colombia, that are now contracted and expected to commence operations during the quarter. We expect international land quarterly revenue days to increase by approximately 5% to 10% during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 and the average rig margin per day to decline to approximately $8,300 per day as a result of several factors, including a temporary rate reduction for one of our rigs.
Let me now comment on corporate level details. We're pleased to announce -- we were pleased to announce last month a slight increase to our quarterly dividend to $0.70 per share. As previously discussed, our strong balance sheet and high liquidity position, along with our firm backlog of long-term contracts and reduced CapEx requirements should continue to allow us to sustain the level of our regular dividend payments during the foreseeable future. Excluding rigs with long-term contracts that have been early terminated and combining all 3 of our drilling segments, we currently have an average of approximately 77 rigs under term contracts expected to be active in fiscal 2017 and 47 in fiscal 2018. Our backlog level as of June 30, 2016, was approximately $2 billion. Capital expenditures for fiscal 2016 are expected to be in the range of $300 million to $350 million. 
We were also pleased to announced earlier this month a new 5-year $300 million revolving credit facility that essentially replaced a very similar facility issued in 2012 that was set to expire in May of 2017. Over recent years, we have only been using our revolving credit facility to support the issuance of letters of credit. 
We are reducing our total annual depreciation expense estimate for fiscal 2016 to approximately $565 million, and we are increasing our total general and administrative expenses estimate to approximately $150 million. The reduction in the depreciation expense estimate is primarily attributable to a lower capital expenditure levels and to new arrangements and customer requested delivery delays related to some of our new build FlexRigs under long-term contracts. 
The increase in the G&A expenses estimate for the year is mostly attributable to items related to employee workforce reductions, including required employer 401(k) plan matching contributions, pension settlements and employee severance expenses. The effective income tax rate for the first 9 months of fiscal 2016 was 63%, and we expect the effective tax rate for all of fiscal 2016 to be in the range of 75% to 80% at this point. These effective tax rates are higher than expected, primarily as a result of significantly reduced earnings before taxes, combined with prior year tax adjustments that impact this year's tax rate, such as the fiscal 2015 adjustment to the domestic production deduction mentioned earlier this year that resulted from a U.S. law -- from a U.S. tax law change in December 2015, extending bonus depreciation allowances that had expired December 31, 2014. 
You may recall that this bonus depreciation adjustment had a very favorable impact in reducing our cash tax obligations by roughly $60 million. This adjustment allowed us to benefit from a tax refund this year and to currently have a significant prepaid tax balance. 
The quarter-to-quarter increase in the line item Other Current Assets in our condensed balance sheet is primarily a result of the corresponding increase in prepaid taxes and taxes receivable. 
With that, let me turn the call back to John."

As we've mentioned previously, we're utilizing that manufacturing capability today and we have, really, throughout the downturn, but we've been utilizing that manufacturing capability to upgrade rigs with 7,500 psi. Some setback upgrades. Just overall, looking at upgrading the fleet is needed in order to meet the challenges. Clearly, we could start back up and get our manufacturing capability up and running. It wasn't that long that we just delivered that last new build. So we can sure do that. Obviously, there's -- from a timing perspective, we could do that in '17, we can do it in '18, obviously, it's going to require, I think -- it's going to require a strong enough market to deliver much higher day rates than what we see today. I think in terms of the rig that we would build, I would think more than likely, it would be FlexRig5s as well as some other ideas that we have out there that, obviously, there's not the market to build those style of rigs into. But again, in an improving market, in a market that required more AC drive rigs or at least quality AC drive rigs, I think we'd be very well positioned to respond to that."

I think we felt pretty -- or consistently said that coming off of bottom pricing is going to be highly competitive. At the same time, as we described in our remarks, the drilling environment is becoming more and more complex, which means that contractors are having to upgrade rigs. And so I think that, in and of itself, would potentially drive some higher rates, again, not right off bottom, but maybe earlier in the cycle. We've described or it's been described as 700 AC rigs that are 1,500 horsepower. And I think, what is it, around 250 or so that are working today. Ballpark range, 250 to 300. So clearly, there will need to be some rigs that will go back -- need to go back to work in order to begin to drive pricing power. But again, I think this cycle is much different than previous cycles because the legacy rigs really aren't playing a role in that, they're drilling. I don't believe those rigs are targeting the more complex well designs. Most of the mechanical rigs, I think over 70% of the mechanical rigs that have been reactivated since the bottom of the cycle, assuming that is the bottom of the cycle. Most of those are going to vertical-type work. So I know it's not a direct answer. I don't think anybody has a direct answer. But I think, in general, it's going to be different than previous cycles. I do think pricing kicks in at a much lower rig count than what we've seen historically."

It's not just 7,500, it's also upgrading setback capacity to be able to handle, as an example, 25,000 foot of setback of 5-inch drill pipe. And not all rigs, not all AC rigs are capable of handling that sort of a setback upgrade. And so then you begin to ask yourself, do you really want to invest in 7,500 and then not also be able to do the setback. So there's a lot of variability. Fortunately, for us, we have that capability with our engineering staff and as I've mentioned earlier, the manufacturing capability. I think we're able to do that much more efficiently and more cost effectively than most. But no, I do. I think it's going to be a bigger driver. I don't think it's a situation where every rig necessarily needs 7,500 psi, but you'll begin to see more and more."

Thank you for joining us on the call. Even though oil prices have pulled back over the past several weeks, it is still encouraging to see signs of optimism in the market.

Even though oil prices have pulled back over the past several weeks, it is still encouraging to see signs of optimism in the market. 
In May, the Baker Hughes U.S. land rig count hit a low of 380 rigs and has since increased from what everyone hopes was the absolute bottom of this market cycle. Recently, some E&P companies have announced budget increases and rig count additions. It is a positive sign, although many still remain on the sidelines. This has been an extraordinary downturn. Over 1,400 rigs have been idled in the U.S. and tens of thousands of industry participants have been laid off. The impact has been pervasive and has affected every enterprise within the industry. 
H&P remains very strong and has been proactive and effective in adjusting to this new environment, but the declines in activity and spot pricing have significantly impacted our bottom line and the size of our organization. An improving market halts these two trends, I believe that H&P is uniquely positioned to grow market share in the increasingly complex drilling environment that will attend most, if not all, of the unconventional shale plays going forward. 
Operational excellence is one of our competitive advantages in capturing market share. Part of our core purpose is to manage and improve performance and all aspects of the well cycle and we continue to invest in tools and processes that will increase our reliability for customers. The industry has long held to a show-up and fix-it model when dealing with rig equipment downtime. But our model is preemptive and predictive. Developing systems that utilize predictive analytics, reduces nonproductive time, enhances reliability and optimizes operational performance. 
The complexity of horizontal shale wells demand advanced technology solutions to drive high levels of performance and reliability. Shale customers have high expectations and concurrently, well complexity is increasing as a result of extended laterals. From a rig requirement perspective, extended laterals require more hydraulic horsepower and greater capability, which is why 1,500 horsepower AC rigs are the rig of choice. H&P has close to 50% of the available 1,500 horsepower AC rigs in U.S. land. So we're positioned very well in the market. We currently have 90 1,500 horsepower AC rigs under contract, and 234 idle AC FlexRigs available to go to work. 
While we aren't building new rigs, we are investing to enhance capabilities that will benefit our customers in this more challenging and complex environment. Not only are we investing to enhance our fleet, we are having great success in partnering with customers and moving new ideas quickly in their operational deployment. We can do this in a scalable and cost-effective way by leveraging our uniform base of existing FlexRig designs. Our spare capacity, combined with our strong balance sheet, gives us great flexibility to invest through the cycle and with our eyes on the future. 
Before turning the call to Juan Pablo, I'd like to end by saying this downturn has lingered on for over 20 months. And very recently, some respected companies have called the bottom of the market. If that is the case, H&P has the operational capacity to respond quickly, given the investments we have been making in the fleet and our organization throughout the cycle. Whatever the demand might be going forward, we believe that the strategies we are employing, coupled with our financial strength, give us superior competitive footing to grow market share in an improving market.

278341,374129323,1017889,"Helmerich & Payne, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2016",2016-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, John. As reported this morning, the company had a net loss of approximately $21 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2016. Nevertheless, after 6 consecutive quarters of reduced drilling activity, we are now expecting slight quarter-to-qua",1689,"Thank you, John. As reported this morning, the company had a net loss of approximately $21 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2016. Nevertheless, after 6 consecutive quarters of reduced drilling activity, we are now expecting slight quarter-to-quarter improvements in the number of revenue days during the fourth fiscal quarter. Following are some details on each of our 3 drilling segments. 
Our U.S. land drilling operations generated approximately $26 million in segment operating income during the third fiscal quarter. The number of revenue days declined by approximately 22% compared to the prior quarter, resulting in an average of close to 82 rigs generating revenue days within the third fiscal quarter. On average, approximately 72 of these rigs were under term contracts and approximately 10 rigs worked in the spot market. 
Excluding the impact of early termination revenues, the average rig revenue per day declined by approximately 5% to $24,684 in the third fiscal quarter as a proportion of rigs generating revenue days under standby-type day rates increased significantly quarter-to-quarter. The average rig expense per day decreased by approximately 4% to $13,417, excluding employee severance expenses. The decrease in the average rig expense per day was also attributable to a greater proportion of rigs on standby-type day rates, which was partly offset by expenses related to the growing proportion of total idle rigs. The corresponding average rig margin per day during the third fiscal quarter was $11,267. 
The segment generated approximately $81 million in revenues corresponding to early termination of long-term contracts during the third fiscal quarter. Given the existing notifications for early terminations, we expect to generate approximately $30 million during the fourth fiscal quarter and over $40 million thereafter in early termination revenues. 
Nevertheless, about half of the mentioned early termination revenues that we expect to be recognized after the third fiscal quarter of 2016 are attributable to compensation that as of June 30 had already been invoiced and collected and that is included in the current liability section of our June 30, 2016, balance sheet as deferred revenue. 
As mentioned in the past, we cannot fully recognize the early termination revenue on a rig until all contractual customer options take that rig back to work at full day rates have expired. Since the peak in late 2014, we have received early termination notifications for a total of 88 rigs under long-term contracts in the segment, up one rig since our last conference call in early May. Total early termination revenues related to these 88 contracts are now estimated at approximately $466 million, about $88 million of which corresponds to cash flow originally expected to be generated through normal operations during fiscal 2015, $179 million during fiscal 2016 and $199 million after that. 
As of today, our 348 available rigs in the U.S. land segment include approximately 91 rigs generating revenue and 257 idle rigs. Included in the 91 rigs generating revenue are 72 rigs under term contracts, 67 of which are generating revenue days. In addition, 19 rigs are currently active in the spot market for a total of 86 rigs generating revenue days in the segment as compared to 78 rigs during our last update in early June. Nevertheless, approximately 14% of these 86 rigs are now idle and on standby-type day rates, which protect daily margins under long-term contracts. 
Separately, the 5 rigs that are not generating revenue days include new build rigs with deliveries that have been delayed in exchange for compensation from customers. Of note, the number of our rigs active in the spot market has increased from 8 to 19 rigs since our latest update in early June. 
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, we expect a quarter-to-quarter increase in the range of 3% to 7% in the number of total revenue days. Excluding the impact of revenues corresponding to early terminated long-term contracts, we expect our average rig revenue per day to decline to approximately $24,000, primarily as a result of a higher proportion of rigs working in the spot market. The average pricing today for the 19 rigs in the spot market is over 35% lower as compared to spot pricing at the peak in late 2014. The average rig expense per day is expected to decrease to roughly $13,300. This expected decrease is primarily attributable to ongoing efforts to effectively manage our costs. 
Absent any additional early terminations and excluding the mentioned rigs for which we have received early termination notifications, the segment currently has term contract commitments in place for an average of approximately 67 rigs during the fourth fiscal quarter, 62 rigs during fiscal 2017 and 34 rigs during fiscal 2018. The average daily margin for these rigs that are currently under term contracts is expected to remain strong at over $15,000 per day during the next several quarters as some rigs roll off and the remaining new builds are deployed.
Let me now transition to our offshore operations. Segment operating income slightly declined to approximately $2 million from $3 million during the prior quarter. Total revenue days declined by about 8% and the average rig margin per day increased by about 1% during the third fiscal quarter to $7,981 per day, excluding employee severance expenses. Most of the rigs that generated revenue during the third fiscal quarter were rigs that remained idle on customer-owned platforms and are generating standby-type day rates. 
As we look at the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, we expect quarterly revenue days to slightly increase by approximately 1% as 7 of our 9 offshore platform rigs continue to generate revenue days during the quarter. The average rig margin per day is expected to remain relatively flat at approximately $8,000 per day during the fourth fiscal quarter. 
Management contracts on platform rigs continue to contribute to our offshore segment operating income. Excluding the impact of employee severance expenses, their contribution during the third fiscal quarter was approximately $3 million. Management contracts are [indiscernible] in each of the next few quarters. 
Turning now to our international land operations. The segment reported operating loss of approximately $5 million during the third fiscal quarter. Excluding the impact of employee severance expenses, the average rig margin per day decreased sequentially by approximately 12% to $9,461 per day, partly as a result of a greater number of rigs generating standby-type day rates during the third fiscal quarter. Quarterly revenue days decreased sequentially by approximately 3% to 1,274 days during the same quarter. As of today, our international land segment has 14 rigs generating revenue days, including 10 in Argentina, 2 in the UAE, one in Colombia and one in Bahrain. All 14 rigs are under a long-term contract. 
The 24 remaining rigs include 22 rigs that are idle and 2 rigs, one in Argentina and one in Colombia, that are now contracted and expected to commence operations during the quarter. We expect international land quarterly revenue days to increase by approximately 5% to 10% during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 and the average rig margin per day to decline to approximately $8,300 per day as a result of several factors, including a temporary rate reduction for one of our rigs.
Let me now comment on corporate level details. We're pleased to announce -- we were pleased to announce last month a slight increase to our quarterly dividend to $0.70 per share. As previously discussed, our strong balance sheet and high liquidity position, along with our firm backlog of long-term contracts and reduced CapEx requirements should continue to allow us to sustain the level of our regular dividend payments during the foreseeable future. Excluding rigs with long-term contracts that have been early terminated and combining all 3 of our drilling segments, we currently have an average of approximately 77 rigs under term contracts expected to be active in fiscal 2017 and 47 in fiscal 2018. Our backlog level as of June 30, 2016, was approximately $2 billion. Capital expenditures for fiscal 2016 are expected to be in the range of $300 million to $350 million. 
We were also pleased to announced earlier this month a new 5-year $300 million revolving credit facility that essentially replaced a very similar facility issued in 2012 that was set to expire in May of 2017. Over recent years, we have only been using our revolving credit facility to support the issuance of letters of credit. 
We are reducing our total annual depreciation expense estimate for fiscal 2016 to approximately $565 million, and we are increasing our total general and administrative expenses estimate to approximately $150 million. The reduction in the depreciation expense estimate is primarily attributable to a lower capital expenditure levels and to new arrangements and customer requested delivery delays related to some of our new build FlexRigs under long-term contracts. 
The increase in the G&A expenses estimate for the year is mostly attributable to items related to employee workforce reductions, including required employer 401(k) plan matching contributions, pension settlements and employee severance expenses. The effective income tax rate for the first 9 months of fiscal 2016 was 63%, and we expect the effective tax rate for all of fiscal 2016 to be in the range of 75% to 80% at this point. These effective tax rates are higher than expected, primarily as a result of significantly reduced earnings before taxes, combined with prior year tax adjustments that impact this year's tax rate, such as the fiscal 2015 adjustment to the domestic production deduction mentioned earlier this year that resulted from a U.S. law -- from a U.S. tax law change in December 2015, extending bonus depreciation allowances that had expired December 31, 2014. 
You may recall that this bonus depreciation adjustment had a very favorable impact in reducing our cash tax obligations by roughly $60 million. This adjustment allowed us to benefit from a tax refund this year and to currently have a significant prepaid tax balance. 
The quarter-to-quarter increase in the line item Other Current Assets in our condensed balance sheet is primarily a result of the corresponding increase in prepaid taxes and taxes receivable. 
With that, let me turn the call back to John."

In addition, we've added 6 new customers in the past quarter. One of the benefits of a downturn is having more opportunities to introduce and attract new customers to FlexRig technology.

It wasn't that long that we just delivered that last new build. So we can sure do that. Obviously, there's -- from a timing perspective, we could do that in '17, we can do it in '18, obviously, it's going to require, I think -- it's going to require a strong enough market to deliver much higher day rates than what we see today. I think in terms of the rig that we would build, I would think more than likely, it would be FlexRig5s as well as some other ideas that we have out there that, obviously, there's not the market to build those style of rigs into.

I think we felt pretty -- or consistently said that coming off of bottom pricing is going to be highly competitive. At the same time, as we described in our remarks, the drilling environment is becoming more and more complex, which means that contractors are having to upgrade rigs. And so I think that, in and of itself, would potentially drive some higher rates, again, not right off bottom, but maybe earlier in the cycle. We've described or it's been described as 700 AC rigs that are 1,500 horsepower. And I think, what is it, around 250 or so that are working today. Ballpark range, 250 to 300. So clearly, there will need to be some rigs that will go back -- need to go back to work in order to begin to drive pricing power. But again, I think this cycle is much different than previous cycles because the legacy rigs really aren't playing a role in that, they're drilling. I don't believe those rigs are targeting the more complex well designs. Most of the mechanical rigs, I think over 70% of the mechanical rigs that have been reactivated since the bottom of the cycle, assuming that is the bottom of the cycle. Most of those are going to vertical-type work. So I know it's not a direct answer. I don't think anybody has a direct answer. But I think, in general, it's going to be different than previous cycles. I do think pricing kicks in at a much lower rig count than what we've seen historically."

I think eventually, that begins to work itself out after putting a number of rigs to work. And particularly, when you see some early examples of companies with low rates and low performing rigs, that's not a good combination when you're drilling the types of wells that are being drilled out there. And I think that's really what you'll see. And I think that has the impact of beginning to improve pricing."

We're pleased to deliver better-than-expected quarterly operational results in the midst of this improving U.S. land market. Our goal is to safely provide performance-driven drilling services, and as we think about the future, I think it's helpful to step back and properly frame where the company is today.
There are 3 main areas I'd like to focus on this morning: first, the success we've had in reactivating idle FlexRigs; second, the leadership position we have in the Permian; and third, some reasons why H&P is in a good position to continue to build its market share.
Let's start with the reactivation of over 32 FlexRigs since the trough of activity in May. Of those rigs, 28 are in the spot market and 4 on term contract, 15 were in the Permian, 5 in the Oklahoma Woodford, 3 each in the Bakken and Haynesville and 2 each in the Eagle Ford, Powder River Basin and Niobrara.
From a FlexRig model perspective, 22 were FlexRig3s and 10 were FlexRig5s. There's a perception by some that the Flex3 isn't as competitive as other models of rigs in the market. Of course, our customers know differently. The Flex 3 continues to be the workhorse of the fleet and delivers great value for customers. Of the 32 rigs, 75% were pad capable and had 7,500-psi mud pumps. These rigs meet the general criteria of what some industry followers have identified as super-spec rigs, and we've also added 14 new customers since May, and momentum has been building as a result of the performance our people are delivering. Our goal is to respond quickly to customer requests, provide problem-free start-ups and deliver very safe, efficient and reliable performance.
We're pleased to have delivered great results, particularly on the very first well drilled by each of the reactivated FlexRigs. Let me give you a few examples of this performance. The rig mobilizations out of our facilities have averaged less than 4 days from the rig down in our facility to moving the rig to the first location, rigging up and being ready to drill. Subsequent moves after the first well have averaged less than 2 days. As far as drilling times by comparing customer AFEs and offset well data, we been able to determine that most of the FlexRigs drill the very first well under the AFE, some have been 20% to 30% under AFE and there's -- have been many that have been record wells. In addition to the efficient rig moves and delivering world-class drilling performance, the 32 rigs have actually averaged lower than 1% downtime, which is aligned with the rest of our working fleet.
Our people and the rigs are to be commended for the high levels of service attitude, performance and value created for our customers and shareholders. Our workforce staffing effort has also been very successful in rehiring previous employees for our reactivated rigs. We've had close to a 90% success rate as we've reached out to previous field employees, resulting in hundreds of quality employees returning to H&P. In fact, all of our rig staffing needs have been provided by rehires up to this point. Another benefit this creates is the opportunity to promote our people. As you can imagine, this is a big boost to the organization's morale.
Another success related to our rig activations is our 24/7 center of excellence for safety, learning and performance. The center of excellence works hand-in-hand providing support services to our field operations so they can deliver operational excellence to our customers. They've developed systems that utilize predictive analytics, which help us reduce nonproductive time, enhance reliability and optimize operational performance. All of these systems working in unison shorten the learning curve and allows sharing of best practices between rigs, driving performance improvements in a shorter time frame and across the fleet. I would be remiss if I didn't also mention the crews and their supervisors that have managed our idle fleet of FlexRigs, and they've turned the process around to reactivating rigs. They have shown great teamwork and have worked very hard to preserve our idle FlexRig equipment stored in our facilities and also to utilize the consumables throughout the fleet. Thanks to each of you for this great effort.
Shifting to the Permian. With all the headlines, it isn't a surprise that we've activated more FlexRigs there than in any other basin. It is equally important to stress the capabilities we have in our Permian operations. We invested heavily on our infrastructure in the Permian back in 2012 through 2014, and it is our largest facility today, and at the peak, we were working just shy of 90 rigs in West Texas and had expectations to work as many as 125 rigs prior to the downturn. Today, we have 49 rigs contracted coming off a low of 37 rigs. We have 71 idle FlexRigs in the area, and 51 of those are 1,500-horsepower, and we expect to continue to have opportunities to grow our active fleet in the Permian.
In addition to having our FlexRig offering, we also have additional services in our Permian operation where we provide rig move trucks and casing running capability for our rigs. We've operated our own rig move trucking fleets since 1994, and today, we are the only major drilling contractor that owns and operates a rig move trucking fleet. Our ability to control the rig move process offers substantial advantages and efficiencies, safety and reliability to our operations and customers. Historically, we have ranged between 30% to 40% of all rig moves in theU.S. with our trucking fleet, and that's similar to our Permian activity today.
For over 10 years, we've offered casing running services in our U.S. land fleet. Like trucking, using our casing running personnel and tools provide competitive advantages and safety and productivity for our people and customers. Of the 14 new customers since May, 8 are working rigs in the Permian. We're seeing that the Permian is leading the recovery in having this infrastructure in place. Certainly, it will be in advantage going forward.
The third area I want to focus on is H&P’s market position to continue efforts to grow our market share in U.S. land. The market today recognizes the advantages of 1,500-horsepower AC drive rigs because those rigs are best designed for the complexity and longer laterals for horizontal shale wells and customer demand for high levels of performance and reliability. From a rig requirement perspective, extended laterals require more hydraulic horsepower, drill strength torque and greater capability from technology solutions that 1,500-horsepower AC rigs provide and therefore, they are the rig of choice.
We estimate that H&P has approximately 55% of the available 1,500-horsepower AC rig in U.S. land today. So we're positioned with more capacity than any of our competitors in the market. We currently have 104 1,500-horsepower AC drive FlexRigs under contract and 220 idle and available to go to work in the U.S. We have 19% share of the U.S. land horizontal directional drilling market, with our closest competitor at 11%. We have slightly grown our market share from 18% since the peak of activity in 2014. We are very hopeful that the market provides an opportunity to utilize our spare capacity and build on the lead we have.
Another example of H&P's industry-leading position is our current fleet of AC drive FlexRigs that have 7,500-psi circulating systems and multi-well pad drilling capability. As mentioned earlier, these rigs meet the general criteria of what some industry followers have identified as super-spec rigs, which is a subset of AC drive rigs with 1,500-horsepower drawworks ratings. We have approximately 80 of these rigs in our U.S. land fleet, and if demand remains high, we could upgrade additional FlexRigs and have approximately 120 of these rigs by the end of our 2017 second fiscal quarter.
The industry's capacity to provide additional super-spec rigs appears to be limited today, which positions H&P very well for future expansion in the space. Should there be a significant market demand for super-spec rigs going forward, H&P has the capability of providing approximately 270 super-spec FlexRigs to the market without requiring new-build rigs, solely through upgrades were needed to our current FlexRig3 and FlexRig5 fleet. Unlike many of our competitors, we don't need to build new rigs today. Our design allows H&P to invest in our existing fleet to enhance capabilities that will benefit our customers in this more challenging and complex environment. We can do this in a scalable and cost-effective way by leveraging our uniform base of existing FlexRig designs.
Our spare capacity, combined with our strong balance sheet, gives us great flexibility to invest in the fleet, providing a family of solutions to meet customer needs and provide value to shareholders.
So before turning the call to Juan Pablo, it is clear the upcoming OPEC meeting is weighing on the oil markets, and yet, even though oil prices have pulled back over the past several weeks, it's still encouraging to see signs of optimism in the market as we're continuing to reactivate idle rigs out of our facilities safely, efficiently and cost-effectively.
And now I'll turn the call over to Juan Pablo."

Nevertheless, operational result",1850,"Thank you, John.
As reported this morning, the company had a net loss of approximately $73 million during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, resulting in an annual net loss of approximately $57 million during fiscal 2016. Nevertheless, operational results were better than expected during the fourth quarter and market improvement signs are encouraging. We are now expecting our second consecutive quarter-to-quarter improvement in overall activity during the first quarter of fiscal 2017.
Following our -- some details on each of our 3 drilling segments. Our U.S. land drilling segment reported an operating loss of approximately $70 million during the fourth fiscal quarter. Nevertheless, the number of revenue days increased by approximately 6% compared to the prior quarter, resulting in an average of close to 86 rigs generating revenue days during the fourth fiscal quarter. On average, approximately 67 of these rigs were under term contract and approximately 19 rigs worked in the spot market.
Excluding the impact of early termination revenues, the average rig revenue per day declined by approximately 1% to $24,404 in the fourth fiscal quarter as a proportion of rigs working in the spot market increased significantly quarter-to-quarter. The average rig expense per day decreased by less than 1% to $13,326, excluding the lawsuit settlement then adjustments to self-insurance reserves. The corresponding rig margin per day during the fourth fiscal quarter was $11,078.
The segment generated approximately $30 million in revenues, corresponding to early termination of long-term contracts during the fourth fiscal quarter. No early termination notices have been received or announced since our last call in July. But given prior notifications, we expect to generate approximately $9 million during the first fiscal quarter and a total of over $30 million during several quarters thereafter in early termination revenues.
Since the peak in late 2014, we have received early termination notifications for a total of 88 rigs under long-term contracts in the segment. Total early termination revenues related to these 88 contracts are estimated at approximately $466 million. As of today, our 348 available rigs in the U.S. land segment include approximately 105 rigs generating revenue and 243 idle rigs. Included in the 105 rigs generating revenue are 72 rigs under term contracts, 69 of which are generating revenue days. In addition, 33 rigs are currently active in the spot market, for a total of 102 rigs generating revenue days in the segment as compared to 86 rigs during our last earnings call in late July. Approximately 4% of these 102 rigs are now idle and on standby type day rates, which protect daily cash margins under long-term contracts. Separately, the 3 rigs that are not generating revenue days include new-build rigs with deliveries that have been delayed in exchange for compensation from customers.
Looking ahead to the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we expect a quarter-to-quarter increase in activity of roughly 20% in terms of revenue days. Excluding the impact of revenues corresponding to early terminated long-term contracts, we expect our average rig revenue per day to decline to approximately $23,500, primarily as a result of a higher proportion of rigs working in the spot market. Although we have experienced spot pricing stabilization and are now beginning to see some spot pricing improvement, the average pricing today for the 33 rigs in the spot market is still over 35% lower as compared with our spot pricing at the peak in late 2014.
The average rig expense per day level is expected to increase to roughly $14,200. This expected increase is primarily attributable to a significantly lower proportion of rigs generating revenue days while on standby, down from almost 13% of revenue days in the prior quarter to an expected level of under 5% in the first fiscal quarter. Although we expect this average expense level to eventually come down to more normalized levels during a recovery, the transitional or rig start-up expenses along with the carrying cost of over 200 idle and available AC drive FlexRigs are temporarily and unfavorably impacting the average.
If we isolate rigs that are currently active, their average expense level is at approximately $13,000 per rig per day, which is similar to overall levels experienced in more stable time periods like 2013 and 2014. Absent any additional early terminations and excluding the aforementioned rigs for which we have received early termination notifications, the segment currently has term contract commitments in place for an average of approximately 69 rigs during the first fiscal quarter, 68 rigs during the remaining 3 quarters of fiscal 2017, 39 rigs during fiscal 2018 and 17 rigs during fiscal 2019. These commitments include about 10 rigs that have relatively recently been placed under term contracts, with pricing at slightly higher than current spot market levels. Thus, as we include this newly contracted rigs, the average daily margin for rigs that are currently under term contracts is now expected to decline, moving from the prior $15,000 to $16,000 range to a new range between $14,000 and $15,000 per day during the next few quarters.
Let me now transition to our offshore operations. Segment operating income slightly increased to approximately $3 million, total revenue days slightly increased and the average rig margin per day increased by about 14% during the fourth fiscal quarter to $9,070 per day excluding employee severance expenses in the prior quarter and self-insurance reserve adjustments during the quarter. Most of the rigs that generated revenue during the fourth fiscal quarter were rigs that remained idle on customer-owned platforms and were generating standby type day rates.
As we look at the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we expect quarterly revenue days to remain flat at 7 of our 9 offshore platform rigs continue to generate revenue days during the quarter. The average rig margin per day is expected to increase to approximately $11,250 per day during the first fiscal quarter. The expected increase is primarily attributable to 2 of 5 rigs that were previously on standby type day rates returning to work at operating day rates.
Management contracts on platform rigs continue to contribute to our offshore segment operating income. Their contribution during the fourth fiscal quarter, however, was lower than expected at under $2 million. Nevertheless, management contracts are expected to once again generate around $3 million in operating income during each of the next few quarters.
Moving on to our international land operations. This segment reported operating losses of approximately $200,000 during the fourth fiscal quarter. Excluding the impact of employee severance expenses during the prior quarter, the average rig margin per day increased sequentially by approximately 12% to $10,619 per day. The increase was primarily attributable to favorable retroactive pricing adjustments and to the absence of unexpected temporary rate reduction that was mentioned during our late July call. Quarterly revenue days increased sequentially by approximately 8% to 1,372 days as 2 rigs commenced operations during the quarter. As of today, our international land segment has 14 rigs generating revenue days, including 11 in Argentina, 2 in Colombia and 1 in Bahrain. 12 of these rigs are under long-term contracts.
We expect approximately $5 million in compensation related to early terminations for 2 rigs in this segment during the first quarter of fiscal 2017. As a result, we expect international land quarterly revenue days to decrease by approximately 5% during that quarter as compared to the fourth fiscal quarter. Excluding the impact of early termination revenues, the average rig margin per day is expected to decrease to approximately $8,000 per day as a result of several factors including the expected absence of the early terminated rigs that were generating higher than average rig margins and more of the rigs under term contracts now at standby type day rates.
When we combine all 3 of our drilling segments and exclude rigs with long-term contracts that have been early terminated, we currently have an average of approximately 82 rigs under term contracts expected to be active in fiscal 2017, 51 in fiscal 2018 and 27 in fiscal 2019.
Let me now comment on corporate level details. Our balance sheet and liquidity remain very strong. Our backlog also remains strong at $1.8 billion as of September 30. Fiscal 2017 CapEx is estimated to be around $200 million, about 30% of which is expected to be related to maintenance CapEx and tubulars and the remainder mostly to upgrades of our existing fleet. We continue to be in great position to sustain regular dividend levels and with great flexibility to take advantage of future opportunities. After this extremely challenging time for everyone in the business, we are now the only investment-grade rated company in our sector and one on a very short list within the entire oil field services universe.
Total depreciation for fiscal 2017 is expected to decline to approximately $525 million and general and administrative expenses to approximately $140 million. The reduction in the depreciation expense estimate is primarily attributable to relatively low levels of capital expenditures during fiscal 2016 and 2017. The effective income tax rate on the loss for fiscal 2016 was approximately 27%, significantly different than expected, given that instead of a slight gain for the fiscal year, we experienced a significant loss as a result of the expected -- of the unexpected select items that impacted the fourth fiscal quarter. The effective income tax rate for fiscal 2017 is, at this point, expected to be around 36%.
As of September 30, other current assets in our condensed balance sheet include a prepaid tax balance of $26 million and a tax receivable balance of $38 million. Also included in current assets are approximately $50 million related to insurance receivables, which are more than offset by approximately $72 million included in current liabilities in our condensed balance sheet related to the mentioned lawsuit settlement. We have a portfolio of equity securities consisting of Atwood Oceanics, Inc. and Schlumberger Limited that is reported under Investments in our balance sheet. And we have been monetizing these holdings over the years and recording very significant gains from the corresponding sales. Nevertheless, our $4 million share position in Atwood was determined to be an other than temporary loss during the fourth quarter as a result of the length of time that its share price had been under our corresponding cost. As a result, we recognized a $26 million impairment charge, equivalent to an after-tax loss of approximately $0.15 per share. This compares to an after-tax gain of approximately $0.86 per share recorded in 2013 when we monetized 4 million shares of our Atwood holdings and reduced that position in half.
As we have in the past, we will probably hold our existing portfolio positions through this downturn and once again, start to monetize them during more attractive times through the cycles. Our noncurrent deferred income tax liability as of September 30, 2016, was slightly over $1.3 billion, which is slightly higher than the prior year-end level. We expect this lability level to remain in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion during the next couple of years.
With that, let me turn the call back to John."

Prior to opening the call for questions, I want to reiterate a few points. We strongly believe H&P is the best fleet, especially for the more technically challenging horizontal shale wells. And equally, if not more important, we also have the people, the systems and the operational support structures to drive the highest levels of performance and reliability for our customers. We've accumulated more than 1,800 rig years of AC drive operational experience. Our expertise designing, building and now upgrading the fleet provides great optionality for the customer and has resulted in H&P having the largest and most capable fleet of AC drive rigs in the industry.
We remain committed to further expand our competitive advantages through technology and the scale of our operations in order to continue to add value to our customers and shareholders.
And Tony, we will now open the call for questions."

I want to say it's around $200,000-or-so. There's some folks that include, in a super-spec, the third and the fourth engine. The way we've approached it, Michael, is it's really on need basis. If the customer has a true need for the third pump or the fourth engine, if the hydraulics requirements are there, then that's what we're doing. But it really depends on basin and it's really dependent customer to customer whether you need 2 or whether you need 3. And that's a relatively small incremental investment.

Our goal is to safely provide performanc",1550,"Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Thank you again for joining us on the call.
We're pleased to deliver better-than-expected quarterly operational results in the midst of this improving U.S. land market. Our goal is to safely provide performance-driven drilling services, and as we think about the future, I think it's helpful to step back and properly frame where the company is today.
There are 3 main areas I'd like to focus on this morning: first, the success we've had in reactivating idle FlexRigs; second, the leadership position we have in the Permian; and third, some reasons why H&P is in a good position to continue to build its market share.
Let's start with the reactivation of over 32 FlexRigs since the trough of activity in May. Of those rigs, 28 are in the spot market and 4 on term contract, 15 were in the Permian, 5 in the Oklahoma Woodford, 3 each in the Bakken and Haynesville and 2 each in the Eagle Ford, Powder River Basin and Niobrara.
From a FlexRig model perspective, 22 were FlexRig3s and 10 were FlexRig5s. There's a perception by some that the Flex3 isn't as competitive as other models of rigs in the market. Of course, our customers know differently. The Flex 3 continues to be the workhorse of the fleet and delivers great value for customers. Of the 32 rigs, 75% were pad capable and had 7,500-psi mud pumps. These rigs meet the general criteria of what some industry followers have identified as super-spec rigs, and we've also added 14 new customers since May, and momentum has been building as a result of the performance our people are delivering. Our goal is to respond quickly to customer requests, provide problem-free start-ups and deliver very safe, efficient and reliable performance.
We're pleased to have delivered great results, particularly on the very first well drilled by each of the reactivated FlexRigs. Let me give you a few examples of this performance. The rig mobilizations out of our facilities have averaged less than 4 days from the rig down in our facility to moving the rig to the first location, rigging up and being ready to drill. Subsequent moves after the first well have averaged less than 2 days. As far as drilling times by comparing customer AFEs and offset well data, we been able to determine that most of the FlexRigs drill the very first well under the AFE, some have been 20% to 30% under AFE and there's -- have been many that have been record wells. In addition to the efficient rig moves and delivering world-class drilling performance, the 32 rigs have actually averaged lower than 1% downtime, which is aligned with the rest of our working fleet.
Our people and the rigs are to be commended for the high levels of service attitude, performance and value created for our customers and shareholders. Our workforce staffing effort has also been very successful in rehiring previous employees for our reactivated rigs. We've had close to a 90% success rate as we've reached out to previous field employees, resulting in hundreds of quality employees returning to H&P. In fact, all of our rig staffing needs have been provided by rehires up to this point. Another benefit this creates is the opportunity to promote our people. As you can imagine, this is a big boost to the organization's morale.
Another success related to our rig activations is our 24/7 center of excellence for safety, learning and performance. The center of excellence works hand-in-hand providing support services to our field operations so they can deliver operational excellence to our customers. They've developed systems that utilize predictive analytics, which help us reduce nonproductive time, enhance reliability and optimize operational performance. All of these systems working in unison shorten the learning curve and allows sharing of best practices between rigs, driving performance improvements in a shorter time frame and across the fleet. I would be remiss if I didn't also mention the crews and their supervisors that have managed our idle fleet of FlexRigs, and they've turned the process around to reactivating rigs. They have shown great teamwork and have worked very hard to preserve our idle FlexRig equipment stored in our facilities and also to utilize the consumables throughout the fleet. Thanks to each of you for this great effort.
Shifting to the Permian. With all the headlines, it isn't a surprise that we've activated more FlexRigs there than in any other basin. It is equally important to stress the capabilities we have in our Permian operations. We invested heavily on our infrastructure in the Permian back in 2012 through 2014, and it is our largest facility today, and at the peak, we were working just shy of 90 rigs in West Texas and had expectations to work as many as 125 rigs prior to the downturn. Today, we have 49 rigs contracted coming off a low of 37 rigs. We have 71 idle FlexRigs in the area, and 51 of those are 1,500-horsepower, and we expect to continue to have opportunities to grow our active fleet in the Permian.
In addition to having our FlexRig offering, we also have additional services in our Permian operation where we provide rig move trucks and casing running capability for our rigs. We've operated our own rig move trucking fleets since 1994, and today, we are the only major drilling contractor that owns and operates a rig move trucking fleet. Our ability to control the rig move process offers substantial advantages and efficiencies, safety and reliability to our operations and customers. Historically, we have ranged between 30% to 40% of all rig moves in theU.S. with our trucking fleet, and that's similar to our Permian activity today.
For over 10 years, we've offered casing running services in our U.S. land fleet. Like trucking, using our casing running personnel and tools provide competitive advantages and safety and productivity for our people and customers. Of the 14 new customers since May, 8 are working rigs in the Permian. We're seeing that the Permian is leading the recovery in having this infrastructure in place. Certainly, it will be in advantage going forward.
The third area I want to focus on is H&P’s market position to continue efforts to grow our market share in U.S. land. The market today recognizes the advantages of 1,500-horsepower AC drive rigs because those rigs are best designed for the complexity and longer laterals for horizontal shale wells and customer demand for high levels of performance and reliability. From a rig requirement perspective, extended laterals require more hydraulic horsepower, drill strength torque and greater capability from technology solutions that 1,500-horsepower AC rigs provide and therefore, they are the rig of choice.
We estimate that H&P has approximately 55% of the available 1,500-horsepower AC rig in U.S. land today. So we're positioned with more capacity than any of our competitors in the market. We currently have 104 1,500-horsepower AC drive FlexRigs under contract and 220 idle and available to go to work in the U.S. We have 19% share of the U.S. land horizontal directional drilling market, with our closest competitor at 11%. We have slightly grown our market share from 18% since the peak of activity in 2014. We are very hopeful that the market provides an opportunity to utilize our spare capacity and build on the lead we have.
Another example of H&P's industry-leading position is our current fleet of AC drive FlexRigs that have 7,500-psi circulating systems and multi-well pad drilling capability. As mentioned earlier, these rigs meet the general criteria of what some industry followers have identified as super-spec rigs, which is a subset of AC drive rigs with 1,500-horsepower drawworks ratings. We have approximately 80 of these rigs in our U.S. land fleet, and if demand remains high, we could upgrade additional FlexRigs and have approximately 120 of these rigs by the end of our 2017 second fiscal quarter.
The industry's capacity to provide additional super-spec rigs appears to be limited today, which positions H&P very well for future expansion in the space. Should there be a significant market demand for super-spec rigs going forward, H&P has the capability of providing approximately 270 super-spec FlexRigs to the market without requiring new-build rigs, solely through upgrades were needed to our current FlexRig3 and FlexRig5 fleet. Unlike many of our competitors, we don't need to build new rigs today. Our design allows H&P to invest in our existing fleet to enhance capabilities that will benefit our customers in this more challenging and complex environment. We can do this in a scalable and cost-effective way by leveraging our uniform base of existing FlexRig designs.
Our spare capacity, combined with our strong balance sheet, gives us great flexibility to invest in the fleet, providing a family of solutions to meet customer needs and provide value to shareholders.
So before turning the call to Juan Pablo, it is clear the upcoming OPEC meeting is weighing on the oil markets, and yet, even though oil prices have pulled back over the past several weeks, it's still encouraging to see signs of optimism in the market as we're continuing to reactivate idle rigs out of our facilities safely, efficiently and cost-effectively.
And now I'll turn the call over to Juan Pablo."
278341,404349007,1088834,"Helmerich & Payne, Inc., Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 17, 2016",2016-11-17,"Earnings Calls","Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, John.As reported this morning, the company had a net loss of approximately $73 million during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, resulting in an annual net loss of approximately $57 million during fiscal 2016. Nevertheless, operational result",1850,"Thank you, John.
As reported this morning, the company had a net loss of approximately $73 million during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, resulting in an annual net loss of approximately $57 million during fiscal 2016. Nevertheless, operational results were better than expected during the fourth quarter and market improvement signs are encouraging. We are now expecting our second consecutive quarter-to-quarter improvement in overall activity during the first quarter of fiscal 2017.
Following our -- some details on each of our 3 drilling segments. Our U.S. land drilling segment reported an operating loss of approximately $70 million during the fourth fiscal quarter. Nevertheless, the number of revenue days increased by approximately 6% compared to the prior quarter, resulting in an average of close to 86 rigs generating revenue days during the fourth fiscal quarter. On average, approximately 67 of these rigs were under term contract and approximately 19 rigs worked in the spot market.
Excluding the impact of early termination revenues, the average rig revenue per day declined by approximately 1% to $24,404 in the fourth fiscal quarter as a proportion of rigs working in the spot market increased significantly quarter-to-quarter. The average rig expense per day decreased by less than 1% to $13,326, excluding the lawsuit settlement then adjustments to self-insurance reserves. The corresponding rig margin per day during the fourth fiscal quarter was $11,078.
The segment generated approximately $30 million in revenues, corresponding to early termination of long-term contracts during the fourth fiscal quarter. No early termination notices have been received or announced since our last call in July. But given prior notifications, we expect to generate approximately $9 million during the first fiscal quarter and a total of over $30 million during several quarters thereafter in early termination revenues.
Since the peak in late 2014, we have received early termination notifications for a total of 88 rigs under long-term contracts in the segment. Total early termination revenues related to these 88 contracts are estimated at approximately $466 million. As of today, our 348 available rigs in the U.S. land segment include approximately 105 rigs generating revenue and 243 idle rigs. Included in the 105 rigs generating revenue are 72 rigs under term contracts, 69 of which are generating revenue days. In addition, 33 rigs are currently active in the spot market, for a total of 102 rigs generating revenue days in the segment as compared to 86 rigs during our last earnings call in late July. Approximately 4% of these 102 rigs are now idle and on standby type day rates, which protect daily cash margins under long-term contracts. Separately, the 3 rigs that are not generating revenue days include new-build rigs with deliveries that have been delayed in exchange for compensation from customers.
Looking ahead to the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we expect a quarter-to-quarter increase in activity of roughly 20% in terms of revenue days. Excluding the impact of revenues corresponding to early terminated long-term contracts, we expect our average rig revenue per day to decline to approximately $23,500, primarily as a result of a higher proportion of rigs working in the spot market. Although we have experienced spot pricing stabilization and are now beginning to see some spot pricing improvement, the average pricing today for the 33 rigs in the spot market is still over 35% lower as compared with our spot pricing at the peak in late 2014.
The average rig expense per day level is expected to increase to roughly $14,200. This expected increase is primarily attributable to a significantly lower proportion of rigs generating revenue days while on standby, down from almost 13% of revenue days in the prior quarter to an expected level of under 5% in the first fiscal quarter. Although we expect this average expense level to eventually come down to more normalized levels during a recovery, the transitional or rig start-up expenses along with the carrying cost of over 200 idle and available AC drive FlexRigs are temporarily and unfavorably impacting the average.
If we isolate rigs that are currently active, their average expense level is at approximately $13,000 per rig per day, which is similar to overall levels experienced in more stable time periods like 2013 and 2014. Absent any additional early terminations and excluding the aforementioned rigs for which we have received early termination notifications, the segment currently has term contract commitments in place for an average of approximately 69 rigs during the first fiscal quarter, 68 rigs during the remaining 3 quarters of fiscal 2017, 39 rigs during fiscal 2018 and 17 rigs during fiscal 2019. These commitments include about 10 rigs that have relatively recently been placed under term contracts, with pricing at slightly higher than current spot market levels. Thus, as we include this newly contracted rigs, the average daily margin for rigs that are currently under term contracts is now expected to decline, moving from the prior $15,000 to $16,000 range to a new range between $14,000 and $15,000 per day during the next few quarters.
Let me now transition to our offshore operations. Segment operating income slightly increased to approximately $3 million, total revenue days slightly increased and the average rig margin per day increased by about 14% during the fourth fiscal quarter to $9,070 per day excluding employee severance expenses in the prior quarter and self-insurance reserve adjustments during the quarter. Most of the rigs that generated revenue during the fourth fiscal quarter were rigs that remained idle on customer-owned platforms and were generating standby type day rates.
As we look at the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we expect quarterly revenue days to remain flat at 7 of our 9 offshore platform rigs continue to generate revenue days during the quarter. The average rig margin per day is expected to increase to approximately $11,250 per day during the first fiscal quarter. The expected increase is primarily attributable to 2 of 5 rigs that were previously on standby type day rates returning to work at operating day rates.
Management contracts on platform rigs continue to contribute to our offshore segment operating income. Their contribution during the fourth fiscal quarter, however, was lower than expected at under $2 million. Nevertheless, management contracts are expected to once again generate around $3 million in operating income during each of the next few quarters.
Moving on to our international land operations. This segment reported operating losses of approximately $200,000 during the fourth fiscal quarter. Excluding the impact of employee severance expenses during the prior quarter, the average rig margin per day increased sequentially by approximately 12% to $10,619 per day. The increase was primarily attributable to favorable retroactive pricing adjustments and to the absence of unexpected temporary rate reduction that was mentioned during our late July call. Quarterly revenue days increased sequentially by approximately 8% to 1,372 days as 2 rigs commenced operations during the quarter. As of today, our international land segment has 14 rigs generating revenue days, including 11 in Argentina, 2 in Colombia and 1 in Bahrain. 12 of these rigs are under long-term contracts.
We expect approximately $5 million in compensation related to early terminations for 2 rigs in this segment during the first quarter of fiscal 2017. As a result, we expect international land quarterly revenue days to decrease by approximately 5% during that quarter as compared to the fourth fiscal quarter. Excluding the impact of early termination revenues, the average rig margin per day is expected to decrease to approximately $8,000 per day as a result of several factors including the expected absence of the early terminated rigs that were generating higher than average rig margins and more of the rigs under term contracts now at standby type day rates.
When we combine all 3 of our drilling segments and exclude rigs with long-term contracts that have been early terminated, we currently have an average of approximately 82 rigs under term contracts expected to be active in fiscal 2017, 51 in fiscal 2018 and 27 in fiscal 2019.
Let me now comment on corporate level details. Our balance sheet and liquidity remain very strong. Our backlog also remains strong at $1.8 billion as of September 30. Fiscal 2017 CapEx is estimated to be around $200 million, about 30% of which is expected to be related to maintenance CapEx and tubulars and the remainder mostly to upgrades of our existing fleet. We continue to be in great position to sustain regular dividend levels and with great flexibility to take advantage of future opportunities. After this extremely challenging time for everyone in the business, we are now the only investment-grade rated company in our sector and one on a very short list within the entire oil field services universe.
Total depreciation for fiscal 2017 is expected to decline to approximately $525 million and general and administrative expenses to approximately $140 million. The reduction in the depreciation expense estimate is primarily attributable to relatively low levels of capital expenditures during fiscal 2016 and 2017. The effective income tax rate on the loss for fiscal 2016 was approximately 27%, significantly different than expected, given that instead of a slight gain for the fiscal year, we experienced a significant loss as a result of the expected -- of the unexpected select items that impacted the fourth fiscal quarter. The effective income tax rate for fiscal 2017 is, at this point, expected to be around 36%.
As of September 30, other current assets in our condensed balance sheet include a prepaid tax balance of $26 million and a tax receivable balance of $38 million. Also included in current assets are approximately $50 million related to insurance receivables, which are more than offset by approximately $72 million included in current liabilities in our condensed balance sheet related to the mentioned lawsuit settlement. We have a portfolio of equity securities consisting of Atwood Oceanics, Inc. and Schlumberger Limited that is reported under Investments in our balance sheet. And we have been monetizing these holdings over the years and recording very significant gains from the corresponding sales. Nevertheless, our $4 million share position in Atwood was determined to be an other than temporary loss during the fourth quarter as a result of the length of time that its share price had been under our corresponding cost. As a result, we recognized a $26 million impairment charge, equivalent to an after-tax loss of approximately $0.15 per share. This compares to an after-tax gain of approximately $0.86 per share recorded in 2013 when we monetized 4 million shares of our Atwood holdings and reduced that position in half.
As we have in the past, we will probably hold our existing portfolio positions through this downturn and once again, start to monetize them during more attractive times through the cycles. Our noncurrent deferred income tax liability as of September 30, 2016, was slightly over $1.3 billion, which is slightly higher than the prior year-end level. We expect this lability level to remain in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion during the next couple of years.
With that, let me turn the call back to John."

As John said, investments might require $2 million or more million dollars to rig. And so it's a combination of making sure that we are ahead of the game. But we have great flexibility. We don't have to upgrade all 270 rigs that are capable of becoming super-specs, but we are very well-prepared to be ahead of the market and trying to make sure that the timing does not represent a bottleneck for us as we continue through -- or as you'd say, as we hopefully continue through this recovery."

The rigs are working harder, you've got 7,500-psi pumps, engines are working harder, pumps are working harder, we're using more consumables, costs are going to have to -- I think you begin to put cost pressure in the equation.

We're pleased to deliver better than expected quarterly operational results in the midst of this improving U.S. land market. Our goal is to safely provide performance-driven drilling services, and as we think about the future, I think it is helpful to step back and properly frame where the company is today.
There are 3 main areas I'd like to focus on this morning: first, the success we've had in reactivating idle FlexRigs; second, the leadership position we have in the Permian; and third, some reasons why H&P is in a good position to continue to build its market share.
Let's start with the reactivation of over 32 FlexRigs since the trough of activity in May. Of those rigs, 28 are in the spot market and 4 on term contract; 15 were in the Permian, 5 in the Oklahoma Woodford, 3 each in the Bakken and Haynesville and 2 each in the Eagle Ford, Powder River Basin and Niobrara.
From a FlexRig model perspective, 22 were FlexRig3s and 10 were FlexRig5s. There's a perception by some that the Flex 3 isn't as competitive as other models of rigs in the market. Of course, our customers know differently. The Flex 3 continues to be the workhorse of the fleet and delivers great value for customers. Of the 32 rigs, 75% were pad capable and had 7,500-psi mud pumps. These rigs meet the general criteria of what some industry followers have identified as super-spec rigs, and we've also added 14 new customers since May, and momentum has been building as a result of the performance our people are delivering. Our goal is to respond quickly to customer requests, provide problem-free start-ups and deliver very safe, efficient and reliable performance.
We're pleased to have delivered great results, particularly on the very first well drilled by each of the reactivated FlexRigs. Let me give you a few examples of this performance. The rig mobilizations out of our facilities have averaged less than 4 days from the rig down in our facility to moving the rig to the first location, rigging up and being ready to drill. Subsequent moves after the first well have averaged less than 2 days. As far as drilling times, by comparing customer AFEs and offset well data, we've been able to determine that most of the FlexRigs drill the very first well under the AFE. Some have been 20% to 30% under AFE, and there have been many that have been record wells. In addition to efficient rig moves and delivering world-class drilling performance, the 32 rigs have actually averaged lower than 1% downtime, which is aligned with the rest of our working fleet.
Our people on the rigs are to be commended for the high levels of service attitude, performance and value created for our customers and shareholders. Our workforce staffing effort has also been very successful in rehiring previous employees for our reactivated rigs. We've had close to a 90% success rate as we've reached out to previous field employees, resulting in hundreds of quality employees returning to H&P. In fact, all of our rig staffing needs have been provided by rehires up to this point. Another benefit this creates is the opportunity to promote our people. As you can imagine, this is a big boost to the organization's morale.
Another success related to our rig activations is our 24/7 center of excellence for safety, learning and performance. The center of excellence works hand-in-hand providing support services to our field operations so they can deliver operational excellence to our customers. They've developed systems that utilize predictive analytics, which help us reduce nonproductive time, enhance reliability and optimize operational performance. All of these systems working in unison shorten the learning curve and allow sharing of best practices between rigs, driving performance improvements in a shorter time frame and across the fleet. I would be remiss if I didn't also mention the crews and their supervisors that have managed our idle fleet of FlexRigs, and they've turned the process around to reactivating rigs. They have shown great teamwork and have worked very hard to preserve our idle FlexRig equipment stored in our facilities and also to utilize the consumables throughout the fleet. Thanks to each of you for this great effort.
Shifting to the Permian. With all the headlines, it isn't a surprise that we've activated more FlexRigs there than in any other basin. It is equally important to stress the capabilities we have in our Permian operations. We invested heavily in our infrastructure in the Permian back in 2012 through 2014, and it is our largest facility today. And at the peak, we were working just shy of 90 rigs in West Texas and had expectations to work as many as 125 rigs prior to the downturn. Today, we have 49 rigs contracted coming off a low of 37 rigs. We have 71 idle FlexRigs in the area, and 51 of those are 1,500-horsepower, and we expect to continue to have opportunities to grow our active fleet in the Permian.
In addition to having our FlexRig offering, we also have additional services in our Permian operation where we provide rig move trucks and casing running capability for our rigs. We've operated our own rig move trucking fleet since 1994, and today we are the only major drilling contractor that owns and operates a rig move trucking fleet. Our ability to control the rig move process offers substantial advantages in efficiency, safety and reliability to our operations and customers. Historically, we have ranged between 30% to 40% of all rig moves in the U.S. with our trucking fleet, and that's similar to our Permian activity today.
For over 10 years, we've offered casing running services in our U.S. land fleet. Like trucking, using our casing running personnel and tools provide competitive advantages in safety and productivity for our people and customers. Of the 14 new customers since May, 8 are working rigs in the Permian. We're seeing that the Permian is leading the recovery, and having this infrastructure in place certainly will be in advantage going forward.
The third area I want to focus on is H&P's market position to continue efforts to grow our market share in U.S. land. The market today recognizes the advantages of 1,500-horsepower AC drive rigs because those rigs are best designed for the complexity and longer laterals for horizontal shale wells and customer demand for high levels of performance and reliability. From a rig requirement perspective, extended laterals require more hydraulic horsepower, drill strength torque and greater capability from technology solutions that 1,500-horsepower AC rigs provide, and therefore, they are the rig of choice.
We estimate that H&P has approximately 55% of the available 1,500-horsepower AC rig in U.S. land today. So we're positioned with more capacity than any of our competitors in the market. We currently have 104 1,500-horsepower AC drive FlexRigs under contract and 220 idle and available to go to work in the U.S. We have 19% share of the U.S. land horizontal directional drilling market, with our closest competitor at 11%. We have slightly grown our market share from 18% since the peak of activity in 2014. We are very hopeful that the market provides an opportunity to utilize our spare capacity and build on the lead we have.
Another example of H&P's industry-leading position is our current fleet of AC drive FlexRigs that have 7,500-psi circulating systems and multi-well pad drilling capability. As mentioned earlier, these rigs meet the general criteria of what some industry followers have identified as super-spec rigs, which is a subset of AC drive rigs with 1,500-horsepower drawworks ratings. We have approximately 80 of these rigs in our U.S. land fleet, and if demand remains high, we could upgrade additional FlexRigs and have approximately 120 of these rigs by the end of our 2017 second fiscal quarter.
The industry's capacity to provide additional super-spec rigs appears to be limited today, which positions H&P very well for future expansion in the space. Should there be a significant market demand for super-spec rigs going forward, H&P has the capability of providing approximately 270 super-spec FlexRigs to the market without requiring new-build rigs, solely through upgrades where needed to our current FlexRig3 and FlexRig5 fleet. Unlike many of our competitors, we don't need to build new rigs today. Our design allows H&P to invest in our existing fleet to enhance capabilities that will benefit our customers in this more challenging and complex environment. We can do this in a scalable and cost-effective way by leveraging our uniform base of existing FlexRig designs.
Our spare capacity, combined with our strong balance sheet, gives us great flexibility to invest in the fleet, providing a family of solutions to meet customer needs and provide value to shareholders.
So before turning the call to Juan Pablo, it is clear the upcoming OPEC meeting is weighing on the oil markets, and yet, even though oil prices have pulled back over the past several weeks, it's still encouraging to see signs of optimism in the market as we're continuing to reactivate idle rigs out of our facilities safely, efficiently and cost effectively.
And now I'll turn the call over to Juan Pablo."
278341,404349007,1088990,"Helmerich & Payne, Inc., Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 17, 2016",2016-11-17,"Earnings Calls","Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, John.As reported this morning, the company had a net loss of approximately $73 million during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, resulting in an annual net loss of approximately $57 million during fiscal 2016. Nevertheless, operational result",1852,"Thank you, John.
As reported this morning, the company had a net loss of approximately $73 million during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, resulting in an annual net loss of approximately $57 million during fiscal 2016. Nevertheless, operational results were better than expected during the fourth quarter and market improvement signs are encouraging. We are now expecting our second consecutive quarter-to-quarter improvement in overall activity during the first quarter of fiscal 2017.
Following our -- some details on each of our 3 drilling segments. Our U.S. land drilling segment reported an operating loss of approximately $70 million during the fourth fiscal quarter. Nevertheless, the number of revenue days increased by approximately 6% compared to the prior quarter, resulting in an average of close to 86 rigs generating revenue days during the fourth fiscal quarter. On average, approximately 67 of these rigs were under term contract and approximately 19 rigs worked in the spot market.
Excluding the impact of early termination revenues, the average rig revenue per day declined by approximately 1% to $24,404 in the fourth fiscal quarter as the proportion of rigs working in the spot market increased significantly quarter-to-quarter. The average rig expense per day decreased by less than 1% to $13,326, excluding the lawsuit settlement and adjustments to self-insurance reserves. The corresponding average rig margin per day during the fourth fiscal quarter was $11,078.
The segment generated approximately $30 million in revenues, corresponding to early termination of long-term contracts during the fourth fiscal quarter. No early termination notices have been received or announced since our last call in July. But given prior notifications, we expect to generate approximately $9 million during the first fiscal quarter and a total of over $30 million during several quarters thereafter in early termination revenues.
Since the peak in late 2014, we have received early termination notifications for a total of 88 rigs under long-term contracts in the segment. Total early termination revenues related to these 88 contracts are estimated at approximately $466 million. As of today, our 348 available rigs in the U.S. land segment include approximately 105 rigs generating revenue and 243 idle rigs. Included in the 105 rigs generating revenue are 72 rigs under term contracts, 69 of which are generating revenue days. In addition, 33 rigs are currently active in the spot market, for a total of 102 rigs generating revenue days in the segment as compared to 86 rigs during our last earnings call in late July. Approximately 4% of these 102 rigs are now idle and on standby type day rates, which protect daily cash margins under long-term contracts. Separately, the 3 rigs that are not generating revenue days include new-build rigs with deliveries that have been delayed in exchange for compensation from customers.
Looking ahead to the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we expect a quarter-to-quarter increase in activity of roughly 20% in terms of revenue days. Excluding the impact of revenues corresponding to early terminated long-term contracts, we expect our average rig revenue per day to decline to approximately $23,500, primarily as a result of a higher proportion of rigs working in the spot market. Although we have experienced spot pricing stabilization and are now beginning to see some spot pricing improvement, the average pricing today for the 33 rigs in the spot market is still over 35% lower as compared with our spot pricing at the peak in late 2014.
The average rig expense per day level is expected to increase to roughly $14,200. This expected increase is primarily attributable to a significantly lower proportion of rigs generating revenue days while on standby, down from almost 13% of revenue days in the prior quarter to an expected level of under 5% in the first fiscal quarter. Although we expect this average expense level to eventually come down to more normalized levels during a recovery, the transitional or rig start-up expenses along with the carrying cost of over 200 idle and available AC drive FlexRigs are temporarily and unfavorably impacting the average.
If we isolate rigs that are currently active, their average expense level is at approximately $13,000 per rig per day, which is similar to overall levels experienced in more stable time periods like 2013 and 2014. Absent any additional early terminations and excluding the aforementioned rigs for which we have received early termination notifications, the segment currently has term contract commitments in place for an average of approximately 69 rigs during the first fiscal quarter, 68 rigs during the remaining 3 quarters of fiscal 2017, 39 rigs during fiscal 2018 and 17 rigs during fiscal 2019. These commitments include about 10 rigs that have relatively recently been placed under term contracts, with pricing at slightly higher than current spot market levels. Thus, as we include these newly contracted rigs, the average daily margin for rigs that are currently under term contracts is now expected to decline, moving from the prior $15,000 to $16,000 range to a new range between $14,000 and $15,000 per day during the next few quarters.
Let me now transition to our offshore operations. Segment operating income slightly increased to approximately $3 million. Total revenue days slightly increased and the average rig margin per day increased by about 14% during the fourth fiscal quarter to $9,070 per day excluding employee severance expenses in the prior quarter and self-insurance reserve adjustments during the quarter. Most of the rigs that generated revenue during the fourth fiscal quarter were rigs that remained idle on customer-owned platforms and were generating standby type day rates.
As we look at the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we expect quarterly revenue days to remain flat as 7 of our 9 offshore platform rigs continue to generate revenue days during the quarter. The average rig margin per day is expected to increase to approximately $11,250 per day during the first fiscal quarter. The expected increase is primarily attributable to 2 of 5 rigs that were previously on standby type day rates returning to work at operating day rates.
Management contracts on platform rigs continue to contribute to our offshore segment operating income. Their contribution during the fourth fiscal quarter, however, was lower than expected at under $2 million. Nevertheless, management contracts are expected to once again generate around $3 million in operating income during each of the next few quarters.
Moving on to our international land operations. This segment reported operating losses of approximately $200,000 during the fourth fiscal quarter. Excluding the impact of employee severance expenses during the prior quarter, the average rig margin per day increased sequentially by approximately 12% to $10,619 per day. The increase was primarily attributable to favorable retroactive pricing adjustments and to the absence of an expected temporary rate reduction that was mentioned during our late July call. Quarterly revenue days increased sequentially by approximately 8% to 1,372 days as 2 rigs commenced operations during the quarter. As of today, our international land segment has 14 rigs generating revenue days, including 11 in Argentina, 2 in Colombia and 1 in Bahrain. 12 of these rigs are under long-term contracts.
We expect approximately $5 million in compensation related to early terminations for 2 rigs in this segment during the first quarter of fiscal 2017. As a result, we expect international land quarterly revenue days to decrease by approximately 5% during that quarter as compared to the fourth fiscal quarter. Excluding the impact of early termination revenues, the average rig margin per day is expected to decrease to approximately $8,000 per day as a result of several factors, including the expected absence of the early terminated rigs that were generating higher than average rig margins and more of the rigs under term contracts now at standby type day rates.
When we combine all 3 of our drilling segments and exclude rigs with long-term contracts that have been early terminated, we currently have an average of approximately 82 rigs under term contracts expected to be active in fiscal 2017, 51 in fiscal 2018 and 27 in fiscal 2019.
Let me now comment on corporate level details. Our balance sheet and liquidity remain very strong. Our backlog also remains strong at $1.8 billion as of September 30. Fiscal 2017 CapEx is estimated to be around $200 million, about 30% of which is expected to be related to maintenance CapEx and tubulars and the remainder mostly to upgrades of our existing fleet. We continue to be in great position to sustain regular dividend levels and with great flexibility to take advantage of future opportunities. After this extremely challenging time for everyone in the business, we are now the only investment-grade rated company in our sector and one on a very short list within the entire oil field services universe.
Total depreciation for fiscal 2017 is expected to decline to approximately $525 million and general and administrative expenses to approximately $140 million. The reduction in the depreciation expense estimate is primarily attributable to relatively low levels of capital expenditures during fiscal 2016 and 2017. The effective income tax rate on the loss for fiscal 2016 was approximately 27%, significantly different than expected, given that instead of a slight gain for the fiscal year, we experienced a significant loss as a result of the expected -- of the unexpected select items that impacted the fourth fiscal quarter. The effective income tax rate for fiscal 2017 is at this point expected to be around 36%.
As of September 30, other current assets in our condensed balance sheet include a prepaid tax balance of $26 million and a tax receivable balance of $38 million. Also included in current assets are approximately $50 million related to insurance receivables, which are more than offset by approximately $72 million included in current liabilities in our condensed balance sheet related to the mentioned lawsuit settlement. We have a portfolio of equity securities consisting of Atwood Oceanics, Inc. and Schlumberger Limited that is reported under Investments in our balance sheet. And we have been monetizing these holdings over the years and recording very significant gains from the corresponding sales. Nevertheless, our $4 million share position in Atwood was determined to be an other than temporary loss during the fourth quarter as a result of the length of time that its share price had been under our corresponding cost. As a result, we recognized a $26 million impairment charge, equivalent to an after-tax loss of approximately $0.15 per share. This compares to an after-tax gain of approximately $0.86 per share recorded in 2013 when we monetized 4 million shares of our Atwood holdings and reduced that position in half.
As we have in the past, we will probably hold our existing portfolio positions through this downturn and once again start to monetize them during more attractive times through the cycles. Our noncurrent deferred income tax liability as of September 30, 2016, was slightly over $1.3 billion, which is slightly higher than the prior year-end level. We expect this liability level to remain in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion during the next couple of years.
With that, let me turn the call back to John."

There's some folks that include, in a super-spec, the third pump and the fourth engine. The way we've approached it, Michael, is it's really on a needs basis. If the customer has a true need for the third pump or the fourth engine, if the hydraulics requirements are there, then that's what we're doing. But it really depends on basin and it's really dependent customer to customer whether you need 2 or whether you need 3. And that's a relatively small incremental investment. Obviously, we already own the pumps and the engines. It's just really the installation cost. The rigs are set up and designed to accept the additional equipment."

And I think that's where -- if you start to think about it in terms of -- rather than looking at it as an entire fleet of rigs and focus on the rigs that are drilling horizontal and directional wells that do have the higher capability needs, not just because somebody wants it but because they need it, that's when you start getting into more of a scarcity where I think you have the potential for at least some pricing power. And I'm not talking about $25,000 a day. I'm just -- I'm talking about getting additional -- getting higher rates and improving our margins. I'm not making any sort of prediction on how high they might go. But I think that does begin to tighten the market. I think the other element is that these rigs -- you can't just continue to drill the kind of wells that the industry's drilling and not get paid for it as a contractor. The rigs are working harder, you've got 7,500-psi pumps, engines are working harder, pumps are working harder, we're using more consumables. Costs are going to have to -- I think you begin to put cost pressure in the equation. So I think in general, we're going to see improved pricing.

We're pleased to deliver better than expected quarterly operational results in the midst of this improving U.S. land market. Our goal is to safely provide performance-driven drilling services, and as we think about the future, I think it is helpful to step back and properly frame where the company is today.
There are 3 main areas I'd like to focus on this morning: first, the success we've had in reactivating idle FlexRigs; second, the leadership position we have in the Permian; and third, some reasons why H&P is in a good position to continue to build its market share.
Let's start with the reactivation of over 32 FlexRigs since the trough of activity in May. Of those rigs, 28 are in the spot market and 4 on term contract; 15 were in the Permian, 5 in the Oklahoma Woodford, 3 each in the Bakken and Haynesville and 2 each in the Eagle Ford, Powder River Basin and Niobrara.
From a FlexRig model perspective, 22 were FlexRig3s and 10 were FlexRig5s. There's a perception by some that the Flex 3 isn't as competitive as other models of rigs in the market. Of course, our customers know differently. The Flex 3 continues to be the workhorse of the fleet and delivers great value for customers. Of the 32 rigs, 75% were pad capable and had 7,500-psi mud pumps. These rigs meet the general criteria of what some industry followers have identified as super-spec rigs, and we've also added 14 new customers since May, and momentum has been building as a result of the performance our people are delivering. Our goal is to respond quickly to customer requests, provide problem-free start-ups and deliver very safe, efficient and reliable performance.
We're pleased to have delivered great results, particularly on the very first well drilled by each of the reactivated FlexRigs. Let me give you a few examples of this performance. The rig mobilizations out of our facilities have averaged less than 4 days from the rig down in our facility to moving the rig to the first location, rigging up and being ready to drill. Subsequent moves after the first well have averaged less than 2 days. As far as drilling times, by comparing customer AFEs and offset well data, we've been able to determine that most of the FlexRigs drill the very first well under the AFE. Some have been 20% to 30% under AFE, and there have been many that have been record wells. In addition to efficient rig moves and delivering world-class drilling performance, the 32 rigs have actually averaged lower than 1% downtime, which is aligned with the rest of our working fleet.
Our people on the rigs are to be commended for the high levels of service attitude, performance and value created for our customers and shareholders. Our workforce staffing effort has also been very successful in rehiring previous employees for our reactivated rigs. We've had close to a 90% success rate as we've reached out to previous field employees, resulting in hundreds of quality employees returning to H&P. In fact, all of our rig staffing needs have been provided by rehires up to this point. Another benefit this creates is the opportunity to promote our people. As you can imagine, this is a big boost to the organization's morale.
Another success related to our rig activations is our 24/7 center of excellence for safety, learning and performance. The center of excellence works hand-in-hand providing support services to our field operations so they can deliver operational excellence to our customers. They've developed systems that utilize predictive analytics, which help us reduce nonproductive time, enhance reliability and optimize operational performance. All of these systems working in unison shorten the learning curve and allow sharing of best practices between rigs, driving performance improvements in a shorter time frame and across the fleet. I would be remiss if I didn't also mention the crews and their supervisors that have managed our idle fleet of FlexRigs, and they've turned the process around to reactivating rigs. They have shown great teamwork and have worked very hard to preserve our idle FlexRig equipment stored in our facilities and also to utilize the consumables throughout the fleet. Thanks to each of you for this great effort.
Shifting to the Permian. With all the headlines, it isn't a surprise that we've activated more FlexRigs there than in any other basin. It is equally important to stress the capabilities we have in our Permian operations. We invested heavily in our infrastructure in the Permian back in 2012 through 2014, and it is our largest facility today. And at the peak, we were working just shy of 90 rigs in West Texas and had expectations to work as many as 125 rigs prior to the downturn. Today, we have 49 rigs contracted coming off a low of 37 rigs. We have 71 idle FlexRigs in the area, and 51 of those are 1,500-horsepower, and we expect to continue to have opportunities to grow our active fleet in the Permian.
In addition to having our FlexRig offering, we also have additional services in our Permian operation where we provide rig move trucks and casing running capability for our rigs. We've operated our own rig move trucking fleet since 1994, and today we are the only major drilling contractor that owns and operates a rig move trucking fleet. Our ability to control the rig move process offers substantial advantages in efficiency, safety and reliability to our operations and customers. Historically, we have ranged between 30% to 40% of all rig moves in the U.S. with our trucking fleet, and that's similar to our Permian activity today.
For over 10 years, we've offered casing running services in our U.S. land fleet. Like trucking, using our casing running personnel and tools provide competitive advantages in safety and productivity for our people and customers. Of the 14 new customers since May, 8 are working rigs in the Permian. We're seeing that the Permian is leading the recovery, and having this infrastructure in place certainly will be in advantage going forward.
The third area I want to focus on is H&P's market position to continue efforts to grow our market share in U.S. land. The market today recognizes the advantages of 1,500-horsepower AC drive rigs because those rigs are best designed for the complexity and longer laterals for horizontal shale wells and customer demand for high levels of performance and reliability. From a rig requirement perspective, extended laterals require more hydraulic horsepower, drill strength torque and greater capability from technology solutions that 1,500-horsepower AC rigs provide, and therefore, they are the rig of choice.
We estimate that H&P has approximately 55% of the available 1,500-horsepower AC rig in U.S. land today. So we're positioned with more capacity than any of our competitors in the market. We currently have 104 1,500-horsepower AC drive FlexRigs under contract and 220 idle and available to go to work in the U.S. We have 19% share of the U.S. land horizontal directional drilling market, with our closest competitor at 11%. We have slightly grown our market share from 18% since the peak of activity in 2014. We are very hopeful that the market provides an opportunity to utilize our spare capacity and build on the lead we have.
Another example of H&P's industry-leading position is our current fleet of AC drive FlexRigs that have 7,500-psi circulating systems and multi-well pad drilling capability. As mentioned earlier, these rigs meet the general criteria of what some industry followers have identified as super-spec rigs, which is a subset of AC drive rigs with 1,500-horsepower drawworks ratings. We have approximately 80 of these rigs in our U.S. land fleet, and if demand remains high, we could upgrade additional FlexRigs and have approximately 120 of these rigs by the end of our 2017 second fiscal quarter.
The industry's capacity to provide additional super-spec rigs appears to be limited today, which positions H&P very well for future expansion in the space. Should there be a significant market demand for super-spec rigs going forward, H&P has the capability of providing approximately 270 super-spec FlexRigs to the market without requiring new-build rigs, solely through upgrades where needed to our current FlexRig3 and FlexRig5 fleet. Unlike many of our competitors, we don't need to build new rigs today. Our design allows H&P to invest in our existing fleet to enhance capabilities that will benefit our customers in this more challenging and complex environment. We can do this in a scalable and cost-effective way by leveraging our uniform base of existing FlexRig designs.
Our spare capacity, combined with our strong balance sheet, gives us great flexibility to invest in the fleet, providing a family of solutions to meet customer needs and provide value to shareholders.
So before turning the call to Juan Pablo, it is clear the upcoming OPEC meeting is weighing on the oil markets, and yet, even though oil prices have pulled back over the past several weeks, it's still encouraging to see signs of optimism in the market as we're continuing to reactivate idle rigs out of our facilities safely, efficiently and cost effectively.
And now I'll turn the call over to Juan Pablo."
278341,404349007,1089190,"Helmerich & Payne, Inc., Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 17, 2016",2016-11-17,"Earnings Calls","Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, John.As reported this morning, the company had a net loss of approximately $73 million during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, resulting in an annual net loss of approximately $57 million during fiscal 2016. Nevertheless, operational result",1852,"Thank you, John.
As reported this morning, the company had a net loss of approximately $73 million during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, resulting in an annual net loss of approximately $57 million during fiscal 2016. Nevertheless, operational results were better than expected during the fourth quarter and market improvement signs are encouraging. We are now expecting our second consecutive quarter-to-quarter improvement in overall activity during the first quarter of fiscal 2017.
Following our -- some details on each of our 3 drilling segments. Our U.S. land drilling segment reported an operating loss of approximately $70 million during the fourth fiscal quarter. Nevertheless, the number of revenue days increased by approximately 6% compared to the prior quarter, resulting in an average of close to 86 rigs generating revenue days during the fourth fiscal quarter. On average, approximately 67 of these rigs were under term contract and approximately 19 rigs worked in the spot market.
Excluding the impact of early termination revenues, the average rig revenue per day declined by approximately 1% to $24,404 in the fourth fiscal quarter as the proportion of rigs working in the spot market increased significantly quarter-to-quarter. The average rig expense per day decreased by less than 1% to $13,326, excluding the lawsuit settlement and adjustments to self-insurance reserves. The corresponding average rig margin per day during the fourth fiscal quarter was $11,078.
The segment generated approximately $30 million in revenues, corresponding to early termination of long-term contracts during the fourth fiscal quarter. No early termination notices have been received or announced since our last call in July. But given prior notifications, we expect to generate approximately $9 million during the first fiscal quarter and a total of over $30 million during several quarters thereafter in early termination revenues.
Since the peak in late 2014, we have received early termination notifications for a total of 88 rigs under long-term contracts in the segment. Total early termination revenues related to these 88 contracts are estimated at approximately $466 million. As of today, our 348 available rigs in the U.S. land segment include approximately 105 rigs generating revenue and 243 idle rigs. Included in the 105 rigs generating revenue are 72 rigs under term contracts, 69 of which are generating revenue days. In addition, 33 rigs are currently active in the spot market, for a total of 102 rigs generating revenue days in the segment as compared to 86 rigs during our last earnings call in late July. Approximately 4% of these 102 rigs are now idle and on standby type day rates, which protect daily cash margins under long-term contracts. Separately, the 3 rigs that are not generating revenue days include new-build rigs with deliveries that have been delayed in exchange for compensation from customers.
Looking ahead to the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we expect a quarter-to-quarter increase in activity of roughly 20% in terms of revenue days. Excluding the impact of revenues corresponding to early terminated long-term contracts, we expect our average rig revenue per day to decline to approximately $23,500, primarily as a result of a higher proportion of rigs working in the spot market. Although we have experienced spot pricing stabilization and are now beginning to see some spot pricing improvement, the average pricing today for the 33 rigs in the spot market is still over 35% lower as compared with our spot pricing at the peak in late 2014.
The average rig expense per day level is expected to increase to roughly $14,200. This expected increase is primarily attributable to a significantly lower proportion of rigs generating revenue days while on standby, down from almost 13% of revenue days in the prior quarter to an expected level of under 5% in the first fiscal quarter. Although we expect this average expense level to eventually come down to more normalized levels during a recovery, the transitional or rig start-up expenses along with the carrying cost of over 200 idle and available AC drive FlexRigs are temporarily and unfavorably impacting the average.
If we isolate rigs that are currently active, their average expense level is at approximately $13,000 per rig per day, which is similar to overall levels experienced in more stable time periods like 2013 and 2014. Absent any additional early terminations and excluding the aforementioned rigs for which we have received early termination notifications, the segment currently has term contract commitments in place for an average of approximately 69 rigs during the first fiscal quarter, 68 rigs during the remaining 3 quarters of fiscal 2017, 39 rigs during fiscal 2018 and 17 rigs during fiscal 2019. These commitments include about 10 rigs that have relatively recently been placed under term contracts, with pricing at slightly higher than current spot market levels. Thus, as we include these newly contracted rigs, the average daily margin for rigs that are currently under term contracts is now expected to decline, moving from the prior $15,000 to $16,000 range to a new range between $14,000 and $15,000 per day during the next few quarters.
Let me now transition to our offshore operations. Segment operating income slightly increased to approximately $3 million. Total revenue days slightly increased and the average rig margin per day increased by about 14% during the fourth fiscal quarter to $9,070 per day excluding employee severance expenses in the prior quarter and self-insurance reserve adjustments during the quarter. Most of the rigs that generated revenue during the fourth fiscal quarter were rigs that remained idle on customer-owned platforms and were generating standby type day rates.
As we look at the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we expect quarterly revenue days to remain flat as 7 of our 9 offshore platform rigs continue to generate revenue days during the quarter. The average rig margin per day is expected to increase to approximately $11,250 per day during the first fiscal quarter. The expected increase is primarily attributable to 2 of 5 rigs that were previously on standby type day rates returning to work at operating day rates.
Management contracts on platform rigs continue to contribute to our offshore segment operating income. Their contribution during the fourth fiscal quarter, however, was lower than expected at under $2 million. Nevertheless, management contracts are expected to once again generate around $3 million in operating income during each of the next few quarters.
Moving on to our international land operations. This segment reported operating losses of approximately $200,000 during the fourth fiscal quarter. Excluding the impact of employee severance expenses during the prior quarter, the average rig margin per day increased sequentially by approximately 12% to $10,619 per day. The increase was primarily attributable to favorable retroactive pricing adjustments and to the absence of an expected temporary rate reduction that was mentioned during our late July call. Quarterly revenue days increased sequentially by approximately 8% to 1,372 days as 2 rigs commenced operations during the quarter. As of today, our international land segment has 14 rigs generating revenue days, including 11 in Argentina, 2 in Colombia and 1 in Bahrain. 12 of these rigs are under long-term contracts.
We expect approximately $5 million in compensation related to early terminations for 2 rigs in this segment during the first quarter of fiscal 2017. As a result, we expect international land quarterly revenue days to decrease by approximately 5% during that quarter as compared to the fourth fiscal quarter. Excluding the impact of early termination revenues, the average rig margin per day is expected to decrease to approximately $8,000 per day as a result of several factors, including the expected absence of the early terminated rigs that were generating higher than average rig margins and more of the rigs under term contracts now at standby type day rates.
When we combine all 3 of our drilling segments and exclude rigs with long-term contracts that have been early terminated, we currently have an average of approximately 82 rigs under term contracts expected to be active in fiscal 2017, 51 in fiscal 2018 and 27 in fiscal 2019.
Let me now comment on corporate level details. Our balance sheet and liquidity remain very strong. Our backlog also remains strong at $1.8 billion as of September 30. Fiscal 2017 CapEx is estimated to be around $200 million, about 30% of which is expected to be related to maintenance CapEx and tubulars and the remainder mostly to upgrades of our existing fleet. We continue to be in great position to sustain regular dividend levels and with great flexibility to take advantage of future opportunities. After this extremely challenging time for everyone in the business, we are now the only investment-grade rated company in our sector and one on a very short list within the entire oil field services universe.
Total depreciation for fiscal 2017 is expected to decline to approximately $525 million and general and administrative expenses to approximately $140 million. The reduction in the depreciation expense estimate is primarily attributable to relatively low levels of capital expenditures during fiscal 2016 and 2017. The effective income tax rate on the loss for fiscal 2016 was approximately 27%, significantly different than expected, given that instead of a slight gain for the fiscal year, we experienced a significant loss as a result of the expected -- of the unexpected select items that impacted the fourth fiscal quarter. The effective income tax rate for fiscal 2017 is at this point expected to be around 36%.
As of September 30, other current assets in our condensed balance sheet include a prepaid tax balance of $26 million and a tax receivable balance of $38 million. Also included in current assets are approximately $50 million related to insurance receivables, which are more than offset by approximately $72 million included in current liabilities in our condensed balance sheet related to the mentioned lawsuit settlement. We have a portfolio of equity securities consisting of Atwood Oceanics, Inc. and Schlumberger Limited that is reported under Investments in our balance sheet. And we have been monetizing these holdings over the years and recording very significant gains from the corresponding sales. Nevertheless, our $4 million share position in Atwood was determined to be an other than temporary loss during the fourth quarter as a result of the length of time that its share price had been under our corresponding cost. As a result, we recognized a $26 million impairment charge, equivalent to an after-tax loss of approximately $0.15 per share. This compares to an after-tax gain of approximately $0.86 per share recorded in 2013 when we monetized 4 million shares of our Atwood holdings and reduced that position in half.
As we have in the past, we will probably hold our existing portfolio positions through this downturn and once again start to monetize them during more attractive times through the cycles. Our noncurrent deferred income tax liability as of September 30, 2016, was slightly over $1.3 billion, which is slightly higher than the prior year-end level. We expect this liability level to remain in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion during the next couple of years.
With that, let me turn the call back to John."

But it really depends on basin and it's really dependent customer to customer whether you need 2 or whether you need 3. And that's a relatively small incremental investment.

What we've been saying all along is that don't expect us to enter into a lot of term contracts at -- in this kind of a pricing environment. The protection we have, if price -- if expenses go up, then we have protection in the contract to cover that. So our margin is held firm. But the majority of the contracts that we'll be entering into and have entered into are going to be spot market-based pricing. And so our protection is, in an improving environment, is -- it's typically a well-to-well agreement, and we would increase pricing on the next logical well, assuming we see that kind of pricing increase. Does that answer your question?"

Yes. And I think that's where -- if you start to think about it in terms of -- rather than looking at it as an entire fleet of rigs and focus on the rigs that are drilling horizontal and directional wells that do have the higher capability needs, not just because somebody wants it but because they need it, that's when you start getting into more of a scarcity where I think you have the potential for at least some pricing power. And I'm not talking about $25,000 a day. I'm just -- I'm talking about getting additional -- getting higher rates and improving our margins. I'm not making any sort of prediction on how high they might go. But I think that does begin to tighten the market. I think the other element is that these rigs -- you can't just continue to drill the kind of wells that the industry's drilling and not get paid for it as a contractor. The rigs are working harder, you've got 7,500-psi pumps, engines are working harder, pumps are working harder, we're using more consumables. Costs are going to have to -- I think you begin to put cost pressure in the equation. So I think in general, we're going to see improved pricing. I think there is an opportunity to differentiate substantially over our peers. I think that's -- as we have in the past, we're going to be able to command a premium."

So if that's the case, what I'm saying, it seems like the supply of available rigs to do that kind of work seems like it's pretty considerable relative to where the horizontal rig count is today.
