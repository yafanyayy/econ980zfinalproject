Good morning, and welcome to Zimmer Biomet's Fourth Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. I'm here with our CEO, David Dvorak; and our CFO, Dan Florin.
Before we start, I'd like to remind you that our discussions during this call will include forward-looking statements.
Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks and uncertainties.
Please refer to our SEC filings for a detailed discussion of these risks and uncertainties.
During our call, we will compare revenues on a constant currency adjusted pro forma billing day basis. This means revenues for the prior year periods have been adjusted to reflect the inclusion of Biomet revenue and the impact of previously announced divestiture revenues with growth rates measured on a per -- billing day basis. Additionally, expense ratios and related margin analysis through operating profit will be computed on the basis of adjusted pro forma financials as revised adjusting in all periods for inventory step and inventory manufacturing-related charges, certain claims, special items, intangible asset amortization, financing and other expenses related to the Biomet merger and certain tax adjustments as applicable. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed during our call to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are available on our website at investor.zimmerbiomet.com. In addition, we have posted to our website updated combined historical financials as revised along with adjusted pro forma revenue guidance.

This morning, I'll review our fourth quarter and full year financial results as well as key highlights from our performance.

This morning, I'll review our fourth quarter and full year financial results as well as key highlights from our performance. Dan will then provide additional financial details and discuss our guidance for 2016. 
In June of 2015, we joined together 2 innovative companies and began executing our plans to expand our leadership position in musculoskeletal health. Our combination provides significant growth opportunities with a highly complementary portfolio of product and service offerings as well as an enhanced ability to improve operating margins and drive free cash flows. 
The early success of our execution of these plans is reflected in our strong earnings performance. In the second half of 2015, we overdelivered against our initial net synergy targets, further validating our confidence in the effectiveness and accretive value of our combined organization. 
Notably, in 2015, we generated our fifth consecutive year of adjusted operating margin expansion. During the fourth quarter, we substantially completed the integration of our global commercial organizations. These actions have included the appointment of proven sales leaders and experienced sales representatives, in addition to product cross-training activities, to ensure appropriate emphasis on our market-leading large joint reconstructive businesses as well as an enhanced focus on faster-growing nonlarge joint categories. 
Based upon our significant progress, we're confident in our ability to drive sequential revenue improvement as we progress through 2016. 
Turning to market conditions. In the fourth quarter, global musculoskeletal markets demonstrated stability, with sequential strength in the United States offsetting a degree of softness in emerging markets and certain countries within the European Middle East and Africa region. 
With respect to pricing, we experienced price pressure of negative 1.3% in the quarter. Our resulting price decline for the year of 1.9% was in line with our expectations. 
Moving on to our performance. Zimmer Biomet achieved stable global revenue growth in the fourth quarter, with sequential improvement in the United States alongside continued solid results in the Asia Pacific region. 
Consolidated net sales for the fourth quarter were $1.93 billion, an increase of 58.1% reported or an increase of 0.5% over the prior year period adjusting for billing day differences. Importantly, our large joint reconstructive and S.E.T. categories in the United States delivered 240 basis points of sequential year-over-year improvement compared to our flat sales results in the third quarter. 
More broadly, revenues in the Americas region increased by 0.5% in the fourth quarter. In the Asia Pacific region, we delivered 4.0% sales growth, and our sales decreased by 1.5% in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region. Full year sales for 2015 on an adjusted pro forma basis were $6.0 billion, an increase of 1.1% over 2014. 
Zimmer Biomet's knee business grew sales by 2.2% in the fourth quarter, reflecting positive volume and mix of 4.1% and negative price of 1.9%. Our knee results were led by improved performance in the United States and an ongoing strong contribution from the Asia Pacific region, which delivered 8.2% growth over the prior year period. 
Our America segment increased revenues by 1.4%, and our Europe, Middle East and Africa region grew knee sales by 0.6%. Our commercial teams achieved this result with the portfolio of solutions that meet the personalized needs of each patient while addressing surgeon and hospital preferences. Knee sales growth was driven mainly by Persona, the personalized knee system, a leading cross-sell opportunity but was also supported by the strong market demand for the Vanguard 360 Revision Knee System as well as bicruciate preserving and clinically proven Oxford partial knee system. 
Sales from our hip business decreased by 0.6% in the fourth quarter, including positive volume and mix of 1.6% and negative price of 2.2%. Our Asia Pacific region revenues increased by 0.7%, and hip sales decreased by 0.8% in the Americas as a positive performance in the United States was offset by Latin America results. Our Europe, Middle East and Africa sales decreased by 1.0% from the prior year period. 
In future quarters, we will continue to pursue growth with our broad hip portfolio, including our G-7 acetabular system, Taperloc Complete Microplasty Stems and the Arcos femoral revision system. 
Turning to our S.E.T. product category. Sales in the fourth quarter increased 1.6% over the prior year period. We achieved solid results with our sports medicine, Surgical and Extremities portfolios, which were offset somewhat by our trauma sales performance. 
The ongoing growth of our sports medicine offerings is highlighted by our Gel-One cross-linked hyaluronic and subchondroplasty treatments. In Surgical, our sales were supported by the performance of our transposal fluid waste management system and A.T.S., automatic tourniquet system, which continued to expand our presence in the operating room suite. 
Within Extremities, we're addressing a broad range of clinical situations and surgeon preferences as evidenced by the commercial success of our Comprehensive Total Shoulder system and the Nexel Total Elbow. 
In future quarters, we'll leverage our specialized sales force and robust Trauma portfolio for improved results, with innovative solutions such as the DDR cross-lock distal radius plating system, the affixes hip fracture nail system and the Natural Nail system. 
Worldwide dental sales decreased by 6.7% in the fourth quarter. Our dental category experienced revenue headwinds due to a supply disruption related to a voluntary field action in response to a packaging issue. We are in the process of remediating this matter, and we expect to do so fully by the close of the first quarter, which will help position us to reestablish our momentum in dental in the second half of the year. 
We remain encouraged by the early success of our cross-selling activity, particularly with our market-leading regenerative product line as we progress through the integration of this business. 
Zimmer Biomet's Spine, craniomaxillofacial and thoracic category revenues decreased by 2.0% from the prior year period. Our craniomaxillofacial and thoracic team continued to deliver strong growth, driven by steady demand for our TraumaOne and sternal lock blue systems as well as growing acceptance of our RibFix Blu System. 
With regard to Spine, we successfully completed the integration of our U.S. Spine commercial channel with anticipated near-term revenue dis-synergies slowing our growth in the quarter. We believe this business as well positioned for accelerated performance in 2016 with a more comprehensive portfolio of innovative spinal solutions, including the Virage OCT Spinal Fixation System, the Polaris spinal system and the Timberline Lateral Fusion System. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Dan, who will continue this discussion in greater detail as well as review our guidance. Dan?"

I will review our fourth quarter performance in more detail and then provide additional information related to our first quarter and full year 2016 sales and earnings guidance. Our total revenues for the fourth quarter were $1,934,000,",1697,"Thank you, David. I will review our fourth quarter performance in more detail and then provide additional information related to our first quarter and full year 2016 sales and earnings guidance. 
Our total revenues for the fourth quarter were $1,934,000,000, an increase of 0.5% constant currency compared to the fourth quarter of 2014 on an adjusted pro forma billing day basis. Net currency impact for the quarter decreased revenues by 4.4% or $90 million. The negative currency impact for the quarter was related to the ongoing strength of the U.S. dollar against many international currencies. 
As David reviewed, we were encouraged to have substantially completed the integration of our commercial teams, which contributed to the sequential improvement of our reconstructive and S.E.T. performances in the United States, which increased over a flat year-on-year growth rate in the third quarter to 2.4% this quarter, in line with our expectations. 
However, we did have some unanticipated headwinds, including decelerating market conditions in certain emerging and Southern European countries as well as the dental field actions, which David referenced. These conditions led to our overall constant-currency sales growth coming in at the bottom of our guidance range. 
Our adjusted gross profit margin was 75.6% for the quarter and 20 basis points less when compared to the prior year adjusted pro forma results due to the impact of foreign exchange and price declines, mostly offset by gains from our cash flow hedging program. 
The company's R&D expense was 4.4% [ph] of revenue at $85.9 million and 20 basis points higher when compared to the prior year period. Adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses were $723.6 million in the fourth quarter or 37.4% of sales, an improvement of 170 basis points over the comparable period in the prior year. 
We continue to achieve process and operational efficiencies in the fourth quarter through the ongoing implementation of initiatives designed to capture synergies. In the quarter, the company recorded pretax charges of approximately $533 million in special items, primarily related to the Biomet acquisition and integration-related expenses. 
Adjusted fourth quarter 2015 figures in the earnings release exclude the impact of these charges, which include $380 million of noncash amortization and inventory step-up charges as well as $120 million of integration costs. A full reconciliation of reported net earnings to adjusted net earnings is included in this morning's press release. 
Adjusted operating profit in the quarter amounted to $652.4 million or 33.7% of sales, a 120 basis point improvement over the prior year period. Net interest expense for the quarter amounted to $88 million, consistent with expectations. 
Adjusted net earnings were $428.3 million for the fourth quarter, an increase of 39.2% compared to the prior year period. Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 17.4% to $2.09 on 205.2 million average outstanding diluted shares. These adjusted earnings per share are inclusive of approximately $0.03 of share-based compensation. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the year increased 7.8% to $6.90 on 189.8 million shares. 
Our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 23.8%. The company had approximately 202.6 million shares of common stock outstanding as of December 31, 2015, increasing from 169.7 million as of December 31, 2014, due to primarily to the Biomet transaction. 
During the quarter, the company invested $150 million to repurchase 1.4 million shares. As of December 31, 2015, approximately $450 million remains available under the existing share repurchase authorization. 
Operating cash flow for the quarter amounted to $433.2 million, an increase of 22% over the fourth quarter of 2014. This result includes $114 million of cash expenditures for integration and initiatives related to our synergy program. 
Free cash flow in the fourth quarter was $303.7 million, which was 12% higher than the fourth quarter of 2014. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $129.5 million, which included $80.4 million for instruments and $49.1 million for property, plant and equipment. 
During the quarter, the company repaid $350 million on our term loan, bringing the repayment total in 2015 to $500 million. Our gross leverage ratio at December 31 was 4.0x. 
I'd like to now turn to our guidance. I will provide revenue and adjusted earnings per share guidance for both the first quarter and the full year. Additionally, I will review our expectations for free cash flow in 2016. 
Beginning with our market assumptions for 2016, we believe that the musculoskeletal markets, in which we participate, will grow approximately 3%. We expect global market conditions to remain stable in 2016 when compared to the full year 2015. 
Price is forecasted to be approximately negative 2%, consistent with the last several years. For 2016, we estimate our adjusted pro forma revenue growth to be in a range of 1.5% to 2.5% on a constant currency basis. 
Foreign exchange is expected to decrease revenues by 2.0%, primarily driven by the euro and Australian dollar along with certain emerging market currencies. Taken together, revenue growth for the year should be in a range of negative 0.5% to positive 0.5% or a range of $7,415,000,000 to $7,490,000,000. 
As David outlined, with the integration of our commercial organization substantially complete, we expect constant currency year-over-year revenue growth to improve sequentially as we progress through 2016. 
In terms of quarterly revenue pacing, we expect first quarter constant currency growth of 0.5% to 1%, and I would guide you toward market growth rates as we progress through the second half of 2016. We will drive revenue acceleration across multiple product categories, with offerings such as Persona, the personalized knee system; the Oxford partial knee; Gel-One cross-linked hyaluronic knee creation subchondroplasty; and the Arcos modular femoral hip revision system, additionally supported by a cadence of new product launches. 
We expect to realize increasing sales force productivity over the course of the year, driven by added stability and specialization in our global sales organization and supported by the benefits of our medical education and training programs. 
As you move down the income statement for 2016, assuming currency rates remain near-recent levels, we expect our gross margin ratio to be between 75.5% and 76%. This takes into account the anticipated gains on foreign currency hedges, principally from the euro and Japanese yen. 
I would like to note that the company won't realize the full annual P&O benefit from the suspended medical device excise tax in 2016 because it was largely treated as an inventory cost. The portion that provides relief to the P&L during the year amounts to approximately $20 million, and we intend to reinvest this benefit in R&D to accelerate our innovation and growth opportunities. 
We expect R&D expense for the year to be in a range of 4.5% to 5.0% of sales. SG&A is expected to be approximately 37% of sales as we continue to realize efficiencies from our synergy initiatives and further leverage revenue growth. 
Assuming interest rates remain near-recent levels, we expect net interest and other expense of $365 million. This incorporates our debt repayment plan throughout 2016. 
We anticipate an adjusted effective tax rate to be approximately 26%, which is in line with our final full year rate for 2015. We anticipate the diluted weighted average shares outstanding for the first quarter to total approximately 204 million shares and in a range of 203 million to 204 million shares for the full year. 
The share count considers additional share repurchases planned during 2016. Therefore, full year adjusted diluted earnings per share is projected to be in a range of $7.80 to $7.95. 
Given our early success in capturing cost savings, we remain on pace to deliver our net operating EBIT synergy target of $350 million by the end of year 3, with approximately $225 million of cumulative net benefit achieved by year-end 2016. 
As I stated earlier, we expect revenues to increase between 0.5% and 1.0% on a constant currency adjusted pro forma basis when compared to the first quarter of 2015. At this time, assuming currency rates remain where they had been -- where they have been during the first month of this quarter, we anticipate foreign currency translation will decrease our reported first quarter revenues by an estimated 2.5%. 
Therefore, we expect first quarter revenues to be between 1.5% and 2.0% below the prior year period or a range of $1,870,000,000 to $1,880,000,000. We expect gross margin and operating expenses ratios to be similar during the first quarter as those realized in the fourth quarter of 2015. 
Our adjusted effective tax rate is expected to be between 26.5% and 27%. Therefore, we expect first quarter adjusted earnings per share to be in a range between $1.90 and $1.95. 
Turning to cash flow. We anticipate full year 2016 operating cash flows to be in a range of $1.65 billion to $1.75 billion, inclusive of approximately $290 million of expenditures in support of our synergy program. This compares to full year 2015 of $863 million. 
This includes total capital expenditures for the year, which are expected to be in a range of $550 million to $575 million. Instrument capital is expected to be in a range of $300 million to $325 million in support of our cross-selling initiatives as well as new product introductions. Traditional PP&E is expected to be approximately $250 million, including $105 million necessary to rationalize facilities and ERP systems as well as to optimize our manufacturing a logistics network. 
Free cash flow is, therefore, expected to be in a range of $1,075,000,000 to $1,020,000,000 for the year. Our guidance assumes that we will continue to deliver our balance sheet with planned debt repayments of approximately $1 billion, exiting the year with a leverage ratio of approximately 3.5x on a gross basis or just under 3.0x on a net basis. 
We intend to return excess cash our stockholders through our share repurchase and dividend programs. Free cash flow in excess of the capital allocation programs is assumed to be held in cash and cash equivalents or other investments. 
For modeling purposes, intangibles, amortization expense for the year is estimated to total approximately $600 million. And finally, please note that our guidance does not include any impact from other potential business development transactions or unforeseen events. 
David, I'll turn the call back over to you."

Probably the most important element of the integration as a whole, as Dan said and you referenced, we have a high degree of confidence in our ability to deliver on the operating synergies, but with the progress that we made in the fourth quarter to appoint sales leaders across the globe, intermediary management level and clarify the roles of reps in all product categories, their compensation plans, the bags that they're going to be carrying, the territories that they're going to be selling to, targets for them for 2016, all of that clarity and visibility along with a really aggressive effort to get people trained up on products that 6 months ago they weren't at all familiar with because they didn't have in their bag, that sets us up to make the progress that we're referencing in 2016. So -- and we're already seeing the beginnings of the cross-sell coming to fruition as well we had some very successful kickoff meetings with further product training and education, and I would tell you that the attendance from a surgeon perspective our medical training and education programs show a big acceptance and interest in learning about the new products, technologies to ensure their safe and efficacious use. So all of that gives us visibility that we're going to push out sequential improvement each quarter of 2016, and it stands to reason relative to where we were a year ago that, that would be the case with the certainty that comes with the progress I just described to you. Furthermore, the revenue dis-synergies will begin to anniversary out as we get into the latter part of the year, and so you can picture a line graph, where the cross-sell is accelerating through the year, and the revenue dis-synergies as you get to the back part of the year begin to anniversary out. And as a consequence, we'd expect to hit market growth rates in the second half of the year and then exit the year at or above market growth rates."

First, it sounds like this is the case, but can you just confirm, David, that the level of sales force turnover that you're seeing is kind of as you expected? I just would love to get a specific update there, and then also in your 2016 revenue growth guidance, are you assuming that Southern Europe and emerging markets improve? Or are you assuming they kind of stay the same? And then lastly, and probably most importantly, I was wondering if you could just kind of drill down a little more specifically on what are the product lines that you think are most likely to drive acceleration over the course of 2016?

I think to take them in order, the sales force turnover is a very consistent with our expectations. We had described to you that it was a fairly normal cadence of turnover in 2015, but what had transpired in the first half of the year was a slowing of the hiring, particularly in the case of the independent distributorships. That began to correct out as the months progressed and now we're entering 2016 with an expectation that, that will net one another out. We're getting the positive growth and particular emphasis to be placed upon the nonlarge joint sales force specialization because we have all the necessary ingredients from a product portfolio to compete very effectively in some of those faster growing markets and a lot of room for growth and runway based upon our market share. So we're enthusiastic about that. So consider the sales force to be stable, and we would look 2016 to bring net gains in sales force representation. The presumption on the emerging markets and sort of the certain countries within Europe that we referenced in our comments is a steady state, probably more of what we would expect to see or what we experienced in the second half of 2015 continuing into 2016, and there's been a lot of discussion around Latin America, in particular. We've experienced that in full. In our case, our business in China is held up more strongly than what it sounds like other people are commenting on, and we continue to believe that will perform strongly. But even that business has slowed down, we're still in a growth mode in China. So those emerging markets have gone from historically strong mid- to upper teens growth quarter-to-quarter to sort of double-digit growth by the middle of last year into low single-digit growth, and we'd expect that picture to improve because we're going to be anniversary out of some of those downward trend. So more than math dictates that. As far as the products go, it's a long list, but I'd rattle off the top of my head some of the ones that we're already seeing a lot of interest and uptake on. Persona is just doing really well, obviously taking that product into the legacy Biomet customer accounts. I would tell you that within the knee category, you're seeing a lot of interest in Oxford at this point in time, and that's an opportunity for us in light of the divestiture. That's pretty special. We're doing very well with Gel-One. We're doing very well with Subchondroplasty. We've talked to you in the past about the hip products that are additive, mostly coming from the legacy Biomet side that have been performing quite well, and that's a business unit now we need to shore up. It includes revision on the side of the hips. The comprehensive shoulder is doing very well on the Extremities side, and I would add in some of the complementary aspects of the product portfolio within Trauma, distal radius plating, which was a space that legacy Zimmer was not hardly present at all in. We're going to do very well with that product. That's a pretty good list for you. ."

I mean, it's true that the math is advantageous to produce growth rates based upon the performance of the company in the second half of last year, and you're able to have full access to those numbers to understand that dynamic, but we're focused on taking what we believe to be the industry leading product portfolio and executing. And remember, that as we built this channel out across the globe, we picked the most successful leaders in the U.S. We referenced this before. On average, those selected leaders were growing their business 300 basis points above those that were not selected to take the business forward. So we have a lot of experience at the rep level, proven leadership at the territory level.

I think that the opportunity to drive enhanced quality in a cost-efficient way is an area of focus for us from an innovation standpoint. It's been an area of focus for us through both internal and external development over the better part of the last decade, and we're happy with our progress. The portfolio of operative and intraoperative technologies that we've assembled, we continue to expand, it is strong. It includes proprietary technologies like as well as signature psi for soft tissue balancing, and we think that there is a wonderful value proposition for that set of technologies, but we are mindful in the way that we are developing these technologies to ensure that there is, in fact, a proven clinical benefit, and it's delivered in a cost-efficient way and in an evolving health care market that we're looking to serve and the partnerships now we want to create that will be deeper than ever with these customers to ensure that they are bringing about an enhanced level of quality in the patient care that they deliver, at the same time, that their managing costs in an optimized way. We think the that that's the right recipe. So we think that there is a need and an opportunity to improve. We think that, for instance, on the large joint side to drive towards more reproducible use of these systems, the alignment placement, soft tissue balancing, all areas that we're very much focused on, we just think that it needs to take the form of clinical proven cost-efficient solutions, and so that's what we've been focused on and what we'll continue to focus on. We're really agnostic as to the embodiment of that technology so long as it meets those needs. With respect to -- you referenced custom solutions. We have built out a wonderful portfolio of personalized solutions. Our interventions, we can help clinicians irrespective of where that patient is in the disease data along the continuum of care and then wherever that thought what is on the continuum of care for that particular patient, we want to offer the most personalized solutions. So when you apply that's our portfolio everything from early intervention, joint preservation solutions such as a Gel-One and subchondroplasty through partial knee replacements, for instance, with Oxford into a total knee solution, whether it's Vanguard or Persona, the personalized knee system, that's a system that offers approximately 17,000 permutations. So we did extensive work to identify and accountable differences and design a system that would address any of those anatomical difference with clinical significance, and so that really is a mass customization strategy that's worked very well to leverage off of the heritage and clinical proof points of the legacy systems and ensure that we're bringing about improve patient outcomes without incurring the risk of going backwards. We referenced Biomet's custom solutions. It is the case that the Vanguard Select is a custom solution. So as I described to you, the mass customization approach that we took with Persona, there are going to be instances where a patient's anatomy is such an outlier or in oncology context, context, deformities in either true custom solution and I am sure that company has done more of that in the musculoskeletal space than anyone including these solutions that Biomet has provided, and that isn't just enlarged joints. We do terrific work -- I was just down a week ago in our craniomaxillofacial group, and they've done some quite literally life-saving solutions for patients on a true custom basis. So across all of our product lines, we have active efforts and existing solutions in that regard."

And now there's a lot of moving parts within that ability to hold the gross margin rate. There's impact of foreign currency to the translation, but then there's also the benefit of the cash flow hedges that flow through the gross margin line as well. On top of that, the synergy program, we do start to begin to see some level of benefit at the COGS line by virtue of the integration, and that's also contributing to kind of a flattish overall gross margin. And I think the other important point of all, foreign currency, the impact to the 2016 P&L remains significant as it was in 2015. And so the foreign currency headwind to earnings is in the neighborhood of $0.15 or $0.16 of headwind on EPS. The other important point is we are planning to reinvest the medical devices tax, and so we account for that up in COGS. So there is a shift out of COGS into R&D in our 2016 guidance."

Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings for detailed discussions of these risks and uncertainties.

This morning, I'll review our fourth quarter and full year financial results as well as key highlights from our performance. Dan will then provide additional financial details and discuss our guidance for 2016. 
In June of 2015, we joined together 2 innovative companies and began executing our plans to expand our leadership position in musculoskeletal health. Our combination provides significant growth opportunities with a highly complementary portfolio of product and service offerings as well as an enhanced ability to improve operating margins and drive free cash flows. The early success of our execution of these plans is reflected in our strong earnings performance. In the second half of 2015, we overdelivered against our initial net synergy targets, further validating our confidence in the effectiveness and accretive value of our combined organization. 
Notably, in 2015, we generated our fifth consecutive year of adjusted operating margin expansion. During the fourth quarter, we substantially completed the integration of our global commercial organizations. These actions have included the appointment of proven sales leaders and experienced sales representatives in addition to product cross-training activities to ensure appropriate emphasis on our market-leading large joint reconstructive businesses as well as an enhanced focus on faster-growing nonlarge joint categories. Based upon our significant progress, we're confident in our ability to drive sequential revenue improvement as we progress through 2016. 
Turning to market conditions. In the fourth quarter, global musculoskeletal markets demonstrated stability, with sequential strength in the United States offsetting a degree of softness in emerging markets and certain countries within the European, Middle East and Africa region. 
With respect to pricing, we experienced price pressure of negative 1.3% in the quarter. Our resulting price decline for the year of 1.9% was in line with our expectations. 
Moving on to our performance. Zimmer Biomet achieved stable global revenue growth in the fourth quarter, with sequential improvement in the United States, alongside continued solid results in the Asia Pacific region. Consolidated net sales for the fourth quarter were $1.93 billion, an increase of 58.1% reported or an increase of 0.5% over the prior year period adjusting for billing day differences. Importantly, our large joint reconstructive and S.E.T. categories in the United States delivered 240 basis points of sequential year-over-year improvement compared to our flat sales results in the third quarter. 
More broadly, revenues in the Americas region increased by 0.5% in the fourth quarter. In the Asia Pacific region, we delivered 4.0% sales growth, and our sales decreased by 1.5% in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region. Full year sales for 2015 on an adjusted pro forma basis were $6.0 billion, an increase of 1.1% over 2014. 
Zimmer Biomet's knee business grew sales by 2.2% in the fourth quarter, reflecting positive volume and mix of 4.1% and negative price of 1.9%. Our knee results were led by improved performance in the United States and an ongoing strong contribution from the Asia Pacific region, which delivered 8.2% growth over the prior year period. 
Our Americas segment increased revenues by 1.4%; and our Europe, Middle East and Africa region grew knee sales by 0.6%. Our commercial teams achieved this result with the portfolio of solutions that meet the personalized needs of each patient while addressing surgeon and hospital preferences. Knee sales growth was driven mainly by Persona The Personalized Knee System, a leading cross-sell opportunity but was also supported by the strong market demand for the Vanguard 360 Revision Knee System as well as the Bicruciate Preserving and clinically proven Oxford Partial Knee system. 
Sales from our hip business decreased by 0.6% in the fourth quarter, including positive volume and mix of 1.6% and negative price of 2.2%. Our Asia Pacific region, revenues increased by 0.7%, and hip sales decreased by 0.8% in the Americas as a positive performance in the United States was offset by Latin America results. Our Europe, Middle East and Africa sales decreased by 1.0% from the prior year period. 
In future quarters, we will continue to pursue growth with our broad hip portfolio, including our G7 Acetabular System, Taperloc Complete Microplasty stems and the Arcos femoral revision system. 
Turning to our S.E.T. product category. Sales in the fourth quarter increased 1.6% over the prior year period. We achieved solid results with our sports medicine, surgical and extremities portfolios, which were offset somewhat by our trauma sales performance. The ongoing growth of our sports medicine offerings is highlighted by our Gel-One Cross-linked Hyaluronic and Subchondroplasty treatments. 
In surgical, our sales were supported by the performance of our Transposal Fluid Waste Management System and A.T.S. Automatic Tourniquet System, which continue to expand our presence in the operating room suite. 
Within extremities, we're addressing a broad range of clinical situations and surgeon preferences, as evidenced by the commercial success of our comprehensive total shoulder system and the Nexel Total Elbow. 
In future quarters, we'll leverage our specialized sales force and robust trauma portfolio for improved results with innovative solutions such as the DDR CrossLock Distal Radius Plating System, the AFFIXUS Hip Fracture Nail System and the Natural Nail System. 
Worldwide Dental sales decreased by 6.7% in the fourth quarter. Our Dental category experienced revenue headwinds due to a supply disruption related to a voluntary field action in response to a packaging issue. We're in the process of remediating this matter, and we expect to do so fully by the close of the first quarter, which will help position us to reestablish our momentum in Dental in the second half of the year. We remain encouraged by the early success of our cross-selling activity, particularly with our market-leading regenerative product line as we progress through the integration of this business. 
Zimmer Biomet's Spine, craniomaxillofacial and thoracic category revenues decreased by 2.0% from the prior year period. Our craniomaxillofacial and thoracic team continue to deliver strong growth, driven by steady demand for our TraumaOne and SternaLock Blu Systems as well as growing acceptance of our RibFix Blu System. 
With regard to Spine, we successfully completed the integration of our U.S. Spine commercial channel with anticipated near-term revenue dissynergies slowing our growth in the quarter. We believe this business is well positioned for accelerated performance in 2016 with a more comprehensive portfolio of innovative spinal solutions, including the Virage OCT Spinal Fixation System, the Polaris Spinal System and the Timberline Lateral Fusion System. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Dan, who will continue this discussion in greater detail as well as review our guidance. Dan?"

I will review our fourth quarter performance in more detail, and then provide additional information related to our first quarter and full year 2016 sales and earnings guidance. Our total revenues for the fourth quarter were $1,934,000",1691,"Thank you, David. I will review our fourth quarter performance in more detail, and then provide additional information related to our first quarter and full year 2016 sales and earnings guidance. 
Our total revenues for the fourth quarter were $1,934,000,000, an increase of 0.5% constant currency compared to the fourth quarter of 2014 on an adjusted pro forma billing day basis. Net currency impact for the quarter decreased revenues by 4.4% or $90 million. The negative currency impact for the quarter was related to the ongoing strength of the U.S. dollar against many international currencies. 
As David reviewed, we were encouraged to have substantially completed the integration of our commercial teams, which contributed to the sequential improvement of our reconstructive and S.E.T. performances in the United States, which increased over a flat year-on-year growth rate in the third quarter to 2.4% this quarter, in line with our expectations. However, we did have some unanticipated headwinds, including decelerating market conditions in certain emerging and Southern European countries as well as the dental field action, which David referenced. These conditions led to our overall constant-currency sales growth coming in at the bottom of our guidance range. 
Our adjusted gross profit margin was 75.6% for the quarter and 20 basis points less when compared to the prior year adjusted pro forma results due to the impact of foreign exchange and price declines, mostly offset by gains from our cash flow hedging program. 
The company's R&D expense was 4.4% of revenue at $85.9 million and 20 basis points higher when compared to the prior year period. Adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses were $723.6 million in the fourth quarter or 37.4% of sales, an improvement of 170 basis points over the comparable period in the prior year. 
We continued to achieve process and operational efficiencies in the fourth quarter through the ongoing implementation of initiatives designed to capture synergies. In the quarter, the company recorded pretax charges of approximately $533 million in special items, primarily related to the Biomet acquisition and integration-related expenses. Adjusted fourth quarter 2015 figures in the earnings release exclude the impact of these charges, which include $380 million of noncash amortization and inventory step-up charges as well as $120 million of integration costs. A full reconciliation of reported net earnings to adjusted net earnings is included in this morning's press release. 
Adjusted operating profit in the quarter amounted to $652.4 million or 33.7% of sales, a 120 basis point improvement over the prior year period. Net interest expense for the quarter amounted to $88 million, consistent with expectations. 
Adjusted net earnings were $428.3 million for the fourth quarter, an increase of 39.2% compared to the prior year period. Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 17.4% to $2.09 on 205.2 million average outstanding diluted shares. These adjusted earnings per share are inclusive of approximately $0.03 of share-based compensation. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the year increased 7.8% to $6.90 on 189.8 million shares. 
Our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 23.8%. The company had approximately 202.6 million shares of common stock outstanding as of December 31, 2015, increasing from 169.7 million as of December 31, 2014, due primarily to the Biomet transaction. During the quarter, the company invested $150 million to repurchase 1.4 million shares. As of December 31, 2015, approximately $450 million remains available under the existing share repurchase authorization. 
Operating cash flow for the quarter amounted to $433.2 million, an increase of 22% over the fourth quarter of 2014. This result includes $114 million of cash expenditures for integration and initiatives related to our synergy program. 
Free cash flow in the fourth quarter was $303.7 million, which was 12% higher than the fourth quarter of 2014. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $129.5 million, which included $80.4 million for instruments and $49.1 million for property, plant and equipment. 
During the quarter, the company repaid $350 million on our term loan, bringing the repayment total in 2015 to $500 million. Our gross leverage ratio at December 31 was 4.0x. 
I'd like to now turn to our guidance. I will provide revenue and adjusted earnings per share guidance for both the first quarter and the full year. Additionally, I will review our expectations for free cash flow in 2016. 
Beginning with our market assumptions for 2016. We believe that the musculoskeletal markets in which we participate will grow approximately 3%. We expect global market conditions to remain stable in 2016 when compared to the full year 2015. 
Price is forecasted to be approximately negative 2%, consistent with the last several years. For 2016, we estimate our adjusted pro forma revenue growth to be in a range of 1.5% to 2.5% on a constant currency basis. 
Foreign exchange is expected to decrease revenues by 2.0%, primarily driven by the euro and Australian dollar, along with certain emerging market currencies. Taken together, revenue growth for the year should be in a range of negative 0.5% to positive 0.5% or a range of $7,415,000,000 to $7,490,000,000. 
As David outlined, with the integration of our commercial organization substantially complete, we expect constant currency year-over-year revenue growth to improve sequentially as we progress through 2016. 
In terms of quarterly revenue pacing, we expect first quarter constant currency growth of 0.5% to 1%, and I would guide you toward market growth rates as we progress through the second half of 2016. We will drive revenue acceleration across multiple product categories, with offerings such as Persona The Personalized Knee System; the Oxford Partial Knee; Gel-One Cross-linked Hyaluronic knee creation subchondroplasty; and the Arcos modular femoral hip revision system, additionally supported by a cadence of new product launches. We expect to realize increasing sales force productivity over the course of the year, driven by added stability and specialization in our global sales organization and supported by the benefits of our medical education and training programs. 
As you move down the income statement for 2016, assuming currency rates remain near-recent levels, we expect our gross margin ratio to be between 75.5% and 76%. This takes into account anticipated gains on foreign currency hedges, principally from the euro and Japanese yen. 
I would like to note that the company won't realize the full annual P&O benefit from the suspended medical device excise tax in 2016 because it was largely treated as an inventoriable cost. The portion that provides relief to the P&L during the year amounts to approximately $20 million, and we intend to reinvest this benefit in R&D to accelerate our innovation and growth opportunities. 
We expect R&D expense for the year to be in a range of 4.5% to 5.0% of sales. SG&A is expected to be approximately 37% of sales as we continue to realize efficiencies from our synergy initiatives and further leverage revenue growth. 
Assuming interest rates remain in near-recent levels, we expect net interest and other expense of $365 million. This incorporates our debt repayment plan throughout 2016. 
We anticipate an adjusted effective tax rate to be approximately 26%, which is in line with our final full year rate for 2015. We anticipate the diluted weighted average shares outstanding for the first quarter to total approximately 204 million shares and in a range of 203 million to 204 million shares for the full year. This share count considers additional share repurchases planned during 2016. Therefore, full year adjusted diluted earnings per share is projected to be in a range of $7.80 to $7.95. 
Given our early success in capturing cost savings, we remain on pace to deliver our net operating EBIT synergy target of $350 million by the end of year 3, with approximately $225 million of cumulative net benefit achieved by year-end 2016. 
As I stated earlier, we expect revenues to increase between 0.5% and 1.0% on a constant currency adjusted pro forma basis when compared to the first quarter of 2015. At this time, assuming currency rates remain where they have been during the first month of this quarter, we anticipate foreign currency translation will decrease our reported first quarter revenues by an estimated 2.5%. Therefore, we expect first quarter revenues to be between 1.5% and 2.0% below the prior year period or a range of $1,870,000,000 to $1,880,000,000. We expect gross margin and operating expense ratios to be similar during the first quarter as those realized in the fourth quarter of 2015. 
Our adjusted effective tax rate is expected to be between 26.5% and 27%. Therefore, we expect first quarter adjusted earnings per share to be in a range between $1.90 and $1.95. 
Turning to cash flow. We anticipate full year 2016 operating cash flows to be in a range of $1.65 billion to $1.75 billion, inclusive of approximately $290 million of expenditures in support of our synergy program. This compares to full year 2015 of $863 million. This includes total capital expenditures for the year, which are expected to be in a range of $550 million to $575 million. 
Instrument capital is expected to be in a range of $300 million to $325 million in support of our cross-sell initiatives as well as new product introductions. Traditional PP&E is expected to be approximately $250 million, including $105 million necessary to rationalize facilities and ERP systems as well as to optimize our manufacturing and logistics network. Free cash flow is, therefore, expected to be in a range of $1,075,000,000 to $1,020,000,000 for the year. 
Our guidance assumes that we will continue to delever our balance sheet with planned debt repayments of approximately $1 billion, exiting the year with a leverage ratio of approximately 3.5x on a gross basis or just under 3.0x on a net basis. 
We intend to return excess cash to our stockholders through our share repurchase and dividend programs. Free cash flow in excess of this capital allocation program is assumed to be held in cash and cash equivalents or other investments. 
For modeling purposes, intangible amortization expense for the year is estimated to total approximately $600 million. And finally, please note that our guidance does not include any impact from other potential business development transactions or unforeseen events. 
David, I'll turn the call back over to you."

What gives us confidence is really the integration and synergy program and the progress that we continue to make and the clear line of sight that we have to the synergy opportunity as we progress through 2016. If you recall at the time of the merger announcement, we announced $135 million of net EBIT synergies in year 1. And then during the Q3 call, we raised that to $155 million and stayed with the $350 million by year 3. As we look at 2016, we see $225 million of cumulative net EBIT synergies in the P&L, and that -- and we have good line of sight to that. So that's what gives us strong conviction in the ability to deliver on net synergies, along with the ability to see sequential improvement on the top line and the flexibility we have with our capital allocation."

David, I think it is appropriate to characterize the fourth quarter performance as you did, and yet I would tell you that the progress that we made on the commercial channel integration was very, very significant. Probably the most important element of the integration as a whole, as Dan said, we -- and you referenced, we have a high degree of confidence in our ability to deliver on the operating synergies. But with the progress that we made in the fourth quarter to appoint sales leaders across the globe, intermediary management level, and clarify the roles of reps in all product categories, their compensation plans, the bags that they're going to be carrying, the territories that they're going to be selling to, targets for them for 2016, all of that clarity and visibility along with a really aggressive effort to get people trained up on products that 6 months ago they weren't at all familiar with because they didn't have in their bag, that sets us up to make the progress that we're referencing in 2016. So -- and we're already seeing the beginnings of the cross-sell coming to fruition. As well, we had some very successful kickoff meetings with further product training and education. And I would tell you that the attendance from a surgeon's perspective our medical training and education programs show a big acceptance and interest in learning about the new products and technologies to ensure their safe and efficacious use. So all of that gives us visibility that we're going to push out sequential improvement each quarter of 2016. And it stands to reason relative to where we were a year ago that, that would be the case with the certainty that comes with the progress I just described to you. Furthermore, the revenue dissynergies will begin to anniversary out as we get into the latter part of the year, and so you can picture a line graph, where the cross-sell is accelerating through the year and the revenue dissynergies as you get to the back part of the year begin to anniversary out. And as a consequence, we'd expect to hit market growth rates in the second half of the year, and then exit the year at or above market growth rates."

So I just wanted to drill down a little bit more on the prospects for revenue growth improvement. So a couple of quick things. First, it sounds like this is the case, but can you just confirm, David, that the level of sales force turnover that you're seeing is kind of as you expected? I just would love to get a specific update there. And then also in your 2016 revenue growth guidance, are you assuming that Southern Europe and emerging markets improve? Or are you assuming they kind of stay the same? And then, lastly, and probably most importantly, I was wondering if you could just kind of drill down a little more specifically on what are the product lines that you think are most likely to drive acceleration over the course of 2016? What are the things that you have the most confidence in?"

I think that the -- to take them in order, the sales force turnover is very consistent with our expectations. We had described to you that it was a fairly normal cadence of turnover in 2015, but what had transpired in the first half of the year",544,"Sure, Bob. I think that the -- to take them in order, the sales force turnover is very consistent with our expectations. We had described to you that it was a fairly normal cadence of turnover in 2015, but what had transpired in the first half of the year was a slowing of the hiring, particularly in the case of the independent distributorships. That began to correct out as the months progressed, and now we're entering 2016 with an expectation that, that will net one another out and will get into positive growth. And particular emphasis is going to be placed upon the nonlarge joint to bring more sales force specialization because we have all the necessary ingredients from a product portfolio to compete very effectively in some of those faster-growing markets and a lot of room for growth and runway based upon our market share. So we're enthusiastic about that. So consider the sales force to be stable, and we would look 2016 to bring net gains in sales force representation. The presumption on the emerging markets and sort of the certain countries within Europe that we referenced in our comments is a steady state, probably more of what we would expect to see or what we experienced in the second half of 2015 continuing into 2016. And there's been a lot of discussion around Latin America, in particular. We've experienced that in full. In our case, our business in China is -- held up more strongly than what it sounds like other people are commenting on, and we continue to believe that will perform strongly. But even that business has slowed down. We're still in a growth mode in China. So those emerging markets have gone from historically strong mid- to upper teen growth quarter-to-quarter, sort of double-digit growth by the middle of last year into low single-digit growth, and we'd expect that picture to improve because we're going to be anniversarying out of some of those downward trends. So more than that, it dictates that. As far as the products go, it's a long list. But I'd rattle off the top of my head some of the ones that we're already seeing a lot of interest and uptick -- uptake on. Persona is doing really well, obviously taking that product into the legacy Biomet customer accounts. I would tell you that within the knee category, we're seeing a lot of interest in Oxford at this point in time, and that's an opportunity for us in light of the divestiture that's pretty special. We're doing very well with Gel-One. We're doing very well with Subchondroplasty. We've talked to you in the past about the hip products that are additive mostly coming from the legacy Biomet side that had been performing quite well, and that's a business unit that we need to shore up. It includes revision on the side of the hips. The Comprehensive Shoulder is doing very well on the extremities side. And I would add in some of the complementary aspects of the product portfolio within trauma, Distal Radius Plating, which was a space that legacy Zimmer was not hardly present at all in. We're going to do very well with that product. That's a pretty good list for you."

That said, 1 quarter does -- trend does not make, and we just want to be smart about our guiding going forward. I think that, that 2% number is the right way to think about price down in 2016.

I mean, it's true that the math is advantageous to produce growth rates based upon the performance of the company in the second half of last year, and you're able to have full access to those numbers to understand that dynamic, but we're focused on taking what we believe to be the industry-leading product portfolio and executing. And remember that as we built this channel out across the globe, we picked the most successful leaders in the U.S. We've referenced this before. On average, those selected leaders were growing their businesses 300 basis points above those that were not selected to take the business forward. So we have a lot of experience at the rep level, proven leadership at the territory level. And with this product bag and running the offense that we expect to run, we're just going to be driving ourselves back into that market growth rate.

I think that the opportunity to drive enhanced quality in a cost-efficient way is an area of focus for us from an innovation standpoint. It's been an area of focus for us through both internal and external development over the better part of the last decade, and we're happy with our progress. The portfolio of preoperative and intraoperative technologies that we've assembled and continue to expand is strong. It includes proprietary technologies like iASSIST as well as signature PSI, eLIBRA for soft tissue balancing. And we think that there is a wonderful value proposition for that set of technologies. But we're mindful in the way that we're developing these technologies to ensure that there is, in fact, a proven clinical benefit and it's delivered in a cost-efficient way and in the evolving health care market that we're looking to serve and the partnerships that we want to create that will be deeper than ever with these customers to ensure that they're bringing about an enhanced level of quality in the patient care that they deliver at the same time that they're managing costs in an optimized way. We think that that's the right recipe. So we think that there is a need and an opportunity to improve. We think that, for instance, on the large joint side to drive towards more reproducible use of these systems, the alignment placement, soft tissue balancing, all areas that we're very much focused on, we just think that it needs to take the form of clinical, proven cost-efficient solutions. And so that's what we've been focused on and what we'll continue to focus on. We're really agnostic as to the embodiment of that technology so long as it meets those needs. With respect to -- you referenced custom solutions. We have built out a wonderful portfolio of personalized solutions. Our interventions, we can help clinicians irrespective of where that patient is in the disease data along the continuum of care. And then, wherever that flat point is on the continuum of care for that particular patient, we want to offer the most personalized solution. So when you apply that to our portfolio, everything from early intervention, joint preservation solutions such as Gel-One and Subchondroplasty through partial knee replacements, for instance, with Oxford into a total knee solution, whether it's Vanguard or Persona The Personalized Knee System, that's a system that offers approximately 17,000 permutations. So we did extensive work to identify anatomical differences and design a system that would address any of those anatomical difference with clinical significance. And so that really is a mass customization strategy that's worked very well to leverage off of the heritage and clinical proof points of the legacy systems and ensure that we're bringing about improved patient outcomes without incurring the risk of going backwards. We referenced Biomet's custom solutions. It is the case that the Vanguard Select is a custom solution. So as I described to you, the mass customization approach that we took with Persona, there are going to be instances where a patient's anatomy is such an outlier or in oncology context, bone void context, deformities, you need a true custom solution. And I'm sure that our company has done more of that in the musculoskeletal space than anyone, including the solutions that Biomet has provided. And that isn't just in large joints. We do terrific work. I was just down a week ago in our craniomaxillofacial group, and they've done some quite literally life-saving solutions for patients on a true custom basis. So across all of our product lines, we have active efforts and existing solutions in that regard."

There's the impact of foreign currency through the translation, but then there's also the benefit of the cash flow hedges that flow through the gross margin line as well. On top of that, the synergy program, we do start to begin to see some level of benefit at the COGS line by virtue of the integration, and that's also contributing to kind of a flattish overall gross margin. And I think the other important point, foreign currency, the impact to the 2016 P&L remains significant as it was in 2015. And so the foreign currency headwind to earnings is in the neighborhood of $0.15 or $0.16 of headwind on EPS. The other important point is we are planning to reinvest the medical device tax, and so we account for that up in COGS. So there is a shift out of COGS into R&D in our 2016 guidance."

This morning, I'll review our fourth quarter and full year financial results as well as key highlights from our performance. Dan will then provide additional financial details and discuss our guidance for 2016. 
In June of 2015, we joined together 2 innovative companies and began executing our plans to expand our leadership position in musculoskeletal health. Our combination provides significant growth opportunities, with a highly complementary portfolio of product and service offerings as well as an enhanced ability to improve operating margins and drive free cash flows. The early success of our execution of these plans is reflected in our strong earnings performance. In the second half of 2015, we overdelivered against our initial net synergy targets, further validating our confidence in the effectiveness and accretive value of our combined organization. 
Notably, in 2015, we generated our fifth consecutive year of adjusted operating margin expansion. During the fourth quarter, we substantially completed the integration of our global commercial organizations. These actions have included the appointment of proven sales leaders and experienced sales representatives, in addition to product cross-training activities, to ensure appropriate emphasis on our market-leading large-joint reconstructive businesses as well as an enhanced focus on faster-growing non-large-joint categories. Based upon our significant progress, we're confident in our ability to drive sequential revenue improvement as we progress through 2016. 
Turning to market conditions. In the fourth quarter, global musculoskeletal markets demonstrated stability, with sequential strength in the United States offsetting a degree of softness in emerging markets and certain countries within the European, Middle East and Africa region. 
With respect to pricing, we experienced price pressure of negative 1.3% in the quarter. Our resulting price decline for the year of 1.9% was in line with our expectations. 
Moving on to our performance. Zimmer Biomet achieved stable global revenue growth in the fourth quarter, with sequential improvement in the United States alongside continued solid results in the Asia Pacific region. Consolidated net sales for the fourth quarter were $1.93 billion, an increase of 58.1% reported or an increase of 0.5% over the prior-year period, adjusting for billing-day differences. Importantly, our large joint reconstructive and S.E.T. categories in the United States delivered 240 basis points of sequential year-over-year improvement compared to our flat sales results in the third quarter. 
More broadly, revenues in the Americas region increased by 0.5% in the fourth quarter. In the Asia Pacific region, we delivered 4.0% sales growth, and our sales decreased by 1.5% in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region. Full year sales for 2015 on an adjusted pro forma basis were $6.0 billion, an increase of 1.1% over 2014. 
Zimmer Biomet's knee business grew sales by 2.2% in the fourth quarter, reflecting positive volume and mix of 4.1% and negative price of 1.9%. Our knee results were led by improved performance in the United States and an ongoing strong contribution from the Asia Pacific region, which delivered 8.2% growth over the prior-year period. 
Our Americas segment increased revenues by 1.4%; and our Europe, Middle East and Africa region grew knee sales by 0.6%. Our commercial teams achieved this result with the portfolio of solutions that meet the personalized needs of each patient while addressing surgeon and hospital preferences. Knee sales growth was driven mainly by Persona The Personalized Knee System, a leading cross-sell opportunity, but was also supported by the strong market demand for the Vanguard 360 Revision Knee System as well as the Bicruciate Preserving and clinically proven Oxford Partial Knee system. 
Sales from our hip business decreased by 0.6% in the fourth quarter, including positive volume and mix of 1.6% and negative price of 2.2%. Our Asia Pacific region revenues increased by 0.7%, and hip sales decreased by 0.8% in the Americas, as a positive performance in the United States was offset by Latin America results. Our Europe, Middle East and Africa sales decreased by 1.0% from the prior-year period. 
In future quarters, we will continue to pursue growth with our broad hip portfolio, including our G7 Acetabular System, Taperloc Complete Microplasty stems and the Arcos femoral revision system. 
Turning to our S.E.T. product category. Sales in the fourth quarter increased 1.6% over the prior-year period. We achieved solid results with our sports medicine, surgical and extremities portfolios, which were offset somewhat by our trauma sales performance. The ongoing growth of our sports medicine offerings is highlighted by our Gel-One Cross-linked Hyaluronate and Subchondroplasty treatments. 
In surgical, our sales were supported by the performance of our Transposal Fluid Waste Management System and A.T.S. Automatic Tourniquet System, which continue to expand our presence in the operating room suite. 
Within extremities, we're addressing a broad range of clinical situations and surgeon preferences, as evidenced by the commercial success of our comprehensive total shoulder system and the Nexel Total Elbow. 
In future quarters, we'll leverage our specialized sales force and robust trauma portfolio for improved results with innovative solutions such as the DDR CrossLock Distal Radius Plating System, the AFFIXUS Hip Fracture Nail System and the Natural Nail System. 
Worldwide Dental sales decreased by 6.7% in the fourth quarter. Our Dental category experienced revenue headwinds due to a supply disruption related to a voluntary field action in response to a packaging issue. We're in the process of remediating this matter, and we expect to do so fully by the close of the first quarter, which will help position us to reestablish our momentum in Dental in the second half of the year. We remain encouraged by the early success of our cross-selling activity, particularly with our market-leading regenerative product line, as we progress through the integration of this business. 
Zimmer Biomet's Spine, craniomaxillofacial and thoracic category revenues decreased by 2.0% from the prior-year period. Our craniomaxillofacial and thoracic team continued to deliver strong growth, driven by steady demand for our TraumaOne and SternaLock Blu Systems as well as growing acceptance of our RibFix Blu System. 
With regard to Spine, we successfully completed the integration of our U.S. Spine commercial channel, with anticipated near-term revenue dissynergies slowing our growth in the quarter. We believe this business is well positioned for accelerated performance in 2016 with a more comprehensive portfolio of innovative spinal solutions, including the Virage OCT Spinal Fixation System, the Polaris Spinal System and the Timberline Lateral Fusion System. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Dan, who will continue this discussion in greater detail as well as review our guidance. Dan?"

I will review our fourth quarter performance in more detail, and then provide additional information related to our first quarter and full year 2016 sales and earnings guidance. 
Our total revenues for the fourth quarter were $1,934,000,000, an increase of 0.5% constant currency compared to the fourth quarter of 2014 on an adjusted pro forma billing-day basis. Net currency impact for the quarter decreased revenues by 4.4% or $90 million. The negative currency impact for the quarter was related to the ongoing strength of the U.S. dollar against many international currencies. 
As David reviewed, we were encouraged to have substantially completed the integration of our commercial teams, which contributed to the sequential improvement of our reconstructive and S.E.T. performances in the United States, which increased over a flat year-on-year growth rate in the third quarter to 2.4% this quarter, in line with our expectations. However, we did have some unanticipated headwinds, including decelerating market conditions in certain emerging and Southern European countries as well as the Dental field action, which David referenced. These conditions led to our overall constant-currency sales growth coming in at the bottom of our guidance range. 
Our adjusted gross profit margin was 75.6% for the quarter, and 20 basis points less when compared to the prior-year adjusted pro forma results due to the impact of foreign exchange and price declines, mostly offset by gains from our cash flow hedging program. 
The company's R&D expense was 4.4% of revenue at $85.9 million, and 20 basis points higher when compared to the prior-year period. Adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses were $723.6 million in the fourth quarter or 37.4% of sales, an improvement of 170 basis points over the comparable period in the prior year. 
We continued to achieve process and operational efficiencies in the fourth quarter through the ongoing implementation of initiatives designed to capture synergies. In the quarter, the company recorded pretax charges of approximately $533 million in special items, primarily related to the Biomet acquisition and integration-related expenses. Adjusted fourth quarter 2015 figures in the earnings release exclude the impact of these charges, which include $380 million of noncash amortization and inventory step-up charges as well as $120 million of integration costs. A full reconciliation of reported net earnings to adjusted net earnings is included in this morning's press release. 
Adjusted operating profit in the quarter amounted to $652.4 million or 33.7% of sales, a 120 basis point improvement over the prior-year period. Net interest expense for the quarter amounted to $88 million, consistent with expectations. 
Adjusted net earnings were $428.3 million for the fourth quarter, an increase of 39.2% compared to the prior-year period. Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 17.4% to $2.09 on 205.2 million average outstanding diluted shares. These adjusted earnings per share are inclusive of approximately $0.03 of share-based compensation. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the year increased 7.8% to $6.90 on 189.8 million shares. 
Our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 23.8%. The company had approximately 202.6 million shares of common stock outstanding as of December 31, 2015, increasing from 169.7 million as of December 31, 2014, due primarily to the Biomet transaction. During the quarter, the company invested $150 million to repurchase 1.4 million shares. As of December 31, 2015, approximately $450 million remains available under the existing share repurchase authorization. 
Operating cash flow for the quarter amounted to $433.2 million, an increase of 22% over the fourth quarter of 2014. This result includes $114 million of cash expenditures for integration and initiatives related to our synergy program. 
Free cash flow in the fourth quarter was $303.7 million, which was 12% higher than the fourth quarter of 2014. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $129.5 million, which included $80.4 million for instruments and $49.1 million for property, plant and equipment. 
During the quarter, the company repaid $350 million on our term loan, bringing the repayment total in 2015 to $500 million. Our gross leverage ratio at December 31 was 4.0x. 
I'd like to now turn to our guidance. I will provide revenue and adjusted earnings per share guidance for both the first quarter and the full year. Additionally, I will review our expectations for free cash flow in 2016. 
Beginning with our market assumptions for 2016. We believe that the musculoskeletal markets in which we participate will grow approximately 3%. We expect global market conditions to remain stable in 2016 when compared to the full year 2015. 
Price is forecasted to be approximately negative 2%, consistent with the last several years. For 2016, we estimate our adjusted pro forma revenue growth to be in a range of 1.5% to 2.5% on a constant currency basis. 
Foreign exchange is expected to decrease revenues by 2.0%, primarily driven by the euro and Australian dollar, along with certain emerging market currencies. Taken together, revenue growth for the year should be in a range of negative 0.5% to positive 0.5% or a range of $7,415,000,000 to $7,490,000,000. 
As David outlined, with the integration of our commercial organization substantially complete, we expect constant currency year-over-year revenue growth to improve sequentially as we progress through 2016. 
In terms of quarterly revenue phasing, we expect first quarter constant currency growth of 0.5% to 1%, and I would guide you toward market growth rates as we progress through the second half of 2016. We will drive revenue acceleration across multiple product categories, with offerings such as Persona The Personalized Knee System, the Oxford Partial Knee, Gel-One Cross-linked Hyaluronate, Knee Creations Subchondroplasty, and the Arcos modular femoral hip revision system, additionally supported by a cadence of new product launches. We expect to realize increasing sales force productivity over the course of the year, driven by added stability and specialization in our global sales organizations and supported by the benefits of our medical education and training programs. 
As you move down the income statement for 2016, assuming currency rates remain near recent levels, we expect our gross margin ratio to be between 75.5% and 76%. This takes into account anticipated gains on foreign currency hedges, principally from the euro and Japanese yen. 
I would like to note that the company won't realize the full annual P&L benefit from the suspended medical device excise tax in 2016 because it was largely treated as an inventoriable cost. The portion that provides relief to the P&L during the year amounts to approximately $20 million, and we intend to reinvest this benefit in R&D to accelerate our innovation and growth opportunities. 
We expect R&D expense for the year to be in a range of 4.5% to 5.0% of sales. SG&A is expected to be approximately 37% of sales as we continue to realize efficiencies from our synergy initiatives and further leverage revenue growth. 
Assuming interest rates remain near recent levels, we expect net interest and other expense of $365 million. This incorporates our debt repayment plan throughout 2016. 
We anticipate an adjusted effective tax rate to be approximately 26%, which is in line with our final full year rate for 2015. We anticipate the diluted weighted average shares outstanding for the first quarter to total approximately 204 million shares, and in a range of 203 million to 204 million shares for the full year. This share count considers additional share repurchases planned during 2016. Therefore, full year adjusted diluted earnings per share is projected to be in a range of $7.80 to $7.95. 
Given our early success in capturing cost savings, we remain on pace to deliver our net operating EBIT synergy target of $350 million by the end of year 3, with approximately $225 million of cumulative net benefit achieved by year-end 2016. 
As I stated earlier, we expect revenues to increase between 0.5% and 1.0% on a constant currency adjusted pro forma basis when compared to the first quarter of 2015. At this time, assuming currency rates remain where they have been during the first month of this quarter, we anticipate foreign currency translation will decrease our reported first quarter revenues by an estimated 2.5%. Therefore, we expect first quarter revenues to be between 1.5% and 2.0% below the prior-year period, or a range of $1,870,000,000 to $1,880,000,000. We expect gross margin and operating expense ratios to be similar during the first quarter as those realized in the fourth quarter of 2015. 
Our adjusted effective tax rate is expected to be between 26.5% and 27%. Therefore, we expect first quarter adjusted earnings per share to be in a range between $1.90 and $1.95. 
Turning to cash flow. We anticipate full year 2016 operating cash flows to be in a range of $1.65 billion to $1.75 billion, inclusive of approximately $290 million of expenditures in support of our synergy program. This compares to full year 2015 of $863 million. This includes total capital expenditures for the year, which are expected to be in a range of $550 million to $575 million. 
Instrument capital is expected to be in a range of $300 million to $325 million in support of our cross-sell initiatives as well as new product introductions. Traditional PP&E is expected to be approximately $250 million, including $105 million necessary to rationalize facilities and ERP systems as well as to optimize our manufacturing and logistics network. Free cash flow is, therefore, expected to be in a range of $1,075,000,000 to $1,020,000,000 for the year. 
Our guidance assumes that we will continue to delever our balance sheet with planned debt repayments of approximately $1 billion, exiting the year with a leverage ratio of approximately 3.5x on a gross basis or just under 3.0x on a net basis. 
We intend to return excess cash to our stockholders through our share repurchase and dividend programs. Free cash flow in excess of this capital allocation program is assumed to be held in cash and cash equivalents or other investments. 
For modeling purposes, intangible amortization expense for the year is estimated to total approximately $600 million. And finally, please note that our guidance does not include any impact from other potential business development transactions or unforeseen events. 
David, I'll turn the call back over to you."

And then during the Q3 call, we raised that to $155 million and stayed with the $350 million by year 3. As we look at 2016, we see $225 million of cumulative net EBIT synergies in the P&L, and that -- and we have good line of sight to that. So that's what gives us strong conviction in the ability to deliver on net synergies, along with the ability to see sequential improvement on the top line and the flexibility we have with our capital allocation."

David, I think it is appropriate to characterize the fourth quarter performance as you did, and yet I would tell you that the progress that we made on the commercial channel integration was very, very significant, probably the most important element of the integration as a whole. As Dan said, we -- and you referenced, we have a high degree of confidence in our ability to deliver on the operating synergies. But with the progress that we made in the fourth quarter to appoint sales leaders across the globe, intermediary management level, and clarify the roles of reps in all product categories, their compensation plans, the bags that they're going to be carrying, the territories that they're going to be selling to, targets for them for 2016, all of that clarity and visibility, along with a really aggressive effort to get people trained up on products that 6 months ago they weren't at all familiar with because they didn't have in their bag, that sets us up to make the progress that we're referencing in 2016. So -- and we're already seeing the beginnings of the cross-sell coming to fruition. As well, we had some very successful kickoff meetings with further product training and education. And I would tell you that the attendance from a surgeon's perspective, our medical training and education programs show a big acceptance and interest in learning about the new products and technologies to ensure their safe and efficacious use. So all of that gives us visibility that we're going to push out sequential improvement each quarter of 2016. And it stands to reason relative to where we were a year ago that, that would be the case with the certainty that comes with the progress I just described to you. Furthermore, the revenue dissynergies will begin to anniversary out as we get into the latter part of the year, and so you can picture a line graph where the cross-sell is accelerating through the year and the revenue dissynergies as you get to the back part of the year begin to anniversary out. And as a consequence, we'd expect to hit market growth rates in the second half of the year, and then exit the year at or above market growth rates."

So I just wanted to drill down a little bit more on the prospects for revenue growth improvement. So a couple of quick things. First, it sounds like this is the case, but can you just confirm, David, that the level of sales force turnover that you're seeing is kind of as you expected? I just would love to get a specific update there. And then also in your 2016 revenue growth guidance, are you assuming that Southern Europe and emerging markets improve? Or are you assuming they kind of stay the same? And then, lastly, and probably most importantly, I was wondering if you could just kind of drill down a little more specifically on what are the product lines that you think are most likely to drive acceleration over the course of 2016? What are the things that you have the most confidence in?"

I think that the -- to take them in order, the sales force turnover is very consistent with our expectations. We had described to you that it was a fairly normal cadence of turnover in 2015, but what had transpired in the first half of the year",544,"Sure, Bob. I think that the -- to take them in order, the sales force turnover is very consistent with our expectations. We had described to you that it was a fairly normal cadence of turnover in 2015, but what had transpired in the first half of the year was a slowing of the hiring, particularly in the case of the independent distributorships. That began to correct out as the months progressed, and now we're entering 2016 with an expectation that, that will net one another out and will get into positive growth. And particular emphasis is going to be placed upon the non-large joint to bring more sales force specialization, because we have all the necessary ingredients from a product portfolio to compete very effectively in some of those faster-growing markets and a lot of room for growth and runway based upon our market share. So we're enthusiastic about that. So consider the sales force to be stable, and we would look 2016 to bring net gains in sales force representation. The presumption on the emerging markets and sort of the certain countries within Europe that we referenced in our comments is a steady state, probably more of what we would expect to see or what we experienced in the second half of 2015 continuing into 2016. And there's been a lot of discussion around Latin America, in particular. We've experienced that in full. In our case, our business in China is -- held up more strongly than what it sounds like other people are commenting on, and we continue to believe that will perform strongly. But even that business has slowed down. We're still in a growth mode in China. So those emerging markets have gone from historically strong mid- to upper teen growth quarter-to-quarter, sort of double-digit growth by the middle of last year into low single-digit growth, and we'd expect that picture to improve because we're going to be anniversary-ing out of some of those downward trends. So more than that, that dictates that. As far as the products go, it's a long list. But I'd rattle off the top of my head some of the ones that we're already seeing a lot of interest and uptick -- uptake on. Persona is doing really well, obviously taking that product into the legacy Biomet customer accounts. I would tell you that within the knee category, we're seeing a lot of interest in Oxford at this point in time, and that's an opportunity for us. In light of the divestiture, that's pretty special. We're doing very well with Gel-One. We're doing very well with Subchondroplasty. We've talked to you in the past about the hip products that are additive, mostly coming from the legacy Biomet side that had been performing quite well, and that's a business unit that we need to shore up. It includes revision on the side of the hips. The Comprehensive Shoulder is doing very well on the extremities side. And I would add in some of the complementary aspects of the product portfolio within trauma. Distal Radius Plating, which was a space that legacy Zimmer was not hardly present at all in, we're going to do very well with that product. That's a pretty good list for you."

I think that the teams are doing a nice job, in particular, of positioning these products. The broader portfolio creates opportunities to ensure that we're matching the customer needs to the best of our ability. And I think that this is going to be a sustained feature of the broader portfolio that comes with the combination. That said, 1 quarter does -- a trend does not make, and we just want to be smart about how we're guiding going forward. I think that, that 2% number is the right way to think about price down in 2016. And remember that although we're anniversary-ing out of, at the end of Q1, the biannual adjustment, which got spread out over 2 years in Japan, we'll reenter that world come April 1 with the next round.

I think about that market growth rate in round numbers at 3%, and the sequential improvement really isn't driven by anything in particular by way of anniversary-ing, I guess, out of a loss in a particular area as much as it is just running the offense that we have at this point in time. I mean, it's true that the math is advantageous to produce growth rates based upon the performance of the company in the second half of last year, and you're able to have full access to those numbers to understand that dynamic, but we're focused on taking what we believe to be the industry-leading product portfolio and executing. And remember that as we built this channel out across the globe, we picked the most successful leaders in the U.S. We've referenced this before. On average, those selected leaders were growing their businesses 300 basis points above those that were not selected to take the business forward. So we have a lot of experience at the rep level, proven leadership at the territory level. And with this product bag and running the offense that we expect to run, we're just going to be driving ourselves back into that market growth rate.

I think that the opportunity to drive enhanced quality in a cost-efficient way is an area of focus for us from an innovation standpoint. It's been an area of focus for us through both internal and external development over the better part of the last decade, and we're happy with our progress. The portfolio of preoperative and intraoperative technologies that we've assembled and continue to expand is strong. It includes proprietary technologies like iASSIST as well as Signature, PSI, eLIBRA for soft tissue balancing. And we think that there is a wonderful value proposition for that set of technologies. But we're mindful in the way that we're developing these technologies to ensure that there is, in fact, a proven clinical benefit and it's delivered in a cost-efficient way, and in the evolving health care market that we're looking to serve and the partnerships that we want to create that will be deeper than ever with these customers to ensure that they're bringing about an enhanced level of quality in the patient care that they deliver at the same time that they're managing costs in an optimized way. We think that that's the right recipe. So we think that there is a need and an opportunity to improve. We think that, for instance, on the large-joint side, to drive towards more reproducible use of these systems, the alignment placement, soft tissue balancing, all areas that we're very much focused on, we just think that it needs to take the form of clinical, proven cost-efficient solutions. And so that's what we've been focused on and what we'll continue to focus on. We're really agnostic as to the embodiment of that technology so long as it meets those needs. With respect to -- you referenced custom solutions. We have built out a wonderful portfolio of personalized solutions. Our interventions, we can help clinicians irrespective of where that patient is in the disease state, along the continuum of care. And then, wherever that plot point is on the continuum of care for that particular patient, we want to offer the most personalized solution. So when you apply that to our portfolio, everything from early-intervention joint-preservation solutions, such as Gel-One and Subchondroplasty, through partial knee replacements, for instance, with Oxford into a total knee solution, whether it's Vanguard or Persona The Personalized Knee System, that's a system that offers approximately 17,000 permutations. So we did extensive work to identify anatomical differences and design a system that would address any of those anatomical difference with clinical significance. And so that really is a mass customization strategy that's worked very well to leverage off of the heritage and clinical proof points of the legacy systems and ensure that we're bringing about improved patient outcomes without incurring the risk of going backwards. We referenced Biomet's custom solutions. It is the case that the Vanguard Select is a custom solution. So as I described to you, the mass customization approach that we took with Persona, there are going to be instances where a patient's anatomy is such an outlier or in oncology context, bone-void context, deformities, you need a true custom solution. And I'm sure that our company has done more of that in the musculoskeletal space than anyone, including the solutions that Biomet has provided. And that isn't just in large joints. We do terrific work. I was just down a week ago in our craniomaxillofacial group, and they've done some quite literally life-saving solutions for patients on a true custom basis. So across all of our product lines, we have active efforts and existing solutions in that regard."

On top of that, the synergy program, we do start to begin to see some level of benefit at the COGS line by virtue of the integration, and that's also contributing to kind of a flattish overall gross margin. And I think the other important point, foreign currency, the impact to the 2016 P&L remains significant, as it was in 2015. And so the foreign currency headwind to earnings is in the neighborhood of $0.15 or $0.16 of headwind on EPS.

We're pleased to report that Zimmer Biomet's revenue was on the high end of our first quarter expectations coming into the year, which further supports our confidence in achieving sequential improvement as we progress through 2016. Our comprehensive portfolio of musculoskeletal solutions and services provides a broad range of new opportunities for our sales channel, including a strengthened presence in a number of faster-growing product categories. 
Together with the increased stabilization and focused execution of our commercial teams, we remain on pace to exit the year at or above market growth rates. As we look to the future, Zimmer Biomet will continue to drive our established leadership with clinically proven devices and therapies, advanced surgical technologies and comprehensive consulting services. The strong combination of our broad portfolio, pipeline and unmatched musculoskeletal expertise allows us to play a leadership role in defining the future of health care through partnership opportunities with hospitals, surgeons and their patients. 
We'll bolster our portfolio throughout 2016 with strategic internal and external development opportunities. Our planned commercialization schedule includes over 50 new product launches this year, of which we've completed a dozen in the first quarter. 
These product launches included expansions to our market-leading knee and hip reconstructive systems, which I'll discuss in a moment. Our ongoing commercial introductions provide a firm foundation for sustainable revenue growth. 
Global musculoskeletal market conditions remain stable in the first quarter with continued strength in the United States and the Asia Pacific region. While there were ongoing challenges in certain emerging markets, these conditions were relatively consistent with recent quarters and in line with our expectations. 
With regard to pricing, we experienced price pressure of negative 0.9% in the quarter, consistent with our expectations. For the balance of the year, we continue to expect price pressure of approximately negative 2% when factoring in anticipated dynamics such as the biannual price adjustments in Japan. 
Against this backdrop, Zimmer Biomet delivered consolidated net sales of $1.9 billion for the first quarter, an increase of 67.8% reported and 1.2% adjusted over the prior year period. Our first quarter performance was highlighted by ongoing sequential sales growth for our U.S. reconstructive business, which posted a 180 basis point improvement. 
Our overall sales in the Americas increased by 1.8% and by 3.6% in the Asia Pacific region while our revenues decreased by 1.5% in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region. Importantly, Zimmer Biomet's knee business increased sales by 3.5% in the first quarter, reflecting positive volume and mix of 4.8% and negative price of 1.3%. 
We accelerated our U.S. knee performance, which contributed to a 3.3% year-over-year sales increase in the Americas. We also maintained strong revenues in the Asia Pacific region, where we delivered solid growth of 7.2%. Our knee sales increased by 1.9% in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region over the prior year period. 
In the quarter, our knee results were driven by our leading cross sells, Persona The Personalized Knee System, the Vanguard 360 Revision Knee System and the Oxford Partial Knee System. We were also excited to announce 2 commercial releases that expand the capabilities of our knee portfolio, our OsseoTi Tibial Sleeve augments, our cutting-edge porous metal technology that adds to the breadth of the trusted Vanguard 360 Revision Knee System. We also introduced the Persona Medial Congruent Bearing, an innovative expansion of the Persona Knee System, designed to re-create a more natural feeling knee by maximizing joint stability throughout the full range of motion. 
We'll continue to pursue growth with our knee portfolio, which combines market-leading reconstructive systems with advanced surgical planning tools and intelligent instrumentation to offer patients and surgeons an extensive range of personalized solutions. 
Sales from our hip business increased by 0.5% in the first quarter, including positive volume and mix of 2.2% and negative price of 1.7%. Our hip revenues grew by 2.9% in the Asia Pacific region, increased by 1.3% in the Americas and decreased by 2.2% in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region compared to the prior year period. 
In the quarter, we were pleased with the growth of our Taperloc complete system as well as our revision portfolio and solutions that leverage our VIVACIT-E and E1 vitamin E infused advanced bearing materials. We also expanded the G7 Acetabular System with the introduction of the G7 Dual Mobility Construct and strengthened our options for the rising adoption of the Anterior Supine Surgical approach with the introduction of the Echo Bi-Metric microplasty stem. These product additions, along with the balance of our comprehensive hip portfolio, continue to position this business for renewed growth. 
Turning to our S.E.T. category. Revenues increased 0.2% over the prior year period. Strong U.S. sales of our ATS, automated tourniquet system, contributed to the growth of our Surgical business in the Americas, and we were encouraged by the solid results of our Surgical power tools in certain overseas geographies. 
The steady growth of our Extremities business, most notably in the Americas and Asia Pacific region, also added to our S.E.T. revenues. Our S.E.T. results were negatively impacted in the quarter by our Trauma performance. We expect to deliver improved growth in the second half of the year with our Trauma business, supported by the increased stabilization and productivity of our commercial channel. 
Within sports medicine, we continue to be pleased with steady sales of our joint preservation treatments, gel-One hyaluronic and the subchondroplasty procedure, which was expanded in 2015 to address the growing foot and ankle market. 
And earlier this week, we announced that we've entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Arizona-based Cayenne Medical. This acquisition, which remains subject to customary closing conditions, will enhance our sports medicine capabilities and add a successful portfolio of soft tissue repair and reconstructive solutions for knee, shoulder and Extremities procedures. 
Our dental sales decreased by 6% in the first quarter, due primarily to headwinds associated with the voluntary product action in the fourth quarter. We expect supply to fully recover by the end of the second quarter. We also continued to make good progress with the ongoing harmonization of our dental commercial channel. Backed by our broad dental portfolio, we're focused on achieving improved results in the second half of the year for this business. 
First quarter sales from our Spine craniomaxillofacial and thoracic category decreased by 1% from the prior year period. Our craniomaxillofacial and thoracic team delivered noteworthy growth in the quarter as they continue to generate strong sales of our TraumaOne and SternaLock Blu systems. Additionally, they made great progress with the recently launched RibFix Blu System and the Omnimax MMF system. 
In Spine, our commercial teams continue to stabilize throughout the first quarter, which supports our confidence for an expected return to growth later this year. We also achieved sales growth for innovative offerings across our Spine portfolio, including the Timberline Lateral Fusion System and the Virage OCT Spinal Fixation System. Looking to the future of this business, we're excited for the opportunities represented by our commercial pipeline and focused sales channel. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Dan, who will continue this discussion in greater detail as well as review our increased revenue and adjusted earnings guidance. Dan?"
264048,331124642,965441,"Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2016",2016-04-28,"Earnings Calls","Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, David. I will review our first quarter performance in more detail and then provide additional information related to our second quarter and full year 2016 sales and earnings guidance. Our total revenues for the first quarter were $1,904,000,0",1114,"Thank you, David. I will review our first quarter performance in more detail and then provide additional information related to our second quarter and full year 2016 sales and earnings guidance. 
Our total revenues for the first quarter were $1,904,000,000, an increase of 1.2% constant currency compared to the first quarter of 2015 on an adjusted pro forma basis. The company recorded the same number of billing days in the quarter as compared to the first quarter of 2015. 
Net currency impact for the quarter decreased revenues by 1.6% or $30 million. The negative currency impact for the quarter was related to the ongoing relative strength of the U.S. dollar against many international currencies. 
Our adjusted gross profit margin was 75.7% for the quarter and 30 basis points lower when compared to the prior year adjusted pro forma results due to the impact of foreign exchange and price declines, mostly offset by gains from our cash flow hedging program and a reduction in the expense recognition of the medical device excise tax. 
The company's R&D expense was 4.5% of revenue at $85.7 million. As David noted, we commercially launched a dozen new products in the first quarter, and we expect to continue that pace throughout the balance of this year with introductions coming from across the entirety of our product categories. 
Adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses were $716.9 million in the first quarter or 37.7% of sales, 130 basis points lower than the comparable period in the prior year on an adjusted pro forma basis. The positive variance was driven by continued savings in SG&A expense categories stemming from synergy capture initiatives, which were partially offset by ongoing investment in our specialized sales force in addition to medical education and training programs. We remain on track to deliver cumulative net EBIT synergies of $225 million by the end of 2016 per our original full year guidance. 
Synergies realized in the first quarter were in line with our expectations. In the quarter, the company recorded pretax charges of $393.6 million in special items, primarily related to the Biomet acquisition as well as integration-related expenses. Adjusted first quarter 2016 figures in the earnings release exclude the impact of these charges, which includes $285 million of noncash amortization and inventory step-up charges as well as $109 million of integration and other costs. A full reconciliation of reported net earnings to adjusted net earnings is included in this morning's press release. 
Adjusted operating profit in the quarter amounted to $639.1 million or 33.6% of sales, which was flat when compared to the prior year period. Net interest expense and other nonoperating expense totaled $90.7 million. 
Adjusted net earnings were $404.3 million for the first quarter, an increase of 51.5% compared to the prior year period. Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 29.9% to $2 per share on 202 million weighted average fully diluted shares outstanding. 
Our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 26.3%. The company had approximately 200.7 million shares of common stock outstanding as of March 31, 2016, increasing from 172.8 million shares as of March 31, 2015, due primarily to the Biomet transaction. 
During the quarter, the company invested $415.5 million to repurchase 4.2 million shares. Our share repurchase activity during the quarter was expanded relative to our original guidance, and this provided approximately $0.02 of EPS benefit in the quarter. 
Operating cash flow for the quarter amounted to $265.2 million, which included $85 million of cash expenditures for integration and initiatives related to our synergy program. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $112.7 million, which included $85.1 million for instruments; and $27.6 million for property, plant and equipment. 
Free cash flow in the quarter was $152.5 million, which was essentially flat with the first quarter of 2015 and in line with our expectations. During the quarter, the company repaid $400 million on our term loan, leaving $2,100,000,000 outstanding at March 31, and this reflects $900 million of prepayment since the closing of the Biomet transaction. 
With that, I'd like to now turn to our guidance. I will provide updated revenue and adjusted earnings per share guidance for the full year and expectations for the second quarter. 
For 2016, we now estimate our adjusted pro forma revenue growth to be in a range of 2.0% to 3.0% on a constant currency basis. This update is reflective of our confidence in the ongoing progress of our cross-selling initiatives and increasing sales channel productivity. 
Foreign exchange is now expected to decrease revenue by 1% compared to our previous estimate of 2% with the U.S. dollar weakening modestly across most currency pairs. Taken together, reported revenue growth for the year should be in a range of 1.0% to 2.0% or a range of $7,525,000,000 to $7,600,000,000. 
For modeling purposes, we would have you update the fully diluted share count estimate to reflect the noted acceleration in timing of share repurchases embedded in our prior guidance. We now anticipate the diluted weighted average shares outstanding for the full year to be approximately 202 million shares. 
Therefore, after updating our assumptions for foreign exchange and our fully diluted share count, our full year adjusted diluted earnings per share is now projected to be in a range of $7.85 to $8. Our guidance takes into account our noted investment into our sales channel specialization, innovative research and development program and medical education and training to drive sustainable, longer-term growth. Our guidance reflects approximately 100 basis points of forecasted operating margin expansion over the prior year on an adjusted pro forma basis. 
Now turning to the second quarter. Including the benefit of slightly more than 1 extra billing day, which equates to about 180 basis points, we expect constant currency revenues to increase between 3.0% and 4.0%. 
At this time, assuming currency rates remain where they've been during the first month of this quarter, we anticipate foreign currency translation will decrease our reported second quarter revenues by approximately 1%. Taken together, reported revenue growth will be in a range of 2.0% to 3.0% for the quarter. Therefore, revenue would be expected to be in a range of $1,885,000,000 to $1,905,000,000. 
Lastly, we expect second quarter adjusted earnings per share to be in a range between $1.93 and $1.98. 
Finally, please note that our full year guidance reflects the anticipated contributions from our recently announced acquisition of Cayenne Medical, assuming that the transaction closes in the second quarter, which, in total, represents about 10 basis points of top line growth for the full year. However, our guidance does not include any impact from other potential business development transactions or unforeseen events. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to David."

Going back a decade now, we've been building out a comprehensive set of not only implant solutions but services and the comprehensive nature in anticipation of a world that would be more consistent with what CJR is contemplating, and that is how do we go about developing deeper partnerships with customers to bring higher quality of care in the most cost-efficient way possible. Our acquisition going back 9 years ago of Accelero and the services that they bring to the patient flow are focused exclusively on that area, and we've been able to bridge technologies and still more services to help develop those partnerships and build out a comprehensive care package that gets into patient engagement earlier in that episode of care, all the way through postacute care with rehabilitative services. And coming back to your question, that last area is probably where the light is going off in our customer conversation with realizations that as much as 40% of the cost of care is incurred postacute, so the rehabilitation end of joint replacement. I would tell you that the customers are in different places right now, and their level of developing plans that are truly going to be responsive to the economic model that they're going to be living with in going forward. So the early adopters and more progressive thinkers have been very sophisticated, and we are far along in developing deep partnerships and enhancing their capabilities to be prepared for that day. Others are coming to grips with the reality that over time, the world is going to shift away from fee-for-service. But in any event, we feel like we have a lot to offer with a full portfolio of solutions and services in that context, and it is the case, I do believe, that as I was just referencing that it's caused more energy on the customer part to be focused over to the postacute care dimension of delivering the total joint solution."

And so I would tell you that it is very broad based, quite literally, every geographic segment and every product category is anticipated to improve sequentially between now and the end of the year. And it's one of the reasons that we have such strong confidence in that progression is there isn't a single category that's driving it rather every category is expected to improve in each quarter between now and the balance of the year. And I think that we're seeing it earlier probably in large joints, and it stands to reason that, that would be the case with the size of the business of those portfolios and the historic culture be ultra focused on large joints and knees in particular. So I think knees is not ahead even within large joints and hips, but we're seeing the same signs of continued improvement in hips. And then I would tell you that S.E.T. category is expected to show some very material improvement beginning in the second quarter and continuing into the second half of the year. It's driven by the cross-sell primarily, but we're starting to in as we begun to emphasize some of the new product introductions, too.

We -- we've seen, particularly in the U.S., a step-up in large joints. I think that the EMEA market is healthier than what we're currently experiencing as we were just responding to the prior question on that front. But -- so the market is healthy in large joints, and we know that we have big opportunities in the other product categories as well. To focus on the large-joint categories, we have been improving our performance sequentially, even above the rate of the improvement in the market growth rates, and so over 100 basis points of gap closure in large joints as a whole, and that's been driven both by U.S. and OUS knee improvement. We see the U.S. knees improving about 70 basis points relative to market performance, OUS knees improving about 160 basis points relative to market. And U.S. hips as well going from Q4 to Q1 improved about 120 basis points. So those gap closures are really important measures as you referenced, but it's always nice to be participating in a robust market itself, and both those factors contribute to the visibility that we have to improve the performance and close the gap and as a consequence, raise our guidance for the full year the 2% to 3%."

And it's pretty clear, based upon our execution, that we've been able to, if anything, retrieve and realize the operating expense synergies in an accelerated fashion as evidenced by last year's performance in that regard. I think to your question, you end up with the best visibility one can have in planning those top line opportunities. And now we're in a stage where we're executing, and so we're making refinements. And part of what Dan has outlined, by the way, of reinvestment would include something like the products that are going and beyond in theory having a cross-sell opportunity, we're realizing success. We're up in production. We're ordering more instruments, and so that's a good example of the reality with any new product launch, and this is as we refer to it as sort of the mother of all product launches, you end up having some surprises, both negative and positive. And where we see the positive surprises, we're going to fuel that growth. So we've got a stable channel. We're, on a net basis, adding sales reps in an intelligent way relative to our opportunity to make sure that our coverage is going to exploit fully the broad bag that we have, and we're dialing it up in medical training education and instruments and inventory, where we see the growth opportunities because of early traction in the sales force.

No, we're comfortable with the consistency of the calculation and the visibility that's provided. We had a successful quarter in managing the business in this regard in Q4 and as you know, another successful quarter in Q1 of 2016. Some of it has to do with just our forward visibility to contracts and renewals and what's in the pipeline, and so we came into the year expecting minus 2. We continue to expect something closer to that in subsequent quarters, Q2, 3 and 4 of 2016, and contributing to that potential uptick relative to where we were in Q1 is going to be the biannual price adjustment in Japan, which comes online here in the beginning of the second quarter. So that's sort of been quantified. It's consistent with most of the past adjustments, say, in mid-single digits based upon our product mix. So you can look at that as being the potential for, round numbers, a 20 basis point uptake on a consolidated basis, but I think that we're managing the business intelligently. I mean, one of the benefits of the combination is the capability with this broad portfolio of the product position. And with the breadth of the portfolio and the capability to these products and better match the demands and needs of customers, it puts us in a better position to maintain pricing on premium technologies, for example, across the globe that is and what the increased transparency on pricing across the globe. That's a big asset. So it's a good news story. The teams are taking advantage of that opportunity. But again, it's 2 good quarters in that regard, and we don't want to call it a stronger trend at this point in time. It probably does cause us to moderate a bit the negative 2% price expectation coming into the year, but we think that we're going to edge up above the 0.9% that are we experienced in Q1 as we move into Q2 and beyond."

We'll look for targets that leverage our sales channel to drive sustainable growth and maximize shoulder value, and we'll also stay focused to ensure sustainable and solid returns within a reasonable time horizon. So I wouldn't think of any shift in that regard. We're still very focused on driving improvements in our free cash flow yield out over time. That will continue to be a focus, and that gives us a lot of flexibility as we progress looking at debt pay down, M&A activity, dividend payment and so on and so forth. So we will stay very disciplined as we always have been."

Dan will then provide additional financial details and discuss our updated guidance. We'll state all sales rates in constant currency terms, and all earnings results on an adjusted basis. 
We're pleased to report that Zimmer Biomet's revenue was on the high end of our first quarter expectations coming into the year, which further supports our confidence in achieving sequential improvement as we progress through 2016. Our comprehensive portfolio of musculoskeletal solutions and services provides a broad range of new opportunities for our sales channel, including a strengthened presence in a number of faster-growing product categories. 
Together with the increased stabilization and focused execution of our commercial teams, we remain on pace to exit the year at or above market growth rates. As we look to the future, Zimmer Biomet will continue to drive our established leadership with clinically proven devices and therapies, advanced surgical technologies and comprehensive consultative services. The strong combination of our broad portfolio, pipeline and unmatched musculoskeletal expertise allows us to play a leadership role in defining the future of health care through partnership opportunities with hospitals, surgeons and their patients. 
We'll bolster our portfolio throughout 2016 with strategic internal and external development opportunities. Our planned commercialization schedule includes over 50 new product launches this year, of which we've completed a dozen in the first quarter. 
These product launches included expansions to our market-leading knee and hip reconstructive systems, which I'll discuss in a moment. Our ongoing commercial introductions provide a firm foundation for sustainable revenue growth. 
Global musculoskeletal market conditions remain stable in the first quarter with continued strength in the United States and the Asia Pacific region. While there were ongoing challenges in certain emerging markets, these conditions were relatively consistent with recent quarters and in line with our expectations. 
With regard to pricing, we experienced price pressure of negative 0.9% in the quarter, consistent with our expectations. For the balance of the year, we continue to expect price pressure of approximately negative 2% when factoring in anticipated dynamics such as the biannual price adjustments in Japan. 
Against this backdrop, Zimmer Biomet delivered consolidated net sales of $1.9 billion for the first quarter, an increase of 67.8% reported and 1.2% adjusted over the prior year period. Our first quarter performance was highlighted by ongoing sequential sales growth for our U.S. reconstructive business, which posted a 180 basis point improvement. 
Our overall sales in the Americas increased by 1.8% and by 3.6% in the Asia Pacific region, while our revenues decreased by 1.5% in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region. Importantly, Zimmer Biomet's knee business increased sales by 3.5% in the first quarter, reflecting positive volume and mix of 4.8% and negative price of 1.3%. 
We accelerated our U.S. knee performance, which contributed to a 3.3% year-over-year sales increase in the Americas. We also maintained strong revenues in the Asia Pacific region, where we delivered solid growth of 7.2%. Our knee sales increased by 1.9% in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region over the prior year period. 
In the quarter, our knee results were driven by our leading cross-sells, Persona The Personalized Knee System, the Vanguard 360 Revision Knee System and the Oxford Partial Knee System. We were also excited to announce 2 commercial releases that expand the capabilities of our knee portfolio, our OsseoTi Tibial Sleeve augments, our cutting-edge porous metal technology that adds to the breadth of the trusted Vanguard 360 Revision Knee System. We also introduced the Persona Medial Congruent Bearing, an innovative expansion of the Persona Knee System designed to recreate a more natural-feeling knee by maximizing joint stability throughout the full range of motion. 
We'll continue to pursue growth with our knee portfolio, which combines market-leading reconstructive systems with advanced surgical planning tools and intelligent instrumentation to offer patients and surgeons an extensive range of personalized solutions. 
Sales from our hip business increased by 0.5% in the first quarter, including positive volume and mix of 2.2% and negative price of 1.7%. Our hip revenues grew by 2.9% in the Asia Pacific region, increased by 1.3% in the Americas and decreased by 2.2% in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region compared to the prior year period. 
In the quarter, we were pleased with the growth of our Taperloc complete system as well as our revision portfolio and solutions that leverage our VIVACIT-E and E1 Vitamin E infused advanced bearing materials. We also expanded the G7 Acetabular System with the introduction of the G7 Dual Mobility Construct and strengthened our options for the rising adoption of the anterior supine surgical approach with the introduction of the Echo Bi-Metric Microplasty stem. These product additions, along with the balance of our comprehensive hip portfolio, continue to position this business for renewed growth. 
Turning to our S.E.T. category. Revenues increased 0.2% over the prior year period. Strong U.S. sales of our A.T.S., automated tourniquet system, contributed to the growth of our surgical business in the Americas, and we were encouraged by the solid results of our surgical power tools in certain overseas geographies. 
The steady growth of our extremities business, most notably in the Americas and Asia Pacific region, also added to our S.E.T. revenues. Our S.E.T. results were negatively impacted in the quarter by our trauma performance. We expect to deliver improved growth in the second half of the year with our trauma business, supported by the increased stabilization and productivity of our commercial channel. 
Within sports medicine, we continue to be pleased with steady sales of our joint preservation treatments, Gel-One hyaluronic and the Subchondroplasty Procedure, which was expanded in 2015 to address the growing foot and ankle market. 
And earlier this week, we announced that we've entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Arizona-based Cayenne Medical. This acquisition, which remains subject to customary closing conditions, will enhance our sports medicine capabilities and add a successful portfolio of soft tissue repair and reconstructive solutions for knee, shoulder and extremities procedures. 
Our dental sales decreased by 6% in the first quarter, due primarily to headwinds associated with the voluntary product action in the fourth quarter. We expect supply to fully recover by the end of the second quarter. We also continued to make good progress with the ongoing harmonization of our dental commercial channel. Backed by our broad dental portfolio, we're focused on achieving improved results in the second half of the year for this business. 
First quarter sales from our spine, craniomaxillofacial and thoracic category decreased by 1% from the prior year period. Our craniomaxillofacial and thoracic team delivered noteworthy growth in the quarter as they continue to generate strong sales of our TraumaOne and SternaLock Blu systems. Additionally, they made great progress with the recently launched RibFix Blu System and the Omnimax MMF System. 
In spine, our commercial teams continue to stabilize throughout the first quarter, which supports our confidence for an expected return to growth later this year. We also achieved sales growth for innovative offerings across our spine portfolio, including the Timberline Lateral Fusion System and the Virage OCT Spinal Fixation System. Looking to the future of this business, we're excited for the opportunities represented by our commercial pipeline and focused sales channel. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Dan, who will continue this discussion in greater detail as well as review our increased revenue and adjusted earnings guidance. Dan?"

I will review our first quarter performance in more detail and then provide additional information related to our second quarter and full year 2016 sales and earnings guidance. Our total revenues for the first quarter were $1,904,000,0",1115,"Thank you, David. I will review our first quarter performance in more detail and then provide additional information related to our second quarter and full year 2016 sales and earnings guidance. 
Our total revenues for the first quarter were $1,904,000,000, an increase of 1.2% constant currency compared to the first quarter of 2015 on an adjusted pro forma basis. The company recorded the same number of billing days in the quarter as compared to the first quarter of 2015. 
Net currency impact for the quarter decreased revenues by 1.6% or $30 million. The negative currency impact for the quarter was related to the ongoing relative strength of the U.S. dollar against many international currencies. 
Our adjusted gross profit margin was 75.7% for the quarter and 30 basis points lower when compared to the prior year adjusted pro forma results due to the impact of foreign exchange and price declines, mostly offset by gains from our cash flow hedging program and a reduction in the expense recognition of the medical device excise tax. 
The company's R&D expense was 4.5% of revenue at $85.7 million. As David noted, we commercially launched a dozen new products in the first quarter, and we expect to continue that pace throughout the balance of this year with introductions coming from across the entirety of our product categories. 
Adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses were $716.9 million in the first quarter or 37.7% of sales, 130 basis points lower than the comparable period in the prior year on an adjusted pro forma basis. The positive variance was driven by continued savings in SG&A expense categories stemming from synergy capture initiatives, which were partially offset by ongoing investments in our specialized sales force in addition to medical education and training programs. We remain on track to deliver cumulative net EBIT synergies of $225 million by the end of 2016 per our original full year guidance. 
Synergies realized in the first quarter were in line with our expectations. In the quarter, the company recorded pretax charges of $393.6 million in special items primarily related to the Biomet acquisition as well as integration-related expenses. Adjusted first quarter 2016 figures in the earnings release exclude the impact of these charges, which includes $285 million of noncash amortization and inventory step-up charges as well as $109 million of integration and other costs. A full reconciliation of reported net earnings to adjusted net earnings is included in this morning's press release. 
Adjusted operating profit in the quarter amounted to $639.1 million or 33.6% of sales, which was flat when compared to the prior year period. Net interest expense and other nonoperating expense totaled $90.7 million. 
Adjusted net earnings were $404.3 million for the first quarter, an increase of 51.5% compared to the prior year period. Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 29.9% to $2 per share on 202 million weighted average fully diluted shares outstanding. 
Our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 26.3%. The company had approximately 200.7 million shares of common stock outstanding as of March 31, 2016, increasing from 172.8 million shares as of March 31, 2015, due primarily to the Biomet transaction. 
During the quarter, the company invested $415.5 million to repurchase 4.2 million shares. Our share repurchase activity during the quarter was expanded relative to our original guidance, and this provided approximately $0.02 of EPS benefit in the quarter. 
Operating cash flow for the quarter amounted to $265.2 million, which included $85 million of cash expenditures for integration and initiatives related to our synergy program. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $112.7 million, which included $85.1 million for instruments; and $27.6 million for property, plant and equipment. 
Free cash flow in the quarter was $152.5 million, which was essentially flat with the first quarter of 2015 and in line with our expectations. During the quarter, the company repaid $400 million on our term loan, leaving $2,100,000,000 outstanding at March 31, and this reflects $900 million of prepayment since the closing of the Biomet transaction. 
With that, I'd like to now turn to our guidance. I will provide updated revenue and adjusted earnings per share guidance for the full year and expectations for the second quarter. 
For 2016, we now estimate our adjusted pro forma revenue growth to be in a range of 2.0% to 3.0% on a constant currency basis. This update is reflective of our confidence in the ongoing progress of our cross-selling initiatives and increasing sales channel productivity. 
Foreign exchange is now expected to decrease revenue by 1% compared to our previous estimate of 2% with the U.S. dollar weakening modestly across most currency pairs. Taken together, reported revenue growth for the year should be in a range of 1.0% to 2.0% or a range of $7,525,000,000 to $7,600,000,000. 
For modeling purposes, we would have you update the fully diluted share count estimate to reflect the noted acceleration and timing of share repurchases embedded in our prior guidance. We now anticipate the diluted weighted average shares outstanding for the full year to be approximately 202 million shares. 
Therefore, after updating our assumptions for foreign exchange and our fully diluted share count, our full year adjusted diluted earnings per share is now projected to be in a range of $7.85 to $8. Our guidance takes into account our noted investments into our sales channel specialization, innovative research and development program and medical education and training to drive sustainable, longer-term growth. Our guidance reflects approximately 100 basis points of forecasted operating margin expansion over the prior year on an adjusted pro forma basis. 
Now turning to the second quarter. Including the benefit of slightly more than 1 extra billing day, which equates to about 180 basis points, we expect constant currency revenues to increase between 3.0% and 4.0%. 
At this time, assuming currency rates remain where they have been during the first month of this quarter, we anticipate foreign currency translation will decrease our reported second quarter revenues by approximately 1%. Taken together, reported revenue growth will be in a range of 2.0% to 3.0% for the quarter. Therefore, revenue would be expected to be in a range of $1,885,000,000 to $1,905,000,000. 
Lastly, we expect second quarter adjusted earnings per share to be in a range between $1.93 and $1.98. 
Finally, please note that our full year guidance reflects the anticipated contributions from our recently announced acquisition of Cayenne Medical, assuming that the transaction closes in the second quarter, which, in total, represents about 10 basis points of top line growth for the full year. However, our guidance does not include any impact from other potential business development transactions or unforeseen events. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to David."

Going back a decade now, we've been building out a comprehensive set of not only implant solutions but services and a comprehensive nature in anticipation of a world that would be more consistent with what CJR is contemplating, that is how do we go about developing deeper partnerships with customers to bring higher quality of care in the most cost-efficient way possible. Our acquisition going back 9 years ago of Accelero and the services that they bring to the patient flow are focused exclusively on that area, and we've been able to bridge technologies and still more services to help develop those partnerships and build out a comprehensive care package that gets into patient engagement earlier in that episode of care, all the way through post-acute care with rehabilitative services. And coming back to your question, that last area is probably where the light is going off in our customer conversation with realizations that as much as 40% of the cost of care is incurred post-acute, so the rehabilitation end of joint replacement. I would tell you that the customers are in different places right now in their level of developing plans that are truly going to be responsive to the economic model that they're going to be living with in going forward. So the early adopters and more progressive thinkers have been very sophisticated, and we're far along in developing deep partnerships and enhancing their capabilities to be prepared for that day. Others are coming to grips with the reality that over time, the world is going to shift away from fee-for-service. But in any event, we feel like we have a lot to offer with a full portfolio of solutions and services in that context, and it is the case, I do believe, that, as I was just referencing, that it's caused more energy on the customer part to be focused over to the post-acute care dimension of delivering the total joint solution."

So there's an enhancement by virtue of billing days in the second quarter. But notwithstanding that, we show continued progression in our forecast as we displayed from Q4 to Q1, and we just believe that everything that we're doing to stabilize the sales force to invest in the non-large joint categories, in particular with expansion of that sales force across training, the medical training education events, all of that is building towards progress in each of the product categories. And so I would tell you that it is very broad based. Quite literally, every geographic segment and every product category is anticipated to improve sequentially between now and the end of the year. And it's one of the reasons that we have such strong confidence in that progression is there isn't a single category that's driving it. Rather, every category is expected to improve in each quarter between now and the balance of the year. And I think that we're seeing it earlier probably in large joints, and it stands to reason that, that would be the case with the size of the business of those portfolios and the historic culture be ultra focused on large joints and knees in particular. So I think knees is not ahead, even within large joints and hips, but we're seeing the same signs of continued improvement in hips. And then I would tell you that the S.E.T. category is expected to show some very material improvement beginning of the second quarter and continuing into the second half of the year. It's driven by the cross-sell primarily, but we're starting to lace in as we begun to emphasize some of the new product introductions, too. And as we get into the second half of the year, we'll see some of the early signs of traction with those product launches that went out from the first quarter."

And then, as we look at the balance of the year with respect to the currency tailwinds, we do see opportunities to continue to make investments in our areas of focus such as specialized sales forces, medical education and training globally but also, importantly, in the emerging markets to sustain that growth. Our R&D programs, investing in personalized solutions and consultative services that add value across the continuum of care that David spoke about, enhanced instrument deployments to further drive cross-sell and things of that nature.

But -- so the market is healthy in large joints, and we know that we have big opportunities in the other product categories as well. To focus on the large joint categories, we have been improving our performance sequentially, even above the rate of the improvement in the market growth rates. And so over 100 basis points of gap closure in large joints as a whole, and that's been driven both by U.S. and OUS knee improvement. We see the U.S. knees improving about 70 basis points relative to market performance, OUS knees improving about 160 basis points relative to market. And U.S. hips as well, going from Q4 to Q1, improved about 120 basis points. So those gap closures are really important measures as you referenced, but it's always nice to be participating in a robust market itself, and both those factors contribute to the visibility that we have to improve the performance and close the gap and as a consequence, raise our guidance for the full year the 2% to 3%."

I think to your question, you end up with the best visibility one can have in planning those top line opportunities. And now we're in a stage where we're executing, and so we're making refinements. And part of what Dan has outlined, by the way, of reinvestment would include something like the products that are going, and beyond, in theory, having a cross-sell opportunity, we're realizing success. We're up in production. We're ordering more instruments, and so that's a good example of the reality with any new product launch, and this is, as we refer to it, is sort of the mother of all product launches. You end up having some surprises, both negative and positive. And where we see the positive surprises, we're going to fuel that growth. So we've got a stable channel. We're, on a net basis, adding sales reps in an intelligent way relative to our opportunity to make sure that our coverage is going to exploit fully the broad bag that we have, and then we're dialing it up in medical training education and instruments and inventory, where we see the growth opportunities because of early traction in the sales force.

No, we're comfortable with the consistency of the calculation and the visibility that's provided. We had a successful quarter in managing the business in this regard in Q4, and as you know, another successful quarter in Q1 of 2016. Some of it has to do with just our forward visibility to contracts and renewals and what's in the pipeline, and so we came into the year expecting minus 2. We continue to expect something closer to that in subsequent quarters, Q2, 3 and 4 of 2016, and contributing to that potential uptick relative to where we were in Q1 is going to be the biannual price adjustment in Japan, which comes online here at the beginning of the second quarter. So that's sort of been quantified. It's consistent with most of the past adjustments, say, in mid-single digits based upon our product mix. So you can look at that as being the potential for, round numbers, a 20 basis point uptick on a consolidated basis. But I think that we're managing the business intelligently. I mean, one of the benefits of the combination is the capability with this broad portfolio to product position. And with the breadth of the portfolio and the capability to tear these products and better match the demands and needs of customers, it puts us in a better position to maintain pricing on premium technologies, for example, across the globe that is and what the increased transparency on pricing across the globe. That's a big asset. So it's a good news story. The teams are taking advantage of that opportunity. But again, it's 2 good quarters in that regard, and we don't want to call it a stronger trend at this point in time. It probably does cause us to moderate a bit the negative 2% price expectation coming into the year, but we think that we're going to edge up above the 0.9% that we experienced in Q1 as we move into Q2 and beyond."

And if there's true value-creation opportunity, we believe that there is true value-creation opportunity through those deeper partnerships, there's going to be plenty of opportunity to share in that upside and broader relationship up and down, again, that continuum of care and that episode of care, and you can envision from the point of diagnosis and joint preservation through sports medicine, partial, total, revision, salvage and the large joint, biological solutions but interventions that makes sense both clinically and economically, we are convinced that there's value to be gathered for both parties and all the other stakeholders and most importantly, patients. And if we get that right, we're going to be able to figure the rest of it out. So that's the mindset that we have in entering into those relationships. A lot of flexibility and agility to get after making a difference for patients, and that's going to redound all the other stakeholders' benefits, and we're sure that we'll participate that in an appropriate way."

Dan will then provide additional financial details and discuss our updated guidance. We'll state all sales rates in constant currency terms, and all earnings results on an adjusted basis. 
We're pleased to report that Zimmer Biomet's revenue was on the high end of our first quarter expectations coming into the year, which further supports our confidence in achieving sequential improvement as we progress through 2016. Our comprehensive portfolio of musculoskeletal solutions and services provides a broad range of new opportunities for our sales channel, including a strengthened presence in a number of faster-growing product categories. 
Together with the increased stabilization and focused execution of our commercial teams, we remain on pace to exit the year at or above market growth rates. As we look to the future, Zimmer Biomet will continue to drive our established leadership with clinically proven devices and therapies, advanced surgical technologies and comprehensive consultative services. The strong combination of our broad portfolio, pipeline and unmatched musculoskeletal expertise allows us to play a leadership role in defining the future of health care through partnership opportunities with hospitals, surgeons and their patients. 
We'll bolster our portfolio throughout 2016 with strategic internal and external development opportunities. Our planned commercialization schedule includes over 50 new product launches this year, of which we've completed a dozen in the first quarter. 
These product launches included expansions to our market-leading knee and hip reconstructive systems, which I'll discuss in a moment. Our ongoing commercial introductions provide a firm foundation for sustainable revenue growth. 
Global musculoskeletal market conditions remain stable in the first quarter with continued strength in the United States and the Asia-Pacific region. While there were ongoing challenges in certain emerging markets, these conditions were relatively consistent with recent quarters and in line with our expectations. 
With regard to pricing, we experienced price pressure of negative 0.9% in the quarter, consistent with our expectations. For the balance of the year, we continue to expect price pressure of approximately negative 2% when factoring in anticipated dynamics such as the biennial price adjustments in Japan. 
Against this backdrop, Zimmer Biomet delivered consolidated net sales of $1.9 billion for the first quarter, an increase of 67.8% reported and 1.2% adjusted over the prior year period. Our first quarter performance was highlighted by ongoing sequential sales growth for our U.S. reconstructive business, which posted a 180 basis point improvement. 
Our overall sales in the Americas increased by 1.8% and by 3.6% in the Asia-Pacific region, while our revenues decreased by 1.5% in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region. Importantly, Zimmer Biomet's knee business increased sales by 3.5% in the first quarter, reflecting positive volume and mix of 4.8% and negative price of 1.3%. 
We accelerated our U.S. knee performance, which contributed to a 3.3% year-over-year sales increase in the Americas. We also maintained strong revenues in the Asia-Pacific region, where we delivered solid growth of 7.2%. Our knee sales increased by 1.9% in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region over the prior year period. 
In the quarter, our knee results were driven by our leading cross-sells, Persona The Personalized Knee System, the Vanguard 360 Revision Knee System and the Oxford Partial Knee System. We were also excited to announce 2 commercial releases that expand the capabilities of our knee portfolio, our OsseoTi Tibial Sleeve augments, our cutting-edge porous metal technology that adds to the breadth of the trusted Vanguard 360 Revision Knee System. We also introduced the Persona Medial Congruent Bearing, an innovative expansion of the Persona Knee System designed to recreate a more natural-feeling knee by maximizing joint stability throughout the full range of motion. 
We'll continue to pursue growth with our knee portfolio, which combines market-leading reconstructive systems with advanced surgical planning tools and intelligent instrumentation to offer patients and surgeons an extensive range of personalized solutions. 
Sales from our hip business increased by 0.5% in the first quarter, including positive volume and mix of 2.2% and negative price of 1.7%. Our hip revenues grew by 2.9% in the Asia-Pacific region, increased by 1.3% in the Americas and decreased by 2.2% in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region compared to the prior year period. 
In the quarter, we were pleased with the growth of our Taperloc complete system as well as our revision portfolio and solutions that leverage our VIVACIT-E and E1 Vitamin E infused advanced bearing materials. We also expanded the G7 Acetabular System with the introduction of the G7 Dual Mobility Construct and strengthened our options for the rising adoption of the anterior supine surgical approach with the introduction of the Echo Bi-Metric Microplasty stem. These product additions, along with the balance of our comprehensive hip portfolio, continue to position this business for renewed growth. 
Turning to our S.E.T. category. Revenues increased 0.2% over the prior year period. Strong U.S. sales of our A.T.S., Automated Tourniquet System, contributed to the growth of our surgical business in the Americas, and we were encouraged by the solid results of our surgical power tools in certain overseas geographies. 
The steady growth of our extremities business, most notably in the Americas and Asia-Pacific region, also added to our S.E.T. revenues. Our S.E.T. results were negatively impacted in the quarter by our trauma performance. We expect to deliver improved growth in the second half of the year with our trauma business, supported by the increased stabilization and productivity of our commercial channel. 
Within sports medicine, we continue to be pleased with steady sales of our joint preservation treatments, Gel-One hyaluronic and the Subchondroplasty Procedure, which was expanded in 2015 to address the growing foot and ankle market. 
And earlier this week, we announced that we've entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Arizona-based Cayenne Medical. This acquisition, which remains subject to customary closing conditions, will enhance our sports medicine capabilities and add a successful portfolio of soft tissue repair and reconstructive solutions for knee, shoulder and extremities procedures. 
Our dental sales decreased by 6% in the first quarter, due primarily to headwinds associated with the voluntary product action in the fourth quarter. We expect supply to fully recover by the end of the second quarter. We also continued to make good progress with the ongoing harmonization of our dental commercial channel. Backed by our broad dental portfolio, we're focused on achieving improved results in the second half of the year for this business. 
First quarter sales from our spine, craniomaxillofacial and thoracic category decreased by 1% from the prior year period. Our craniomaxillofacial and thoracic team delivered noteworthy growth in the quarter as they continue to generate strong sales of our TraumaOne and SternaLock Blu systems. Additionally, they made great progress with the recently launched RibFix Blu System and the Omnimax MMF System. 
In spine, our commercial teams continue to stabilize throughout the first quarter, which supports our confidence for an expected return to growth later this year. We also achieved sales growth for innovative offerings across our spine portfolio, including the Timberline Lateral Fusion System and the Virage OCT Spinal Fixation System. Looking to the future of this business, we're excited for the opportunities represented by our commercial pipeline and focused sales channel. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Dan, who will continue this discussion in greater detail as well as review our increased revenue and adjusted earnings guidance. Dan?"

I will review our first quarter performance in more detail and then provide additional information related to our second quarter and full year 2016 sales and earnings guidance. Our total revenues for the first quarter were $1,904,000,0",1115,"Thank you, David. I will review our first quarter performance in more detail and then provide additional information related to our second quarter and full year 2016 sales and earnings guidance. 
Our total revenues for the first quarter were $1,904,000,000, an increase of 1.2% constant currency compared to the first quarter of 2015 on an adjusted pro forma basis. The company recorded the same number of billing days in the quarter as compared to the first quarter of 2015. 
Net currency impact for the quarter decreased revenues by 1.6% or $30 million. The negative currency impact for the quarter was related to the ongoing relative strength of the U.S. dollar against many international currencies. 
Our adjusted gross profit margin was 75.7% for the quarter and 30 basis points lower when compared to the prior year adjusted pro forma results due to the impact of foreign exchange and price declines, mostly offset by gains from our cash flow hedging program and a reduction in the expense recognition of the medical device excise tax. 
The company's R&D expense was 4.5% of revenue at $85.7 million. As David noted, we commercially launched a dozen new products in the first quarter, and we expect to continue that pace throughout the balance of this year with introductions coming from across the entirety of our product categories. 
Adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses were $716.9 million in the first quarter or 37.7% of sales, 130 basis points lower than the comparable period in the prior year on an adjusted pro forma basis. The positive variance was driven by continued savings in SG&A expense categories stemming from synergy capture initiatives, which were partially offset by ongoing investments in our specialized sales force in addition to medical education and training programs. We remain on track to deliver cumulative net EBIT synergies of $225 million by the end of 2016 per our original full year guidance. 
Synergies realized in the first quarter were in line with our expectations. In the quarter, the company recorded pretax charges of $393.6 million in special items primarily related to the Biomet acquisition as well as integration-related expenses. Adjusted first quarter 2016 figures in the earnings release exclude the impact of these charges, which includes $285 million of noncash amortization and inventory step-up charges as well as $109 million of integration and other costs. A full reconciliation of reported net earnings to adjusted net earnings is included in this morning's press release. 
Adjusted operating profit in the quarter amounted to $639.1 million or 33.6% of sales, which was flat when compared to the prior year period. Net interest expense and other nonoperating expense totaled $90.7 million. 
Adjusted net earnings were $404.3 million for the first quarter, an increase of 51.5% compared to the prior year period. Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 29.9% to $2 per share on 202 million weighted average fully diluted shares outstanding. 
Our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 26.3%. The company had approximately 200.7 million shares of common stock outstanding as of March 31, 2016, increasing from 172.8 million shares as of March 31, 2015, due primarily to the Biomet transaction. 
During the quarter, the company invested $415.5 million to repurchase 4.2 million shares. Our share repurchase activity during the quarter was expanded relative to our original guidance, and this provided approximately $0.02 of EPS benefit in the quarter. 
Operating cash flow for the quarter amounted to $265.2 million, which included $85 million of cash expenditures for integration and initiatives related to our synergy program. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $112.7 million, which included $85.1 million for instruments; and $27.6 million for property, plant and equipment. 
Free cash flow in the quarter was $152.5 million, which was essentially flat with the first quarter of 2015 and in line with our expectations. During the quarter, the company repaid $400 million on our term loan, leaving $2,100,000,000 outstanding at March 31, and this reflects $900 million of prepayment since the closing of the Biomet transaction. 
With that, I'd like to now turn to our guidance. I will provide updated revenue and adjusted earnings per share guidance for the full year and expectations for the second quarter. 
For 2016, we now estimate our adjusted pro forma revenue growth to be in a range of 2.0% to 3.0% on a constant currency basis. This update is reflective of our confidence in the ongoing progress of our cross-selling initiatives and increasing sales channel productivity. 
Foreign exchange is now expected to decrease revenue by 1% compared to our previous estimate of 2% with the U.S. dollar weakening modestly across most currency pairs. Taken together, reported revenue growth for the year should be in a range of 1.0% to 2.0% or a range of $7,525,000,000 to $7,600,000,000. 
For modeling purposes, we would have you update the fully diluted share count estimate to reflect the noted acceleration and timing of share repurchases embedded in our prior guidance. We now anticipate the diluted weighted average shares outstanding for the full year to be approximately 202 million shares. 
Therefore, after updating our assumptions for foreign exchange and our fully diluted share count, our full year adjusted diluted earnings per share is now projected to be in a range of $7.85 to $8. Our guidance takes into account our noted investments into our sales channel specialization, innovative research and development program and medical education and training to drive sustainable, longer-term growth. Our guidance reflects approximately 100 basis points of forecasted operating margin expansion over the prior year on an adjusted pro forma basis. 
Now turning to the second quarter. Including the benefit of slightly more than 1 extra billing day, which equates to about 180 basis points, we expect constant currency revenues to increase between 3.0% and 4.0%. 
At this time, assuming currency rates remain where they have been during the first month of this quarter, we anticipate foreign currency translation will decrease our reported second quarter revenues by approximately 1%. Taken together, reported revenue growth will be in a range of 2.0% to 3.0% for the quarter. Therefore, revenue would be expected to be in a range of $1,885,000,000 to $1,905,000,000. 
Lastly, we expect second quarter adjusted earnings per share to be in a range between $1.93 and $1.98. 
Finally, please note that our full year guidance reflects the anticipated contributions from our recently announced acquisition of Cayenne Medical, assuming that the transaction closes in the second quarter, which, in total, represents about 10 basis points of top line growth for the full year. However, our guidance does not include any impact from other potential business development transactions or unforeseen events. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to David."

Going back a decade now, we've been building out a comprehensive set of not only implant solutions but services and a comprehensive nature in anticipation of a world that would be more consistent with what CJR is contemplating, that is how do we go about developing deeper partnerships with customers to bring higher quality of care in the most cost-efficient way possible. Our acquisition going back 9 years ago of Accelero and the services that they bring to the patient flow are focused exclusively on that area, and we've been able to bridge technologies and still more services to help develop those partnerships and build out a comprehensive care package that gets into patient engagement earlier in that episode of care, all the way through post-acute care with rehabilitative services. And coming back to your question, that last area is probably where the light is going off in our customer conversation with realizations that as much as 40% of the cost of care is incurred post-acute, so the rehabilitation end of joint replacement. I would tell you that the customers are in different places right now in their level of developing plans that are truly going to be responsive to the economic model that they're going to be living with in going forward. So the early adopters and more progressive thinkers have been very sophisticated, and we're far along in developing deep partnerships and enhancing their capabilities to be prepared for that day. Others are coming to grips with the reality that over time, their world is going to shift away from fee-for-service. But in any event, we feel like we have a lot to offer with a full portfolio of solutions and services in that context, and it is the case, I do believe, that, as I was just referencing, that it's caused more energy on the customer part to be focused over to the post-acute care dimension of delivering the total joint solution."

So there's an enhancement by virtue of billing days in the second quarter. But notwithstanding that, we show continued progression in our forecast as we displayed from Q4 to Q1, and we just believe that everything that we're doing to stabilize the sales force to invest in the non-large joint categories, in particular with expansion of that sales force, the cross-training, the medical training education events, all of that is building towards progress in each of the product categories. And so I would tell you that it is very broad based. Quite literally, every geographic segment and every product category is anticipated to improve sequentially between now and the end of the year. And it's one of the reasons that we have such strong confidence and that progression is -- there isn't a single category that's driving it. Rather, every category is expected to improve in each quarter between now and the balance of the year. And I think that we're seeing it earlier probably in large joints, and it stands to reason that, that would be the case with the size of the business of those portfolios and the historic culture being ultra-focused on large joints and knees in particular. So I think knees is out ahead, even within large joints and hips, but we're seeing the same signs of continued improvement in hips. And then I would tell you that the S.E.T. category is expected to show some very material improvement beginning of the second quarter and continuing into the second half of the year. It's driven by the cross-sell primarily, but we're starting to lace in as we begun to emphasize some of the new product introductions, too. And as we get into the second half of the year, we'll see some of the early signs of traction with those product launches that went out from the first quarter."

We're pushing through those, consistent with our plans, and I think that what you saw in Q1, Bob, was a consistent performance, if not on large joints, a bit of sequential improvement from Q4 to Q1.

But -- so the market is healthy in large joints, and we know that we have big opportunities in the other product categories as well. To focus on the large joint categories, we have been improving our performance sequentially, even above the rate of the improvement in the market growth rates. And so over 100 basis points of gap closure in large joints as a whole, and that's been driven both by U.S. and OUS knee improvement. We see the U.S. knees improving about 70 basis points relative to market performance, OUS knees improving about 160 basis points relative to market. And U.S. hips as well, going from Q4 to Q1, improved about 120 basis points. So those gap closures are really important measures as you referenced, but it's always nice to be participating in a robust market itself, and both those factors contribute to the visibility that we have to improve the performance and close the gap and as a consequence, raise our guidance for the full year the 2% to 3%."

And part of what Dan has outlined, by the way, of reinvestment would include something like the products that are going, and beyond, in theory, having a cross-sell opportunity, we're realizing success. We're upping production. We're ordering more instruments, and so that's a good example of the reality with any new product launch, and this is, as we refer to it, is sort of the mother of all product launches. You end up having some surprises, both negative and positive. And where we see the positive surprises, we're going to fuel that growth. So we've got a stable channel. We're, on a net basis, adding sales reps in an intelligent way relative to our opportunity to make sure that our coverage is going to exploit fully the broad bag that we have, and then we're dialing it up in medical training education and instruments and inventory, where we see the growth opportunities because of early traction in the sales force.

No, we're comfortable with the consistency of the calculation and the visibility that's provided. We had a successful quarter in managing the business in this regard in Q4, and as you know, another successful quarter in Q1 of 2016. Some of it has to do with just our forward visibility to contracts and renewals and what's in the pipeline, and so we came into the year expecting minus 2. We continue to expect something closer to that in subsequent quarters, Q2, 3 and 4 of 2016, and contributing to that potential uptick relative to where we were in Q1 is going to be the biennial price adjustment in Japan, which comes online here at the beginning of the second quarter. So that's sort of been quantified. It's consistent with most of the past adjustments, say, in mid-single digits based upon our product mix. So you can look at that as being the potential for, round numbers, a 20 basis point uptick on a consolidated basis. But I think that we're managing the business intelligently. I mean, one of the benefits of the combination is the capability with this broad portfolio to product position. And with the breadth of the portfolio and the capability to tier these products and better match the demands and needs of customers, it puts us in a better position to maintain pricing on premium technologies, for example, across the globe that is and what the increased transparency on pricing across the globe. That's a big asset. So it's a good news story. The teams are taking advantage of that opportunity. But again, it's 2 good quarters in that regard, and we don't want to call it a stronger trend at this point in time. It probably does cause us to moderate a bit the negative 2% price expectation coming into the year, but we think that we're going to edge up above the 0.9% that we experienced in Q1 as we move into Q2 and beyond."

But it also strikes me that you've talked about -- I think some of your other larger orthopedic competitors have talked about stepping into the void for some of these networks to help them understand and deal with managing those downstream costs, which are often out of the hospital or with third-party partners. And so I'd love to understand how that -- how you see that playing out in terms of sort of the value you're providing and the benefit that you would hope to get from that sort of expanded relationship and networks as you sort of team up to get your arms around or get their arms around this change."

I will tell you every one of those conversations is validating to the work that we've done. As I said over the last decade, I think that you can envision a day where it's very much the case that the end-to-end patient engagement is something that we're more deeply involved with. And as a consequence of the data and insights that we glean in partnership with customers that are progressive thinkers in this regard, that we're mining that data, creating the right treatment algorithms and the right clinical and economic support that announces where the unmet needs are and the opportunities for continuous improvement on both clinical and economic bases, and that's our vision. And there are a lot of customers across the globe that share that vision, and I think that again, there are limited numbers of companies that can sit at the table with the offerings that we have to bring value to that conversation and be able to follow through and deliver.

We're pleased to report that Zimmer Biomet's revenue was on the high end of our first quarter expectations coming into the year, which further supports our confidence in achieving sequential improvement as we progress through 2016. Our comprehensive portfolio of musculoskeletal solutions and services provides a broad range of new opportunities for our sales channel, including a strengthened presence in a number of faster-growing product categories. 
Together with the increased stabilization and focused execution of our commercial teams, we remain on pace to exit the year at or above market growth rates. As we look to the future, Zimmer Biomet will continue to drive our established leadership with clinically proven devices and therapies, advanced surgical technologies and comprehensive consultative services. The strong combination of our broad portfolio, pipeline and unmatched musculoskeletal expertise allows us to play a leadership role in defining the future of health care through partnership opportunities with hospitals, surgeons and their patients. 
We'll bolster our portfolio throughout 2016 with strategic internal and external development opportunities. Our planned commercialization schedule includes over 50 new product launches this year, of which we've completed a dozen in the first quarter. 
These product launches included expansions to our market-leading knee and hip reconstructive systems, which I'll discuss in a moment. Our ongoing commercial introductions provide a firm foundation for sustainable revenue growth. 
Global musculoskeletal market conditions remain stable in the first quarter with continued strength in the United States and the Asia Pacific region. While there were ongoing challenges in certain emerging markets, these conditions were relatively consistent with recent quarters and in line with our expectations. 
With regard to pricing, we experienced price pressure of negative 0.9% in the quarter, consistent with our expectations. For the balance of the year, we continue to expect price pressure of approximately negative 2% when factoring in anticipated dynamics such as the biennial price adjustments in Japan. 
Against this backdrop, Zimmer Biomet delivered consolidated net sales of $1.9 billion for the first quarter, an increase of 67.8% reported and 1.2% adjusted over the prior year period. Our first quarter performance was highlighted by ongoing sequential sales growth for our U.S. reconstructive business, which posted a 180 basis point improvement. 
Our overall sales in the Americas increased by 1.8% and by 3.6% in the Asia Pacific region, while our revenues decreased by 1.5% in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region. Importantly, Zimmer Biomet's knee business increased sales by 3.5% in the first quarter, reflecting positive volume and mix of 4.8% and negative price of 1.3%. 
We accelerated our U.S. knee performance, which contributed to a 3.3% year-over-year sales increase in the Americas. We also maintained strong revenues in the Asia Pacific region, where we delivered solid growth of 7.2%. Our knee sales increased by 1.9% in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region over the prior year period. 
In the quarter, our knee results were driven by our leading cross-sells, Persona The Personalized Knee System, the Vanguard 360 Revision Knee System and the Oxford Partial Knee System. We were also excited to announce 2 commercial releases that expand the capabilities of our knee portfolio, our OsseoTi Tibial Sleeve augments, our cutting-edge porous metal technology that adds to the breadth of the trusted Vanguard 360 Revision Knee System. We also introduced the Persona Medial Congruent Bearing, an innovative expansion of the Persona Knee System designed to recreate a more natural-feeling knee by maximizing joint stability throughout the full range of motion. 
We'll continue to pursue growth with our knee portfolio, which combines market-leading reconstructive systems with advanced surgical planning tools and intelligent instrumentation to offer patients and surgeons an extensive range of personalized solutions. 
Sales from our hip business increased by 0.5% in the first quarter, including positive volume and mix of 2.2% and negative price of 1.7%. Our hip revenues grew by 2.9% in the Asia Pacific region, increased by 1.3% in the Americas and decreased by 2.2% in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region compared to the prior year period. 
In the quarter, we were pleased with the growth of our Taperloc complete system as well as our revision portfolio and solutions that leverage our VIVACIT-E and E1 Vitamin E infused advanced bearing materials. We also expanded the G7 Acetabular System with the introduction of the G7 Dual Mobility Construct and strengthened our options for the rising adoption of the anterior supine surgical approach with the introduction of the Echo Bi-Metric Microplasty stem. These product additions, along with the balance of our comprehensive hip portfolio, continue to position this business for renewed growth. 
Turning to our S.E.T. category. Revenues increased 0.2% over the prior year period. Strong U.S. sales of our A.T.S., Automated Tourniquet System, contributed to the growth of our surgical business in the Americas, and we were encouraged by the solid results of our surgical power tools in certain overseas geographies. 
The steady growth of our extremities business, most notably in the Americas and Asia Pacific region, also added to our S.E.T. revenues. Our S.E.T. results were negatively impacted in the quarter by our trauma performance. We expect to deliver improved growth in the second half of the year with our trauma business, supported by the increased stabilization and productivity of our commercial channel. 
Within sports medicine, we continue to be pleased with steady sales of our joint preservation treatments, Gel-One hyaluronic and the Subchondroplasty Procedure, which was expanded in 2015 to address the growing foot and ankle market. 
And earlier this week, we announced that we've entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Arizona-based Cayenne Medical. This acquisition, which remains subject to customary closing conditions, will enhance our sports medicine capabilities and add a successful portfolio of soft tissue repair and reconstructive solutions for knee, shoulder and extremities procedures. 
Our dental sales decreased by 6% in the first quarter, due primarily to headwinds associated with the voluntary product action in the fourth quarter. We expect supply to fully recover by the end of the second quarter. We also continued to make good progress with the ongoing harmonization of our dental commercial channel. Backed by our broad dental portfolio, we're focused on achieving improved results in the second half of the year for this business. 
First quarter sales from our spine, craniomaxillofacial and thoracic category decreased by 1% from the prior year period. Our craniomaxillofacial and thoracic team delivered noteworthy growth in the quarter as they continue to generate strong sales of our TraumaOne and SternaLock Blu systems. Additionally, they made great progress with the recently launched RibFix Blu System and the Omnimax MMF System. 
In spine, our commercial teams continue to stabilize throughout the first quarter, which supports our confidence for an expected return to growth later this year. We also achieved sales growth for innovative offerings across our spine portfolio, including the Timberline Lateral Fusion System and the Virage OCT Spinal Fixation System. Looking to the future of this business, we're excited for the opportunities represented by our commercial pipeline and focused sales channel. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Dan, who will continue this discussion in greater detail as well as review our increased revenue and adjusted earnings guidance. Dan?"

I will review our first quarter performance in more detail and then provide additional information related to our second quarter and full year 2016 sales and earnings guidance. Our total revenues for the first quarter were $1,904,000,0",1115,"Thank you, David. I will review our first quarter performance in more detail and then provide additional information related to our second quarter and full year 2016 sales and earnings guidance. 
Our total revenues for the first quarter were $1,904,000,000, an increase of 1.2% constant currency compared to the first quarter of 2015 on an adjusted pro forma basis. The company recorded the same number of billing days in the quarter as compared to the first quarter of 2015. 
Net currency impact for the quarter decreased revenues by 1.6% or $30 million. The negative currency impact for the quarter was related to the ongoing relative strength of the U.S. dollar against many international currencies. 
Our adjusted gross profit margin was 75.7% for the quarter and 30 basis points lower when compared to the prior year adjusted pro forma results due to the impact of foreign exchange and price declines, mostly offset by gains from our cash flow hedging program and a reduction in the expense recognition of the medical device excise tax. 
The company's R&D expense was 4.5% of revenue at $85.7 million. As David noted, we commercially launched a dozen new products in the first quarter, and we expect to continue that pace throughout the balance of this year with introductions coming from across the entirety of our product categories. 
Adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses were $716.9 million in the first quarter or 37.7% of sales, 130 basis points lower than the comparable period in the prior year on an adjusted pro forma basis. The positive variance was driven by continued savings in SG&A expense categories stemming from synergy capture initiatives, which were partially offset by ongoing investments in our specialized sales force in addition to medical education and training programs. We remain on track to deliver cumulative net EBIT synergies of $225 million by the end of 2016 per our original full year guidance. 
Synergies realized in the first quarter were in line with our expectations. In the quarter, the company recorded pretax charges of $393.6 million in special items primarily related to the Biomet acquisition as well as integration-related expenses. Adjusted first quarter 2016 figures in the earnings release exclude the impact of these charges, which includes $285 million of noncash amortization and inventory step-up charges as well as $109 million of integration and other costs. A full reconciliation of reported net earnings to adjusted net earnings is included in this morning's press release. 
Adjusted operating profit in the quarter amounted to $639.1 million or 33.6% of sales, which was flat when compared to the prior year period. Net interest expense and other nonoperating expense totaled $90.7 million. 
Adjusted net earnings were $404.3 million for the first quarter, an increase of 51.5% compared to the prior year period. Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 29.9% to $2 per share on 202 million weighted average fully diluted shares outstanding. 
Our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 26.3%. The company had approximately 200.7 million shares of common stock outstanding as of March 31, 2016, increasing from 172.8 million shares as of March 31, 2015, due primarily to the Biomet transaction. 
During the quarter, the company invested $415.5 million to repurchase 4.2 million shares. Our share repurchase activity during the quarter was expanded relative to our original guidance, and this provided approximately $0.02 of EPS benefit in the quarter. 
Operating cash flow for the quarter amounted to $265.2 million, which included $85 million of cash expenditures for integration and initiatives related to our synergy program. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $112.7 million, which included $85.1 million for instruments; and $27.6 million for property, plant and equipment. 
Free cash flow in the quarter was $152.5 million, which was essentially flat with the first quarter of 2015 and in line with our expectations. During the quarter, the company repaid $400 million on our term loan, leaving $2,100,000,000 outstanding at March 31, and this reflects $900 million of prepayment since the closing of the Biomet transaction. 
With that, I'd like to now turn to our guidance. I will provide updated revenue and adjusted earnings per share guidance for the full year and expectations for the second quarter. 
For 2016, we now estimate our adjusted pro forma revenue growth to be in a range of 2.0% to 3.0% on a constant currency basis. This update is reflective of our confidence in the ongoing progress of our cross-selling initiatives and increasing sales channel productivity. 
Foreign exchange is now expected to decrease revenue by 1% compared to our previous estimate of 2% with the U.S. dollar weakening modestly across most currency pairs. Taken together, reported revenue growth for the year should be in a range of 1.0% to 2.0% or a range of $7,525,000,000 to $7,600,000,000. 
For modeling purposes, we would have you update the fully diluted share count estimate to reflect the noted acceleration and timing of share repurchases embedded in our prior guidance. We now anticipate the diluted weighted average shares outstanding for the full year to be approximately 202 million shares. 
Therefore, after updating our assumptions for foreign exchange and our fully diluted share count, our full year adjusted diluted earnings per share is now projected to be in a range of $7.85 to $8. Our guidance takes into account our noted investments into our sales channel specialization, innovative research and development program and medical education and training to drive sustainable, longer-term growth. Our guidance reflects approximately 100 basis points of forecasted operating margin expansion over the prior year on an adjusted pro forma basis. 
Now turning to the second quarter. Including the benefit of slightly more than 1 extra billing day, which equates to about 180 basis points, we expect constant currency revenues to increase between 3.0% and 4.0%. 
At this time, assuming currency rates remain where they have been during the first month of this quarter, we anticipate foreign currency translation will decrease our reported second quarter revenues by approximately 1%. Taken together, reported revenue growth will be in a range of 2.0% to 3.0% for the quarter. Therefore, revenue would be expected to be in a range of $1,885,000,000 to $1,905,000,000. 
Lastly, we expect second quarter adjusted earnings per share to be in a range between $1.93 and $1.98. 
Finally, please note that our full year guidance reflects the anticipated contributions from our recently announced acquisition of Cayenne Medical, assuming that the transaction closes in the second quarter, which, in total, represents about 10 basis points of top line growth for the full year. However, our guidance does not include any impact from other potential business development transactions or unforeseen events. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to David."

Going back a decade now, we've been building out a comprehensive set of not only implant solutions but services and a comprehensive nature in anticipation of a world that would be more consistent with what CJR is contemplating, that is how do we go about developing deeper partnerships with customers to bring higher quality of care in the most cost-efficient way possible. Our acquisition going back 9 years ago of Accelero and the services that they bring to the patient flow are focused exclusively on that area, and we've been able to bridge technologies and still more services to help develop those partnerships and build out a comprehensive care package that gets into patient engagement earlier in that episode of care, all the way through post-acute care with rehabilitative services. And coming back to your question, that last area is probably where the light is going off in our customer conversation with realizations that as much as 40% of the cost of care is incurred post-acute, so the rehabilitation end of joint replacement. I would tell you that the customers are in different places right now in their level of developing plans that are truly going to be responsive to the economic model that they're going to be living with in going forward. So the early adopters and more progressive thinkers have been very sophisticated, and we're far along in developing deep partnerships and enhancing their capabilities to be prepared for that day. Others are coming to grips with the reality that over time, their world is going to shift away from fee-for-service. But in any event, we feel like we have a lot to offer with a full portfolio of solutions and services in that context, and it is the case, I do believe, that, as I was just referencing, that it's caused more energy on the customer part to be focused over to the post-acute care dimension of delivering the total joint solution."

So there's an enhancement by virtue of billing days in the second quarter. But notwithstanding that, we show continued progression in our forecast as we displayed from Q4 to Q1, and we just believe that everything that we're doing to stabilize the sales force to invest in the non-large joint categories, in particular with expansion of that sales force, the cross-training, the medical training education events, all of that is building towards progress in each of the product categories. And so I would tell you that it is very broad based. Quite literally, every geographic segment and every product category is anticipated to improve sequentially between now and the end of the year. And it's one of the reasons that we have such strong confidence and that progression is -- there isn't a single category that's driving it. Rather, every category is expected to improve in each quarter between now and the balance of the year. And I think that we're seeing it earlier probably in large joints, and it stands to reason that, that would be the case with the size of the business of those portfolios and the historic culture being ultra-focused on large joints and knees in particular. So I think knees is out ahead, even within large joints and hips, but we're seeing the same signs of continued improvement in hips. And then I would tell you that the S.E.T. category is expected to show some very material improvement beginning of the second quarter and continuing into the second half of the year. It's driven by the cross-sell primarily, but we're starting to lace in as we begun to emphasize some of the new product introductions, too. And as we get into the second half of the year, we'll see some of the early signs of traction with those product launches that went out from the first quarter."

But -- so the market is healthy in large joints, and we know that we have big opportunities in the other product categories as well. To focus on the large joint categories, we have been improving our performance sequentially, even above the rate of the improvement in the market growth rates. And so over 100 basis points of gap closure in large joints as a whole, and that's been driven both by U.S. and OUS knee improvement. We see the U.S. knees improving about 70 basis points relative to market performance, OUS knees improving about 160 basis points relative to market. And U.S. hips as well, going from Q4 to Q1, improved about 120 basis points. So those gap closures are really important measures as you referenced, but it's always nice to be participating in a robust market itself, and both those factors contribute to the visibility that we have to improve the performance and close the gap and as a consequence, raise our guidance for the full year the 2% to 3%."

I think that we had an opportunity, because of the pendency period that was prolonged for 14 months between signing and closing, to do to extensive planning.

I think to your question, you end up with the best visibility one can have in planning those top line opportunities. And now we're in a stage where we're executing, and so we're making refinements. And part of what Dan has outlined, by the way, of reinvestment would include something like the products that are going, and beyond, in theory, having a cross-sell opportunity, we're realizing success. We're upping production. We're ordering more instruments, and so that's a good example of the reality with any new product launch, and this is, as we refer to it, is sort of the mother of all product launches. You end up having some surprises, both negative and positive. And where we see the positive surprises, we're going to fuel that growth. So we've got a stable channel. We're, on a net basis, adding sales reps in an intelligent way relative to our opportunity to make sure that our coverage is going to exploit fully the broad bag that we have, and then we're dialing it up in medical training education and instruments and inventory, where we see the growth opportunities because of early traction in the sales force. And that visibility is extraordinarily helpful and gives us line of sight as to sequentially between now and the end of the year what we think we can do."

No, we're comfortable with the consistency of the calculation and the visibility that's provided. We had a successful quarter in managing the business in this regard in Q4, and as you know, another successful quarter in Q1 of 2016. Some of it has to do with just our forward visibility to contracts and renewals and what's in the pipeline, and so we came into the year expecting minus 2. We continue to expect something closer to that in subsequent quarters, Q2, 3 and 4 of 2016, and contributing to that potential uptick relative to where we were in Q1 is going to be the biennial price adjustment in Japan, which comes online here at the beginning of the second quarter. So that's sort of been quantified. It's consistent with most of the past adjustments, say, in mid-single digits based upon our product mix. So you can look at that as being the potential for, round numbers, a 20 basis point uptick on a consolidated basis. But I think that we're managing the business intelligently. I mean, one of the benefits of the combination is the capability with this broad portfolio to product position. And with the breadth of the portfolio and the capability to tier these products and better match the demands and needs of customers, it puts us in a better position to maintain pricing on premium technologies, for example, across the globe that is and what the increased transparency on pricing across the globe. That's a big asset. So it's a good news story. The teams are taking advantage of that opportunity. But again, it's 2 good quarters in that regard, and we don't want to call it a stronger trend at this point in time. It probably does cause us to moderate a bit the negative 2% price expectation coming into the year, but we think that we're going to edge up above the 0.9% that we experienced in Q1 as we move into Q2 and beyond."

But it also strikes me that you've talked about -- I think some of your other larger orthopedic competitors have talked about stepping into the void for some of these networks to help them understand and deal with managing those downstream costs, which are often out of the hospital or with third-party partners. And so I'd love to understand how that -- how you see that playing out in terms of sort of the value you're providing and the benefit that you would hope to get from that sort of expanded relationship and networks as you sort of team up to get your arms around or get their arms around this change."

I will tell you every one of those conversations is validating to the work that we've done. As I said over the last decade, I think that you can envision a day where it's very much the case that the end-to-end patient engagement is something that we're more deeply involved with. And as a consequence of the data and insights that we glean in partnership with customers that are progressive thinkers in this regard, that we're mining that data, creating the right treatment algorithms and the right clinical and economic support that announces where the unmet needs are and the opportunities for continuous improvement on both clinical and economic bases, and that's our vision. And there are a lot of customers across the globe that share that vision, and I think that again, there are limited numbers of companies that can sit at the table with the offerings that we have to bring value to that conversation and be able to follow through and deliver.

This morning,, I'll review our second quarter financial results and key highlights from our performance as well as the ongoing development and expansion of our musculoskeletal portfolio. Dan will then provide additional financial details and discuss our updated guidance. 
Before I launch into these topics, however, I'd like to take a moment to reflect on the 1 year anniversary of the formation of Zimmer Biomet. Throughout this past year, we've continued to be guided by our long-standing value-creation framework, which focuses on investing for sustainable growth, driving operational efficiencies and redeploying capital in a disciplined manner. We've successfully integrated and leveraged the combined expertise and cultures of the 2 organizations while executing on a highly complementary portfolio of technologies, services and solutions. 
Our financial results have provided the tangible proof points that Zimmer Biomet reflects our initial vision of an ideal fit. Our company has reached an important inflection point, having successfully reestablished top line momentum by beginning to capture the promise of the attractive cross-selling opportunities inherent in our merger, in addition to successfully delivering on our synergy commitments. 
We are now poised to move forward with our plans, which include the acceleration of our commercial and innovation strategic priorities. These priorities are designed to further enhance and sustain our growth well into the future. 
Consistent with this progress, Zimmer Biomet generated solid revenue acceleration in the second quarter, again above the top end of our expectations, further validating our strategies to achieve above-market revenue growth by the close of 2016. Our steady advance towards this goal demonstrates the increasing productivity and focused execution of our commercial organization. And for the balance of the year, we'll continue to exploit the opportunities presented by our differentiated musculoskeletal portfolio. 
Turning briefly to market conditions. In the second quarter, the demand across the globe for musculoskeletal solutions continue to grow at a steady pace, in line with our expectations and consistent with recent quarters. 
With regard to pricing, we experienced negative price pressure of 1.2% in the quarter, consistent with broader trends throughout 2016. Against this backdrop, Zimmer Biomet delivered second quarter consolidated net sales of $1.93 billion, which represented an increase of 65.6% on a reported basis and 4.5% adjusted compared to the prior year quarter. 
We increased sales in each of our segments, with Americas, up 3.6%; Europe, Middle East and Africa region growing 4.5%; and the Asia Pacific region delivering 8.2% growth. 
Within our consolidated results, Zimmer Biomet's knee category grew sales 5.0% in the second quarter, reflecting positive volume and mix of 6.5% and negative price of 1.5%. Our U.S. knee business continue to deliver solid results, which contributed to a sales increase of 3.0% in the Americas. We also achieved strong revenues in markets across the Asia Pacific and Europe, Middle East and Africa regions, where we increased sales over the prior year period by 9.6% and 7.1%, respectively. 
As anticipated, the cross-selling opportunities of our market-leading knee portfolio continue to drive growth, led by the ongoing sales performance of premium reconstructive systems such as our flagship Persona The Personalized Knee System and the Vanguard 360 Revision Knee System. 
In addition, during the quarter, we marked the 40th anniversary of the launch of the Oxford Partial Knee, the most widely used and clinically proven partial knee replacement in the world, which has been used in more than 600,000 surgeries across 50 countries and featured in more than 280 published studies. 
And as part of our commitment to continuous product innovation, during the second quarter, we released a series of next-generation enhancements to our OSS Orthopedic Salvage System, advancing this unique solution for salvage revision procedures and oncologic applications. As we look to the second half of the year, we'll further leverage the commercial opportunities of our knee portfolio for the ongoing growth of this important category. 
Turning to our market-leading hip business. We accelerated consolidated sales growth to 3.2% in the second quarter, including positive volume and mix of 5.4% and negative price of 2.2%. Hip revenues grew 8.1% in the Asia Pacific region; 3.6% in Europe, Middle East and Africa; and 1.5% in the Americas compared to the prior year quarter. 
The second quarter progress of our hip category was led by our innovative Taperloc complete system and our comprehensive revision portfolio, in addition to our Vitamin E-infused advanced bearing materials VIVACIT-E and E1. During the quarter, our sales channel focused on increasing the adoption of differentiated recent additions to our hip offerings, including the Echo Bi-Metric Microplasty stem and the Arcos 1 piece revision system. 
We also continued to gain traction with the G7 Dual Mobility Construct. This unique solution is designed to achieve stability with optimal range of motion and is compatible with the full line of fixation options within our G7 Acetabular System. We plan to further deliver hip growth in the second half of the year, backed by a diversified portfolio of solutions that address a broad spectrum of clinical challenges and surgical approaches. 
Importantly, we increased our S.E.T. revenues by an impressive 7.2% in the second quarter, supported by the positive U.S. performances of every business within this category. In surgical, our sales were again strengthened by our offerings for the OR suite, led by the Transposal Fluid Waste Management system and the A.T.S., Automatic Tourniquet System. 
From our sports medicine portfolio, we continue to deliver attractive growth with our joint preserving Gel-One hyaluronic injection and the subchondroplasty procedure, in addition to a solid initial quarter of results for our [indiscernible] anchors and [indiscernible] system from our recently expanded line of advanced soft tissue repair and reconstruction solutions. 
Within our market-leading extremities business, we've been pleased with the ongoing sales performance of our Comprehensive Total Shoulder system and the Nexel Total Elbow. And through the increased productivity of our trauma commercial teams, we sequentially improved our trauma performance with steady sales of our AFFIXUS Fracture Nail System and the Natural Nail system. Going forward, we plan to continue accelerating growth in our S.E.T. category as part of our global strategy for a diversified and sustainable revenue platform. 
Zimmer Biomet dental sales decreased 0.8% in the second quarter, representing a stabilizing sequential performance that has set the stage for expected growth in the second half of the year. In addition to benefiting from the increased harmonization of our dental commercial channel, during the second quarter, we successfully resolved a supply disruption associated with a voluntary product action that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2015. 
We also continue to improve sales across our dental portfolio, including our market-leading regenerative solutions. From our dental commercial pipeline, we've been pleased with the ongoing U.S. launch of the 3i T3 short implant, designed for challenging vertical grafting procedures and the 3.1-millimeter diameter aesthetic implant for a neuro interior sites. We will remain focused on the improvement of our dental business in the second half of the year, leveraging our scale expertise and competitive portfolio of potential solutions. 
Our Spine craniomaxillofacial and thoracic category increased sales 1.4% over the prior year quarter. Our craniomaxillofacial and thoracic team continues to grow sales of our recently launched RibFix Blu System and Omnimax MMF System while delivering strong results with our TraumaOne and SternaLock Blu Systems. 
In our Spine business, we continued to deliver steady revenues with the Polaris spinal system as well as the Timberline Lateral Fusion System, an offering, which we enhanced during the quarter with valuable expansions. Our Spine results were also supported by sales of our recently launched Vitality Spinal Fixation System. 
Going forward, we're well positioned to capture the opportunities resulting from our acquisition of LDR Spine. By joining together with this successful and innovative international Spine company, we're enhancing the scale, portfolio and capabilities of our global Spine business, including an immediate leadership position in cervical disc replacement, the fastest-growing segment of the $10 billion Spine market. 
We've also gained a number of valuable new offerings to expand our minimally invasive technologies. In addition, earlier this month, we acquired a controlling share of French surgical robotics innovator, Medtech SA, including its ROSA robotics platform for a range of minimally invasive brain, neurological and spinal procedures. This advanced combination of robotics technology with surgical navigation will further diversify our Spine and CMF portfolio as well as bolster our strategy to offer the industry's broadest range of intelligent instrumentation options. 
Furthermore, we see significant potential to leverage this platform technology for additional anatomical sites in the future. Upon acquiring the remaining Medtech shares in the coming months, our integration priorities will focus on building a strong foundation to support the expansion of this platform technology across our musculoskeletal portfolio. We will prioritize future application development and ensure that R&D resources are expanded appropriately. 
We'll also ensure that key capabilities and support functions such as manufacturing and quality systems are built out in a manner that will support our growth plans. These and other highly complementary transactions, in combination with the diversified internal pipeline, are accelerating our strategies for delivering sustainable longer-term revenue growth across all musculoskeletal markets. 
The ongoing expansion of our personalized technology, services and solutions also allows us to play a meaningful role in transforming health care by addressing the evolving needs of the sector. To that end, earlier this week, we were pleased to unveil our latest offering, Signature Solutions. This comprehensive suite of clinical services and technologies is designed to assist hospitals and medical practices to seamlessly transition to value-based health care models by maintaining excellent patient outcomes while maximizing procedural and cost efficiencies across the entire episode of care. 
Built on our 9 decades of musculoskeletal expertise, Signature Solutions will combine Zimmer Biomet's established consulting platform with a strategically curated suite of technologies and services that drives improvement across every aspect of the health care value equation. We'll initially offer Signature Solutions to musculoskeletal service lines at select academic facilities in the United States, leading the way for a broader release scheduled for 2017. 
Importantly, we expect the expansion of Signature Solutions to coincide with an increased focus on knee and hip replacement at U.S. facilities participating in Medicare CJR payment model.

264048,373864719,1015015,"Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2016",2016-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, David. I will review our second quarter performance in more detail and then provide additional information related to our second half and full year 2016 sales and earnings guidance. Our total revenues for the second quarter were $1,934,000,00",1282,"Thank you, David. I will review our second quarter performance in more detail and then provide additional information related to our second half and full year 2016 sales and earnings guidance. 
Our total revenues for the second quarter were $1,934,000,000, an increase of 4.5% constant currency compared to the second quarter of 2015 on an adjusted pro forma basis. The net currency impact for the quarter on revenue was not material to consolidated results. 
We had just over one additional billing day in the quarter as compared to the second quarter of 2015, which contributed approximately 190 basis points of growth in the quarter on a consolidated basis. The billing day differences varied by geographic segment, with the Americas and EMEA having 1 and 2 extra billing days, respectively. There was essentially no impact in the Asia Pacific region. 
Our adjusted gross profit margin was 75% for the quarter and 80 basis points lower when compared to the prior year adjusted pro forma results due to the impact of unfavorable foreign currency and price declines. The company's R&D expense was 4.6% of revenue at $88.6 million. 
Adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses were $732 million in the second quarter or 37.8% of sales, which was 220 basis points lower than the comparable period in the prior year on an adjusted pro forma basis. SG&A leverage was again driven by our synergy initiatives, partially offset by ongoing investments in our specialized sales forces around the globe as well as additional medical training and education programs. 
We remain on track to deliver cumulative net EBIT merger synergies of $225 million by the end of 2016, which is ahead of our expectations at the time of the merger closing and consistent with our full year guidance. 
In the quarter, the company recorded pretax charges of $430 million in special items, primarily related to the Biomet acquisition, including $307 million of noncash amortization and inventory step-up charges as well as integration-related expenses. Adjusted second quarter 2016 figures in the earnings release exclude the impact of these charges. A full reconciliation of reported net earnings to adjusted net earnings is included in this morning's press release. 
Adjusted operating profit in the quarter amounted to approximately $630 million or 32.6% of sales, which was an increase of 160 basis points when compared to the prior year period. Net interest expense and other nonoperating expenses totaled $89.6 million in the quarter. 
Our adjusted net earnings were $407.1 million for the second quarter, an increase of 47% compared to the prior year period. Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 27.8% to $2.02 on 201.9 million weighted average fully diluted shares outstanding. 
Our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 24.7%, which included approximately 70 basis points of benefit from the early adoption of the new tax accounting rules for stock-based compensation. With the early adoption of the new accounting standard, we also revised our Q1 tax rate by 50 basis points, which resulted in an incremental $0.01 or $0.01 to earnings per share in the first quarter. 
Operating cash flow for the quarter amounted to $380 million, which included $101 million of cash expenditures for integration and initiatives related to our synergy program. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $118 million, including $72 million for instruments and $46 million for property, plant and equipment. 
Our free cash flow in the second quarter was approximately $262 million compared to $115 million in the second quarter of 2015 and was in line with our expectations. During the quarter, the company repaid $100 million on our term loan, reflecting $1 billion of debt repayment since the closing of the Biomet transaction 1 year ago. 
I'd like to now review our guidance. I will provide updated revenue and adjusted earnings per share guidance for the full year as well as our expectations for the second half of the year. 
Our guidance reflects continued accelerating sales momentum, consistent with our prior expectations, plus the addition of exciting new technology such as the LDR portfolio, which we believe positions us well for sustained, above-market growth for years to come. 
For full year 2016, we now estimate revenue to be in a range of $7.68 billion to $7.715 billion or an increase of approximately 28% on a reported basis and 3.0% to 3.5% on an adjusted pro forma basis in each case as compared to the prior year. The adjusted pro forma revenue guidance is inclusive of approximately 100 basis points of contribution related to the LDR transaction. 
We now expect foreign currency translation to decrease revenue in 2016 by approximately 0.5% compared to our previous estimate of 1.0%, with the Japanese yen strengthening against the U.S. dollar, partially offset by the weakening British pound. Therefore, organic revenue growth on a constant currency adjusted pro forma basis is now expected to be in a range of 2.5% to 3.0%. Previously, the company estimated full year revenue growth to be in a range of 2.0% to 3.0% on a similar basis. 
Turning to the full year P&L. After updating our assumptions to reflect our recent acquisitions and planned strategic investments as well as foreign currency exchange rates, our full year adjusted diluted earnings per share is now expected to be in a range of $7.90 to $8, the achievement of which would mark our fifth consecutive year of expanded adjusted operating margins. 
Our reported earnings per share are expected to be in a range of $1.50 to $1.75 after getting us back to our year-to-date results and anticipated special items in the second half. Special items are largely associated with noncash amortization, cost incurred to capture net synergy targets and the acquisition integration expenses. 
As we look to the second half of the year, revenue growth is expected to be in a range of 4.0% to 5.0% for both the third and fourth quarter, with 1 less billing day in Q4 compared to the prior year, a 150 basis point headwind. 
Foreign exchange is estimated to decrease revenue in both quarters by about 30 basis points. Reported revenue is expected to be in a dollar range of $1,830,000,000 to $1,850,000,000 for the third quarter and $2,010,000,000 to $2,030,000,000 in the fourth quarter. 
Constant currency growth on a day adjusted basis is expected to be in a range of 4.3% to 5.3% for the third quarter and 5.8% to 6.8% for the fourth quarter. Excluding the impact of the LDR acquisition, constant currency day rate growth is expected to be in a range of 2.5% to 3.5% and 3.5% to 4.5% for Q3 and Q4, respectively. 
Working down the P&L. During the second half of 2016, we expect gross margin to be in a range of 75.0% to 75.7%, consistent with the first half of the year. R&D and SG&A as a percentage of sales are expected to increase from the first half of the year to reflect the recent acquisitions and planned strategic investments. 
We now estimate R&D expense to be in a range of 4.7% to 5.2% of sales in the second half, and SG&A expense to be in a range of 37.5% to 39.5%. We expect higher expense ratios in Q3 and lower in Q4 to properly reflect seasonality. 
The effective tax rate in the second half of the year is expected to be approximately 25%. 
To wrap up, we expect Q3 adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $1.76 to $1.80 and Q4 to be in a range of $2.11 to $2.17. 
Finally, please note that our guidance does not include any impact from other potential business development transactions or unforeseen events.

Probably more substantial progress sequentially from the first quarter to the second quarter in hips, but that stands to reason relative to some of the product launches that have already come out this year, and we're finding a lot of traction with strengthening our revision line. As we talked about in the past, the Biomet portfolio greatly shores up some of the gaps that we had in the legacy Zimmer side, and the commercial teams are taking advantage of that in the hip side. We probably saw an earlier recovery in the knee business on the U.S. front, and then that was sustained sequentially from Q1 to Q2. So we feel good about the momentum. We have a lot of opportunity going forward both large-joint categories in the United States, and obviously, these are categories that are performed quite well outside of the U.S. for us, particularly the knee business over the course of the last couple of quarters now."

Obviously, across the globe, we compete against a large number of companies, some of whom are taking that segment of the market by way of focus. And if anything, I would tell you that we're better positioned than ever because the Zimmer Biomet combination we have not only the capability to position our system at a price point to meet the clinical needs and the demands of customers to match anyone, but we're doing that with clinically proven products that have been out for, in the case of NexGen, 20 years. And our service capabilities, at the same time, with our scale can deliver that product in a cross-efficient way, in a manner that meets the service needs of those customers as well. So nothing new in the way of that announcement. Obviously, we take any launch seriously. We pay a lot of attention to the competitive environment and do that in a very respectable manner because that leads us to running the business in a more confident fashion. But there isn't anything about that particular announcement that we find to be game changing relative to the marketplace. I would go on, I guess, Craig, to tell you that I think that to the extent that the value-based models are going to become more significant in the U.S. market, and this is the case in some of the OUS markets that we've operated in for a long, long time, look, if someone grabs a product to save a few dollars and ends up with a clinical problem and remember, that patients, at the same time, are becoming much, much more better educated, and their expectations for return to the lifestyle that they have envisioned with respect to getting to is better informed than ever. Using the wrong product, ending up with the wrong patient result, a reputational damage quite soon, the economic consequences of doing that are going to be dialed in, in a much more significant way. So again, proving clinical technologies are going to be more important in the environment that we're going to be operating in rather than less. And I think that whether it's surgeons or hospital administrators, they're going to be making business decisions in accordance with that environment that they're -- in which they're operating."

This is all part of a decade-long effort that we've had underway to offer the marketplace with the broadest array of intelligent instruments. And as we've said all along, we're agnostic as to the form that, that technology takes. But what's important to us is to create value with these technologies, and think about that in 3 key areas: first and foremost, is to improve the quality of outcomes; secondly, to ensure that, that technology is efficient and creates value for our customers; and then thirdly, and this is going to become increasingly important in the value-based world that we're going to be operating within, is patient volume capture. And so that means the clinical outcome can't go backwards. The cost of the technology can't be positioned in a way where it doesn't provide the customer with a return, and it certainly can't prolong OR times or terms of those ORs in a manner that cause the patient volume to decline in that important service line for the customer. So with all of that by way of background, we obviously in patient-specific instruments, in iASSIST, in eLIBRA, et cetera, and the more traditional navigation have made significant investments and do thousands and thousands of procedures that are supported by those technologies. To the extent that robotics can augment, where it is a value creator, the cases that are being done, then that's an effort that is worth putting forward, and we believe that it will create value. Now this is it technology that is very well advanced. The better part of a couple of decades of effort have gone into it, and it really augments and complements what we've been doing out of our Montréal operations for over a decade, what they've been doing for 2 decades as ortho soft, the navigation of the development of the ISS technologies, so very complementary. It will be integrated into those technologies, but it has to create value, and so the Medtech group has done a good job of taking that technology forward, addressing technical challenges that existed when we looked at similar technologies over the last many years, and that's the difference maker to us. And so it has the potential of being leverageable across other musculoskeletal sites, but obviously, at the start point, we'll focus on the current applications and sort of the beginnings of the launch in the Spine space and do that in a way where we make sure that we're getting the foundation right to ensure that we don't have hiccups or hit sort of speed bumps as we roll out those technologies and applications across various anatomical sites. So if you look at Spine specifically, obviously, the success rates, patient satisfaction rates are quite different than knees and hips. And this is one of the things that we can do along with LDR's Mobi-C, along with LDR's minimally invasive technologies and implants to provide a better patient outcome, and so we'll be focused in those areas first. And then over time, to the extent that we can create value with this technology in other areas, you should expect to see those applications get launched as well, Craig."

And again, these were business units where -- and market subsegments, where we had lower share, we had sort of scale challenges and some product gaps. Biomet was in the exact same position, and it really was a complementary fit when you brought those product lines together, the product pipelines together and importantly, the capability, given the competitiveness of that combined portfolio in each of those product categories to justify building out more specialized sales forces, I tell you that that's just now what you're starting to see the benefit of, and that's a big difference maker. So you've got this competitive bag, and historically, organizations that were primarily driven by generalists and are in the future, and you're starting to see good results of this going to be driven by sales force specialization, where appropriate.

It was one of the things that we drove, Mike, in the integration early on is to make critical decisions that would optimize our performance across all these product categories. And since then, we've been adding more specialized reps to each of these categories, and we're up on a net basis substantially in the nonlarge-joint categories. In fact, we're up on a net basis both Q1 and Q2 on the large joint side, too. So this is just the beginning of driving this momentum, and we're really enthusiastic about over what we're seeing."

I think first importantly, as we said in our prepared remarks, with the Biomet integration solidly on track and accelerating revenue growth that it really does put us in a position to make important strategic investments, and the -- certainly the LDR acquisition being part of that effort. So very excited to have LDR in our Spine portfolio. It's a big opportunity for us to transform our Spine business. As you know, as an independent company, LDR was generating operating losses, which we're absorbing in the second half of the year. And as we eliminate redundancies and integrate the back office, et cetera, we'll grow that business, and that will begin to turn. So as we said at the time of the deal announcement, the transaction is expected to be neutral to net income in 2017. And so for the back half of '16 and the full year of '16, we're delivering on our -- towards the high end of our original EPS guidance while also making strategic investments, like LDR, like Medtech, Signature Solutions, which David referred to, on top of specialized sales forces in medical training and education. So those are the types of investments that we're able to meet while delivering on our EPS, and we think that's the smart investment to make it and really positions us well going into 2017 with that accelerating top line."

It just feels like this momentum continues over the next 2 quarters, you should exceed the top end of your organic guidance range, and I guess, I try to take your qualitative momentum commentary with the guidance. It sounds that you think there's a lot of momentum. I think that, that carries forward, you do better than the top end of guidance. Is this just sort of baby steps? Or is there anything you can think of either in recon or other businesses that potentially are headwinds in the back half of the year that we may not be thinking about relative to the momentum that looks obvious?"

So again, you look at the sort of clean view of the organic growth rate that we spoke about, and you've got nice steps that are contemplated for both Q3 and Q4, and then that creates a nice jump off point for 2017, which is absolutely consistent with what we came into the year articulating we would accomplish."

But that's not a refinement that I would tell you is something that you want to set into your thinking for the market that we're operating with. And the only other thing I would tell you was it is the case with this broad portfolio that we have a lot of opportunities to position products and technologies in proven products and technologies at that to meet those customer demands.

It matters in your ability to continuously reinvest in the business and research and development and avoid product gaps and have a nice mix of sort of the more me too oriented products so you don't have a hole as well as some of the things that are more aggressively going after addressing unmet need, and so the Medtech acquisition would be an example of the latter, the Mobi-C products within the LDR portfolio would be a good example of the latter. So we're absolutely in a position where we're going to be able to compete effectively. I do think that it is going to be become increasingly the case where with the consolidation of customers and their desire to eliminate large numbers of vendors and consolidate themselves that the one-stop shop provider and now we're going to be able to do that in Spine business, we're doing that across musculoskeletal service line as a whole, and I think that you'll see a continuing trend towards that within the marketplace, and it obviously plays to our advantage."

If you bump around from 1 quarter to the next, like I said, there can be some billing day differences, some day mix differences, but look, at the end of the day, the population globally is aging. The need for these procedures is growing. That's unmistakable. This is, in the case of large joints, the only solution for someone in advanced stage osteoarthritis, and these procedures work, and that underlying demand is just not going to change. You can forecast out the numbers, see how that percentage of the population that's aging in a period where they're more likely to need a total joint is going to continue to grow for years to come. And so to us, that's the basis upon which we make our business decisions as opposed to bumping around from 1 quarter to next with sort of minor variations in growth rates. The dynamics are quite stable. The union -- or the unit demand, the pricing environment that we've been in and to the extent that there is going to be any change in the United States market, for example, the movement towards more value-based environment for reimbursement, we're going to have the broadest of service offerings and the most cohesive capability to come in and partner more deeply with our customers to help them address their needs across that episode of care.

And if you think about that, whether it's that particular setting or the broader movement towards value-based reimbursement, these are all driven by the same trends, aging population. These providers of the solutions being pushed to do it more cost effectively than ever, and I think that our Z23 [ph] program Signature Solutions are specifically designed to shape that solution, and we've had good success with that program. We're ready to expand that program and do more with it, and it is very integrated into our Signature Solutions offering because it's meeting the same demands that these customers are facing. So it just stands to reason that for the right patient that the capability to get them in and out of the hospital, to avoid the potential of high-risk consequences or readmissions in the form of [indiscernible] infections that can be more pervasive in a acute care setting, we've got to be doing those procedures outside the acute care setting. There are many, many patients where you're not going to be able to do that for the foreseeable future. So I think that the providers understand that that's an opportunity. It's a message that resonated well with the surgeons. It's a small percentage today. It's going to grow -- I hesitate to predict, where that lands. I think that, that really needs to be driven by the way the patients present, and I think that that's part of the work that needs to be done is to very carefully refine which patients are qualified for that setting and those that aren't. But again, the data that we're going to be able to generate over a reasonable time period with our Signature Solutions effort is going to be part of what allows us to make those informed decisions and to continuously refine the model because it's end to end. So we'll be building data and through the Z23 [ph] program, Signature Solutions, and that's going to allow diagnosis and care pathway decisions to be made on a better-informed basis than those decisions have ever been made in the past."

And obviously, we have a long period of time between signing and consummating the Biomet deal to do that planning work. But then you're sort of standing by aggressively until the deal closes, and I think our commercial leaders did an outstanding job in the second half of 2015 of executing those plans. And it created some significant opportunities as we appointed leaders then to sort out the product portfolio and the customers being covered by reps to start to build greater emphasis in the nonlarge-joint categories, where appropriate, and we took advantage of that opportunity. And then we started to build the pipeline of recruiting of new reps that would be able to fully exploit the opportunities, particularly in outside of large joints. And so that pipeline got built towards the end of last year. Those positions are brought on, and obviously, it takes time for those reps to become productive. And so I think in Q2, you're just seeing the early signs of that productivity that's going to continue into second half of the year, but this is going to be a dynamic that is forever for us with the critical mass, scale, competitiveness of our portfolios across all product category and our innovation pipeline and capability to make a difference with service lines like Signature Solutions going forward integrating all this. We're going to continuously build-out that sales force, and that's going to be a real strength to the organization going forward on a global basis. And so the local leaders are going to make these decisions as to what level of specialization they need because they're closest to the opportunity and the customers and where it makes sense because it's a less populated environment or the call point is overlapping, and we'll have the same rep going after that business to the extent that the call point is more separated. And it's a highly populated area, you should expect to see us with more specialization in those markets, but we've made tremendous progress in this regard in both the first and the second quarter, and we'll continue to execute that plan going forward.

During our call, we will compare revenues on a constant currency adjusted, pro forma basis. This means revenues for the prior year periods have been adjusted to reflect the inclusion of Biomet revenues and the impact of previously announced divestiture revenues.
Additionally, expense ratios and related margin analysis through operating profit will be computed on the basis of an adjusted pro forma financial, as revised, adjusted in all periods for inventory step-up and other inventory and manufacturing-related charges, special items, intangible asset amortization, financing and other expenses related to the Biomet merger and certain tax adjustments as applicable.

This morning,, I'll review our second quarter financial results and key highlights from our performance, as well as the ongoing development and expansion of our musculoskeletal portfolio. Dan will then provide additional financial details and discuss our updated guidance. 
Before I launch into these topics, however, I'd like to take a moment to reflect on the 1 year anniversary of the formation of Zimmer Biomet. Throughout this past year, we've continued to be guided by our long-standing value-creation framework which focuses on investing for sustainable growth, driving operational efficiencies and redeploying capital in a disciplined manner. We've successfully integrated and leveraged the combined expertise and cultures of the 2 organizations while executing on a highly complementary portfolio of technologies, services and solutions. Our financial results have provided the tangible proof points that Zimmer Biomet reflects our initial vision of an ideal fit. 
Our company has reached an important inflection point, having successfully reestablished top line momentum by beginning to capture the promise of the attractive cross-selling opportunities inherent in our merger in addition to successfully delivering on our synergy commitments. We are now poised to move forward with our plans, which include the acceleration of our commercial and innovation strategic priorities. These priorities are designed to further enhance and sustain our growth well into the future. 
Consistent with this progress, Zimmer Biomet generated solid revenue acceleration in the second quarter, again above the top end of our expectations, further validating our strategies to achieve above-market revenue growth by the close of 2016. Our steady advance towards this goal demonstrates the increasing productivity and focused execution of our commercial organization. And for the balance of the year, we'll continue to exploit the opportunities presented by our differentiated musculoskeletal portfolio. 
Turning briefly to market conditions. In the second quarter, the demand across the globe for musculoskeletal solutions continued to grow at a steady pace, in line with our expectations and consistent with recent quarters. With regard to pricing, we experienced negative price pressure of 1.2% in the quarter, consistent with broader trend throughout 2016. 
Against this backdrop, Zimmer Biomet delivered second quarter consolidated net sales of $1.93 billion, which represented an increase of 65.6% on a reported basis and 4.5% adjusted compared to the prior year quarter. 
We increased sales in each of our segments, with Americas up 3.6%; Europe, Middle East and Africa region growing 4.5%; and the Asia Pacific region delivering 8.2% growth. 
Within our consolidated results, Zimmer Biomet's knee category grew sales 5.0% the second quarter, reflecting positive volume and mix of 6.5% and negative price of 1.5%. Our U.S. knee business continued to deliver solid results, which contributed to a sales increase of 3.0% in the Americas. We also achieved strong revenues in markets across the Asia Pacific and Europe, Middle East and Africa regions, where we increased sales over the prior year period by 9.6% and 7.1%, respectively. 
As anticipated, the cross-selling opportunities of our market-leading knee portfolio continued to drive growth, led by the ongoing sales performance of premium reconstructive systems, such as our flagship Persona The Personalized Knee System and the Vanguard 360 Revision Knee System. 
In addition, during the quarter, we marked the 40th anniversary of the launch of the Oxford Partial Knee, the most widely used and clinically proven partial knee replacement in the world, which has been used in more than 600,000 surgeries across 50 countries and featured in more than 280 published studies. 
And as part of our commitment to continuous product innovation, during the second quarter, we released a series of next-generation enhancements to our OSS Orthopedic Salvage System, advancing this unique solution for salvage revision procedures and oncologic applications. As we look to the second half of the year, we'll further leverage the commercial opportunities of our knee portfolio for the ongoing growth of this important category. 
Turning to our market-leading hip business. We accelerated consolidated sales growth to 3.2% the second quarter, including positive volume and mix of 5.4% and negative price of 2.2%. Hip revenues grew 8.1% in the Asia Pacific region; 3.6% in Europe, Middle East and Africa; and 1.5% in the Americas compared to the prior year quarter. 
The second quarter progress of our hip category was led by our innovative Taperloc Complete system and our comprehensive revision portfolio, in addition to our Vitamin E-infused advanced bearing materials, VIVACIT-E and E1. During the quarter, our sales channel focused on increasing the adoption of differentiated recent additions to our hip offerings, including the Echo Bi-Metric Microplasty stem and the Arcos One-Piece Revision system. 
We also continued to gain traction with the G7 Dual Mobility Construct. This unique solution is designed to achieve stability with optimal range of motion and is compatible with the full line of fixation options within our G7 Acetabular System. 
We plan to further deliver hip growth in the second half of the year, backed by a diversified portfolio of solutions that address a broad spectrum of clinical challenges and surgical approaches. 
Importantly, we increased our S.E.T. revenues by an impressive 7.2% in the second quarter, supported by the positive U.S. performances of every business within this category. In surgical, our sales were again strengthened by our offerings for the OR suite, led by the Transposal Fluid Waste Management System and the A.T.S. Automatic Tourniquet System. 
From our sports medicine portfolio, we continued to deliver attractive growth with our joint-preserving Gel-One hyaluronan injection and the Subchondroplasty Procedure, in addition to a solid initial quarter of results for our Quattro Link knotless anchors, an afferfic [ph] system from our recently expanded line of advanced soft tissue repair and reconstruction solutions. 
Within our market-leading extremities business, we've been pleased with the ongoing sales performance of our Comprehensive Total Shoulder system and the Nexel Total Elbow. And through the increased productivity of our trauma commercial teams, we sequentially improved our trauma performance with steady sales of our AFFIXUS Hip Fracture Nail System and the Natural Nail system. Going forward, we plan to continue accelerating growth in our S.E.T. category as part of our global strategy for a diversified and sustainable revenue platform. 
Zimmer Biomet Dental sales decreased 0.8% in the second quarter, representing a stabilizing sequential performance that has set the stage for expected growth in the second half of the year. In addition to benefiting from the increased harmonization of our dental commercial channel, during the second quarter, we successfully resolved a supply disruption associated with a voluntary product action that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2015. 
We also continued to improve sales across our dental portfolio, including our market-leading regenerative solutions. 
From our dental commercial pipeline, we've been pleased with the ongoing U.S. launch of the 3i T3 short implant, designed for challenging vertical grafting procedures, and the 3.1-millimeter diameter aesthetic implant for a narrow interior sites. We will remain focused on the improvement of our dental business in the second half of the year, leveraging our scale, expertise and competitive portfolio of potential solutions. 
Our Spine, craniomaxillofacial and thoracic category increased sales 1.4% over the prior year quarter. Our craniomaxillofacial and thoracic team continues to grow sales of our recently launched RibFix Blu System and Omnimax MMF System, while delivering strong results with our TraumaOne and SternaLock Blu systems. 
In our Spine business, we continued to deliver steady revenues with the Polaris spinal system, as well as The Timberline Lateral Fusion System, an offering which we enhanced during the quarter with valuable expansions. Our Spine results were also supported by sales of our recently launched Vitality Spinal Fixation System. 
Going forward, we're well positioned to capture the opportunities resulting from our acquisition of LDR Spine. By joining together with this successful and innovative international spine company, we're enhancing the scale, portfolio and capabilities of our global Spine business, including an immediate leadership position in cervical disc replacement, the fastest-growing segment of the $10 billion spine market. We've also gained a number of valuable new offerings to expand our minimally invasive technologies. 
In addition, earlier this month, we acquired a controlling share of French surgical robotics innovator, Medtech SA, including its ROSA robotics platform for a range of minimally invasive brain, neurological and spinal procedures. This advanced combination of robotics technology with surgical navigation will further diversify our Spine and CMF portfolio, as well as bolster our strategy to offer the industry's broadest range of intelligent instrumentation options. Furthermore, we see significant potential to leverage this platform technology for additional anatomical sites in the future. 
Upon acquiring the remaining Medtech shares in the coming months, our integration priorities will focus on building a strong foundation to support the expansion of this platform technology across our musculoskeletal portfolio. We will prioritize future application development and ensure that R&D resources are expanded appropriately. We'll also ensure that key capabilities and support functions, such as manufacturing and quality systems, are built out in a manner that will support our growth plans. 
These and other highly complementary transactions, in combination with the diversified internal pipeline, are accelerating our strategies for delivering sustainable longer-term revenue growth across all musculoskeletal markets. 
The ongoing expansion of our personalized technology, services and solutions also allows us to play a meaningful role in transforming health care by addressing the evolving needs of the sector. To that end, earlier this week, we were pleased to unveil our latest offering: Signature Solutions. This comprehensive suite of clinical services and technologies is designed to assist hospitals and medical practices to seamlessly transition to value-based health care models by maintaining excellent patient outcomes while maximizing procedural and cost efficiencies across the entire episode of care. 
Built on our 9 decades of musculoskeletal expertise, Signature Solutions will combine Zimmer Biomet's established consulting platform with a strategically curated suite of technologies and services that drives improvement across every aspect of the health care value equation. 
We'll initially offer Signature Solutions to musculoskeletal service lines at select academic facilities in the United States, leading the way for a broader release scheduled for 2017. Importantly, we expect the expansion of Signature Solutions to coincide with an increased focus on knee and hip replacement at U.S. facilities participating in Medicare's CJR payment model. Through innovative service-driven offerings such as this, we're deepening our commitment to advancing standards of musculoskeletal care and enhancing our partnerships with health care stakeholders. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Dan, who will continue this discussion in greater detail, as well as review our revenue and earnings guidance. Dan?"
264048,373864719,1015292,"Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2016",2016-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, David. I will review our second quarter performance in more detail and then provide additional information related to our second half and full year 2016 sales and earnings guidance. Our total revenues for the second quarter were $1,934,000,00",1277,"Thank you, David. I will review our second quarter performance in more detail and then provide additional information related to our second half and full year 2016 sales and earnings guidance. 
Our total revenues for the second quarter were $1,934,000,000, an increase of 4.5% constant currency compared to the second quarter of 2015 on an adjusted pro forma basis. The net currency impact for the quarter on revenue was not material to consolidated results. 
We had just over one additional billing day in the quarter as compared to the second quarter of 2015, which contributed approximately 190 basis points of growth in the quarter on a consolidated basis. The billing day differences varied by geographic segment, with the Americas and EMEA having 1 and 2 extra billing days, respectively. There was essentially no impact in the Asia Pacific region. 
Our adjusted gross profit margin was 75% for the quarter and 80 basis points lower when compared to the prior year adjusted pro forma results due to the impact of unfavorable foreign currency and price declines. The company's R&D expense was 4.6% of revenue at $88.6 million. 
Adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses were $732 million in the second quarter or 37.8% of sales, which was 220 basis points lower than the comparable period in the prior year on adjusted pro forma basis. SG&A leverage was again driven by our synergy initiatives, partially offset by ongoing investments in our specialized sales forces around the globe, as well as additional medical training and education programs. 
We remain on track to deliver cumulative net EBIT merger synergies of $225 million by the end of 2016, which is ahead of our expectations at the time of the merger closing and consistent with our full year guidance. 
In the quarter, the company recorded pretax charges of $430 million in special items primarily related to the Biomet acquisition, including $307 million of noncash amortization and inventory step-up charges as well as integration-related expenses. Adjusted second quarter 2016 figures in the earnings release exclude the impact of these charges. A full reconciliation of reported net earnings to adjusted net earnings is included in this morning's press release. 
Adjusted operating profit in the quarter amounted to approximately $630 million or 32.6% of sales, which was an increase of 160 basis points when compared to the prior year period. Net interest expense and other nonoperating expenses totaled $89.6 million in the quarter. 
Our adjusted net earnings were $407.1 million for the second quarter, an increase of 47% compared to the prior year period. Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 27.8% to $2.02 on 201.9 million weighted average fully diluted shares outstanding. 
Our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 24.7%, which included approximately 70 basis points of benefit from the early adoption of the new tax accounting rules for stock-based compensation. With the early adoption of the new accounting standard, we also revised our Q1 tax rate by 50 basis points, which resulted in an incremental $0.01 to earnings per share in the first quarter. 
Operating cash flow for the quarter amounted to $380 million, which included $101 million of cash expenditures for integration and initiatives related to our synergy program. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $118 million, including $72 million for instruments and $46 million for property, plant and equipment. 
Our free cash flow in the second quarter was approximately $262 million compared to $115 million in the second quarter of 2015 and was in line with our expectations. During the quarter, the company repaid $100 million on our term loan, reflecting $1 billion of debt repayment since the closing of the Biomet transaction 1 year ago. 
I'd like to now review our guidance. I will provide updated revenue and adjusted earnings per share guidance for the full year as well as our expectations for the second half of the year. 
Our guidance reflects continued accelerating sales momentum, consistent with our prior expectations, plus the addition of exciting new technologies, such as the LDR portfolio, which we believe positions us well for sustained above-market growth for years to come. 
For full year 2016, we now estimate revenue to be in a range of $7.68 billion to $7.715 billion or an increase of approximately 28% on a reported basis and 3.0% to 3.5% on an adjusted pro forma basis in each case as compared to the prior year. The adjusted pro forma revenue guidance is inclusive of approximately 100 basis points of contribution related to the LDR transaction. 
We now expect foreign currency translation to decrease revenue in 2016 by approximately 0.5% compared to our previous estimate of 1.0%, with the Japanese yen strengthening against the U.S. dollar partially offset by the weakening British pound. Therefore, organic revenue growth on a constant currency adjusted pro forma basis is now expected to be in a range of 2.5% to 3.0%. Previously, the company estimated full year revenue growth to be in a range of 2.0% to 3.0% on a similar basis. 
Turning to the full year P&L. After updating our assumptions to reflect our recent acquisitions and planned strategic investments as well as foreign currency exchange rates, our full year adjusted diluted earnings per share is now expected to be in a range of $7.90 to $8, the achievement of which would mark our fifth consecutive year of expanded adjusted operating margins. 
Our reported earnings per share are expected to be in a range of $1.50 to $1.75 after getting us back to our year-to-date results and anticipated special items in the second half. Special items are largely associated with noncash amortization, costs incurred to capture net synergy targets and acquisition integration expenses. 
As we look to the second half of the year, revenue growth is expected to be in a range of 4.0% to 5.0% for both the third and fourth quarter, with 1 less billing day in Q4 compared to the prior year, a 150 basis point headwind. 
Foreign exchange is estimated to decrease revenue in both quarters by about 30 basis points. Reported revenue is expected to be in a dollar range of $1,830,000,000 to $1,850,000,000 for the third quarter and $2,010,000,000 to $2,030,000,000 in the fourth quarter. 
Constant currency growth on a day-adjusted basis is expected to be in a range of 4.3% to 5.3% for the third quarter and 5.8% to 6.8% for the fourth quarter. Excluding the impact of the LDR acquisition, constant currency day rate growth is expected to be in a range of 2.5% to 3.5% and 3.5% to 4.5% for Q3 and Q4, respectively. 
Working down the P&L. During the second half of 2016, we expect gross margin to be in a range of 75.0% to 75.7%, consistent with the first half of the year. R&D and SG&A as a percentage of sales are expected to increase from the first half of the year to reflect the recent acquisitions and planned strategic investments. We now estimate R&D expense to be in a range of 4.7% to 5.2% of sales in the second half, and SG&A expense to be in a range of 37.5% to 39.5%. We expect higher expense ratios in Q3 and lower in Q4 to properly reflect seasonality. 
The effective tax rate in the second half of the year is expected to be approximately 25%. 
To wrap up, we expect Q3 adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $1.76 to $1.80 and Q4 to be in a range of $2.11 to $2.17. 
Finally, please note that our guidance does not include any impact from other potential business development transactions or unforeseen events.

Probably more substantial progress sequentially from the first quarter to the second quarter in hips, but that stands to reason relative to some of the product launches that have already come out this year, and we're finding a lot of traction with strengthening our revision line. As we talked about in the past, the Biomet portfolio greatly shores up some of the gaps that we had on the legacy Zimmer side, and the commercial teams are taking advantage of that on the hip side. We probably saw an earlier recovery of the knee business on the U.S. front, and then that was sustained sequentially from Q1 to Q2. So we feel good about the momentum. We have a lot of opportunity going forward, both large-joint categories in the United States. And obviously, these are categories that have performed quite well outside the U.S. for us, particularly the knee business over the course of the last couple of quarters now."

And our service capabilities, at the same time with our scale, can deliver that product in a cost-efficient way, in a manner that meets the service needs of those customers as well. So nothing new in the way of that announcement. Obviously, we take any launch seriously. We pay a lot of attention to the competitive environment and do that in a very respectful manner because that leads us to running the business in a more confident fashion. But there isn't anything about that particular announcement that we find to be game-changing relative to the marketplace. I would go on, I guess, Craig, to tell you that I think that to the extent that the value-based models are going to become more significant in the U.S. market, and this is the case in some of the OUS markets that we've operated in for a long, long time, look, if someone grabs a product to save a few dollars and ends up with a clinical problem, and remember, that patients at the same time, are becoming much, much more better educated, and their expectations for return to the lifestyle that they have a vision with respect to getting to is better informed than ever. Using the wrong product, ending up with the wrong patient result, a reputational damage, and quite soon, the economic consequences of doing that are going to be dialed in at a much more significant way. So again, proven clinical technologies are going to be more important in the environment that we're going to be operating in rather than less. And I think that whether it's surgeons or hospital administrators, they're going to be making business decisions in accordance with that environment that they're -- in which they're operating."

This is all part of a decade-long effort that we've had underway to offer the marketplace with the broadest array of intelligent instruments. And as we've said all along, we're agnostic as to the form that, that technology takes. But what's important to us is to create value with these technologies, and think about that in 3 key areas: First and foremost is to improve the quality of outcomes; secondly, to ensure that, that technology is efficient and creates value for our customers; and then thirdly, and this is going to become increasingly important in the value-based world that we're going to be operating within, is patient volume capture. And so that means that the clinical outcome can't go backwards. The cost of the technology can't be positioned in a way where it doesn't provide the customer with a return, and it certainly can't prolong OR times or turns of those ORs in a manner that cause the patient volume to decline in that important service line for the customer. So with all of that by way of background, we obviously, in patient-specific instruments, in iASSIST, in eLIBRA, et cetera, and the more traditional navigation have made significant investments and do thousands and thousands of procedures that are supported by those technologies. To the extent that robotics can augment, where it is a value creator, the cases that are being done, then that's an effort that is worth putting forth, and we believe that it will create value. Now this is a technology that is very well advanced. The better part of a couple of decades of effort have gone into it, and it really augments and complements what we've been doing out of our Montréal operations for over a decade, what they've been doing for 2 decades as ORTHOsoft, the navigation of the development of the iASSIST technologies. So very complementary. It will be integrated into those technologies, but it has to create value. And so the Medtech group has done a good job of taking that technology forward, addressing technical challenges that existed when we looked at similar technologies over the last many years, and that's the difference-maker to us. And so it has the potential of being leverageable across other musculoskeletal sites. But obviously at the start point, we'll focus on the current applications and sort of the beginnings of the launch in the spine space and do that in a way where we make sure that we're getting the foundation right to ensure that we don't have hiccups or hit sort of speed bumps as we roll out those technologies and the applications across various anatomical sites. So if you look at Spine specifically, obviously, the success rates, patient satisfaction rates are quite different than knees and hips. And this is one of the things that we can do along with LDR's Mobi-C, along with LDR's minimally invasive technologies and implants to provide a better patient outcome. And so we'll be focused in those areas first. And then over time, to the extent that we can create value with this technology in other areas, you should expect to see those applications get launched as well, Craig."

That S.E.T. side, we talked about this at the point of announcing the Biomet combination. And again, these were business units where -- and market subsegments where we had lower share, we had sort of scale challenges and some product gaps. Biomet was in the exact same position, and it really was a complementary fit when you brought those product lines together, the product pipelines together and importantly, the capability, given the competitiveness of that combined portfolio in each of those product categories, to justify building out more specialized sales forces, And I tell you that, that's just now what you're starting to see the benefit of, and that's a big difference maker. So you've got this competitive bag, and historically, organizations that were primarily driven by generalists and are in the future, and you're starting to see good results of this, going to be driven by sales force specialization, where appropriate.

It was one of the things that we drove, Mike, in the integration early on, is to make critical decisions that would optimize our performance across all these product categories. And since then, we've been adding more specialized reps to each of these categories, and we're up on a net basis substantially in the nonlarge-joint categories.

So very excited to have LDR in our Spine portfolio. It's a big opportunity for us to transform our Spine business. As you know, as an independent company, LDR was generating operating losses, which we're absorbing in the second half of the year. And as we eliminate redundancies and integrate the back office, et cetera, we'll grow that business, and that will begin to turn. So as we said at the time of the deal announcement, the transaction is expected to be neutral to net income in 2017. And so for the back half of '16 and the full year of '16, we're delivering on our -- towards the high end of our original EPS guidance while also making strategic investments like LDR; like Medtech; Signature Solutions, which David referred to; on top of specialized sales forces in medical training and education. So those are the types of investments that we're able to make while delivering on our EPS, and we think that's the smart investment to make it and really positions us well going into 2017 with that accelerating top line."

The dynamics are quite stable.

So it just stands to reason that for the right patient, that the capability to get them in and out of the hospital to avoid the potential of high-risk consequences or readmissions in the form of nosocomial infections that can be more pervasive in an acute care setting, they got to be doing those procedures outside the acute care setting. There are many, many patients where you're not going to be able to do that for the foreseeable future. So I think that the providers understand that, that's an opportunity. It's a message that's resonated well with the surgeons. It's a small percentage today. It's going to grow -- I hesitate to predict where that lands. I think that, that really needs to be driven by the way the patients present. And I think that, that's part of the work that needs to be done, is to very carefully refine which patients are qualified for that setting and those that aren't. But again, the data that we're going to be able to generate over a reasonable time period with our Signature Solutions effort is going to be part of what allows us to make those informed decisions and to continuously refine the model because it's end-to-end. So we'll be building data in -- through the Z23 program, Signature Solutions, and that's going to allow diagnosis and care pathway decisions to be made on a better-informed basis than those decisions have ever been made in the past."

So I wouldn't expect that pace to be continuing into the second half of the year, but we're always going to be evaluating these opportunities. We've got terrific chances to get after building out the innovation pipeline and executing on that, and I think that, that's going to carry us into 2017 nicely.

And obviously, we had a long period of time between signing and consummating the Biomet deal to do that planning work. But then you're sort of standing by aggressively until the deal closes, and I think our commercial leaders did an outstanding job in the second half of 2015 of executing those plans. And it created some significant opportunities as we appointed leaders then to sort out the product portfolio and the customers being covered by reps to start to build greater emphasis in the nonlarge-joint categories, where appropriate, and we took advantage of that opportunity. And then we started to build the pipeline of recruiting of new reps that would be able to fully exploit the opportunities, particularly in -- outside of large joints. And so that pipeline got built towards the end of last year. Those positions are brought on, and obviously, it takes time for those reps to become productive. And so I think in Q2, you're just seeing the early signs of that productivity. It's going to continue in second half of the year, but this is going to be a dynamic that is forever for us with the critical mass, scale, competitiveness of our portfolios across all product categories and our innovation pipeline and capability, to make a difference with service lines, like Signature Solutions going forward, integrating all this. We're going to continuously build out that sales force, and that's going to be a real strength of the organization going forward on a global basis. And so the local leaders are going to make these decisions as to what level of specialization they need because they're closest to the opportunity and the customers and where it makes sense because it's a less populated environment or the call point is overlapping, then we'll have the same rep going after that business to the extent that the call point is more separated. And it's a highly populated area, you should expect to see us with more specialization in those markets. But we've made tremendous progress in this regard in both the first and the second quarter, and we'll continue to execute that plan going forward.

This morning, I'll review our second quarter financial results and key highlights from our performance, as well as the ongoing development and expansion of our musculoskeletal portfolio. Dan will then provide additional financial details and discuss our updated guidance. 
Before I launch into these topics, however, I'd like to take a moment to reflect on the 1 year anniversary of the formation of Zimmer Biomet. Throughout this past year, we've continued to be guided by our long-standing value-creation framework which focuses on investing for sustainable growth, driving operational efficiencies and redeploying capital in a disciplined manner. We've successfully integrated and leveraged the combined expertise and cultures of the 2 organizations while executing on a highly complementary portfolio of technologies, services and solutions. Our financial results have provided the tangible proof points that Zimmer Biomet reflects our initial vision of an ideal fit. 
Our company has reached an important inflection point, having successfully reestablished top line momentum by beginning to capture the promise of the attractive cross-selling opportunities inherent in our merger in addition to successfully delivering on our synergy commitments. We are now poised to move forward with our plans, which include the acceleration of our commercial and innovation strategic priorities. These priorities are designed to further enhance and sustain our growth well into the future. 
Consistent with this progress, Zimmer Biomet generated solid revenue acceleration in the second quarter, again above the top end of our expectations, further validating our strategies to achieve above-market revenue growth by the close of 2016. Our steady advance towards this goal demonstrates the increasing productivity and focused execution of our commercial organization. And for the balance of the year, we'll continue to exploit the opportunities presented by our differentiated musculoskeletal portfolio. 
Turning briefly to market conditions. In the second quarter, the demand across the globe for musculoskeletal solutions continued to grow at a steady pace, in line with our expectations and consistent with recent quarters. With regard to pricing, we experienced negative price pressure of 1.2% in the quarter, consistent with broader trend throughout 2016. 
Against this backdrop, Zimmer Biomet delivered second quarter consolidated net sales of $1.93 billion, which represented an increase of 65.6% on a reported basis and 4.5% adjusted compared to the prior year quarter. 
We increased sales in each of our segments, with Americas up 3.6%; Europe, Middle East and Africa region growing 4.5%; and the Asia Pacific region delivering 8.2% growth. 
Within our consolidated results, Zimmer Biomet's knee category grew sales 5.0% the second quarter, reflecting positive volume and mix of 6.5% and negative price of 1.5%. Our U.S. knee business continued to deliver solid results, which contributed to a sales increase of 3.0% in the Americas. We also achieved strong revenues in markets across the Asia Pacific and Europe, Middle East and Africa regions, where we increased sales over the prior year period by 9.6% and 7.1%, respectively. 
As anticipated, the cross-selling opportunities of our market-leading knee portfolio continued to drive growth, led by the ongoing sales performance of premium reconstructive systems, such as our flagship Persona The Personalized Knee System and the Vanguard 360 Revision Knee System. 
In addition, during the quarter, we marked the 40th anniversary of the launch of the Oxford Partial Knee, the most widely used and clinically proven partial knee replacement in the world, which has been used in more than 600,000 surgeries across 50 countries and featured in more than 280 published studies. 
And as part of our commitment to continuous product innovation, during the second quarter, we released a series of next-generation enhancements to our OSS Orthopedic Salvage System, advancing this unique solution for salvage revision procedures and oncologic applications. As we look to the second half of the year, we'll further leverage the commercial opportunities of our knee portfolio for the ongoing growth of this important category. 
Turning to our market-leading hip business. We accelerated consolidated sales growth to 3.2% the second quarter, including positive volume in mix of 5.4% and negative price of 2.2%. Hip revenues grew 8.1% in the Asia Pacific region; 3.6% in Europe, Middle East and Africa; and 1.5% in the Americas compared to the prior year quarter. 
The second quarter progress of our hip category was led by our innovative Taperloc Complete system and our comprehensive revision portfolio, in addition to our Vitamin E-infused advanced bearing materials, VIVACIT-E and E1. During the quarter, our sales channel focused on increasing the adoption of differentiated recent additions to our hip offerings, including the Echo Bi-Metric Microplasty stem and the Arcos One-Piece Revision system. 
We also continued to gain traction with the G7 Dual Mobility Construct. This unique solution is designed to achieve stability with optimal range of motion and is compatible with the full line of fixation options within our G7 Acetabular System. 
We plan to further deliver hip growth in the second half of the year, backed by a diversified portfolio of solutions that address a broad spectrum of clinical challenges and surgical approaches. 
Importantly, we increased our S.E.T. revenues by an impressive 7.2% in the second quarter, supported by the positive U.S. performances of every business within this category. In surgical, our sales were again strengthened by our offerings for the OR suite, led by the Transposal Fluid Waste Management System and the A.T.S. Automatic Tourniquet System. 
From our sports medicine portfolio, we continued to deliver attractive growth with our joint-preserving Gel-One hyaluronan injection and the Subchondroplasty Procedure, in addition to a solid initial quarter of results for our Quattro Link knotless anchors, and afferfic [ph] system from our recently expanded line of advanced soft tissue repair and reconstruction solutions. 
Within our market-leading extremities business, we've been pleased with the ongoing sales performance of our Comprehensive Total Shoulder system and the Nexel Total Elbow. And through the increased productivity of our trauma commercial teams, we sequentially improved our trauma performance with steady sales of our AFFIXUS Hip Fracture Nail System and the Natural Nail system. Going forward, we plan to continue accelerating growth in our S.E.T. category as part of our global strategy for a diversified and sustainable revenue platform. 
Zimmer Biomet Dental sales decreased 0.8% in the second quarter, representing a stabilizing sequential performance that has set the stage for expected growth in the second half of the year. In addition to benefiting from the increased harmonization of our dental commercial channel, during the second quarter, we successfully resolved a supply disruption associated with a voluntary product action that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2015. 
We also continued to improve sales across our dental portfolio, including our market-leading regenerative solutions. 
From our dental commercial pipeline, we've been pleased with the ongoing U.S. launch of the 3i T3 short implant, designed for challenging vertical grafting procedures, and the 3.1-millimeter diameter aesthetic implant for a narrow interior sites. We will remain focused on the improvement of our dental business in the second half of the year, leveraging our scale, expertise and competitive portfolio of potential solutions. 
Our Spine, craniomaxillofacial and thoracic category increased sales 1.4% over the prior year quarter. Our craniomaxillofacial and thoracic team continues to grow sales of our recently launched RibFix Blu System and Omnimax MMF System, while delivering strong results with our TraumaOne and SternaLock Blu systems. 
In our Spine business, we continued to deliver steady revenues with the Polaris spinal system, as well as The Timberline Lateral Fusion System, an offering which we enhanced during the quarter with valuable expansions. Our Spine results were also supported by sales of our recently launched Vitality Spinal Fixation System. 
Going forward, we're well positioned to capture the opportunities resulting from our acquisition of LDR Spine. By joining together with this successful and innovative international spine company, we're enhancing the scale, portfolio and capabilities of our global Spine business, including an immediate leadership position in cervical disc replacement, the fastest-growing segment of the $10 billion spine market. We've also gained a number of valuable new offerings to expand our minimally invasive technologies. 
In addition, earlier this month, we acquired a controlling share of French surgical robotics innovator, Medtech SA, including its ROSA robotics platform for a range of minimally invasive brain, neurological and spinal procedures. This advanced combination of robotics technology with surgical navigation will further diversify our Spine and CMF portfolio, as well as bolster our strategy to offer the industry's broadest range of intelligent instrumentation options. Furthermore, we see significant potential to leverage this platform technology for additional anatomical sites in the future. 
Upon acquiring the remaining Medtech shares in the coming months, our integration priorities will focus on building a strong foundation to support the expansion of this platform technology across our musculoskeletal portfolio. We will prioritize future application development and ensure that R&D resources are expanded appropriately. We'll also ensure that key capabilities and support functions, such as manufacturing and quality systems, are built out in a manner that will support our growth plans. 
These and other highly complementary transactions, in combination with the diversified internal pipeline, are accelerating our strategies for delivering sustainable longer-term revenue growth across all musculoskeletal markets. 
The ongoing expansion of our personalized technology, services and solutions also allows us to play a meaningful role in transforming health care by addressing the evolving needs of the sector. To that end, earlier this week, we were pleased to unveil our latest offering: Signature Solutions. This comprehensive suite of clinical services and technologies is designed to assist hospitals and medical practices to seamlessly transition to value-based health care models by maintaining excellent patient outcomes while maximizing procedural and cost efficiencies across the entire episode of care. 
Built on our 9 decades of musculoskeletal expertise, Signature Solutions will combine Zimmer Biomet's established consulting platform with a strategically curated suite of technologies and services that drives improvement across every aspect of the health care value equation. 
We'll initially offer Signature Solutions to musculoskeletal service lines at select academic facilities in the United States, leading the way for a broader release scheduled for 2017. Importantly, we expect the expansion of Signature Solutions to coincide with an increased focus on knee and hip replacement at U.S. facilities participating in Medicare's CJR payment model. Through innovative service-driven offerings such as this, we're deepening our commitment to advancing standards of musculoskeletal care and enhancing our partnerships with health care stakeholders. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Dan, who will continue this discussion in greater detail, as well as review our revenue and earnings guidance. Dan?"

I will review our second quarter performance in more detail and then provide additional information related to our second half and full year 2016 sales and earnings guidance. Our total revenues for the second quarter were $1,934,000,00",1277,"Thank you, David. I will review our second quarter performance in more detail and then provide additional information related to our second half and full year 2016 sales and earnings guidance. 
Our total revenues for the second quarter were $1,934,000,000, an increase of 4.5% constant currency compared to the second quarter of 2015 on an adjusted pro forma basis. The net currency impact for the quarter on revenue was not material to consolidated results. 
We had just over one additional billing day in the quarter as compared to the second quarter of 2015, which contributed approximately 190 basis points of growth in the quarter on a consolidated basis. The billing day differences varied by geographic segment, with the Americas and EMEA having 1 and 2 extra billing days, respectively. There was essentially no impact in the Asia Pacific region. 
Our adjusted gross profit margin was 75% for the quarter and 80 basis points lower when compared to the prior year adjusted pro forma results due to the impact of unfavorable foreign currency and price declines. The company's R&D expense was 4.6% of revenue at $88.6 million. 
Adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses were $732 million in the second quarter or 37.8% of sales, which was 220 basis points lower than the comparable period in the prior year on adjusted pro forma basis. SG&A leverage was again driven by our synergy initiatives, partially offset by ongoing investments in our specialized sales forces around the globe, as well as additional medical training and education programs. 
We remain on track to deliver cumulative net EBIT merger synergies of $225 million by the end of 2016, which is ahead of our expectations at the time of the merger closing and consistent with our full year guidance. 
In the quarter, the company recorded pretax charges of $430 million in special items primarily related to the Biomet acquisition, including $307 million of noncash amortization and inventory step-up charges as well as integration-related expenses. Adjusted second quarter 2016 figures in the earnings release exclude the impact of these charges. A full reconciliation of reported net earnings to adjusted net earnings is included in this morning's press release. 
Adjusted operating profit in the quarter amounted to approximately $630 million or 32.6% of sales, which was an increase of 160 basis points when compared to the prior year period. Net interest expense and other nonoperating expenses totaled $89.6 million in the quarter. 
Our adjusted net earnings were $407.1 million for the second quarter, an increase of 47% compared to the prior year period. Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 27.8% to $2.02 on 201.9 million weighted average fully diluted shares outstanding. 
Our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 24.7%, which included approximately 70 basis points of benefit from the early adoption of the new tax accounting rules for stock-based compensation. With the early adoption of the new accounting standard, we also revised our Q1 tax rate by 50 basis points, which resulted in an incremental $0.01 to earnings per share in the first quarter. 
Operating cash flow for the quarter amounted to $380 million, which included $101 million of cash expenditures for integration and initiatives related to our synergy program. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $118 million, including $72 million for instruments and $46 million for property, plant and equipment. 
Our free cash flow in the second quarter was approximately $262 million compared to $115 million in the second quarter of 2015 and was in line with our expectations. During the quarter, the company repaid $100 million on our term loan, reflecting $1 billion of debt repayment since the closing of the Biomet transaction 1 year ago. 
I'd like to now review our guidance. I will provide updated revenue and adjusted earnings per share guidance for the full year as well as our expectations for the second half of the year. 
Our guidance reflects continued accelerating sales momentum, consistent with our prior expectations, plus the addition of exciting new technologies, such as the LDR portfolio, which we believe positions us well for sustained above-market growth for years to come. 
For full year 2016, we now estimate revenue to be in a range of $7.68 billion to $7.715 billion or an increase of approximately 28% on a reported basis and 3.0% to 3.5% on an adjusted pro forma basis in each case as compared to the prior year. The adjusted pro forma revenue guidance is inclusive of approximately 100 basis points of contribution related to the LDR transaction. 
We now expect foreign currency translation to decrease revenue in 2016 by approximately 0.5% compared to our previous estimate of 1.0%, with the Japanese yen strengthening against the U.S. dollar partially offset by the weakening British pound. Therefore, organic revenue growth on a constant currency adjusted pro forma basis is now expected to be in a range of 2.5% to 3.0%. Previously, the company estimated full year revenue growth to be in a range of 2.0% to 3.0% on a similar basis. 
Turning to the full year P&L. After updating our assumptions to reflect our recent acquisitions and planned strategic investments as well as foreign currency exchange rates, our full year adjusted diluted earnings per share is now expected to be in a range of $7.90 to $8, the achievement of which would mark our fifth consecutive year of expanded adjusted operating margins. 
Our reported earnings per share are expected to be in a range of $1.50 to $1.75 after getting us back to our year-to-date results and anticipated special items in the second half. Special items are largely associated with noncash amortization, costs incurred to capture net synergy targets and acquisition integration expenses. 
As we look to the second half of the year, revenue growth is expected to be in a range of 4.0% to 5.0% for both the third and fourth quarter, with 1 less billing day in Q4 compared to the prior year, a 150 basis point headwind. 
Foreign exchange is estimated to decrease revenue in both quarters by about 30 basis points. Reported revenue is expected to be in a dollar range of $1,830,000,000 to $1,850,000,000 for the third quarter and $2,010,000,000 to $2,030,000,000 in the fourth quarter. 
Constant currency growth on a day-adjusted basis is expected to be in a range of 4.3% to 5.3% for the third quarter and 5.8% to 6.8% for the fourth quarter. Excluding the impact of the LDR acquisition, constant currency day rate growth is expected to be in a range of 2.5% to 3.5% and 3.5% to 4.5% for Q3 and Q4, respectively. 
Working down the P&L. During the second half of 2016, we expect gross margin to be in a range of 75.0% to 75.7%, consistent with the first half of the year. R&D and SG&A as a percentage of sales are expected to increase from the first half of the year to reflect the recent acquisitions and planned strategic investments. We now estimate R&D expense to be in a range of 4.7% to 5.2% of sales in the second half, and SG&A expense to be in a range of 37.5% to 39.5%. We expect higher expense ratios in Q3 and lower in Q4 to properly reflect seasonality. 
The effective tax rate in the second half of the year is expected to be approximately 25%. 
To wrap up, we expect Q3 adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $1.76 to $1.80 and Q4 to be in a range of $2.11 to $2.17. 
Finally, please note that our guidance does not include any impact from other potential business development transactions or unforeseen events.

We continued to make progress in closing the gap to market in both large-joint categories in the United States. Probably more substantial progress sequentially from the first quarter to the second quarter in hips, but that stands to reason relative to some of the product launches that have already come out this year, and we're finding a lot of traction with strengthening our revision line. As we talked about in the past, the Biomet portfolio greatly shores up some of the gaps that we had on the legacy Zimmer side, and the commercial teams are taking advantage of that on the hip side. We probably saw an earlier recovery of the knee business on the U.S. front, and then that was sustained sequentially from Q1 to Q2. So we feel good about the momentum. We have a lot of opportunity going forward, both large-joint categories in the United States. And obviously, these are categories that have performed quite well outside the U.S. for us, particularly the knee business over the course of the last couple of quarters now."

Obviously, across the globe, we compete against a large number of companies, some of whom are taking that segment of the market by way of focus. And if anything, I would tell you that we're better positioned than ever. Because of the Zimmer Biomet combination, we have not only the capability to position our systems at a price point to meet the clinical needs and the demands of customers to match anyone, but we're doing that with clinically proven products that have been out for, in the case of NexGen, 20 years. And our service capabilities, at the same time with our scale, can deliver that product in a cost-efficient way, in a manner that meets the service needs of those customers as well. So nothing new in the way of that announcement. Obviously, we take any launch seriously. We pay a lot of attention to the competitive environment and do that in a very respectful manner because that leads us to running the business in a more confident fashion. But there isn't anything about that particular announcement that we find to be game-changing relative to the marketplace. I would go on, I guess, Craig, to tell you that I think that to the extent that the value-based models are going to become more significant in the U.S. market, and this is the case in some of the OUS markets that we've operated in for a long, long time, look, if someone grabs a product to save a few dollars and ends up with a clinical problem, and remember, that patients at the same time, are becoming much, much more better educated, and their expectations for return to the lifestyle that they have a vision with respect to getting to is better informed than ever. Using the wrong product, ending up with the wrong patient result, a reputational damage, and quite soon, the economic consequences of doing that are going to be dialed in at a much more significant way. So again, proven clinical technologies are going to be more important in the environment that we're going to be operating in rather than less. And I think that whether it's surgeons or hospital administrators, they're going to be making business decisions in accordance with that environment that they're -- in which they're operating."

So I want to ask from a strategic point of view why robotics works in Spine and some of the other anatomical areas but may not work in hip and knee, as you've spoken numerous times about one of your competitors and the robot that they acquired.

This is all part of a decade-long effort that we've had underway to offer the marketplace with the broadest array of intelligent instruments. And as we've said all along, we're agnostic as to the form that, that technology takes. But what's important to us is to create value with these technologies, and think about that in 3 key areas: First and foremost is to improve the quality of outcomes; secondly, to ensure that, that technology is efficient and creates value for our customers; and then thirdly, and this is going to become increasingly important in the value-based world that we're going to be operating within, is patient volume capture. And so that means that the clinical outcome can't go backwards. The cost of the technology can't be positioned in a way where it doesn't provide the customer with a return, and it certainly can't prolong OR times or turns of those ORs in a manner that cause the patient volume to decline in that important service line for the customer. So with all of that by way of background, we obviously, in patient-specific instruments, in iASSIST, in eLIBRA, et cetera, and the more traditional navigation have made significant investments and do thousands and thousands of procedures that are supported by those technologies. To the extent that robotics can augment, where it is a value creator, the cases that are being done, then that's an effort that is worth putting forth, and we believe that it will create value. Now this is a technology that is very well advanced. The better part of a couple of decades of effort have gone into it, and it really augments and complements what we've been doing out of our Montréal operations for over a decade, what they've been doing for 2 decades as ORTHOsoft, the navigation of the development of the iASSIST technologies. So very complementary. It will be integrated into those technologies, but it has to create value. And so the Medtech group has done a good job of taking that technology forward, addressing technical challenges that existed when we looked at similar technologies over the last many years, and that's the difference-maker to us. And so it has the potential of being leverageable across other musculoskeletal sites. But obviously at the start point, we'll focus on the current applications and sort of the beginnings of the launch in the spine space and do that in a way where we make sure that we're getting the foundation right to ensure that we don't have hiccups or hit sort of speed bumps as we roll out those technologies and the applications across various anatomical sites. So if you look at Spine specifically, obviously, the success rates, patient satisfaction rates are quite different than knees and hips. And this is one of the things that we can do along with LDR's Mobi-C, along with LDR's minimally invasive technologies and implants to provide a better patient outcome. And so we'll be focused in those areas first. And then over time, to the extent that we can create value with this technology in other areas, you should expect to see those applications get launched as well, Craig."

That S.E.T. side, we talked about this at the point of announcing the Biomet combination. And again, these were business units where -- and market subsegments where we had lower share, we had sort of scale challenges and some product gaps. Biomet was in the exact same position, and it really was a complementary fit when you brought those product lines together, the product pipelines together and importantly, the capability, given the competitiveness of that combined portfolio in each of those product categories, to justify building out more specialized sales forces, And I tell you that, that's just now what you're starting to see the benefit of, and that's a big difference maker. So you've got this competitive bag, and historically, organizations that were primarily driven by generalists and are in the future, and you're starting to see good results of this, going to be driven by sales force specialization, where appropriate.

It was one of the things that we drove, Mike, in the integration early on, is to make critical decisions that would optimize our performance across all these product categories. And since then, we've been adding more specialized reps to each of these categories, and we're up on a net basis substantially in the nonlarge-joint categories.

So very excited to have LDR in our Spine portfolio. It's a big opportunity for us to transform our Spine business. As you know, as an independent company, LDR was generating operating losses, which we're absorbing in the second half of the year. And as we eliminate redundancies and integrate the back office, et cetera, we'll grow that business, and that will begin to turn. So as we said at the time of the deal announcement, the transaction is expected to be neutral to net income in 2017. And so for the back half of '16 and the full year of '16, we're delivering on our -- towards the high end of our original EPS guidance while also making strategic investments like LDR; like Medtech; Signature Solutions, which David referred to; on top of specialized sales forces in medical training and education.

And what's really important to us is to make sure that we're doing this methodically so that it leads to a sustainable and durable growth rate on the top line as we exit 2016 into 2017. So again, you look at the sort of clean view of the organic growth rate that we spoke about, and you've got nice steps that are contemplated for both Q3 and Q4, and then that creates a nice jump off point for 2017, which is absolutely consistent with what we came into the year articulating we would accomplish."

But that's not a refinement that I would tell you is something that you want to set into your thinking for the market that we're operating with. And the only other thing I would tell you is it is the case with this broad portfolio, that we have a lot of opportunities to position products and technologies, and proven products and technologies at that, to meet those customer demands. So that, obviously, helps us manage price, and I'm optimistic that whatever the market environment takes us to, that we're going to be in a nice position to perform at a good level in that context that we're operating within."

Scale matters as it relates to the completeness of one's product portfolio. It matters relative to your capability to build out a first-class sales force on a global basis. It matters in your ability to continuously reinvest in the business in research and development and avoid product gaps and have a nice mix of sort of the more me-too oriented products so you don't have a hole, as well as some of the things that are more aggressively going after addressing unmet needs. And so the Medtech acquisition would be an example of the latter, the Mobi-C products within the LDR portfolio would be a good example of the latter. So we're absolutely in a position where we're going to be able to compete effectively. I do think that it is going to be become increasingly the case where, with the consolidation of customers and their desire to eliminate large numbers of vendors and consolidate themselves, that the one-stop shop provider -- and not only are we're going to be able to do that in Spine business. We're doing that across musculoskeletal service lines as a whole. And I think that you'll see a continuing trend towards that within the marketplace, and it obviously plays to our advantage."

But look, at the end of the day, the population globally is aging. The need for these procedures is growing, that's unmistakable. This is, in the case of large joints, the only solution for someone in advanced stage osteoarthritis, and these procedures work. And that underlying demand is just not going to change. You can forecast out the numbers, see how that percentage of the population that's aging in a period where they're more likely to need a total joint is going to continue to grow for years to come. And so to us, that's the basis upon which we make our business decisions, as opposed to bumping around from 1 quarter to the next with sort of minor variations in growth rates. The dynamics are quite stable. The union -- or the unit demand, the pricing environment that we've been in, and to the extent that there is going to be any change in the United States market, for example, the movement towards a more value-based environment for reimbursement, we're going to have the broadest of service offerings and the most cohesive capability to come in and partner more deeply with our customers to help them address their needs across that episode of care. So we like the operating environment."

The concept of that program, as you'll recall, Kyle, is helping patients' sick knee. And if you think about that, whether it's that particular setting or the broader movement towards value-based reimbursement, these are all driven by the same trends: Aging population, these providers of the solutions being pushed to do it more cost effectively than ever. And I think that our Z23 program, Signature Solutions are specifically designed to shape that solution. And we've had good success with that program. We're ready to expand that program and do more with it, and it is very integrated into our Signature Solutions offering because it's meeting the same demands that these customers are facing. So it just stands to reason that for the right patient, that the capability to get them in and out of the hospital to avoid the potential of high-risk consequences or readmissions in the form of nosocomial infections that can be more pervasive in an acute care setting, then you ought to be doing those procedures outside the acute care setting. There are many, many patients where you're not going to be able to do that for the foreseeable future. So I think that the providers understand that, that's an opportunity. It's a message that's resonated well with the surgeons. It's a small percentage today. It's going to grow -- I hesitate to predict where that lands. I think that, that really needs to be driven by the way the patients present. And I think that, that's part of the work that needs to be done, is to very carefully refine which patients are qualified for that setting and those that aren't. But again, the data that we're going to be able to generate over a reasonable time period with our Signature Solutions effort is going to be part of what allows us to make those informed decisions and to continuously refine the model because it's end-to-end. So we'll be building data in -- through the Z23 program, Signature Solutions, and that's going to allow diagnosis and care pathway decisions to be made on a better-informed basis than those decisions have ever been made in the past."

We've got terrific chances to get after building out the innovation pipeline and executing on that, and I think that, that's going to carry us into 2017 nicely.

And obviously, we had a long period of time between signing and consummating the Biomet deal to do that planning work. But then you're sort of standing by aggressively until the deal closes, and I think our commercial leaders did an outstanding job in the second half of 2015 of executing those plans. And it created some significant opportunities as we appointed leaders then to sort out the product portfolio and the customers being covered by reps to start to build greater emphasis in the nonlarge-joint categories, where appropriate, and we took advantage of that opportunity. And then we started to build the pipeline of recruiting of new reps that would be able to fully exploit the opportunities, particularly in -- outside of large joints. And so that pipeline got built towards the end of last year. Those positions are brought on, and obviously, it takes time for those reps to become productive. And so I think in Q2, you're just seeing the early signs of that productivity. It's going to continue in second half of the year, but this is going to be a dynamic that is forever for us with the critical mass, scale, competitiveness of our portfolios across all product categories in our innovation pipeline and capability, to make a difference with service lines, like Signature Solutions going forward, integrating all this. We're going to continuously build out that sales force, and that's going to be a real strength of the organization going forward on a global basis. And so the local leaders are going to make these decisions as to what level of specialization they need because they're closest to the opportunity and the customers and where it makes sense because it's a less populated environment or the call point is overlapping, then we'll have the same rep going after that business to the extent that the call point is more separated. And it's a highly populated area, you should expect to see us with more specialization in those markets. But we've made tremendous progress in this regard in both the first and the second quarter, and we'll continue to execute that plan going forward.

Dan will then provide additional financial details and discuss our updated guidance. 
Before I launch into these topics, however, I'd like to take a moment to reflect on the 1 year anniversary of the formation of Zimmer Biomet. Throughout this past year, we've continued to be guided by our long-standing value-creation framework which focuses on investing for sustainable growth, driving operational efficiencies and redeploying capital in a disciplined manner. We've successfully integrated and leveraged the combined expertise and cultures of the 2 organizations while executing on a highly complementary portfolio of technologies, services and solutions. Our financial results have provided the tangible proof points that Zimmer Biomet reflects our initial vision of an ideal fit. 
Our company has reached an important inflection point, having successfully reestablished top line momentum by beginning to capture the promise of the attractive cross-selling opportunities inherent in our merger in addition to successfully delivering on our synergy commitments. We are now poised to move forward with our plans, which include the acceleration of our commercial and innovation strategic priorities. These priorities are designed to further enhance and sustain our growth well into the future. 
Consistent with this progress, Zimmer Biomet generated solid revenue acceleration in the second quarter, again above the top end of our expectations, further validating our strategies to achieve above-market revenue growth by the close of 2016. Our steady advance towards this goal demonstrates the increasing productivity and focused execution of our commercial organization. And for the balance of the year, we'll continue to exploit the opportunities presented by our differentiated musculoskeletal portfolio. 
Turning briefly to market conditions. In the second quarter, the demand across the globe for musculoskeletal solutions continued to grow at a steady pace, in line with our expectations and consistent with recent quarters. With regard to pricing, we experienced negative price pressure of 1.2% in the quarter, consistent with broader trend throughout 2016. 
Against this backdrop, Zimmer Biomet delivered second quarter consolidated net sales of $1.93 billion, which represented an increase of 65.6% on a reported basis and 4.5% adjusted compared to the prior year quarter. 
We increased sales in each of our segments, with Americas up 3.6%; Europe, Middle East and Africa region growing 4.5%; and the Asia Pacific region delivering 8.2% growth. 
Within our consolidated results, Zimmer Biomet's knee category grew sales 5.0% the second quarter, reflecting positive volume and mix of 6.5% and negative price of 1.5%. Our U.S. knee business continued to deliver solid results, which contributed to a sales increase of 3.0% in the Americas. We also achieved strong revenues in markets across the Asia Pacific and Europe, Middle East and Africa regions, where we increased sales over the prior year period by 9.6% and 7.1%, respectively. 
As anticipated, the cross-selling opportunities of our market-leading knee portfolio continued to drive growth, led by the ongoing sales performance of premium reconstructive systems, such as our flagship Persona The Personalized Knee System and the Vanguard 360 Revision Knee System. 
In addition, during the quarter, we marked the 40th anniversary of the launch of the Oxford Partial Knee, the most widely used and clinically proven partial knee replacement in the world, which has been used in more than 600,000 surgeries across 50 countries and featured in more than 280 published studies. 
And as part of our commitment to continuous product innovation, during the second quarter, we released a series of next-generation enhancements to our OSS Orthopedic Salvage System, advancing this unique solution for salvage revision procedures and oncologic applications. As we look to the second half of the year, we'll further leverage the commercial opportunities of our knee portfolio for the ongoing growth of this important category. 
Turning to our market-leading hip business. We accelerated consolidated sales growth to 3.2% the second quarter, including positive volume and mix of 5.4% and negative price of 2.2%. Hip revenues grew 8.1% in the Asia Pacific region; 3.6% in Europe, Middle East and Africa; and 1.5% in the Americas compared to the prior year quarter. 
The second quarter progress of our hip category was led by our innovative Taperloc Complete system and our comprehensive revision portfolio, in addition to our Vitamin E-infused advanced bearing materials, VIVACIT-E and E1. During the quarter, our sales channel focused on increasing the adoption of differentiated recent additions to our hip offerings, including the Echo Bi-Metric Microplasty stem and the Arcos One-Piece Revision system. 
We also continued to gain traction with the G7 Dual Mobility Construct. This unique solution is designed to achieve stability with optimal range of motion and is compatible with the full line of fixation options within our G7 Acetabular System. 
We plan to further deliver hip growth in the second half of the year, backed by a diversified portfolio of solutions that address a broad spectrum of clinical challenges and surgical approaches. 
Importantly, we increased our S.E.T. revenues by an impressive 7.2% in the second quarter, supported by the positive U.S. performances of every business within this category. In surgical, our sales were again strengthened by our offerings for the OR suite, led by the Transposal Fluid Waste Management System and the A.T.S. Automatic Tourniquet System. 
From our sports medicine portfolio, we continued to deliver attractive growth with our joint-preserving Gel-One hyaluronan injection and the Subchondroplasty Procedure, in addition to a solid initial quarter of results for our Quattro Link knotless anchors, and afferfic [ph] system from our recently expanded line of advanced soft tissue repair and reconstruction solutions. 
Within our market-leading extremities business, we've been pleased with the ongoing sales performance of our Comprehensive Total Shoulder system and the Nexel Total Elbow. And through the increased productivity of our trauma commercial teams, we sequentially improved our trauma performance with steady sales of our AFFIXUS Hip Fracture Nail System and the Natural Nail system. Going forward, we plan to continue accelerating growth in our S.E.T. category as part of our global strategy for a diversified and sustainable revenue platform. 
Zimmer Biomet Dental sales decreased 0.8% in the second quarter, representing a stabilizing sequential performance that has set the stage for expected growth in the second half of the year. In addition to benefiting from the increased harmonization of our dental commercial channel, during the second quarter, we successfully resolved a supply disruption associated with a voluntary product action that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2015. 
We also continued to improve sales across our dental portfolio, including our market-leading regenerative solutions. 
From our dental commercial pipeline, we've been pleased with the ongoing U.S. launch of the 3i T3 short implant, designed for challenging vertical grafting procedures, and the 3.1-millimeter diameter aesthetic implant for a narrow interior sites. We will remain focused on the improvement of our dental business in the second half of the year, leveraging our scale, expertise and competitive portfolio of potential solutions. 
Our Spine, craniomaxillofacial and thoracic category increased sales 1.4% over the prior year quarter. Our craniomaxillofacial and thoracic team continues to grow sales of our recently launched RibFix Blu System and Omnimax MMF System, while delivering strong results with our TraumaOne and SternaLock Blu systems. 
In our Spine business, we continued to deliver steady revenues with the Polaris spinal system, as well as The Timberline Lateral Fusion System, an offering which we enhanced during the quarter with valuable expansions. Our Spine results were also supported by sales of our recently launched Vitality Spinal Fixation System. 
Going forward, we're well positioned to capture the opportunities resulting from our acquisition of LDR Spine. By joining together with this successful and innovative international spine company, we're enhancing the scale, portfolio and capabilities of our global Spine business, including an immediate leadership position in cervical disc replacement, the fastest-growing segment of the $10 billion spine market. We've also gained a number of valuable new offerings to expand our minimally invasive technologies. 
In addition, earlier this month, we acquired a controlling share of French surgical robotics innovator, Medtech SA, including its ROSA robotics platform for a range of minimally invasive brain, neurological and spinal procedures. This advanced combination of robotics technology with surgical navigation will further diversify our Spine and CMF portfolio as well as bolster our strategy to offer the industry's broadest range of intelligent instrumentation options. Furthermore, we see significant potential to leverage this platform technology for additional anatomical sites in the future. 
Upon acquiring the remaining Medtech shares in the coming months, our integration priorities will focus on building a strong foundation to support the expansion of this platform technology across our musculoskeletal portfolio. We will prioritize future application development and ensure that R&D resources are expanded appropriately. We'll also ensure that key capabilities and support functions, such as manufacturing and quality systems, are built out in a manner that will support our growth plans. 
These and other highly complementary transactions, in combination with the diversified internal pipeline, are accelerating our strategies for delivering sustainable longer-term revenue growth across all musculoskeletal markets. 
The ongoing expansion of our personalized technology, services and solutions also allows us to play a meaningful role in transforming health care by addressing the evolving needs of the sector. To that end, earlier this week, we were pleased to unveil our latest offering: Signature Solutions. This comprehensive suite of clinical services and technologies is designed to assist hospitals and medical practices to seamlessly transition to value-based health care models by maintaining excellent patient outcomes while maximizing procedural and cost efficiencies across the entire episode of care. 
Built on our 9 decades of musculoskeletal expertise, Signature Solutions will combine Zimmer Biomet's established consulting platform with a strategically curated suite of technologies and services that drives improvement across every aspect of the health care value equation. 
We'll initially offer Signature Solutions to musculoskeletal service lines at select academic facilities in the United States, leading the way for a broader release scheduled for 2017. Importantly, we expect the expansion of Signature Solutions to coincide with an increased focus on knee and hip replacement at U.S. facilities participating in Medicare's CJR payment model. Through innovative service-driven offerings such as this, we're deepening our commitment to advancing standards of musculoskeletal care and enhancing our partnerships with health care stakeholders. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Dan, who will continue this discussion in greater detail as well as review our revenue and earnings guidance. Dan?"
264048,373864719,1016400,"Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2016",2016-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, David. I will review our second quarter performance in more detail and then provide additional information related to our second half and full year 2016 sales and earnings guidance. Our total revenues for the second quarter were $1,934,000,00",1277,"Thank you, David. I will review our second quarter performance in more detail and then provide additional information related to our second half and full year 2016 sales and earnings guidance. 
Our total revenues for the second quarter were $1,934,000,000, an increase of 4.5% constant currency compared to the second quarter of 2015 on an adjusted pro forma basis. The net currency impact for the quarter on revenue was not material to consolidated results. 
We had just over one additional billing day in the quarter as compared to the second quarter of 2015, which contributed approximately 190 basis points of growth in the quarter on a consolidated basis. The billing day differences varied by geographic segment, with the Americas and EMEA having 1 and 2 extra billing days, respectively. There was essentially no impact in the Asia Pacific region. 
Our adjusted gross profit margin was 75% for the quarter and 80 basis points lower when compared to the prior year adjusted pro forma results due to the impact of unfavorable foreign currency and price declines. The company's R&D expense was 4.6% of revenue at $88.6 million. 
Adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses were $732 million in the second quarter or 37.8% of sales, which was 220 basis points lower than the comparable period in the prior year on adjusted pro forma basis. SG&A leverage was again driven by our synergy initiatives, partially offset by ongoing investments in our specialized sales forces around the globe as well as additional medical training and education programs. 
We remain on track to deliver cumulative net EBIT merger synergies of $225 million by the end of 2016, which is ahead of our expectations at the time of the merger closing and consistent with our full year guidance. 
In the quarter, the company recorded pretax charges of $430 million in special items primarily related to the Biomet acquisition, including $307 million of noncash amortization and inventory step-up charges as well as integration-related expenses. Adjusted second quarter 2016 figures in the earnings release exclude the impact of these charges. A full reconciliation of reported net earnings to adjusted net earnings is included in this morning's press release. 
Adjusted operating profit in the quarter amounted to approximately $630 million or 32.6% of sales, which was an increase of 160 basis points when compared to the prior year period. Net interest expense and other nonoperating expenses totaled $89.6 million in the quarter. 
Our adjusted net earnings were $407.1 million for the second quarter, an increase of 47% compared to the prior year period. Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 27.8% to $2.02 on 201.9 million weighted average fully diluted shares outstanding. 
Our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 24.7%, which included approximately 70 basis points of benefit from the early adoption of the new tax accounting rules for stock-based compensation. With the early adoption of the new accounting standard, we also revised our Q1 tax rate by 50 basis points, which resulted in an incremental $0.01 to earnings per share in the first quarter. 
Operating cash flow for the quarter amounted to $380 million, which included $101 million of cash expenditures for integration and initiatives related to our synergy program. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $118 million, including $72 million for instruments and $46 million for property, plant and equipment. 
Our free cash flow in the second quarter was approximately $262 million compared to $115 million in the second quarter of 2015 and was in line with our expectations. During the quarter, the company repaid $100 million on our term loan, reflecting $1 billion of debt repayment since the closing of the Biomet transaction 1 year ago. 
I'd like to now review our guidance. I will provide updated revenue and adjusted earnings per share guidance for the full year as well as our expectations for the second half of the year. 
Our guidance reflects continued accelerating sales momentum, consistent with our prior expectations, plus the addition of exciting new technologies, such as the LDR portfolio, which we believe positions us well for sustained above-market growth for years to come. 
For full year 2016, we now estimate revenue to be in a range of $7.68 billion to $7.715 billion or an increase of approximately 28% on a reported basis and 3.0% to 3.5% on an adjusted pro forma basis in each case as compared to the prior year. The adjusted pro forma revenue guidance is inclusive of approximately 100 basis points of contribution related to the LDR transaction. 
We now expect foreign currency translation to decrease revenue in 2016 by approximately 0.5% compared to our previous estimate of 1.0%, with the Japanese yen strengthening against the U.S. dollar partially offset by the weakening British pound. Therefore, organic revenue growth on a constant currency adjusted pro forma basis is now expected to be in a range of 2.5% to 3.0%. Previously, the company estimated full year revenue growth to be in a range of 2.0% to 3.0% on a similar basis. 
Turning to the full year P&L. After updating our assumptions to reflect our recent acquisitions and planned strategic investments as well as foreign currency exchange rates, our full year adjusted diluted earnings per share is now expected to be in a range of $7.90 to $8, the achievement of which would mark our fifth consecutive year of expanded adjusted operating margins. 
Our reported earnings per share are expected to be in a range of $1.50 to $1.75 after getting us back to our year-to-date results and anticipated special items in the second half. Special items are largely associated with noncash amortization, costs incurred to capture net synergy targets and acquisition integration expenses. 
As we look to the second half of the year, revenue growth is expected to be in a range of 4.0% to 5.0% for both the third and fourth quarter, with 1 less billing day in Q4 compared to the prior year, a 150 basis point headwind. 
Foreign exchange is estimated to decrease revenue in both quarters by about 30 basis points. Reported revenue is expected to be in a dollar range of $1,830,000,000 to $1,850,000,000 for the third quarter and $2,010,000,000 to $2,030,000,000 in the fourth quarter. 
Constant currency growth on a day-adjusted basis is expected to be in a range of 4.3% to 5.3% for the third quarter and 5.8% to 6.8% for the fourth quarter. Excluding the impact of the LDR acquisition, constant currency day rate growth is expected to be in a range of 2.5% to 3.5% and 3.5% to 4.5% for Q3 and Q4, respectively. 
Working down the P&L. During the second half of 2016, we expect gross margin to be in a range of 75.0% to 75.7%, consistent with the first half of the year. R&D and SG&A as a percentage of sales are expected to increase from the first half of the year to reflect the recent acquisitions and planned strategic investments. We now estimate R&D expense to be in a range of 4.7% to 5.2% of sales in the second half, and SG&A expense to be in a range of 37.5% to 39.5%. We expect higher expense ratios in Q3 and lower in Q4 to properly reflect seasonality. 
The effective tax rate in the second half of the year is expected to be approximately 25%. 
To wrap up, we expect Q3 adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $1.76 to $1.80 and Q4 to be in a range of $2.11 to $2.17. 
Finally, please note that our guidance does not include any impact from other potential business development transactions or unforeseen events.

Probably more substantial progress sequentially from the first quarter to the second quarter in hips, but that stands to reason relative to some of the product launches that have already come out this year, and we're finding a lot of traction with strengthening our revision line. As we talked about in the past, the Biomet portfolio greatly shores up some of the gaps that we had on the legacy Zimmer side, and the commercial teams are taking advantage of that on the hip side. We probably saw an earlier recovery of the knee business on the U.S. front, and then that was sustained sequentially from Q1 to Q2. So we feel good about the momentum. We have a lot of opportunity going forward, both large-joint categories in the United States. And obviously, these are categories that have performed quite well outside the U.S. for us, particularly the knee business over the course of the last couple of quarters now."

And if Easter hits at a particular point in time and Good Friday gets pushed from Q1, Q2 back and forth from 1 year to the next, that can have some dynamics.

Obviously, across the globe, we compete against a large number of companies, some of whom are taking that segment of the market by way of focus. And if anything, I would tell you that we're better positioned than ever. Because of the Zimmer Biomet combination, we have not only the capability to position our systems at a price point to meet the clinical needs and the demands of customers to match anyone, but we're doing that with clinically proven products that have been out for, in the case of NexGen, 20 years. And our service capabilities, at the same time with our scale, can deliver that product in a cost-efficient way, in a manner that meets the service needs of those customers as well. So nothing new in the way of that announcement. Obviously, we take any launch seriously. We pay a lot of attention to the competitive environment and do that in a very respectful manner because that leads us to running the business in a more confident fashion. But there isn't anything about that particular announcement that we find to be game-changing relative to the marketplace. I would go on, I guess, Craig, to tell you that I think that to the extent that the value-based models are going to become more significant in the U.S. market, and this is the case in some of the OUS markets that we've operated in for a long, long time, look, if someone grabs a product to save a few dollars and ends up with a clinical problem, and remember, that patients at the same time, are becoming much, much more better educated, and their expectations for return to the lifestyle that they have a vision with respect to getting to is better informed than ever. Using the wrong product, ending up with the wrong patient result, a reputational damage, and quite soon, the economic consequences of doing that are going to be dialed in at a much more significant way. So again, proven clinical technologies are going to be more important in the environment that we're going to be operating in rather than less. And I think that whether it's surgeons or hospital administrators, they're going to be making business decisions in accordance with that environment that they're -- in which they're operating."

This is all part of a decade-long effort that we've had underway to offer the marketplace with the broadest array of intelligent instruments. And as we've said all along, we're agnostic as to the form that, that technology takes. But what's important to us is to create value with these technologies, and think about that in 3 key areas: First and foremost is to improve the quality of outcomes; secondly, to ensure that, that technology is efficient and creates value for our customers; and then thirdly, and this is going to become increasingly important in the value-based world that we're going to be operating within, is patient volume capture. And so that means that the clinical outcome can't go backwards. The cost of the technology can't be positioned in a way where it doesn't provide the customer with a return, and it certainly can't prolong OR times or turns of those ORs in a manner that cause the patient volume to decline in that important service line for the customer. So with all of that by way of background, we obviously, in patient-specific instruments, in iASSIST, in eLIBRA, et cetera, and the more traditional navigation have made significant investments and do thousands and thousands of procedures that are supported by those technologies. To the extent that robotics can augment, where it is a value creator, the cases that are being done, then that's an effort that is worth putting forth, and we believe that it will create value. Now this is a technology that is very well advanced. The better part of a couple of decades of effort have gone into it, and it really augments and complements what we've been doing out of our Montréal operations for over a decade, what they've been doing for 2 decades as ORTHOsoft, the navigation of the development of the iASSIST technologies. So very complementary. It will be integrated into those technologies, but it has to create value. And so the Medtech group has done a good job of taking that technology forward, addressing technical challenges that existed when we looked at similar technologies over the last many years, and that's the difference-maker to us. And so it has the potential of being leverageable across other musculoskeletal sites. But obviously at the start point, we'll focus on the current applications and sort of the beginnings of the launch in the spine space and do that in a way where we make sure that we're getting the foundation right to ensure that we don't have hiccups or hit sort of speed bumps as we roll out those technologies and the applications across various anatomical sites. So if you look at Spine specifically, obviously, the success rates, patient satisfaction rates are quite different than knees and hips. And this is one of the things that we can do along with LDR's Mobi-C, along with LDR's minimally invasive technologies and implants to provide a better patient outcome. And so we'll be focused in those areas first. And then over time, to the extent that we can create value with this technology in other areas, you should expect to see those applications get launched as well, Craig."

So we would expect to sustain that level and perhaps pick up the pace even within S.E.T. because we love our opportunities there, and yet we see opportunities in the other product categories just the same. That S.E.T. side, we talked about this at the point of announcing the Biomet combination. And again, these were business units where -- and market subsegments where we had lower share, we had sort of scale challenges and some product gaps. Biomet was in the exact same position, and it really was a complementary fit when you brought those product lines together, the product pipelines together and importantly, the capability, given the competitiveness of that combined portfolio in each of those product categories, to justify building out more specialized sales forces, And I tell you that, that's just now what you're starting to see the benefit of, and that's a big difference maker. So you've got this competitive bag, and historically, organizations that were primarily driven by generalists and are in the future, and you're starting to see good results of this, going to be driven by sales force specialization, where appropriate. So it's going to continue to be a growth engine for us. I think what you'll see is Spine will take that form as we get through the LDR integration as well."

So anything that's nonlarge joint, you should expect some form of specialization, whether those are product specialists or outright direct reps that are focused exclusively on those product categories. And obviously, the product category and the geography will dictate the level of specialization, but they exist today. It was one of the things that we drove, Mike, in the integration early on, is to make critical decisions that would optimize our performance across all these product categories. And since then, we've been adding more specialized reps to each of these categories, and we're up on a net basis substantially in the nonlarge-joint categories. In fact, we're up on a net basis, both Q1 and Q2, on the large joint side, too. So this is just the beginning of driving this momentum, and we're really enthusiastic about what we're seeing."

I think first importantly, as we said in our prepared remarks, with the Biomet integration solidly on track and accelerating revenue growth, that it really does put us in a position to make important strategic investments, and the -- certainly the LDR acquisition being part of that effort. So very excited to have LDR in our Spine portfolio. It's a big opportunity for us to transform our Spine business. As you know, as an independent company, LDR was generating operating losses, which we're absorbing in the second half of the year. And as we eliminate redundancies and integrate the back office, et cetera, we'll grow that business, and that will begin to turn. So as we said at the time of the deal announcement, the transaction is expected to be neutral to net income in 2017. And so for the back half of '16 and the full year of '16, we're delivering on our -- towards the high end of our original EPS guidance while also making strategic investments like LDR; like Medtech; Signature Solutions, which David referred to; on top of specialized sales forces in medical training and education. So those are the types of investments that we're able to make while delivering on our EPS, and we think that's the smart investment to make it and really positions us well going into 2017 with that accelerating top line."

It just feels like if this momentum continues over the next 2 quarters, you should exceed the top end of your organic guidance range. And I guess I'm trying to take your qualitative momentum commentary with the guidance. It sounds like you think there's a lot of momentum. I think if that carries forward, you do better than the top end of guidance. Is this just sort of baby steps?

It matters in your ability to continuously reinvest in the business in research and development and avoid product gaps and have a nice mix of sort of the more me-too oriented products so you don't have a hole as well as some of the things that are more aggressively going after addressing unmet needs. And so the Medtech acquisition would be an example of the latter, the Mobi-C products within the LDR portfolio would be a good example of the latter. So we're absolutely in a position where we're going to be able to compete effectively. I do think that it is going to be become increasingly the case where, with the consolidation of customers and their desire to eliminate large numbers of vendors and consolidate themselves, that the one-stop shop provider -- and not only are we're going to be able to do that in Spine business.

This is, in the case of large joints, the only solution for someone in advanced stage osteoarthritis, and these procedures work. And that underlying demand is just not going to change. You can forecast out the numbers, see how that percentage of the population that's aging in a period where they're more likely to need a total joint is going to continue to grow for years to come. And so to us, that's the basis upon which we make our business decisions, as opposed to bumping around from 1 quarter to the next with sort of minor variations in growth rates. The dynamics are quite stable. The union -- or the unit demand, the pricing environment that we've been in, and to the extent that there is going to be any change in the United States market, for example, the movement towards a more value-based environment for reimbursement, we're going to have the broadest of service offerings and the most cohesive capability to come in and partner more deeply with our customers to help them address their needs across that episode of care.

The concept of that program, as you'll recall, Kyle, is helping patients' sick knee. And if you think about that, whether it's that particular setting or the broader movement towards value-based reimbursement, these are all driven by the same trends: Aging population, these providers of the solutions being pushed to do it more cost effectively than ever. And I think that our Z23 program, Signature Solutions are specifically designed to shape that solution. And we've had good success with that program. We're ready to expand that program and do more with it, and it is very integrated into our Signature Solutions offering because it's meeting the same demands that these customers are facing. So it just stands to reason that for the right patient, that the capability to get them in and out of the hospital to avoid the potential of high-risk consequences or readmissions in the form of nosocomial infections that can be more pervasive in an acute care setting, then you ought to be doing those procedures outside the acute care setting. There are many, many patients where you're not going to be able to do that for the foreseeable future. So I think that the providers understand that, that's an opportunity. It's a message that's resonated well with the surgeons. It's a small percentage today. It's going to grow -- I hesitate to predict where that lands. I think that, that really needs to be driven by the way the patients present. And I think that, that's part of the work that needs to be done, is to very carefully refine which patients are qualified for that setting and those that aren't. But again, the data that we're going to be able to generate over a reasonable time period with our Signature Solutions effort is going to be part of what allows us to make those informed decisions and to continuously refine the model because it's end-to-end. So we'll be building data in -- through the Z23 program, Signature Solutions, and that's going to allow diagnosis and care pathway decisions to be made on a better-informed basis than those decisions have ever been made in the past."

But then you're sort of standing by aggressively until the deal closes, and I think our commercial leaders did an outstanding job in the second half of 2015 of executing those plans. And it created some significant opportunities as we appointed leaders then to sort out the product portfolio and the customers being covered by reps to start to build greater emphasis in the nonlarge-joint categories, where appropriate, and we took advantage of that opportunity. And then we started to build the pipeline of recruiting of new reps that would be able to fully exploit the opportunities, particularly in -- outside of large joints. And so that pipeline got built towards the end of last year. Those positions are brought on, and obviously, it takes time for those reps to become productive. And so I think in Q2, you're just seeing the early signs of that productivity. It's going to continue in second half of the year, but this is going to be a dynamic that is forever for us with the critical mass, scale, competitiveness of our portfolios across all product categories in our innovation pipeline and capability, to make a difference with service lines, like Signature Solutions going forward, integrating all this.

And so the local leaders are going to make these decisions as to what level of specialization they need because they're closest to the opportunity and the customers and where it makes sense because it's a less populated environment or the call point is overlapping, then we'll have the same rep going after that business to the extent that the call point is more separated. And it's a highly populated area, you should expect to see us with more specialization in those markets. But we've made tremendous progress in this regard in both the first and the second quarter, and we'll continue to execute that plan going forward.
So with that, I'd like to thank everyone for joining the call today and for your continued interest and support for Zimmer. We look forward to speaking with you on our third quarter conference call.

This morning, I'll review our third quarter financial results as well as provide an overview of some of our new technologies and solutions and the focused actions we're taking to drive sustainable growth. Dan will then provide additional financial details and discuss our updated guidance. 
Zimmer Biomet's third quarter revenue performance was highlighted by the acceleration of our S.E.T. category and ongoing strength in our Asia Pacific region. However, consolidated sales were below our expectations on weaker-than-anticipated results from our large joint and dental categories. Overall, broad demand for our differentiated portfolio remained high throughout the quarter, particularly for our focused cross-sell products. 
Variable commercial performances by our sales teams were in part caused by unanticipated supply constraints related to our transitioning supply chain infrastructure. This resulted in shortfalls of needed implants and additional instrument sets to fully exploit sales opportunities in key product categories. In response to this challenge, we've accelerated work to enhance certain aspects of our supply chain infrastructure as we harmonize and optimize our sourcing, manufacturing and quality management systems. Through these efforts, we expect to improve our demand fulfillment in the coming months. 
As a consequence of these supply constraints, we project fourth quarter sales results to be similar to those of the third quarter. However, as we look ahead, we remain confident in our ability to successfully reaccelerate our revenue growth in 2017. 
As I mentioned, demand for our extensive portfolio of differentiated and clinically proven musculoskeletal technologies, solutions and services has never been stronger. Our global sales organizations remain stable and have, in fact, achieved a third consecutive quarter of net personnel additions. These teams remain focused on delivering high-quality, personalized solutions to our customers and their patients.
To that end, during the quarter, we consummated a number of strategic external development transactions to expand our musculoskeletal portfolio and capabilities while continuing to deliver leveraged earnings per share. By joining together with LDR Spine in mid-July, we now possess a leading position in the attractive global market for cervical disc replacement. Additionally, our recently completed acquisition of Medtech SA provides us with current brain and spine robotic technology and positions us to identify and develop additional applications for the ROSA robotics minimally invasive platform. This differentiated technology supports our strategy to offer the industry's most comprehensive range of intelligent instrumentation options. 
Also during the quarter, we acquired new clinical solutions that extend our reach across the continuum of care, spanning from state-of-the-art 3D range of motion simulation software to an innovative telerehabilitation platform. These portfolio additions are designed to support health care providers in personalizing musculoskeletal treatment. Importantly, these assets further strengthen our Zimmer Biomet Signature Solutions offering, which is designed to assist hospitals and medical practices to seamlessly transition to value-based health care models. 
With our end-to-end clinical services, proprietary technologies and analytical tools, we're enabling health care providers to maximize productivity and patient engagement across the entire episode of care. As we have previously communicated, the rollout of Zimmer Biomet's Signature Solutions comes in an opportune time, when an increasing number of health care providers are striving to comply with bundled payment models by placing a greater emphasis on the quality and cost-effectiveness of knee and hip replacement service lines.
Before I review the performance of each of our sales categories, I'd like to comment on third quarter market conditions. We noted overall global market stability during the quarter. In addition, we believe that while the U.S. market demonstrated some softness during the summer months, it strengthened toward the end of the quarter. With regard to pricing, we experienced negative 1.9% of pressure, which was in line with expectations and consistent with trends in recent years. 
Against this backdrop, Zimmer Biomet delivered third quarter consolidated net sales of $1.83 billion. This performance represented 3.5% of constant-currency growth over the prior year quarter, of which the recently acquired LDR Holding Corporation contributed 190 basis points. Embedded [ph] within these results, we achieved solid 6.4% top line
[Audio Gap]
Knee business was flat on a global basis in the third quarter, reflecting positive volume and mix of 1.9% and negative price of 2%. Our 2.6% sales growth in the Asia Pacific region was offset by our results in the Americas, where sales decreased by 0.9%. Our knee revenues increased by 0.3% in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region as compared to the prior year quarter. 
Despite continuing attractive growth rates during the quarter for Persona, the personalized knee system, our sales execution on this leading cross-selling opportunity was limited by the supply issues I just mentioned. The Oxford Partial Knee also delivered solid sales results during the quarter. 
Additionally, we were pleased to announce the commercial launch of our Vanguard individualized design total knee replacement system. This first-of-its-kind total knee construct supports our soft tissue preserved -- preservation focus and market leadership with independent medial and lateral polyethylene bearings that simplify soft tissue preservation and balance. We're committed to driving focused execution in support of stronger knee results in future quarters with this exceptional portfolio.
Third quarter hip sales grew by 0.6%, reflecting positive volume and mix of 3.0% and negative price of 2.4%. We grew revenues by a solid 5.9% in the Asia Pacific region while sales were flat in the Americas. Hip sales decreased by 1.4% in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region compared to the prior year quarter. 
Within this overall performance, we continued to drive the sales growth of our Taperloc complete system and Arcos modular femoral revision system as well as offerings that leverage Zimmer Biomet's proprietary vitamin E-infused advanced bearing materials. We were also pleased with the commercial traction of the recently introduced G7 Dual Mobility Construct. We're well positioned to build on these successes in future periods by leveraging the industry's most comprehensive range of hip solutions.
Turning to our S.E.T. category. We achieved a healthy 7.8% increase in global revenues, supported by solid results in all geographic segments. In our surgical business, we've been pleased with the ongoing progress of our growing specialized sales channel and the commercial success of our diversified offerings for the OR suite. Our sports medicine results were once again driven by our proprietary Subchondroplasty Procedure and Gel-One cross-linked hyaluronic injection. 
Similarly, our extremities business continued to leverage our market-leading upper extremities portfolio, including the comprehensive total shoulder system and the Nexel Total Elbow. Lastly, we delivered ongoing improvement in trauma with third quarter sales being led by our AFFIXUS Hip Fracture Nail System and the NCB Plating System. We expect that our S.E.T. product category will remain an integral component of our sustainable revenue growth platform, with innovative clinical solutions that meet the needs of surgeons, patients and health care institutions.
Dental sales decreased by 7.6%, which was below our expectations. Nonetheless, we achieved good performances from the 3i T3 implant system and the recently introduced  Eztetic implant system. Looking forward, we expect to more fully capitalize on this and additional future product launches as we enhance our multitiered offerings to address an evolving dental marketplace. 
Our spine craniomaxillofacial and thoracic category sales increased by 23.9% on a constant-currency basis in the third quarter, which represented approximately 1% organic growth. Following our recent LDR acquisition, we're making good progress with the initial phases of integration throughout our spine commercial organization. Among our spine offerings, we've been encouraged by the sustained revenue performance of the Mobi-C cervical disc prosthesis. Last week, we announced that Mobi-C is now the most widely covered device for 1- and 2-level cervical disc replacement by commercial health insurers in the United States. 
In addition, we also continued to deliver growth with the Vitality spinal fixation system. We're well positioned to continue to bolster the competitiveness of our spine business with an expanded portfolio and strengthening sales channel.
With regard to our craniomaxillofacial and thoracic business, we continue to be pleased with the ongoing strong sales growth of the SternaLock Blu and SternaLock 360 primary closure systems as well as the Omnimax MMF System. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Dan, who will continue this discussion in greater detail as well as review our updated revenue and earnings guidance. Dan?"
264048,404021255,1067105,"Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 31, 2016",2016-10-31,"Earnings Calls","Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, David. I will review our third quarter performance in more detail and then provide additional information related to fourth quarter and full year 2016 sales and earnings guidance. Our total revenues for the third quarter were $1,833,000,000,",1293,"Thank you, David. I will review our third quarter performance in more detail and then provide additional information related to fourth quarter and full year 2016 sales and earnings guidance. 
Our total revenues for the third quarter were $1,833,000,000, an increase of 3.5% adjusted constant currency when compared to the third quarter of 2015 and 1.6% excluding the contribution from the LDR acquisition. The net currency impact for the quarter was a positive 60 basis points or $11 million on consolidated revenue results. We had an immaterial difference in billing days in the quarter as compared to the third quarter of 2015.
Third quarter revenue was below our expectations primarily due to execution issues within our large joint supply chain, which led to a degradation in order fulfillment rate late in the quarter as well as our performance in dental. As noted by David, customer demand was strong in the quarter but certain aspects of our supply chain integration impacted our ability to effectively respond to shifting product mix, most notably within our knee and hip portfolios. As a consequence, we underestimated demand for certain key cross-sell brands within our existing customer base, leading to a depletion of our safety stocks and also affecting our ability to capitalize on new customer opportunities.
We are working diligently to enhance our supply chain processes and execution, particularly in the areas of demand forecasting, global inventory tracking and asset deployment systems while we replenish our safety stock levels. However, these issues have some carryover effect into the fourth quarter, which I will address shortly in the context of our updated Q4 guidance.
Turning now to the balance of our third quarter results. Our adjusted gross profit margin was 75.1% for the quarter and 110 basis points lower when compared to the prior year due mainly to the impact of ASP declines as well as lower foreign currency hedge gains, which we have been recently highlighting. 
The company's R&D expense was 5.2% of revenue at $95.6 million [ph], reflecting investments from our recently acquired businesses as well as our Zimmer Biomet Signature Solutions program. Adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses were $727.7 million in the third quarter or 39.7% of sales, which was 40 basis points higher than the comparable period in the prior year. 
As anticipated, ongoing investments in our specialized sales forces and medical training and education programs, combined with the inclusion of our recent acquisitions, offset the benefit of SG&A cost synergies in the quarter. We remain on track to deliver cumulative net EBIT merger synergies of $225 million by the end of 2016. In addition to the Biomet synergies, we are also laying the foundational elements for synergy capture in 2017 from our recent acquisitions.
In the quarter, the company recorded pretax charges of $355 million in special items, primarily related to the Biomet and LDR acquisitions, including $181 million of noncash amortization and inventory step-up charges as well as approximately $140 [ph] million of acquisition- and integration-related expenses. Adjusted third quarter 2016 figures in the earnings release exclude the impact of these charges. A full reconciliation of reported net earnings to adjusted net earnings is included in this morning's press release.
Adjusted operating profit in the quarter amounted to approximately $553 million or 30.2% of sales, which was a decrease of 200 basis points when compared to the prior year period due to the reduction in gross margin as well as expected impacts from acquisitions. Net interest expense and other nonoperating expense totaled $94.6 million. Adjusted net earnings were $362.4 million for the third quarter, an increase of 7.1% compared to the prior year period. Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 9.1% to $1.79 on 202.9 million weighted average fully diluted shares outstanding.
Our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 21.1%, which reflects a year-to-date true-up to recognize the tax benefit associated with the noted product mix shifts coming from tax-efficient supply chain jurisdictions as well as certain other items. Our year-to-date adjusted effective tax rate is 24%.
Operating cash flow for the quarter amounted to $353 million, which included $161 million of cash expenditures for acquisition costs, integration activities and initiatives related to our synergy program. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $150 million, which included $94 million for instruments and $56 million for property, plant and equipment. Our free cash flow in the third quarter was approximately $202 million compared to $16 million in the third quarter of 2015. Ongoing working capital initiatives and improvements are expected to keep the company on track with full year cash flow generation of approximately $1.1 billion.
During the quarter, the company repaid $200 million on our term loan, reflecting $700 million of debt repayment since the beginning of this year. Additionally, during the quarter, the company consummated its new 5-year $1.5 billion multicurrency senior credit facility, along with a new $750 million term loan to finance the LDR transaction. As a result, gross debt increased by $550 million in the quarter.
I'd like now to review our guidance. As we look to the fourth quarter, revenue growth is expected to be in a range of 1.6% to 2.6%. Foreign exchange is estimated to decrease revenue by approximately 30 basis points. Therefore, reported revenue is expected to be in a range of $1,960,000,000 to $1,980,000,000. Fourth quarter constant-currency growth on a day adjusted basis is expected to be in a range of 3.3% to 4.3% or 1.0% to 2.0% excluding the contribution from LDR. 
On a similar basis, the company had previously estimated revenue growth for the quarter in a range of 5.8% to 6.8% or 3.5% to 4.5% excluding LDR. As a reminder, we have 1 less billing day as compared to the prior year. Our fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share on a fully diluted basis is now expected to be in a range of $2.08 to $2.13.
Turning to the full year 2016. We now estimate revenue to be in a range of $7,630,000,000 to $7,650,000,000 or an increase of approximately 27% on a reported basis or 2.4% to 2.7% on an adjusted pro forma basis in each case as compared to the prior year. The adjusted pro forma revenue guidance range is inclusive of approximately 110 basis points of contribution related to the LDR transaction.
We now expect foreign currency translation to decrease full year revenue in 2016 by approximately 30 basis points compared to our previous estimate of 50 basis points, with the Japanese yen strengthening against the U.S. dollar and a stabilized euro partially offset by the weakening British pound. Therefore, full year revenue growth excluding the impact of the LDR acquisition on a constant-currency adjusted pro forma basis is now expected to be in a range of 1.65% to 1.9%. Previously, the company estimated full year revenue growth to be in a range of 2.5% to 3.0% on a similar basis.
Turning to the full year P&L. After updating our assumptions to reflect our recent performance, acquisitions, lower expected tax rate as well as foreign currency exchange rates and the associated operating margin implications, our full year adjusted diluted earnings per share is now expected to be in a range of $7.90 to $7.95, an increase of approximately 15% over the prior year. Our full year reported earnings per share are expected to be in a range of $1.50 to $1.60 after giving effect to our year-to-date results and anticipated special items in the fourth quarter. Special items are largely associated with noncash amortization, costs incurred to capture net synergy targets and acquisition integration expenses. Finally, please note that our guidance does not include any impact from other potential business development transactions or unforeseen events. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to David."

And I think, Bob, the manifestation was really as the quarter progressed, and late in the quarter, the signs became clear that we had a pretty significant product mix with the lack of visibility on a forward basis that allowed our supply chain to respond. Obviously, as we fully integrate on the operations front, we're going to have a much more agile supply chain and be able to respond to these kinds of demands in a much shorter time period. As we are in our natural state now, we just did not have the ability or the foresight. So part of this is forecasting systems. Part of it is just operational execution and lead times for these products but primarily driven by the large joint demand. If you think about the cross-sell product categories, you're going to be aligned with the biggest opportunities that we have. And probably on the forecasting side, the most significant underestimation was the demand for those same products with existing customers. And so it caused us to have to step back, make sure that we're redoubling our efforts to service existing customers. And as we've referenced, that took away from some of the offensive opportunities that we have. But please don't construe that to be a lack of demand. We know that we have significant opportunities to gain competitive accounts and business. And as we restore the supply chain, we'll get after those opportunities and reaccelerate our top line momentum."

The supply chain is extraordinarily complex. However, importantly, we do have new tools coming online beginning this quarter with integrated global inventory, data warehouses, which did not exist. That's part of the visibility fix that we lacked. We had some interim processes in place that, in hindsight, were not as robust as we needed them to be. We also have integrated demand planning tools and production planning tools coming online next quarter.

That is in user acceptance training as we speak, and so we expect that to come online in the coming weeks. That immediately gives us the type of global visibility to finished goods inventory levels around the U.S. and around the world, that's critical. So that comes online in the coming weeks. So I think we're very low risk of that going poorly based on the testing that's been done today. The integrated demand planning tools come online shortly after the new year. And based on the learnings over the past few months, needless to say, a lot of focus on the process for that and then the deployment of these tools. We're deploying a proven tool. So confident that we're going to be able to get that up and running without a glitch. Importantly, over the past month, we've significantly ramped up production levels. But given lead times from vendors and production lead times, it just takes time to build inventory and replenish those safety stock levels. But all of the above, we're aggressively dealing with and have been for the past several weeks."

We take the form of much broader and deeper partnerships with the hospital customers, and I would tell you the discussions that we've had, which to date have been focused primarily on large academic institutions, have been very, very positive. So we would enter into a deep partnership that could include risk-sharing in an appropriate manner to optimize the quality of care for patients and as well, address the economic pressures of that are on these customers as they get transitioned over to a more value-based system. To do that well, obviously, it requires an end-to-end management of the episode of care. And that's where the patient engagement tools become so important. Rehab is important, education, patient, surgeon communications and then obviously, a really bright light has been shining as of late because of CJR on the post-discharge costs that are incurred. And that's telerehabilitation and leveraging technologies that lead to the  better patient outcome but do that in a cost-effective way can become so meaningful. So that product portfolio across the continuum of care, including these services and solutions, including our couple of decades of experience through our Accelero consulting services that help lean out processes and ensure that the quality of care is raised and it's done efficiently and throughput is driven through that -- through the systems is what Signature Solutions is all about. And as I said, it's a message that's really resonating. I think that we're in a unique position as we participate in over 1.5 million procedures across the globe on just the large joint side alone, to understand what best practices can be transferred from one institution to another. And then ultimately, what the appropriate structure on an end-to-end basis, we're going to be able to, along with our hospital customers, draw data that will lead to continuous improvements and refinements of how the care is delivered. So we love the opportunity. We think that we can be a big part of the solution for the hospitals going forward, and the deeper partnerships in the Zimmer Biomet Signature Solutions is the umbrella that allows us to bring those solutions to the customers."

This morning, I'll review our third quarter financial results as well as provide an overview of some of our new technologies and solutions and the focused actions we're taking to drive sustainable growth. Dan will then provide additional financial details and discuss our updated guidance. 
Zimmer Biomet's third quarter revenue performance was highlighted by the acceleration of our S.E.T. category and ongoing strength in our Asia Pacific region. However, consolidated sales were below our expectations on weaker-than-anticipated results from our large joint and dental categories. Overall, broad demand for our differentiated portfolio remained high throughout the quarter, particularly for our focused cross-sell products. 
Variable commercial performances by our sales teams were in part caused by unanticipated supply constraints related to our transitioning supply chain infrastructure. This resulted in shortfalls of needed implants and additional instrument sets to fully exploit sales opportunities in key product categories. In response to this challenge, we've accelerated work to enhance certain aspects of our supply chain infrastructure as we harmonize and optimize our sourcing, manufacturing and quality management systems. Through these efforts, we expect to improve our demand fulfillment in the coming months. 
As a consequence of these supply constraints, we project fourth quarter sales results to be similar to those of the third quarter. However, as we look ahead, we remain confident in our ability to successfully reaccelerate our revenue growth in 2017. 
As I mentioned, demand for our extensive portfolio of differentiated and clinically proven musculoskeletal technologies, solutions and services has never been stronger. Our global sales organizations remain stable and have, in fact, achieved a third consecutive quarter of net personnel additions. These teams remain focused on delivering high-quality, personalized solutions to our customers and their patients.
To that end, during the quarter, we consummated a number of strategic external development transactions to expand our musculoskeletal portfolio and capabilities while continuing to deliver leveraged earnings per share. By joining together with LDR Spine in mid-July, we now possess a leading position in the attractive global market for cervical disc replacement. Additionally, our recently completed acquisition of Medtech SA provides us with current brain and spine robotic technology and positions us to identify and develop additional applications for the ROSA robotics minimally invasive platform. This differentiated technology supports our strategy to offer the industry's most comprehensive range of intelligent instrumentation options. 
Also during the quarter, we acquired new clinical solutions that extend our reach across the continuum of care, spanning from state-of-the-art 3D range of motion simulation software to an innovative telerehabilitation platform. These portfolio additions are designed to support health care providers in personalizing musculoskeletal treatment. Importantly, these assets further strengthen our Zimmer Biomet Signature Solutions offering, which is designed to assist hospitals and medical practices to seamlessly transition to value-based health care models. 
With our end-to-end clinical services, proprietary technologies and analytical tools, we're enabling health care providers to maximize productivity and patient engagement across the entire episode of care. As we have previously communicated, the rollout of Zimmer Biomet's Signature Solutions comes in an opportune time, when an increasing number of health care providers are striving to comply with bundled payment models by placing a greater emphasis on the quality and cost-effectiveness of knee and hip replacement service lines.
Before I review the performance of each of our sales categories, I'd like to comment on third quarter market conditions. We noted overall global market stability during the quarter. In addition, we believe that while the U.S. market demonstrated some softness during the summer months, it strengthened toward the end of the quarter. With regard to pricing, we experienced negative 1.9% of pressure, which was in line with expectations and consistent with trends in recent years. 
Against this backdrop, Zimmer Biomet delivered third quarter consolidated net sales of $1.83 billion. This performance represented 3.5% of constant-currency growth over the prior year quarter, of which the recently acquired LDR Holding Corporation contributed 190 basis points. Embedded within these results, we achieved solid 6.4% top line growth in the Asia Pacific region while growing sales in the Americas by 3.7% and by 0.9% in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region.
Zimmer Biomet's knee business was flat on a global basis in the third quarter, reflecting positive volume and mix of 1.9% and negative price of 2%. Our 2.6% sales growth in the Asia Pacific region was offset by our results in the Americas, where sales decreased by 0.9%. Our knee revenues increased by 0.3% in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region as compared to the prior year quarter. 
Despite continuing attractive growth rates during the quarter for Persona, the personalized knee system, our sales execution on this leading cross-selling opportunity was limited by the supply issues I just mentioned. The Oxford Partial Knee also delivered solid sales results during the quarter. 
Additionally, we were pleased to announce the commercial launch of our Vanguard individualized design total knee replacement system. This first-of-its-kind total knee construct supports our soft tissue preserved -- preservation focus and market leadership with independent medial and lateral polyethylene bearings that simplify soft tissue preservation and balance. We're committed to driving focused execution in support of stronger knee results in future quarters with this exceptional portfolio.
Third quarter hip sales grew by 0.6%, reflecting positive volume and mix of 3.0% and negative price of 2.4%. We grew revenues by a solid 5.9% in the Asia Pacific region while sales were flat in the Americas. Hip sales decreased by 1.4% in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region compared to the prior year quarter. 
Within this overall performance, we continued to drive the sales growth of our Taperloc complete system and Arcos modular femoral revision system as well as offerings that leverage Zimmer Biomet's proprietary vitamin E-infused advanced bearing materials. We were also pleased with the commercial traction of the recently introduced G7 Dual Mobility Construct. We're well positioned to build on these successes in future periods by leveraging the industry's most comprehensive range of hip solutions.
Turning to our S.E.T. category. We achieved a healthy 7.8% increase in global revenues, supported by solid results in all geographic segments. In our surgical business, we've been pleased with the ongoing progress of our growing specialized sales channel and the commercial success of our diversified offerings for the OR suite. Our sports medicine results were once again driven by our proprietary Subchondroplasty Procedure and Gel-One cross-linked hyaluronic injection. 
Similarly, our extremities business continued to leverage our market-leading upper extremities portfolio, including the comprehensive total shoulder system and the Nexel Total Elbow. Lastly, we delivered ongoing improvement in trauma with third quarter sales being led by our AFFIXUS Hip Fracture Nail System and the NCB Plating System. We expect that our S.E.T. product category will remain an integral component of our sustainable revenue growth platform, with innovative clinical solutions that meet the needs of surgeons, patients and health care institutions.
Dental sales decreased by 7.6%, which was below our expectations. Nonetheless, we achieved good performances from the 3i T3 implant system and the recently introduced  Eztetic implant system. Looking forward, we expect to more fully capitalize on this and additional future product launches as we enhance our multitiered offerings to address an evolving dental marketplace. 
Our spine craniomaxillofacial and thoracic category sales increased by 23.9% on a constant-currency basis in the third quarter, which represented approximately 1% organic growth. Following our recent LDR acquisition, we're making good progress with the initial phases of integration throughout our spine commercial organization. Among our spine offerings, we've been encouraged by the sustained revenue performance of the Mobi-C cervical disc prosthesis. Last week, we announced that Mobi-C is now the most widely covered device for 1- and 2-level cervical disc replacement by commercial health insurers in the United States. 
In addition, we also continued to deliver growth with the Vitality spinal fixation system. We're well positioned to continue to bolster the competitiveness of our spine business with an expanded portfolio and strengthening sales channel.
With regard to our craniomaxillofacial and thoracic business, we continue to be pleased with the ongoing strong sales growth of the SternaLock Blu and SternaLock 360 primary closure systems as well as the Omnimax MMF System. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Dan, who will continue this discussion in greater detail as well as review our updated revenue and earnings guidance. Dan?"
264048,404021255,1067179,"Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 31, 2016",2016-10-31,"Earnings Calls","Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, David. I will review our third quarter performance in more detail and then provide additional information related to fourth quarter and full year 2016 sales and earnings guidance. Our total revenues for the third quarter were $1,833,000,000,",1291,"Thank you, David. I will review our third quarter performance in more detail and then provide additional information related to fourth quarter and full year 2016 sales and earnings guidance. 
Our total revenues for the third quarter were $1,833,000,000, an increase of 3.5% adjusted constant currency when compared to the third quarter of 2015 and 1.6% excluding the contribution from the LDR acquisition. The net currency impact for the quarter was a positive 60 basis points or $11 million on consolidated revenue results. We had an immaterial difference in billing days in the quarter as compared to the third quarter of 2015.
Third quarter revenue was below our expectations primarily due to execution issues within our large joint supply chain, which led to a degradation in order fulfillment rate late in the quarter as well as our performance in dental. As noted by David, customer demand was strong in the quarter but certain aspects of our supply chain integration impacted our ability to effectively respond to shifting product mix, most notably within our knee and hip portfolios. As a consequence, we underestimated demand for certain key cross-sell brands within our existing customer base, leading to a depletion of our safety stocks and also affecting our ability to capitalize on new customer opportunities.
We are working diligently to enhance our supply chain processes and execution, particularly in the areas of demand forecasting, global inventory tracking and asset deployment systems while we replenish our safety stock levels. However, these issues have some carryover effect into the fourth quarter, which I will address shortly in the context of our updated Q4 guidance.
Turning now to the balance of our third quarter results. Our adjusted gross profit margin was 75.1% for the quarter and 110 basis points lower when compared to the prior year due mainly to the impact of ASP declines as well as lower foreign currency hedge gains, which we have been recently highlighting. 
The company's R&D expense was 5.2% of revenue at $95.6 million, reflecting investments from our recently acquired businesses as well as our Zimmer Biomet Signature Solutions program. Adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses were $727.7 million in the third quarter or 39.7% of sales, which was 40 basis points higher than the comparable period in the prior year. 
As anticipated, ongoing investments in our specialized sales forces and medical training and education programs, combined with the inclusion of our recent acquisitions, offset the benefit of SG&A cost synergies in the quarter. We remain on track to deliver cumulative net EBIT merger synergies of $225 million by the end of 2016. In addition to the Biomet synergies, we are also laying the foundational elements for synergy capture in 2017 from our recent acquisitions.
In the quarter, the company recorded pretax charges of $355 million in special items, primarily related to the Biomet and LDR acquisitions, including $181 million of noncash amortization and inventory step-up charges as well as approximately $140 million of acquisition- and integration-related expenses. Adjusted third quarter 2016 figures in the earnings release exclude the impact of these charges. A full reconciliation of reported net earnings to adjusted net earnings is included in this morning's press release.
Adjusted operating profit in the quarter amounted to approximately $553 million or 30.2% of sales, which was a decrease of 200 basis points when compared to the prior year period due to the reduction in gross margin as well as expected impacts from acquisitions. Net interest expense and other nonoperating expense totaled $94.6 million. Adjusted net earnings were $362.4 million for the third quarter, an increase of 7.1% compared to the prior year period. Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 9.1% to $1.79 on 202.9 million weighted average fully diluted shares outstanding.
Our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 21.1%, which reflects a year-to-date true-up to recognize the tax benefit associated with the noted product mix shifts coming from tax-efficient supply chain jurisdictions as well as certain other items. Our year-to-date adjusted effective tax rate is 24%.
Operating cash flow for the quarter amounted to $353 million, which included $161 million of cash expenditures for acquisition costs, integration activities and initiatives related to our synergy program. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $150 million, which included $94 million for instruments and $56 million for property, plant and equipment. Our free cash flow in the third quarter was approximately $202 million compared to $16 million in the third quarter of 2015. Ongoing working capital initiatives and improvements are expected to keep the company on track with full year cash flow generation of approximately $1.1 billion.
During the quarter, the company repaid $200 million on our term loan, reflecting $700 million of debt repayment since the beginning of this year. Additionally, during the quarter, the company consummated its new 5-year $1.5 billion multicurrency senior credit facility, along with a new $750 million term loan to finance the LDR transaction. As a result, gross debt increased by $550 million in the quarter.
I'd like now to review our guidance. As we look to the fourth quarter, revenue growth is expected to be in a range of 1.6% to 2.6%. Foreign exchange is estimated to decrease revenue by approximately 30 basis points. Therefore, reported revenue is expected to be in a range of $1,960,000,000 to $1,980,000,000. Fourth quarter constant-currency growth on a day adjusted basis is expected to be in a range of 3.3% to 4.3% or 1.0% to 2.0% excluding the contribution from LDR. 
On a similar basis, the company had previously estimated revenue growth for the quarter in a range of 5.8% to 6.8% or 3.5% to 4.5% excluding LDR. As a reminder, we have 1 less billing day as compared to the prior year. Our fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share on a fully diluted basis is now expected to be in a range of $2.08 to $2.13.
Turning to the full year 2016. We now estimate revenue to be in a range of $7,630,000,000 to $7,650,000,000 or an increase of approximately 27% on a reported basis or 2.4% to 2.7% on an adjusted pro forma basis in each case as compared to the prior year. The adjusted pro forma revenue guidance range is inclusive of approximately 110 basis points of contribution related to the LDR transaction.
We now expect foreign currency translation to decrease full year revenue in 2016 by approximately 30 basis points compared to our previous estimate of 50 basis points, with the Japanese yen strengthening against the U.S. dollar and a stabilized euro partially offset by the weakening British pound. Therefore, full year revenue growth excluding the impact of the LDR acquisition on a constant-currency adjusted pro forma basis is now expected to be in a range of 1.65% to 1.9%. Previously, the company estimated full year revenue growth to be in a range of 2.5% to 3.0% on a similar basis.
Turning to the full year P&L. After updating our assumptions to reflect our recent performance, acquisitions, lower expected tax rate as well as foreign currency exchange rates and the associated operating margin implications, our full year adjusted diluted earnings per share is now expected to be in a range of $7.90 to $7.95, an increase of approximately 15% over the prior year. Our full year reported earnings per share are expected to be in a range of $1.50 to $1.60 after giving effect to our year-to-date results and anticipated special items in the fourth quarter. Special items are largely associated with noncash amortization, costs incurred to capture net synergy targets and acquisition integration expenses.

It will take several months to make those corrections. In terms of sizing impact for the quarter, it's not a perfect science, but I would roughly anticipate or estimate that it'd be about 100 basis points of impact due to the supply issues in the third quarter.

And I think, Bob, the manifestation was really as the quarter progressed, and late in the quarter, the signs became clear that we had a pretty significant product mix with the lack of visibility on a forward basis that allowed our supply chain to respond. Obviously, as we fully integrate on the operations front, we're going to have a much more agile supply chain and be able to respond to these kinds of demands in a much shorter time period. As we are in our natural state now, we just did not have the ability or the foresight. So part of this is forecasting systems. Part of it is just operational execution and lead times for these products but primarily driven by the large joint demand. If you think about the cross-sell product categories, you're going to be aligned with the biggest opportunities that we have. And probably on the forecasting side, the most significant underestimation was the demand for those same products with existing customers. And so it caused us to have to step back, make sure that we're redoubling our efforts to service existing customers. And as we've referenced, that took away from some of the offensive opportunities that we have. But please don't construe that to be a lack of demand. We know that we have significant opportunities to gain competitive accounts and business. And as we restore the supply chain, we'll get after those opportunities and reaccelerate our top line momentum."

The development of any applications for us, Matt, on the minimally invasive technologies and soft tissue preserving technologies and the broader portfolio of intelligent instrumentation is going to be driven by proven clinical benefit in a cost-efficient way that also addresses the provider's capability on throughput fronts. And so those are really the 3 preconditions. Any anatomical site is fair game for that, but our broad portfolio of intelligent instrumentation puts us in a position to be able to bring the right technologies and converge the right technologies, whether those are preoperative planning, integrating into an interoperative execution set of technologies in an optimized way. So this is a piece of the portfolio. We think it will become an increasingly important piece of the portfolio, but just a piece of the portfolio. And we want to bring the right tool to address the issue in a cost-effective way. So as far as forecasting that out, we would expect to continue to drive the convergence of these innovative technologies in the operating periods to come, Matt, and would give updates at appropriate points when applications are developed and gotten to the point where we're doing limited launches moving towards full launches of those other applications. Right now, the ROSA robotics technology is focused on brain and spine applications."

We take the form of much broader and deeper partnerships with the hospital customers, and I would tell you the discussions that we've had, which to date have been focused primarily on large academic institutions, have been very, very positive. So we would enter into a deep partnership that could include risk sharing in an appropriate manner to optimize the quality of care for patients and as well address the economic pressures that are on these customers as they get transitioned over to a more value-based system. To do that well, obviously, it requires an end-to-end management of the episode of care, and that's where the patient engagement tools become so important. Rehab is important, education, patient-surgeon communications. And then, obviously, a really bright light has been shining as of late because of CJR on the post-discharge costs that are incurred, and that's where the telerehabilitation and leveraging technologies that lead to a better patient outcome but do that in a cost-effective way can become so meaningful. So that product portfolio across the continuum of care, including these services and solutions, including our couple of decades of experience through our Accelero consulting services that help lean out processes and ensure that the quality of care is raised and it's done efficiently and throughput is driven through that -- through these systems, is what Signature Solutions is all about. And as I've said, it's a message that's really resonating. I think that we're in a unique position, as we participate in over 1.5 million procedures across the globe on just the large joint side alone, to understand what best practices can be transferred from one institution to another. And then, ultimately, with the appropriate structure on an end-to-end basis, we're going to be able to, along with our hospital customers, draw data that will lead to continuous improvement and refinement of how the care is delivered. So we love the opportunity. We think that we can be a big part of the solution for the hospitals going forward, and the deeper partnerships in the Zimmer Biomet Signature Solutions is the umbrella that allows us to bring those solutions to the customers."

This morning, I'll review our third quarter financial results as well as provide an overview of some of our new technologies and solutions and the focused actions we're taking to drive sustainable growth. Dan will then provide additional financial details and discuss our updated guidance. 
Zimmer Biomet's third quarter revenue performance was highlighted by the acceleration of our S.E.T. category and ongoing strength in our Asia Pacific region. However, consolidated sales were below our expectations on weaker-than-anticipated results from our large joint and dental categories. Overall, broad demand for our differentiated portfolio remained high throughout the quarter, particularly for our focused cross-sell products. 
Variable commercial performances by our sales teams were in part caused by unanticipated supply constraints related to our transitioning supply chain infrastructure. This resulted in shortfalls of needed implants and additional instrument sets to fully exploit sales opportunities in key product categories. In response to this challenge, we've accelerated work to enhance certain aspects of our supply chain infrastructure as we harmonize and optimize our sourcing, manufacturing and quality management systems. Through these efforts, we expect to improve our demand fulfillment in the coming months. 
As a consequence of these supply constraints, we project fourth quarter sales results to be similar to those of the third quarter. However, as we look ahead, we remain confident in our ability to successfully reaccelerate our revenue growth in 2017. 
As I mentioned, demand for our expansive portfolio of differentiated and clinically proven musculoskeletal technologies, solutions and services has never been stronger. Our global sales organizations remain stable and have, in fact, achieved a third consecutive quarter of net personnel additions. These teams remain focused on delivering high-quality, personalized solutions to our customers and their patients.
To that end, during the quarter, we consummated a number of strategic external development transactions to expand our musculoskeletal portfolio and capabilities while continuing to deliver leveraged earnings per share. By joining together with LDR Spine in mid-July, we now possess a leading position in the attractive global market for cervical disc replacement. Additionally, our recently completed acquisition of Medtech SA provides us with current brain and spine robotic technology and positions us to identify and develop additional applications for the ROSA robotics minimally invasive platform. This differentiated technology supports our strategy to offer the industry's most comprehensive range of intelligent instrumentation options. 
Also during the quarter, we acquired new clinical solutions that extend our reach across the continuum of care, spanning from state-of-the-art 3D range of motion simulation software to an innovative telerehabilitation platform. These portfolio additions are designed to support health care providers in personalizing musculoskeletal treatment. Importantly, these assets further strengthen our Zimmer Biomet Signature Solutions offering, which is designed to assist hospitals and medical practices to seamlessly transition to value-based health care models. 
With our end-to-end clinical services, proprietary technologies and analytical tools, we're enabling health care providers to maximize productivity and patient engagement across the entire episode of care. As we have previously communicated, the rollout of Zimmer Biomet's Signature Solutions comes in an opportune time, when an increasing number of health care providers are striving to comply with bundled payment models by placing a greater emphasis on the quality and cost-effectiveness of knee and hip replacement service lines.
Before I review the performance of each of our sales categories, I'd like to comment on third quarter market conditions. We noted overall global market stability during the quarter. In addition, we believe that while the U.S. market demonstrated some softness during the summer months, it strengthened toward the end of the quarter. With regard to pricing, we experienced negative 1.9% of pressure, which was in line with expectations and consistent with trends in recent years. 
Against this backdrop, Zimmer Biomet delivered third quarter consolidated net sales of $1.83 billion. This performance represented 3.5% of constant-currency growth over the prior year quarter, of which the recently acquired LDR Holding Corporation contributed 190 basis points. Embedded within these results, we achieved solid 6.4% top line growth in the Asia Pacific region while growing sales in the Americas by 3.7% and by 0.9% in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region.
Zimmer Biomet's knee business was flat on a global basis in the third quarter, reflecting positive volume and mix of 1.9% and negative price of 2%. Our 2.6% sales growth in the Asia Pacific region was offset by our results in the Americas, where sales decreased by 0.9%. Our knee revenues increased by 0.3% in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region as compared to the prior year quarter. 
Despite continuing attractive growth rates during the quarter for Persona, the personalized knee system, our sales execution on this leading cross-selling opportunity was limited by the supply issues I just mentioned. The Oxford Partial Knee also delivered solid sales results during the quarter. 
Additionally, we were pleased to announce the commercial launch of our Vanguard individualized design total knee replacement system. This first-of-its-kind total knee construct supports our soft tissue preserved -- preservation focus and market leadership with independent medial and lateral polyethylene bearings that simplify soft tissue preservation and balance. We're committed to driving focused execution in support of stronger knee results in future quarters with this exceptional portfolio.
Third quarter hip sales grew by 0.6%, reflecting positive volume and mix of 3.0% and negative price of 2.4%. We grew revenues by a solid 5.9% in the Asia Pacific region while sales were flat in the Americas. Hip sales decreased by 1.4% in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region compared to the prior year quarter. 
Within this overall performance, we continued to drive the sales growth of our Taperloc complete system and Arcos modular femoral revision system as well as offerings that leverage Zimmer Biomet's proprietary vitamin E-infused advanced bearing materials. We were also pleased with the commercial traction of the recently introduced G7 Dual Mobility Construct. We're well positioned to build on these successes in future periods by leveraging the industry's most comprehensive range of hip solutions.
Turning to our S.E.T. category. We achieved a healthy 7.8% increase in global revenues, supported by solid results in all geographic segments. In our surgical business, we've been pleased with the ongoing progress of our growing specialized sales channel and the commercial success of our diversified offerings for the OR suite. Our sports medicine results were once again driven by our proprietary Subchondroplasty Procedure and Gel-One cross-linked hyaluronic injection. 
Similarly, our extremities business continued to leverage our market-leading upper extremities portfolio, including the comprehensive total shoulder system and the Nexel Total Elbow. Lastly, we delivered ongoing improvement in trauma with third quarter sales being led by our AFFIXUS Hip Fracture Nail System and the NCB Plating System. We expect that our S.E.T. product category will remain an integral component of our sustainable revenue growth platform, with innovative clinical solutions that meet the needs of surgeons, patients and health care institutions.
Dental sales decreased by 7.6%, which was below our expectations. Nonetheless, we achieved good performances from the 3i T3 implant system and the recently introduced  Eztetic implant system. Looking forward, we expect to more fully capitalize on this and additional future product launches as we enhance our multitiered offerings to address an evolving dental marketplace. 
Our spine craniomaxillofacial and thoracic category sales increased by 23.9% on a constant-currency basis in the third quarter, which represented approximately 1% organic growth. Following our recent LDR acquisition, we're making good progress with the initial phases of integration throughout our spine commercial organization. Among our spine offerings, we've been encouraged by the sustained revenue performance of the Mobi-C cervical disc prosthesis. Last week, we announced that Mobi-C is now the most widely covered device for 1- and 2-level cervical disc replacement by commercial health insurers in the United States. 
In addition, we also continued to deliver growth with the Vitality spinal fixation system. We're well positioned to continue to bolster the competitiveness of our spine business with an expanded portfolio and strengthening sales channel.
With regard to our craniomaxillofacial and thoracic business, we continue to be pleased with the ongoing strong sales growth of the SternaLock Blu and SternaLock 360 primary closure systems as well as the Omnimax MMF System. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Dan, who will continue this discussion in greater detail as well as review our updated revenue and earnings guidance. Dan?"
264048,404021255,1067321,"Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 31, 2016",2016-10-31,"Earnings Calls","Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, David. I will review our third quarter performance in more detail and then provide additional information related to fourth quarter and full year 2016 sales and earnings guidance. Our total revenues for the third quarter were $1,833,000,000,",1292,"Thank you, David. I will review our third quarter performance in more detail and then provide additional information related to fourth quarter and full year 2016 sales and earnings guidance. 
Our total revenues for the third quarter were $1,833,000,000, an increase of 3.5% adjusted constant currency when compared to the third quarter of 2015 and 1.6% excluding the contribution from the LDR acquisition. The net currency impact for the quarter was a positive 60 basis points or $11 million on consolidated revenue results. We had an immaterial difference in billing days in the quarter as compared to the third quarter of 2015.
Third quarter revenue was below our expectations primarily due to execution issues within our large joint supply chain, which led to a degradation in order fulfillment rate late in the quarter as well as our performance in dental. As noted by David, customer demand was strong in the quarter but certain aspects of our supply chain integration impacted our ability to effectively respond to shifting product mix, most notably within our knee and hip portfolios. As a consequence, we underestimated demand for certain key cross-sell brands within our existing customer base, leading to a depletion of our safety stocks and also affecting our ability to capitalize on new customer opportunities.
We are working diligently to enhance our supply chain processes and execution, particularly in the areas of demand forecasting, global inventory tracking and asset deployment systems while we replenish our safety stock levels. However, these issues have some carryover effect into the fourth quarter, which I will address shortly in the context of our updated Q4 guidance.
Turning now to the balance of our third quarter results. Our adjusted gross profit margin was 75.1% for the quarter and 110 basis points lower when compared to the prior year due mainly to the impact of ASP declines as well as lower foreign currency hedge gains, which we have been recently highlighting. 
The company's R&D expense was 5.2% of revenue at $95.6 million, reflecting investments from our recently acquired businesses as well as our Zimmer Biomet Signature Solutions program. Adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses were $727.7 million in the third quarter or 39.7% of sales, which was 40 basis points higher than the comparable period in the prior year. 
As anticipated, ongoing investments in our specialized sales forces and medical training and education programs, combined with the inclusion of our recent acquisitions, offset the benefit of SG&A cost synergies in the quarter. We remain on track to deliver cumulative net EBIT merger synergies of $225 million by the end of 2016. In addition to the Biomet synergies, we are also laying the foundational elements for synergy capture in 2017 from our recent acquisitions.
In the quarter, the company recorded pretax charges of $355 million in special items, primarily related to the Biomet and LDR acquisitions, including $181 million of noncash amortization and inventory step-up charges as well as approximately $140 million of acquisition- and integration-related expenses. Adjusted third quarter 2016 figures in the earnings release exclude the impact of these charges. A full reconciliation of reported net earnings to adjusted net earnings is included in this morning's press release.
Adjusted operating profit in the quarter amounted to approximately $553 million or 30.2% of sales, which was a decrease of 200 basis points when compared to the prior year period due to the reduction in gross margin as well as expected impacts from acquisitions. Net interest expense and other nonoperating expense totaled $94.6 million. Adjusted net earnings were $362.4 million for the third quarter, an increase of 7.1% compared to the prior year period. Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 9.1% to $1.79 on 202.9 million weighted average fully diluted shares outstanding.
Our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 21.1%, which reflects a year-to-date true-up to recognize the tax benefit associated with the noted product mix shifts coming from tax-efficient supply chain jurisdictions as well as certain other items. Our year-to-date adjusted effective tax rate is 24%.
Operating cash flow for the quarter amounted to $353 million, which included $161 million of cash expenditures for acquisition costs, integration activities and initiatives related to our synergy program. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $150 million, which included $94 million for instruments and $56 million for property, plant and equipment. Our free cash flow in the third quarter was approximately $202 million compared to $16 million in the third quarter of 2015. Ongoing working capital initiatives and improvements are expected to keep the company on track with full year cash flow generation of approximately $1.1 billion.
During the quarter, the company repaid $200 million on our term loan, reflecting $700 million of debt repayment since the beginning of this year. Additionally, during the quarter, the company consummated its new 5-year $1.5 billion multicurrency senior credit facility, along with a new $750 million term loan to finance the LDR transaction. As a result, gross debt increased by $550 million in the quarter.
I'd like now to review our guidance. As we look to the fourth quarter, revenue growth is expected to be in a range of 1.6% to 2.6%. Foreign exchange is estimated to decrease revenue by approximately 30 basis points. Therefore, reported revenue is expected to be in a range of $1,960,000,000 to $1,980,000,000. Fourth quarter constant-currency growth on a day adjusted basis is expected to be in a range of 3.3% to 4.3% or 1.0% to 2.0% excluding the contribution from LDR. 
On a similar basis, the company had previously estimated revenue growth for the quarter in a range of 5.8% to 6.8% or 3.5% to 4.5% excluding LDR. As a reminder, we have 1 less billing day as compared to the prior year. Our fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share on a fully diluted basis is now expected to be in a range of $2.08 to $2.13.
Turning to the full year 2016. We now estimate revenue to be in a range of $7,630,000,000 to $7,650,000,000 or an increase of approximately 27% on a reported basis or 2.4% to 2.7% on an adjusted pro forma basis in each case as compared to the prior year. The adjusted pro forma revenue guidance range is inclusive of approximately 110 basis points of contribution related to the LDR transaction.
We now expect foreign currency translation to decrease full year revenue in 2016 by approximately 30 basis points compared to our previous estimate of 50 basis points, with the Japanese yen strengthening against the U.S. dollar and a stabilized euro partially offset by the weakening British pound. Therefore, full year revenue growth excluding the impact of the LDR acquisition on a constant-currency adjusted pro forma basis is now expected to be in a range of 1.65% to 1.9%. Previously, the company estimated full year revenue growth to be in a range of 2.5% to 3.0% on a similar basis.
Turning to the full year P&L. After updating our assumptions to reflect our recent performance, acquisitions, a lower expected tax rate as well as foreign currency exchange rates and the associated operating margin implications, our full year adjusted diluted earnings per share is now expected to be in a range of $7.90 to $7.95, an increase of approximately 15% over the prior year. Our full year reported earnings per share are expected to be in a range of $1.50 to $1.60 after giving effect to our year-to-date results and anticipated special items in the fourth quarter. Special items are largely associated with noncash amortization, costs incurred to capture net synergy targets and acquisition integration expenses. Finally, please note that our guidance does not include any impact from other potential business development transactions or unforeseen events. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to David."

And while not anticipated, we understand the root causes. We understand the fixes that are necessary, and we're highly confident in our ability to implement those changes. It will take several months to make those corrections. In terms of sizing impact for the quarter, it's not a perfect science, but I would roughly anticipate or estimate that it'd be about 100 basis points of impact due to the supply issues in the third quarter. We have a very robust backlog of demand. And with respect to the impact in the fourth quarter, I would size that even slightly above that 1% impact."

And I think, Bob, the manifestation was really as the quarter progressed, and late in the quarter the signs became clear that we had a pretty significant product mix with the lack of visibility on a forward basis that allowed our supply chain to respond. Obviously, as we fully integrate on the operations front, we're going to have a much more agile supply chain and be able to respond to these kinds of demands in a much shorter time period. As we are in our natural state now, we just did not have the ability or the foresight. So part of this is forecasting systems. Part of it is just operational execution and lead times for these products but primarily driven by the large joint demand. If you think about the cross-sell product categories, you're going to be aligned with the biggest opportunities that we have. And probably on the forecasting side, the most significant underestimation was the demand for those same products with existing customers. And so it caused us to have to step back, make sure that we're redoubling our efforts to service existing customers. And as we've referenced, that took away from some of the offensive opportunities that we have. But please don't construe that to be a lack of demand. We know that we have significant opportunities to gain competitive accounts and business. And as we restore the supply chain, we'll get after those opportunities and reaccelerate our top line momentum."

That's part of the visibility fix that we lacked. We had some interim processes in place that, in hindsight, were not as robust as we needed them to be. We also have integrated demand planning tools and production planning tools coming online next quarter.

That's not in the third quarter. You'll start to see that in the fourth quarter and, certainly, more significantly as we progress through 2017. So that leverage from integrating our acquisition is a big contributor to the growth in operating margin next year, combined with our other growth investments that we've been making during the course of the year, the medical training and education, the specialized sales forces, which are driving that S.E.T. growth that David described, and then further investments in our Signature Solutions platform, which David described as well, all of which are critical to long-term sustainable growth."

It would take the form of much broader and deeper partnerships with the hospital customers, and I would tell you the discussions that we've had, which to date have been focused primarily on large academic institutions, have been very, very positive. So we would enter into a deep partnership that could include risk sharing in an appropriate manner to optimize the quality of care for patients and as well address the economic pressures that are on these customers as they get transitioned over to a more value-based system. To do that well, obviously, it requires an end-to-end management of the episode of care, and that's where the patient engagement tools become so important. Prehab is important, education, patient-surgeon communications. And then, obviously, a really bright light has been shining as of late because of CJR on the post-discharge costs that are incurred, and that's where the telerehabilitation and leveraging technologies that lead to a better patient outcome but do that in a cost-effective way can become so meaningful. So that product portfolio across the continuum of care, including these services and solutions, including our couple of decades of experience through our Accelero consulting services that help lean out processes and ensure that the quality of care is raised and it's done efficiently and throughput is driven through that -- through these systems, is what Signature Solutions is all about. And as I've said, it's a message that's really resonating. I think that we're in a unique position, as we participate in over 1.5 million procedures across the globe on just the large joint side alone, to understand what best practices can be transferred from one institution to another. And then, ultimately, with the appropriate structure on an end-to-end basis, we're going to be able to, along with our hospital customers, draw data that will lead to continuous improvement and refinement of how the care is delivered. So we love the opportunity. We think that we can be a big part of the solution for the hospitals going forward, and the deeper partnerships in the Zimmer Biomet Signature Solutions is the umbrella that allows us to bring those solutions to the customers."

I guess my question just there is do you -- what's your confidence level that you're going to be able to maintain the sales force in what always is tricky with spine acquisitions? And what level of confidence do you have that we won't see any surprises kind of for that business to potentially alter that margin outlook?"

This morning, I'll review our third quarter financial results as well as provide an overview of some of our new technologies and solutions and the focused actions we're taking to drive sustainable growth. Dan will then provide additional financial details and discuss our updated guidance. 
Zimmer Biomet's third quarter revenue performance was highlighted by the acceleration of our S.E.T. category and ongoing strength in our Asia Pacific region. However, consolidated sales were below our expectations on weaker-than-anticipated results from our large joint and dental categories. Overall, broad demand for our differentiated portfolio remained high throughout the quarter, particularly for our focused cross-sell products. 
Variable commercial performances by our sales teams were in part caused by unanticipated supply constraints related to our transitioning supply chain infrastructure. This resulted in shortfalls of needed implants and additional instrument sets to fully exploit sales opportunities in key product categories. In response to this challenge, we've accelerated work to enhance certain aspects of our supply chain infrastructure as we harmonize and optimize our sourcing, manufacturing and quality management systems. Through these efforts, we expect to improve our demand fulfillment in the coming months. 
As a consequence of these supply constraints, we project fourth quarter sales results to be similar to those of the third quarter. However, as we look ahead, we remain confident in our ability to successfully reaccelerate our revenue growth in 2017. 
As I mentioned, demand for our expansive portfolio of differentiated and clinically proven musculoskeletal technologies, solutions and services has never been stronger. Our global sales organizations remain stable and have, in fact, achieved a third consecutive quarter of net personnel additions. These teams remain focused on delivering high-quality, personalized solutions to our customers and their patients.
To that end, during the quarter, we consummated a number of strategic external development transactions to expand our musculoskeletal portfolio and capabilities while continuing to deliver leveraged earnings per share. By joining together with LDR Spine in mid-July, we now possess a leading position in the attractive global market for cervical disc replacement. Additionally, our recently completed acquisition of Medtech SA provides us with current brain and spine robotic technology and positions us to identify and develop additional applications for the ROSA robotics minimally invasive platform. This differentiated technology supports our strategy to offer the industry's most comprehensive range of intelligent instrumentation options. 
Also during the quarter, we acquired new clinical solutions that extend our reach across the continuum of care, spanning from state-of-the-art 3D range of motion simulation software to an innovative telerehabilitation platform. These portfolio additions are designed to support health care providers in personalizing musculoskeletal treatment. Importantly, these assets further strengthen our Zimmer Biomet Signature Solutions offering, which is designed to assist hospitals and medical practices to seamlessly transition to value-based health care models. 
With our end-to-end clinical services, proprietary technologies and analytical tools, we're enabling health care providers to maximize productivity and patient engagement across the entire episode of care. As we have previously communicated, the rollout of Zimmer Biomet's Signature Solutions comes in an opportune time, when an increasing number of health care providers are striving to comply with bundled payment models by placing a greater emphasis on the quality and cost-effectiveness of knee and hip replacement service lines.
Before I review the performance of each of our sales categories, I'd like to comment on third quarter market conditions. We noted overall global market stability during the quarter. In addition, we believe that while the U.S. market demonstrated some softness during the summer months, it strengthened toward the end of the quarter. With regard to pricing, we experienced negative 1.9% of pressure, which was in line with expectations and consistent with trends in recent years. 
Against this backdrop, Zimmer Biomet delivered third quarter consolidated net sales of $1.83 billion. This performance represented 3.5% of constant-currency growth over the prior year quarter, of which the recently acquired LDR Holding Corporation contributed 190 basis points. Embedded within these results, we achieved solid 6.4% top line growth in the Asia Pacific region while growing sales in the Americas by 3.7% and by 0.9% in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region.
Zimmer Biomet's knee business was flat on a global basis in the third quarter, reflecting positive volume and mix of 1.9% and negative price of 2%. Our 2.6% sales growth in the Asia Pacific region was offset by our results in the Americas, where sales decreased by 0.9%. Our knee revenues increased by 0.3% in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region as compared to the prior year quarter. 
Despite continuing attractive growth rates during the quarter for Persona, the personalized knee system, our sales execution on this leading cross-selling opportunity was limited by the supply issues I just mentioned. The Oxford Partial Knee also delivered solid sales results during the quarter. 
Additionally, we were pleased to announce the commercial launch of our Vanguard individualized design total knee replacement system. This first-of-its-kind total knee construct supports our soft tissue preserved -- preservation focus and market leadership with independent medial and lateral polyethylene bearings that simplify soft tissue preservation and balance. We're committed to driving focused execution in support of stronger knee results in future quarters with this exceptional portfolio.
Third quarter hip sales grew by 0.6%, reflecting positive volume and mix of 3.0% and negative price of 2.4%. We grew revenues by a solid 5.9% in the Asia Pacific region while sales were flat in the Americas. Hip sales decreased by 1.4% in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region compared to the prior year quarter. 
Within this overall performance, we continued to drive the sales growth of our Taperloc complete system and Arcos modular femoral revision system as well as offerings that leverage Zimmer Biomet's proprietary vitamin E-infused advanced bearing materials. We were also pleased with the commercial traction of the recently introduced G7 Dual Mobility Construct. We're well positioned to build on these successes in future periods by leveraging the industry's most comprehensive range of hip solutions.
Turning to our S.E.T. category. We achieved a healthy 7.8% increase in global revenues, supported by solid results in all geographic segments. In our surgical business, we've been pleased with the ongoing progress of our growing specialized sales channel and the commercial success of our diversified offerings for the OR suite. Our sports medicine results were once again driven by our proprietary Subchondroplasty Procedure and Gel-One cross-linked hyaluronic injection. 
Similarly, our extremities business continued to leverage our market-leading upper extremities portfolio, including the comprehensive total shoulder system and the Nexel Total Elbow. Lastly, we delivered ongoing improvement in trauma with third quarter sales being led by our AFFIXUS Hip Fracture Nail System and the NCB Plating System. We expect that our S.E.T. product category will remain an integral component of our sustainable revenue growth platform, with innovative clinical solutions that meet the needs of surgeons, patients and health care institutions.
Dental sales decreased by 7.6%, which was below our expectations. Nonetheless, we achieved good performances from the 3i T3 implant system and the recently introduced  Eztetic implant system. Looking forward, we expect to more fully capitalize on this and additional future product launches as we enhance our multitiered offerings to address an evolving dental marketplace. 
Our spine craniomaxillofacial and thoracic category sales increased by 23.9% on a constant-currency basis in the third quarter, which represented approximately 1% organic growth. Following our recent LDR acquisition, we're making good progress with the initial phases of integration throughout our spine commercial organization. Among our spine offerings, we've been encouraged by the sustained revenue performance of the Mobi-C cervical disc prosthesis. Last week, we announced that Mobi-C is now the most widely covered device for 1- and 2-level cervical disc replacement by commercial health insurers in the United States. 
In addition, we also continued to deliver growth with the Vitality spinal fixation system. We're well positioned to continue to bolster the competitiveness of our spine business with an expanded portfolio and strengthening sales channel.
With regard to our craniomaxillofacial and thoracic business, we continue to be pleased with the ongoing strong sales growth of the SternaLock Blu and SternaLock 360 primary closure systems as well as the Omnimax MMF System. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Dan, who will continue this discussion in greater detail as well as review our updated revenue and earnings guidance. Dan?"
264048,404021255,1067761,"Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 31, 2016",2016-10-31,"Earnings Calls","Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, David. I will review our third quarter performance in more detail and then provide additional information related to fourth quarter and full year 2016 sales and earnings guidance. Our total revenues for the third quarter were $1,833,000,000,",1292,"Thank you, David. I will review our third quarter performance in more detail and then provide additional information related to fourth quarter and full year 2016 sales and earnings guidance. 
Our total revenues for the third quarter were $1,833,000,000, an increase of 3.5% adjusted constant currency when compared to the third quarter of 2015 and 1.6% excluding the contribution from the LDR acquisition. The net currency impact for the quarter was a positive 60 basis points or $11 million on consolidated revenue results. We had an immaterial difference in billing days in the quarter as compared to the third quarter of 2015.
Third quarter revenue was below our expectations primarily due to execution issues within our large joint supply chain, which led to a degradation in order fulfillment rate late in the quarter as well as our performance in dental. As noted by David, customer demand was strong in the quarter but certain aspects of our supply chain integration impacted our ability to effectively respond to shifting product mix, most notably within our knee and hip portfolios. As a consequence, we underestimated demand for certain key cross-sell brands within our existing customer base, leading to a depletion of our safety stocks and also affecting our ability to capitalize on new customer opportunities.
We are working diligently to enhance our supply chain processes and execution, particularly in the areas of demand forecasting, global inventory tracking and asset deployment systems while we replenish our safety stock levels. However, these issues have some carryover effect into the fourth quarter, which I will address shortly in the context of our updated Q4 guidance.
Turning now to the balance of our third quarter results. Our adjusted gross profit margin was 75.1% for the quarter and 110 basis points lower when compared to the prior year due mainly to the impact of ASP declines as well as lower foreign currency hedge gains, which we have been recently highlighting. 
The company's R&D expense was 5.2% of revenue at $95.6 million, reflecting investments from our recently acquired businesses as well as our Zimmer Biomet Signature Solutions program. Adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses were $727.7 million in the third quarter or 39.7% of sales, which was 40 basis points higher than the comparable period in the prior year. 
As anticipated, ongoing investments in our specialized sales forces and medical training and education programs, combined with the inclusion of our recent acquisitions, offset the benefit of SG&A cost synergies in the quarter. We remain on track to deliver cumulative net EBIT merger synergies of $225 million by the end of 2016. In addition to the Biomet synergies, we are also laying the foundational elements for synergy capture in 2017 from our recent acquisitions.
In the quarter, the company recorded pretax charges of $355 million in special items, primarily related to the Biomet and LDR acquisitions, including $181 million of noncash amortization and inventory step-up charges as well as approximately $140 million of acquisition- and integration-related expenses. Adjusted third quarter 2016 figures in the earnings release exclude the impact of these charges. A full reconciliation of reported net earnings to adjusted net earnings is included in this morning's press release.
Adjusted operating profit in the quarter amounted to approximately $553 million or 30.2% of sales, which was a decrease of 200 basis points when compared to the prior year period due to the reduction in gross margin as well as expected impacts from acquisitions. Net interest expense and other nonoperating expense totaled $94.6 million. Adjusted net earnings were $362.4 million for the third quarter, an increase of 7.1% compared to the prior year period. Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 9.1% to $1.79 on 202.9 million weighted average fully diluted shares outstanding.
Our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 21.1%, which reflects a year-to-date true-up to recognize the tax benefit associated with the noted product mix shifts coming from tax-efficient supply chain jurisdictions as well as certain other items. Our year-to-date adjusted effective tax rate is 24%.
Operating cash flow for the quarter amounted to $353 million, which included $161 million of cash expenditures for acquisition costs, integration activities and initiatives related to our synergy program. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $150 million, which included $94 million for instruments and $56 million for property, plant and equipment. Our free cash flow in the third quarter was approximately $202 million compared to $16 million in the third quarter of 2015. Ongoing working capital initiatives and improvements are expected to keep the company on track with full year cash flow generation of approximately $1.1 billion.
During the quarter, the company repaid $200 million on our term loan, reflecting $700 million of debt repayment since the beginning of this year. Additionally, during the quarter, the company consummated its new 5-year $1.5 billion multicurrency senior credit facility, along with a new $750 million term loan to finance the LDR transaction. As a result, gross debt increased by $550 million in the quarter.
I'd like now to review our guidance. As we look to the fourth quarter, revenue growth is expected to be in a range of 1.6% to 2.6%. Foreign exchange is estimated to decrease revenue by approximately 30 basis points. Therefore, reported revenue is expected to be in a range of $1,960,000,000 to $1,980,000,000. Fourth quarter constant-currency growth on a day adjusted basis is expected to be in a range of 3.3% to 4.3% or 1.0% to 2.0% excluding the contribution from LDR. 
On a similar basis, the company had previously estimated revenue growth for the quarter in a range of 5.8% to 6.8% or 3.5% to 4.5% excluding LDR. As a reminder, we have 1 less billing day as compared to the prior year. Our fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share on a fully diluted basis is now expected to be in a range of $2.08 to $2.13.
Turning to the full year 2016. We now estimate revenue to be in a range of $7,630,000,000 to $7,650,000,000 or an increase of approximately 27% on a reported basis or 2.4% to 2.7% on an adjusted pro forma basis in each case as compared to the prior year. The adjusted pro forma revenue guidance range is inclusive of approximately 110 basis points of contribution related to the LDR transaction.
We now expect foreign currency translation to decrease full year revenue in 2016 by approximately 30 basis points compared to our previous estimate of 50 basis points, with the Japanese yen strengthening against the U.S. dollar and a stabilized euro partially offset by the weakening British pound. Therefore, full year revenue growth excluding the impact of the LDR acquisition on a constant-currency adjusted pro forma basis is now expected to be in a range of 1.65% to 1.9%. Previously, the company estimated full year revenue growth to be in a range of 2.5% to 3.0% on a similar basis.
Turning to the full year P&L. After updating our assumptions to reflect our recent performance, acquisitions, a lower expected tax rate as well as foreign currency exchange rates and the associated operating margin implications, our full year adjusted diluted earnings per share is now expected to be in a range of $7.90 to $7.95, an increase of approximately 15% over the prior year. Our full year reported earnings per share are expected to be in a range of $1.50 to $1.60 after giving effect to our year-to-date results and anticipated special items in the fourth quarter. Special items are largely associated with noncash amortization, costs incurred to capture net synergy targets and acquisition integration expenses. Finally, please note that our guidance does not include any impact from other potential business development transactions or unforeseen events. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to David."

And I think, Bob, the manifestation was really as the quarter progressed, and late in the quarter the signs became clear that we had a pretty significant product mix with the lack of visibility on a forward basis that allowed our supply chain to respond. Obviously, as we fully integrate on the operations front, we're going to have a much more agile supply chain and be able to respond to these kinds of demands in a much shorter time period. As we are in our natural state now, we just did not have the ability or the foresight. So part of this is forecasting systems. Part of it is just operational execution and lead times for these products but primarily driven by the large joint demand. If you think about the cross-sell product categories, you're going to be aligned with the biggest opportunities that we have. And probably on the forecasting side, the most significant underestimation was the demand for those same products with existing customers. And so it caused us to have to step back, make sure that we're redoubling our efforts to service existing customers. And as we've referenced, that took away from some of the offensive opportunities that we have. But please don't construe that to be a lack of demand.

The -- so I think we're very low risk of that going poorly based on the testing that's been done to date. The integrated demand planning tools come online shortly after the new year. And based on the learnings over the past few months, needless to say, a lot of focus on the process for that and then the deployment of these tools. We're deploying a proven tool, so confident that we're going to be able to get that up and running without a glitch. Importantly, over the past month, we've significantly ramped up production levels. But given lead times from vendors and production lead times, it just takes time to build inventory and replenish those safety stock levels. But all of the above, we're aggressively dealing with and have been for the past several weeks."

It would take the form of much broader and deeper partnerships with the hospital customers, and I would tell you the discussions that we've had, which to date have been focused primarily on large academic institutions, have been very, very positive. So we would enter into a deep partnership that could include risk sharing in an appropriate manner to optimize the quality of care for patients and as well address the economic pressures that are on these customers as they get transitioned over to a more value-based system. To do that well, obviously, it requires an end-to-end management of the episode of care, and that's where the patient engagement tools become so important. Prehab is important, education, patient-surgeon communications. And then, obviously, a really bright light has been shining as of late because of CJR on the post-discharge costs that are incurred, and that's where the telerehabilitation and leveraging technologies that lead to a better patient outcome but do that in a cost-effective way can become so meaningful. So that product portfolio across the continuum of care, including these services and solutions, including our couple of decades of experience through our Accelero consulting services that help lean out processes and ensure that the quality of care is raised and it's done efficiently and throughput is driven through that -- through these systems, is what Signature Solutions is all about. And as I've said, it's a message that's really resonating. I think that we're in a unique position, as we participate in over 1.5 million procedures across the globe on just the large joint side alone, to understand what best practices can be transferred from one institution to another. And then, ultimately, with the appropriate structure on an end-to-end basis, we're going to be able to, along with our hospital customers, draw data that will lead to continuous improvement and refinement of how the care is delivered. So we love the opportunity. We think that we can be a big part of the solution for the hospitals going forward, and the deeper partnerships in the Zimmer Biomet Signature Solutions is the umbrella that allows us to bring those solutions to the customers."
