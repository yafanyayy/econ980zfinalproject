Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. With me on today's call are Mike Mahoney, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Dan Brennan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
We issued a press release earlier this morning announcing our fourth quarter and full year 2015 results, which included reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in the release.
We have posted a copy of that release as well as reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in today's call to the Investor Relations section of our website under the heading, Financial Information.
The duration of this morning's call will be approximately 1 hour. Mike will provide strategic and revenue highlights of the fourth quarter. Dan will review the financials for the quarter and then provide first quarter '16 and full year 2016 guidance, and then we'll take your questions. During today's Q&A session, Mike and Dan will be joined by our Chief Medical Officers, Dr. Keith Dawkins and Dr. Ken Stein. 
Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that on the call organic revenue growth is defined as excluding the impact of sales from divested businesses, changes in foreign currency exchange rates and sales from the acquisition of the American Medical Systems or AMS male urology portfolio over the prior year period. Also note this call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws, which may be identified by words like anticipate, expect, believe, estimate and other similar words
They include, among other things, statements about our growth and market share; new product approvals and launches; clinical trials; cost savings and growth opportunities; our cash flow and expected use; our financial performance, including sales, margins, earnings and other Q4 and full year 2015 results and Q1 and full year 2016 guidance; as well as our tax rates, R&D spend and other expenses.

At this point, I'll turn it over to Mike for his comments. Mike?"
317627,321212230,926312,"Boston Scientific Corporation, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 04, 2016",2016-02-04,"Earnings Calls","Boston Scientific Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Susie, and good morning, everyone. in, fourth quarter, Boston Scientific posted another quarter of strong results and closed out an excellent 2015 as we continued to execute against our strategic planned goals. At our May 2015 Investor Day meet",2211,"Thank you, Susie, and good morning, everyone. in, fourth quarter, Boston Scientific posted another quarter of strong results and closed out an excellent 2015 as we continued to execute against our strategic planned goals. At our May 2015 Investor Day meeting, we outlined plans to drive mid-single-digit organic revenue growth and consistent adjusted operating margin expansion, which, in turn, will drive double-digit adjusted EPS growth excluding the impact of FX. 
We are delivering against these objectives. In Q4, we grew worldwide sales 5% organically and 10% operationally, which includes the benefit of the AMS Urology business. We also grew adjusted operating income by 10% in the fourth quarter, which represents 100 basis point year-over-year improvement to 21.7%. 
The solid revenue growth and margin expansion drove very strong 18% adjusted EPS growth to $0.26, and our fourth quarter results reflect our focus on delivering meaningful innovation while also providing clinical and economic value to our hospital customers. 
Importantly, our Q4 results built upon the consistent momentum generated over the past few years and contributed to the following full year '15 results. For the full year, we delivered 5% organic revenue growth and 8% operational revenue growth, which includes the acquired sales from Bayer Peripheral and EMS. In parallel with the consistent revenue growth, we are driving a strong improvements through our operating margin. 
In 2014, we delivered 130 basis point improvement in adjusted operating margin. In 2015, we delivered an additional 210 basis point improvement to a full year 22.3%. In prior previous calls, we continue to expect to deliver 25% plus adjusted operating margin in 2017 with plans to deliver an additional 200 to 300 basis points of improvement by year-end 2020. 
We delivered full year of '15 adjusted EPS growth -- I'm sorry, EPS of $0.93, representing 11% growth for the full year. It's important to note that the 11% adjusted EPS growth includes a significant negative foreign exchange impact of $0.10 versus our original expectation of a $0.04 hit when we originally gave '15 guidance. We are very pleased that we are able to overcome this FX headwind while investing in the long-term growth of the company yet still delivering on our commitment for diluted adjusted EPS growth. 
We continue to believe that Boston Scientific is uniquely positioned to deliver differentiated shareholder value to durable mid-single-digit revenue growth and double-digit adjusted EPS growth via our ongoing opportunity improvement initiatives. We're excited by our 2016 and our plans to build upon our global momentum. 
In 2016, we're targeting full year organic revenue growth of 4% to 7% and operational revenue growth of 7% to 10%. We're guiding adjusted EPS to $1.03 to $1.07, which represents 11% to 15% earnings growth. Importantly, this EPS once again includes an expected $0.06 negative impact from foreign exchange. 
I'll now provide some highlights on fourth quarter and '15 results along with thoughts on our '16 outlook. In my remarks, all reference to growth in an organic year-over-year constant currency basis and unless otherwise specified. 
Our fourth quarter organic revenue growth of 5% was broad based across businesses and regions. It's led by exciting new product launches, which continued; global expansion; and execution of our category leadership strategy. With the exception of the anticipated 1% decline in CRM sales, all of our other businesses grew organic revenue by at least 6%, led by 10% growth in PI. IC had a strong quarter growing 6% against a very tough 10% comp in Q4 2014. And importantly, all 3 medical/surgical businesses grew revenue at 7% while also improving segmented adjusted operating margin by 90 basis points year-over-year to 34.1%. 
We delivered another quarter of balanced global growth led by 6% revenue growth in Asia, 5% growth in the U.S. and Europe. Another highlight was strong 15% revenue growth in emerging markets led by 20% growth in China and Brazil. 
The MedSurg businesses continued to deliver. In Endoscopy, we delivered 7% growth in Q4, fueled by the strength portfolio, our expanding global commercial reach and ongoing launches of our SpyGlass DS and axial stent. SpyGlass DS is launched in July 2015, and is in advance single-use visualization system for the diagnosis and treatment of complex disorders of the pancreas and bile ducts. It's truly a cornerstone product that is highly differentiated and complementary to our core endo portfolio. Our axial stent used for transluminal drainage pancreatic fluid collections is also off to a strong start. We'll continue to innovate in endoscopic ultrasound and other exciting therapeutic categories, including pulmonary and ecology, to further enhance our global leadership in Endoscopy. 
Urology and Pelvic Health also continued a strong performance trend, growing 7% organically in Q4 led by laser fibers, capital equipment and strong international growth. Importantly, this quarter, we launched LithoVue, a disposable uterus scope, which provides customers with visualization and navigation capabilities to diagnose and treat stones and other conditions of the kidney, uterus and bladder. And after closing the AMS Urology acquisition in August, we remain on track to realize our adjusted EPS accretion goals of at least $0.03 in 2016 and $0.07 in 2017. 
Neuromodulation revenue grew 7% in the fourth quarter led by strong growth in both the U.S. and international. Sales were driven by the market-leading Specter platform and the launch of precision Novi, our first product in the primary self nonrechargeable market. 
In addition, we're seeing really promising uptake of our precise Deep Brain Stimulation system due to its Cartesian directional lead system and our partnership with Brainlab. Our USDBS trial is making progress, and we expect to complete enrollment in 2016 and enter the market in late 2017 or early '18. 
Our Cardiovascular group grew 7% in Q4 led by impressive 10% growth in Peripheral Interventions. The core PI business continues to execute, and we are very pleased with integration of the legacy Bayer business. The legacy Bayer business grew over 20% for the second quarter in a row as we continue to grow share in the market, and we're encouraged by early results by global launch of our Zelante DVT catheter and the U.S. launch of our stent for the SFA. 
We also recently began to enroll our U.S. IDE trial for Eluvia, our drug-eluting stent and remain on track for a European launch of Eluvia this quarter. In addition, we recently closed the CeloNova transaction, which is a synergistic tuck-in acquisition focused on the treatment of liver cancer via localized delivery of chemotherapeutic agents. 
And finally in PI, we continue to benefit from our commercial relationship with CR Bard and drug coated balloon technology. 
Interventional Cardiology continues to deliver with 6% growth in the quarter, which represents the sixth consecutive quarter of plus 6% growth in IC. Growth was led by worldwide imaging, U.S. and European drug-eluting stents, our complex PCI portfolio and Structural Heart. 
PCI guidance grew low teens globally, and we're encouraged by the market enthusiasm of our integrated fractional flow platform. In DES, the U.S. synergy launch is going well. We anticipate that synergy will represent approximately 50% of our DES revenue mix in the U.S. by the end of 2016. 
In addition, we're launching SYNERGY in Japan, and we'll continue to expand SYNERGY in other international markets. We also continue to divest and build upon our strong clinical evidence for SYNERGY as we have initiated the evolve short DAPT study. 
Finally, the IC performance was fueled by our strengthening Structural Heart business, which includes our Lotus aortic valve and WATCHMAN Left Atrial Appendage Closure Device. We're truly in an exciting position to drive growth and share gains over the long run in these fast-growing markets. 
Lotus delivered a strong quarter for the -- in the European market as the platform continues to build momentum despite our near-term size major limitations. Lotus offers physicians excellent control during implantation and best-in-class leakage rates. 
In our RESPOND Post-Market Study, 95.1% of patients had 0 to trace PDL. Importantly, we completed enrollment in our REPRISE III IDE study in December, which we anticipate will position us for late 2017 U.S. market entrance. We're also pleased to announce completion of the 1,000-patient respond Lotus plus market study, and those results will be presented at Euro PCR in May. 
We're expanding the Lotus platform and expect to launch our NexGen 14 French delivery system along with additional sizes in Europe this year. Also in Structural Heart, the U.S. WATCHMAN launch continues to progress ahead of plan. We're pleased with the implant success rates and the high quality of patient outcomes thus far, which reflect our controlled rollout and proven training program. 
In addition, Dr. Visik Reddy of Mount Sinai recently published in JECC a study highlighting WATCHMAN's cost-effectiveness versus warfarin and novel oral anticoagulants. In the U.S., we opened more than 100 WATCHMAN accounts in 2015 and expect to open an additional 100 accounts in 2016. 
In Europe, we're looking forward to a full launch of our second-gen WATCHMAN flex, which also -- which already CE marked. As our U.S. reimbursement, we will await final NCD decision from CMS by February 8, and we remain confident that WATCHMAN will represent at least a $500 million worldwide market opportunity. 
So overall, we're very pleased with our progress in Structural Heart and excited about our capabilities and the long-term prospects for this business. We exceeded our full year of '15 Structural Heart revenue goal of $75 million to $100 million, and in 2016, we anticipate Structural Heart sales between $175 million and $200 million. 
Now turning to CRM. On our first quarter '15 earnings call, we projected a slowdown in our worldwide CRM sales for the balance of '15 and through first quarter '16, primarily due to replacement cycle headwinds and competitive launches in the U.S. Our forecast is accurate as global CRM sales declined 1% in Q4. However, we're very encouraged by about our forward-looking CRM position given the strong cadence of new launches expected in the U.S. and Japan in '16, our leading position and growing awareness of S-ICD and our replacement cycle headwind becoming more favorable as we exit 2016. 
In the U.S., we plan to launch our full X4 quad system with our ACCOLADE EMI same system in the first half and EMBLEM MRI in the second half of '16, and we anticipate these releases will strengthen 2016 CRM performance, particularly in the second half. 
Pacemaker sales again grew 2%, and we recently launched X4 CRTD quad device. And while our ICD sales declined 2%, we continue to be pleased with our de novo ICD performance in the Emblem SICD in particular. Emblem continues to drive strong growth in de novo share gains in both the Europe and the U.S. Emblem is building momentum globally, and we look forward to launching Emblem in Japan this quarter with the reimbursement premium and expanding SICD to additional international markets in 2016. 
In Europe, we continue to gain share and grow our CRM business in the mid-single-digit range with our complete portfolio. These consistent European CRM results are encouraging as we look forward to our anticipated U.S. approvals in '16. Lastly in CRM, we're continuously mounting third-party evidence of the economic benefits associated with our EnduraLife extended battery technology. And recently another third-party data set from the Europace was published, demonstrating the 6-year survival of BSC CRTDs over our competitors. 
Also recent U.S. study modeled a 14% reduction in Medicare cost from a 2-year increase in ICD battery longevity, and an Italian study showed Extended Longevity drove a 29% to 34% reduction in long-term health care costs over 15-year period. 
Turning to our EP business. We delivered 8% growth in the quarter. Arrhythmia platform continues to rollout nicely driven by new installations and high case volumes. We have a strong arrhythmia customer pipeline in 2016 as well as new platform enhancement scheduled for release. 
We did see some softness in EP in fourth quarter, primarily driven by the delay in our European launch of our IntellaMap ablation catheter, which we anticipate launching later in the first quarter. We continue to strengthen our EP business, and we look forward to continued progress in 2016. 
Our strategy of category leadership is working. It's helping us to become a stronger partner with our global customers. As the health care environment continues to evolve, we're building new capabilities to support our customers be on our part of portfolio with our ADVANTICS solutions offerings. These offerings are focused on driving operational excellence within Cardiovascular and GI lives and improving standardizing care for chronic Cardiovascular diseases. 
And just last week, we announced an alliance with Accenture to develop a data-driven digital health solutions improve patient outcomes and reduce costs to treat patients with chronic Cardiovascular disease. 
So to wrap up my section, our company has great momentum, and our 2015 results reflect the strength of our portfolio and our ongoing investment investor growth markets, our globalization efforts and execution of our global teams. 
More importantly, we believe that we are well positioned to continue and strengthen our performance track record in 2016 and beyond. I really want to thank our employees for their winning spirit and a great commitment to Boston Scientific. 
And now let me turn the call over to Dan for more detailed review of our financials."
317627,321212230,926312,"Boston Scientific Corporation, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 04, 2016",2016-02-04,"Earnings Calls","Boston Scientific Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Mike. I'll start with some overall perspective on the quarter before getting into the detail. We generated adjusted earnings per share of $0.26, exceeding the high end of our guidance range of $0.23 to $0.25 and representing 18% year-over-year g",2753,"Thanks, Mike. I'll start with some overall perspective on the quarter before getting into the detail. 
We generated adjusted earnings per share of $0.26, exceeding the high end of our guidance range of $0.23 to $0.25 and representing 18% year-over-year growth in the quarter. Excluding a $0.03 unfavorable foreign exchange impact, Q4 adjusted earnings per share grew 31% year-over-year. The strong performance in Q4 was driven primarily by operational revenue growth in gross margin expansion. 
Our Q4 2015 adjusted operating margin of 21.7% represents an improvement of 100 basis points over the fourth quarter of 2014. For the full year 2015, total company adjusted operating margin expanded by 210 basis points over the full year of '14, and we effectively offset a $0.10 FX headwind through operational savings and initiatives. 
Our full year 2015 adjusted earnings per share of $0.93 represents 11% growth and 23% growth excluding FX versus 2014. 
Now for the P&L highlights. For the fourth quarter of 2015, consolidated revenue of $1,978,000,000 represented operational growth of 10%, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange. Excluding an approximate 500 basis point contribution from the AMS male urology portfolio, organic revenue growth was 5% in the quarter. 
On an as-reported basis, revenue grew 5% year-over-year. The foreign exchange impact on sale was a $110 million headwind compared to the prior year period, which was about $25 million worse than we assumed in our Q4 guidance range. 
Adjusted gross margin for the fourth quarter was 72.8%, increasing 140 basis points year-over-year. The increase resulted primarily from cost improvements, driven by our value improvement programs as the impact of foreign exchange was negligible in the quarter. 
For the full year 2015, adjusted gross margin was 72% compared to 70.7% for the full year 2014. The 130 basis point full year adjusted gross margin improvement was driven by benefits of 180 and 50 basis points from cost improvements and FX, respectively. This was partially offset by 100 basis points of headwind attributed primarily to price. 
Adjusted SG&A expenses were $757 million or 38.3% of sales in the fourth quarter, down 10 basis points year-over-year. The Q4 rate includes 80 basis points a higher spend related to fixed asset write-offs, full year related benefits and litigation fees. 
Our full year 2015 adjusted SG&A rate of 37.4% is down 50 basis points versus the full year 2014. As a reminder, the medical device tax has been suspended for 2016 and 2017, which would benefit our adjusted SG&A rate by roughly 100 basis points annually. We're pleased to see that this tax has been temporarily suspended and intent to reinvest virtually all of the benefits into jobs, innovation, R&D, collaborations with universities and other initiatives that will help treat patients and sustain top line growth over the long term. 
We expect the reinvestment of approximately 100 basis points to be split roughly equally between R&D and SG&A. Our guidance for full year 2016 assumes our adjusted SG&A rate will come down by a total of 140 basis points at the midpoint, which breaks down into 50 basis points on the medical device tax suspension and 90 basis points from operational improvements. 
Adjusted research and development expenses were $238 million in the fourth quarter or 12% of sales. For the full year 2015, adjusted R&D expenses were $850 million or 11.4% of sales. We expect our full year 2016 adjusted R&D rate to be roughly 11.5%. Again, this includes a 50 basis point increase due to the reinvestment of the medical device tax, offset by increased efficiencies and improved utilization of our global footprint. 
Royalty expense was 0.9% of sales in both the fourth quarter and the full year 2015. This represents a 60 basis point reduction compared to the full year 2014 rate, and we expect our royalty rate to remain at approximately 1% of sales in 2016. 
On an adjusted basis, operating income was  $429 million in the quarter or 21.7% of sales, up 100 basis points year-over-year. We are very pleased with our consistent and adjusted operating margin improvement throughout 2015 as we saw year-over-year improvement of at least 100 basis points in each of the 4 quarters. 
Rhythm Management's adjusted operating margin in Q4 was 13.9%, down substantially from Q3 2015, which resulted in a second half 2015 Rhythm Management adjusted operating margin of 15.9% falling short of our respect to of 17% due to the timing of manufacturing variances and reserve charges as we transition our portfolio and prepare for new product launches in 2016. 
Full year 2015 Rhythm Management adjusted operating margin of 15% represents an improvement of 160 basis points over the full year 2014. 
And turning to 2016, we expect Rhythm Management adjusted operating margin to increase sequentially in Q1 versus Q4 of '15 with more noticeable improvement in Q2 as we begin to realize the full benefit of 2016 product costs and leverage the improved top line performance expected from the global CRM and EP franchises. In the second half 2016, Rhythm Management adjusted operating margin is also expected to benefit from our Plant Network Optimization program completed at the end of 2015, which transferred a portion of our EP effective tax rate to lower-cost locations. 
The net of all these factors drive our expectation for full year Rhythm Management adjusted operating margin to approach 18% for the full year 2016, and we remain confident in 20% plus in 2017. 
GAAP operating income, which includes GAAP to adjusted items of $700 million, was a loss of $271 million in Q4 2015. The primary GAAP to adjusted items for the quarter included restructuring-related charges of $26 million, acquisition-related SG&A expenses of $15 million, contingent consideration expense of $37 million, amortization expense of $135 million and litigation-related charges of $456 million. 
The $456 million in litigation-related net charges were primarily related to increases in our litigation reserve for a recent appellate court ruling in Maryland in the case, with the remainder related to a combination of increases in our transvaginal surgical product liability reserves and other adjustments. The Murawski case traces back to the mid-2000 and relates to licensing agreement on patents that have expired. We continue to believe the facts and the law do not support the court's findings or the amount of the damages, and we plan to seek review of the judgment by the Maryland Supreme Court. 
We increased our reserve this quarter as we became aware of additional claims during the quarter as we continue to work through the settlement evaluation process. Currently, our known claim count is approximately 35,000, and we've agreed in principle to settle over 10,000 of those 35,000 claims. 
We intend to continue to contest cases against those vigorously while also looking to settle when reasonable terms are presented. Our total legal reserve was $1,936,000,000 as of December 31, 2015. 
Separately, a case was recently filed against Boston Scientific in West Virginia regarding the resin use in our transvaginal mesh products. We are confident that the revenues in the manufacturing of these devices is neither counterfeit nor adulterated and meets required material biocompatibility and design specifications. We provided information and materials to a European notified body, the FDA and the Department of Justice regarding the resin, our quality processes and our commitment to producing medical devices of the highest quality. 
Now I'll move on to other income and expense. Interest expense for the quarter was $59 million compared to $54 million in Q4 of 2014. The increase was primarily due to the incremental debt raised in Q2 of 2015 to finance the AMS male urology portfolio acquisition. 
Our average interest rate was 3.9% [ph] in Q4 2015 compared to 4.8% in Q4 2014. The lower interest expense rate in Q4 2015 was primarily due to lower average cost of debt resulting from the senior notes refinancing completed in Q2 of 2015. 
Other expense was $10 million, and this consisted primarily of foreign exchange losses and investment losses incurred during the quarter. Our tax rate for the fourth quarter was 58% on a reported basis and 0.2% on an adjusted basis. 
Our Q4 adjusted tax rate includes $3.9 million [ph] of favorable discrete tax items and other onetime benefits primarily related to foreign exchange. Excluding these items, our Q4 operational tax rate would have been 13%. 
Now I'll provide a bit more detail on our full year 2015 adjusted tax rate where our guidance as of the third quarter had been 13%. As you may know, the U.S. R&D tax credit was permanently reinstated in December, which benefited the full year 2015 adjusted tax rate by slightly more than 100 basis points. We've decided to reinvest this benefit in our tax structure to improve long-term flexibility in our capital structure, the net result of this being a 13% adjusted tax rate for the full year excluding discrete and onetime tax items and a 9.2% rate including them. 
After this onetime investment, we continue to expect an approximately 100 basis point increase in our adjusted tax rate annually and therefore, continue to expect our full year 2016 adjusted tax rate to be approximately 14%. 
Finally, as mentioned, Q4 2015 adjusted EPS of $0.26 includes approximately $0.03 of unfavorable foreign exchange and represents 18% year-over-year growth or 31% growth, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. On a reported GAAP basis, Q4 2015 EPS was a loss of $0.11 and includes net charges and amortization expenses totaling $504 million after tax. 
The GAAP loss of $0.11 compares to a GAAP loss of $0.23 in the fourth quarter of 2014. For the full year 2015, we reported adjusted EPS of $0.93, exceeding our guidance range while absorbing $0.10 of unfavorable FX. 
Recall this is $0.02 more than we expected as of our Q3 2015 earnings call and $0.06 more than we expected at the beginning of 2015. Full year 2015 adjusted EPS grew 11% over prior year and 23% excluding the impact of foreign exchange. On a reported GAAP basis, 2015 EPS was a loss of $0.18 compared to a full year 2014 GAAP loss per share of $0.09. 
Moving onto the balance sheet. Days sales outstanding of 59 days increased 1 day compared to December of 2014. Days inventory on hand of 163 days was up 7 days compared to December of last year due primarily to the acquisition of the AMS male urology portfolio. 
Capital expenditures were $86 million in Q4 2015 compared to $79 million in Q4 2014. For the full year 2015, capital expenditures were $248 million. 
For the full year 2016, we expect capital expenditures to be roughly $100 million higher, primarily due to the construction of our new manufacturing facility and distribution center in Malaysia. Beyond 2016, we expect capital expenditures to return to our historical run rate of approximately $250 million annually. 
Adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was $448 million compared to $508 million in Q4 2014. Our full year 2015 adjusted free cash flow of $1,366,000,000 represents growth of 8% over the full year 2014. 
For 2016, we expect full year adjusted free cash flow to exceed $1.5 billion, representing growth of 10% and have a stretch goal to exceed $1.6 billion for the year with initiatives aimed at improving the working capital contribution to cash flow. 
In Q4, we repaid $150 million of our term loan and expect to repay an additional $250 million by the end of 2016, at which time, we expect our debt leverage will be consistent with our goal of returning to pre-AMS debt leverage by year-end. There were no share repurchases in the quarter, consistent with our decision to suspend the share repurchase program temporarily following the announcement of the AMS male urology portfolio acquisition. And near term, our capital allocation priorities are to repay debt, manage contingencies and pursue tuck-in M&A. 
We ended 2015 with 1,363,000,000 fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding, consistent with our prior guidance. We expect our share count to increase by roughly 5 million per quarter through the end of 2016 as we plan to keep the buyback suspended for the balance of 2016. We expect this to result in a fully diluted weighted average share count of approximately 1,380,000,000 for the full year 2016. 
I'd like to conclude with guidance for Q1 and full year 2016. For the full year, we expect consolidated revenue to be in a range of $7,900,000,000 to $8,100,000,000, which represents year-over-year growth of 4% to 7% on an organic basis, 7% to 10% on an operational basis and 6% to 8% on a reported basis. 
As a result of a stronger dollar and current rates, we expect foreign exchange to be a roughly $150 million headwind for the full year 2016 on revenue. We expect our adjusted gross margin for the year as a percentage of sales to be in a range of 72% to 73%. We expect foreign exchange to have an unfavorable impact of approximately 50 basis points on adjusted gross margin in 2016 as hedging contracts from our 3-year program are layered in. We expect this headwind be offset by favorable mix, market segmentation, the ramp of accretive new products and our standard cost-reduction programs. 
As mentioned, we expect our full year 2016 adjusted SG&A rate to be between 35.5% and 36.5% of sales and our full year R&D rate to be between 11% and 12% of sales. This implies a full year 2016 adjusted operating margin in the range of 23.5% to 24.5%, the midpoint of which represents 170 basis points of improvement over full year 2015. 
And importantly, we remain on track to achieve an adjusted operating margin of 25% plus in 2017. Full year 2016 interest expense is expected to be $245 million, about $10 million higher than the full year 2015 due to incremental debt raised in Q2 of 2015. 
As mentioned, we expect our tax rate for the full year 2016 to be approximately 14%. As a result, we expect adjusted earnings per share for the full year 2016 to be in a range of $1.03 to $1.07, representing 11% to 15% adjusted earnings per share growth. 
We expect 2016 adjusted earnings per share to be impacted negatively by approximately $0.06 of FX or roughly $80 million of adjusted income. In terms of timing, this $0.06 should be roughly $0.02 per quarter in Q1 and Q2 and $0.01 per quarter in Q3 and Q4. 
Excluding the $0.06 of unfavorable foreign exchange, our full year adjusted EPS guidance range represents growth of 17% to 21%. Despite this approximate $0.06 hit, we remain confident in our ability to deliver double-digit adjusted EPS growth. 
Let me walk you through the 2016 adjusted EPS guidance. We've delivered adjusted EPS of $0.93 in 2015, representing 11% growth or 23% growth excluding the $0.10 of negative FX impact. 
As you know, our stated goal is to grow EPS double digits, which would imply $1.02 in 2016. Adding $0.03 of AMS accretion gets us to $1.05, which is the midpoint of our guidance. We expect unfavorable FX of approximately $0.06, as I mentioned, but our goal is to offset this through operational initiatives and savings as we did in 2015, and as mentioned, the medical device tax is worth roughly 100 basis points on the OM line, but we intend to reinvest substantially all of that back into innovation and have developed the detailed plans to do so. 
On a GAAP basis, we expect EPS to be in a range of $0.62 to $0.67. Lastly, for 2016 our guidance assumes pretax amortization of approximately $534 million. 
Now turning to the first quarter of 2016. We expect consolidated revenues to be in a range of $1,890,000,000 to $1,940,000,000. If current foreign exchange rates hold constants, the headwind from foreign exchange should be approximately $45 million or 250 basis points relative to Q1 2015. 
We expect consolidated Q1 sales to grow year-over-year in a range of 4% to 6% organically and 9% to 11% operationally. 
For the first quarter, adjusted earnings per share is expected to be in a range of $0.23 to $0.25 per share, and GAAP earnings per share is expected to be in a range of $0.11 to $0.13 per share. 
I encourage you to check our Investor Relations website for Q4 2015 financial and operational highlights, which outlines Q4 results as well as Q1 and full year 2016 guidance, including P&L line item guidance. 
So with that, I will turn it back to Susie, who will moderate the Q&A."

The manufacturing and the inventory reserve charges are really in anticipation of the launches that might just mentioned around the MRI safe brady and the quad launch in the U.S. So those are kind of out of the way now at this point as opposed to having had to take those in different quarters. So I think the way I would think of it is the 13 9 in Q4, I'd expect a little bit of a sequential improvement in Q1, not a tremendous amount just a little bit. Q2 gets a little bit better than that, and really the back half is where it accelerates to get to that overall 18% for the year.

So really we are right on track. We're going to deliver our EPS accretion commitment of $0.03 in '16, and I think it's $0.07 in 2017. So the integrations has gone well. We've had exceptionally low turnover, and it's being met very well by the customers."

317627,321212230,926653,"Boston Scientific Corporation, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 04, 2016",2016-02-04,"Earnings Calls","Boston Scientific Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Susie, and good morning, everyone. In fourth quarter, Boston Scientific posted another quarter of strong results and closed out an excellent 2015 as we continued to execute against our strategic plan goals. At our May 2015 Investor Day meetin",2223,"Thank you, Susie, and good morning, everyone. 
In fourth quarter, Boston Scientific posted another quarter of strong results and closed out an excellent 2015 as we continued to execute against our strategic plan goals. At our May 2015 Investor Day meeting, we outlined plans to drive mid-single-digit organic revenue growth and consistent adjusted operating margin expansion, which, in turn, will drive double-digit adjusted EPS growth excluding the impact of FX. 
We are delivering against these objectives. In Q4, we grew worldwide sales 5% organically and 10% operationally, which includes the benefit of the AMS urology business. We also grew adjusted operating income by 10% in the fourth quarter, which represents 100 basis point year-over-year improvement to 21.7%. 
The solid revenue growth and margin expansion drove very strong 18% adjusted EPS growth to $0.26, and our fourth quarter results reflect our focus on delivering meaningful innovation, while also providing clinical and economic value to our hospital to customers. 
Importantly, our Q4 results built upon the consistent momentum generated over the past few years and contributed to the following full year '15 results. For the full year, we delivered 5% organic revenue growth and 8% operational revenue growth, which includes the acquired sales from Bayer Peripheral and AMS.
In parallel with the consistent revenue growth, we are driving a strong improvements through our operating margin. In 2014, we delivered 130-basis-point improvement in adjusted operating margin. In 2015, we delivered an additional 210-basis-point improvement to a full year 22.3%. In prior previous goals, we continue to expect to deliver 25% plus adjusted operating margin in 2017 with plans to deliver an additional 200 to 300 basis points of improvement by year-end 2020. 
We delivered full year of '15 adjusted EPS growth -- I'm sorry, EPS of $0.93, representing 11% growth for the full year. It's important to note that the 11% adjusted EPS growth includes a significant negative foreign exchange impact of $0.10 versus our original expectation of a $0.04 hit when we originally gave '15 guidance. We're very pleased that we're able to overcome this FX headwind while investing in the long-term growth of the company, yet still delivering on our commitment for double-digit adjusted EPS growth. 
We continue to believe that Boston Scientific is uniquely positioned to deliver differentiated shareholder value through durable mid-single-digit revenue growth and double-digit adjusted EPS growth via our ongoing operating margin improvement initiatives. We're excited by our 2016 and our plans to build upon our global momentum. 
In 2016, we're targeting full year organic revenue growth of 4% to 7% and operational revenue growth of 7% to 10%. We're guiding adjusted EPS to $1.03 to $1.07, which represents 11% to 15% earnings growth. Importantly, this EPS once again includes an expected $0.06 negative impact from foreign exchange. 
I'll now provide some highlights on fourth quarter and '15 results along with thoughts on our '16 outlook. In my remarks, I'll reference to growth in an organic year-over-year constant currency basis, unless otherwise specified. 
Our fourth quarter organic revenue growth of 5% was broad-based across businesses and regions. It's led by exciting new product launches, which continued; global expansion; and execution of our category leadership strategy. With the exception of the anticipated 1% decline in CRM sales, all of our other businesses grew organic revenue by at least 6%, led by 10% growth in PI. IC had a strong quarter, growing 6% against a very tough 10% comp in Q4 2014. And importantly, all 3 medical/surgical businesses grew revenue at 7%, while also improving segmented adjusted operating margin by 90 basis points year-over-year to 34.1%. 
We delivered another quarter of balanced global growth, led by 6% revenue growth in Asia, 5% growth in the U.S. and Europe. Another highlight was strong 15% revenue growth in emerging markets, led by 20% growth in China and Brazil. 
The MedSurg businesses continued to deliver. In Endoscopy, we delivered 7% growth in Q4, fueled by the strength of our portfolio, our expanding global commercial reach and ongoing launches of our SpyGlass DS and AXIOS Stents. SpyGlass DS was launched in July 2015, and is an advance single-use visualization system for the diagnosis and treatment of complex disorders of the pancreas and bile ducts. It's truly a cornerstone product that is highly differentiated and complementary to our core Endo portfolio. Our AXIOS Stent is used for transluminal drainage of pancreatic fluid collections and is also off to a strong start. We'll continue to innovate in endoscopic ultrasound and other exciting therapeutic categories, including pulmonary and oncology, to further enhance our global leadership in Endoscopy. 
Urology and Pelvic Health also continued a strong performance trend, growing 7% organically in Q4, led by laser fibers, capital equipment and strong international growth. Importantly, this quarter, we launched LithoVue, a disposable uterus scope, which provides customers with visualization and navigation capabilities to diagnose and treat stones and other conditions of the kidney, uterus and bladder. And after closing the AMS Urology acquisition in August, we remain on track to realize our adjusted EPS accretion goals of at least $0.03 in 2016 and $0.07 in 2017. 
Neuromodulation revenue grew 7% in the fourth quarter, led by strong growth in both the U.S. and international. Sales were driven by the market-leading Spectra platform and the launch of Precision Novi, our first product of the primary cell non-rechargeable market. 
In addition, we're seeing really promising uptake of our precise Deep Brain Stimulation system due to its Cartesian directional lead system and our partnership with Brainlab. Our U.S. DBS trial's making progress, and we expect to complete enrollment in 2016 and enter the market in late 2017 or early '18. 
Our Cardiovascular group grew 7% in Q4, led by impressive 10% growth in Peripheral Interventions. The core PI business continues to execute, and we're very pleased with integration of the legacy Bayer business. The legacy Bayer business grew over 20% for the second quarter in a row as we continue to grow share in the atherectomy market, and we're encouraged by our early results from the global launch of our ZelanteDVT catheter and the U.S. launch of our Innova Stent for the SFA. We also recently began to enroll our IMPERIAL U.S. IDE trial for Eluvia, our drug-eluting stent, and remain on track for a European launch of Eluvia this quarter. 
In addition, we recently closed the CeloNova transaction, which is a synergistic tuck-in acquisition focused on the treatment of liver cancer via localized delivery of chemotherapeutic agents. 
And finally in PI, we continue to benefit from our commercial relationship with C.R. Bard and the Lutonix Drug Coated Balloon technology. 
Interventional Cardiology continues to deliver, with 6% growth in the quarter, which represents the sixth consecutive quarter of plus 6% growth in IC. Growth was led by worldwide imaging, U.S. and European drug-eluting stents, our complex PCI portfolio and structural heart. 
PCI guidance grew low-teens globally, and we're encouraged by the market enthusiasm of our fractional flow reserve platform. In DES, the U.S. synergy launch is going well. We anticipate that synergy will represent approximately 50% of our DES revenue mix in the U.S. by the end of 2016. 
In addition, we're launching SYNERGY in Japan, and we'll continue to expand SYNERGY in other international markets. We also continue to divest and build upon a strong clinical evidence for SYNERGY as we have initiated the EVOLVE Short DAPT Study. 
Finally, the IC performance was fueled by our strengthening structural heart business, which includes our Lotus Aortic Valve and WATCHMAN Left Atrial Appendage Closure Device. We're truly in an exciting position to drive growth and share gains over the long run in these fast-growing markets. 
Lotus delivered a strong quarter for the -- in the European market as the platform continues to build momentum despite our near-term size major [ph] limitations. Lotus offers physicians excellent control during implantation and best-in-class paravalvular leakage rates. In our RESPOND Post-Market Study, 95.1% of patients had 0 to trace PVL.
Importantly, we completed enrollment in our REPRISE III IDE study in December, which we anticipate will position us for a late 2017 U.S. market entrance. We're also pleased to announce completion of the 1,000-patient RESPOND Lotus Post-Market Study and those results will be presented at EuroPCR in May. We're expanding the Lotus platform and expect to launch our next-gen 14 French delivery system along with additional sizes in Europe this year. 
Also in structural heart, the U.S. WATCHMAN launch continues to progress ahead of plan. We're pleased with the implant success rates and the high quality of patient outcomes thus far, which reflect our controlled rollout and proven training program. 
In addition, Dr. Vivek Reddy of Mount Sinai recently published in JACC a study highlighting WATCHMAN's cost-effectiveness versus both warfarin and novel oral anticoagulants. In the U.S., we opened more than 100 WATCHMAN accounts in 2015 and expect to open an additional 100 accounts in 2016. 
In Europe, we're looking forward to a full launch of our second-gen WATCHMAN FLX, which also -- which already has CE Mark. As our U.S. reimbursement, we will await final NCD decision from CMS by February 8, and we remain confident that WATCHMAN will represent at least a $500 million worldwide market opportunity. 
So overall, we're very pleased with our progress in structural heart and excited about our capabilities and the long-term prospects for this business. We exceeded our full year of '15 structural heart revenue goal of $75 million to $100 million, and in 2016, we anticipate structural heart sales between $175 million and $200 million. 
Now turning to CRM. On our first quarter '15 earnings call, we projected a slowdown in our worldwide CRM sales for the balance of '15 and through first quarter '16, primarily due to replacement cycle headwinds and competitive launches in the U.S. Our forecast is accurate as global CRM sales declined 1% in Q4. However, we're very encouraged about our forward-looking CRM position given the strong cadence of new launches expected in the U.S. and Japan in '16, our leading position and growing awareness of S-ICD and our replacement cycle headwind becoming more favorable as we exit 2016. 
In the U.S., we plan to launch our full X4 quad system with our ACCOLADE brady MRI-safe system in the first half and the EMBLEM MRI-safe in the second half of '16. And we anticipate these releases will strengthen 2016 CRM performance, particularly in the second half. 
Pacemaker sales again grew 2%, and we recently launched X4 CRT-P quad device. And while our ICD sales declined 2%, we continue to be pleased with our de novo ICD performance, in the EMBLEM S-ICD in particular. EMBLEM continues to drive strong growth in de novo shared gains in both the Europe and the U.S. EMBLEM is building momentum globally, and we look forward to launching EMBLEM in Japan this quarter with a reimbursement premium and expanding S-ICD to additional international markets in 2016. 
In Europe, we continue to gain share and grow our CRM business in the mid-single-digit range with our complete portfolio. These consistent European CRM results are encouraging as we look forward to our anticipated U.S. approvals in '16. 
Lastly in CRM, we're continuously mounting third-party evidence of the economic benefits associated with our EnduraLife extended battery technology. And recently, another third-party data set from the Europace was published, demonstrating the 6-year survival of BSC CRT-Ds over our competitors. 
Also, recent U.S. study modeled a 14% reduction in Medicare cost from a 2-year increase in ICD battery longevity. And an Italian study showed Extended Longevity drove a 29% to 34% reduction in long-term health care costs over a 15-year period. 
Turning to our EP business. We delivered 8% growth in the quarter. Arrhythmia platform continues to rollout nicely, driven by new installations and higher case volumes. We have a strong arrhythmia customer pipeline in 2016 as well as new platform enhancements scheduled for release. 
We did see some softness in EP in fourth quarter, primarily driven by the delay in our European launch of our IntellaMap ablation catheter, which we anticipate launching later in the first quarter. We continue to strengthen our EP business, and we look forward to continued progress in 2016. 
Our strategy of category leadership is working, and it's helping us to become a stronger partner with our global customers. As the health care environment continues to evolve, we're building new capabilities to support our customers be on our part of portfolio with our ADVANTICS solutions offerings. These offerings are focused on driving operational excellence within Cardiovascular and GI labs and improving a standardizing care for chronic cardiovascular diseases. And just last week, we announced an alliance with Accenture to develop a data-driven digital health solution to improve patient outcomes and reduce costs to treat patients with chronic cardiovascular diseases. 
So to wrap up my section, our company has great momentum, and our 2015 results reflect the strength of our portfolio and our ongoing investment into faster growth markets, our globalization efforts and the execution of our global teams. More importantly, we believe that we are well positioned to continue and strengthen our performance track record in 2016 and beyond. I would like to thank our employees for their winning spirit and a great commitment to Boston Scientific. 
Now let me turn the call over to Dan for a more detailed review of our financials."
317627,321212230,926653,"Boston Scientific Corporation, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 04, 2016",2016-02-04,"Earnings Calls","Boston Scientific Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Mike. I'll start with some overall perspective on the quarter before getting into the details. We generated adjusted earnings per share of $0.26, exceeding the high end of our guidance range of $0.23 to $0.25 and representing 18% year-over-year",2750,"Thanks, Mike. I'll start with some overall perspective on the quarter before getting into the details. 
We generated adjusted earnings per share of $0.26, exceeding the high end of our guidance range of $0.23 to $0.25 and representing 18% year-over-year growth in the quarter. Excluding a $0.03 unfavorable foreign exchange impact, Q4 adjusted earnings per share grew 31% year-over-year. The strong performance in Q4 was driven primarily by operational revenue growth and gross margin expansion. 
Our Q4 2015 adjusted operating margin of 21.7% represents an improvement of 100 basis points over the fourth quarter of 2014. For the full year 2015, total company adjusted operating margin expanded by 210 basis points over the full year of '14, and we effectively offset a $0.10 FX headwind through operational savings and initiatives. 
Our full year 2015 adjusted earnings per share of $0.93 represents 11% growth and 23% growth excluding FX versus 2014. 
Now for the P&L highlights. For the fourth quarter of 2015, consolidated revenue of $1,978,000,000 represented operational growth of 10%, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange. Excluding an approximate 500 basis point contribution from the AMS male urology portfolio, organic revenue growth was 5% in the quarter. 
On an as-reported basis, revenue grew 5% year-over-year. The foreign exchange impact on sales was a $110 million headwind compared to the prior year period, which was about $25 million worse than we assumed in our Q4 guidance range. 
Adjusted gross margin for the fourth quarter was 72.8%, increasing 140 basis points year-over-year. The increase resulted primarily from cost improvements, driven by our value improvement programs, as the impact of foreign exchange was negligible in the quarter. 
For the full year 2015, adjusted gross margin was 72% compared to 70.7% for the full year 2014. The 130 basis point full year adjusted gross margin improvement was driven by benefits of 180 and 50 basis points from cost improvements and FX, respectively. This was partially offset by 100 basis points of headwind attributed primarily to price. 
Adjusted SG&A expenses were $757 million or 38.3% of sales in the fourth quarter, down 10 basis points year-over-year. The Q4 rate includes 80 basis points of higher spend related to fixed asset write-offs, full year related benefits and litigation fees. 
Our full year 2015 adjusted SG&A rate of 37.4% is down 50 basis points versus the full year 2014. As a reminder, the medical device tax has been suspended for 2016 and 2017, which would benefit our adjusted SG&A rate by roughly 100 basis points annually. We're pleased to see that this tax has been temporarily suspended and intend to reinvest virtually all of the benefit into jobs, innovation, R&D, collaborations with universities and other initiatives that will help treat patients and sustain top line growth over the long term. 
We expect the reinvestment of approximately 100 basis points to be split roughly equally between R&D and SG&A. Our guidance for full year 2016 assumes our adjusted SG&A rate will come down by a total of 140 basis points at the midpoint, which breaks down into 50 basis points from the medical device tax suspension and 90 basis points from operational improvements. 
Adjusted research and development expenses were $238 million in the fourth quarter or 12% of sales. For the full year 2015, adjusted R&D expenses were $850 million or 11.4% of sales. We expect our full year 2016 adjusted R&D rate to be roughly 11.5%. Again, this includes a 50-basis-point increase due to the reinvestment of the medical device tax, offset by increased efficiencies and improved utilization of our global footprint. 
Royalty expense was 0.9% of sales in both the fourth quarter and the full year 2015. This represents a 60-basis-point reduction compared to the full year 2014 rate, and we expect our royalty rate to remain at approximately 1% of sales in 2016. 
On an adjusted basis, operating income was $429 million in the quarter or 21.7% of sales, up 100 basis points year-over-year. We are very pleased with our consistent adjusted operating margin improvement throughout 2015 as we saw year-over-year improvement of at least 100 basis points in each of the 4 quarters. 
Rhythm Management's adjusted operating margin in Q4 was 13.9%, down substantially from Q3 2015, which resulted in a second half 2015 Rhythm Management adjusted operating margin of 15.9%, falling short of our expectation of 17% due to the timing of manufacturing variances and reserve charges as we transition our portfolio and prepare for new product launches in 2016. Full year 2015 Rhythm Management adjusted operating margin of 15% represents an improvement of 160 basis points over the full year 2014. 
And turning to 2016, we expect Rhythm Management adjusted operating margin to increase sequentially in Q1 versus Q4 of '15, with more noticeable improvement in Q2 as we begin to realize the full benefit of 2016 product costs and leverage the improved top line performance expected from the global CRM and EP franchises. And the second half 2016 Rhythm Management adjusted operating margin is also expected to benefit from our Plant Network Optimization program completed at the end of 2015, which transferred a portion of our EP manufacturing to lower-cost locations. 
The net of all these factors drive our expectation for full year Rhythm Management adjusted operating margin to approach 18% for the full year 2016, and we remain confident in 20% plus in 2017. 
GAAP operating income, which includes GAAP to adjusted items of $700 million, was a loss of $271 million in Q4 2015. The primary GAAP to adjusted items for the quarter included restructuring-related charges of $26 million, acquisition-related SG&A expenses of $15 million, contingent consideration expense of $37 million, amortization expense of $135 million and litigation-related charges of $456 million. 
The $456 million in litigation-related net charges were primarily related to increases in our litigation reserve for a recent appellate court ruling in Maryland in the Mirowski case, with the remainder related to a combination of increases in our transvaginal surgical mesh product liability reserves and other adjustments. The Mirowski case traces back to the mid-2000 and relates to licensing agreement on patents that have expired. We continue to believe that the facts and the law do not support the court's findings or the amount of the damages, and we plan to seek review of the judgment by the Maryland Supreme Court. 
We increased our mesh reserve this quarter as we became aware of additional claims during the quarter as we continue to work through the settlement evaluation process. Currently, our known claim count is approximately 35,000, and we've agreed in principle to settle over 10,000 of those 35,000 claims. We intend to continue to contest cases against us vigorously, while also looking to settle when reasonable terms are presented. Our total legal reserve was $1,936,000,000 as of December 31, 2015. 
Separately, a case was recently filed against Boston Scientific in West Virginia regarding the resin use in our transvaginal mesh products. We are confident that the resin used in the manufacturing of these devices is neither counterfeit nor adulterated and meets required material biocompatibility and design specifications. We've provided information and materials to DEKRA, a European notified body, the FDA and the Department of Justice regarding the resin, our quality processes and our commitment to producing medical devices of the highest quality. 
Now I'll move on to other income and expense. Interest expense for the quarter was $59 million compared to $54 million in Q4 of 2014. The increase was primarily due to the incremental debt raised in Q2 of 2015 to finance the AMS male urology portfolio acquisition. 
Our average interest rate was 3.9% in Q4 2015 compared to 4.8% in Q4 2014. The lower interest expense rate in Q4 2015 was primarily due to lower average cost of debt resulting from the senior notes refinancing completed in Q2 of 2015. 
Other expense was $10 million, and this consisted primarily of foreign exchange losses and investment losses incurred during the quarter. Our tax rate for the fourth quarter was 58% on a reported basis and 0.2% on an adjusted basis. 
Our Q4 adjusted tax rate includes $3.9 million of favorable discrete tax items and other onetime benefits primarily related to foreign exchange. Excluding these items, our Q4 operational tax rate would have been 13%. 
Now I'll provide a bit more detail on our full year 2015 adjusted tax rate, where our guidance as of the third quarter had been 13%. As you may know, the U.S. R&D tax credit was permanently reinstated in December, which benefited the full year 2015 adjusted tax rate by slightly more than 100 basis points. We've decided to reinvest this benefit in our tax structure to improve long-term flexibility in our capital structure. The net result of this being a 13% adjusted tax rate for the full year excluding discrete and onetime tax items and a 9.2% rate including them. After this onetime investment, we continue to expect an approximately 100-basis-point increase in our adjusted tax rate annually, and therefore continue to expect our full year 2016 adjusted tax rate to be approximately 14%. 
Finally, as mentioned, Q4 2015 adjusted EPS of $0.26 includes approximately $0.03 of unfavorable foreign exchange and represents 18% year-over-year growth or 31% growth, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. On a reported GAAP basis, Q4 2015 EPS was a loss of $0.11 and includes net charges and amortization expenses totaling $504 million after tax. The GAAP loss of $0.11 compares to a GAAP loss of $0.23 in the fourth quarter of 2014. For the full year 2015, we reported adjusted EPS of $0.93, exceeding our guidance range while absorbing $0.10 of unfavorable FX. Recall this is $0.02 more than we expected as of our Q3 2015 earnings call and $0.06 more than we had expected at the beginning of 2015. 
Full year 2015 adjusted EPS grew 11% over prior year and 23% excluding the impact of foreign exchange. On a reported GAAP basis, 2015 EPS was a loss of $0.18 compared to a full year 2014 GAAP loss per share of $0.09. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. Days sales outstanding of 59 days, increased 1 day compared to December of 2014. Days inventory on hand of 163 days, was up 7 days compared to December of last year due primarily to the acquisition of the AMS male urology portfolio. 
Capital expenditures were $86 million in Q4 2015 compared to $79 million in Q4 2014. For the full year 2015, capital expenditures were $248 million. For the full year 2016, we expect capital expenditures to be roughly $100 million higher, primarily due to the construction of our new manufacturing facility and distribution center in Malaysia. Beyond 2016, we expect capital expenditures to return to our historical run rate of approximately $250 million annually. 
Adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was $448 million compared to $508 million in Q4 2014. Our full year 2015 adjusted free cash flow of $1,366,000,000 represents growth of 8% over the full year 2014. For 2016, we expect full year adjusted free cash flow to exceed $1.5 billion, representing growth of 10%, and have a stretch goal to exceed $1.6 billion for the year with initiatives aimed at improving the working capital contribution to cash flow. 
In Q4, we repaid $150 million of our term loan and expect to repay an additional $250 million by the end of 2016. At which time, we expect our debt leverage will be consistent with our goal of returning to pre-AMS debt leverage by year-end. There were no share repurchases in the quarter, consistent with our decision to suspend the share repurchase program temporarily following the announcement of the AMS male urology portfolio acquisition. At near term, our capital allocation priorities are to repay debt, manage contingencies and pursue tuck-in M&A. 
We ended 2015 with 1,363,000,000 fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding, consistent with our prior guidance. We expect our share count to increase by roughly 5 million per quarter through the end of 2016 as we plan to keep the buyback suspended for the balance of 2016. We expect this to result in a fully diluted weighted average share count of approximately 1,380,000,000 for the full year 2016. 
I'd like to conclude with guidance for Q1 and full year 2016. For the full year, we expect consolidated revenue to be in the range of $7,900,000,000 to $8,100,000,000, which represents year-over-year growth of 4% to 7% on an organic basis, 7% to 10% on an operational basis and 6% to 8% on a reported basis. 
As a result of a stronger dollar at current rates, we expect foreign exchange to be a roughly $150 million headwind for the full year 2016 on revenue. We expect our adjusted gross margin for the year, as a percentage of sales, to be in a range of 72% to 73%. We expect foreign exchange to have an unfavorable impact of approximately 50 basis points on adjusted gross margin in 2016 as hedging contracts from our 3-year program are layered in. We expect this headwind be offset by a favorable mix, market segmentation, the ramp of accretive new products and our standard cost-reduction programs. 
As mentioned, we expect our full year 2016 adjusted SG&A rate to be between 35.5% and 36.5% of sales and our full year R&D rate to be between 11% and 12% of sales. This implies a full year 2016 adjusted operating margin in the range of 23.5% to 24.5%, the midpoint of which represents 170 basis points of improvement over full year 2015. 
And importantly, we remain on track to achieve an adjusted operating margin of 25% plus in 2017. Full year 2016 interest expense is expected to be $245 million, about $10 million higher than the full year 2015 due to incremental debt raised in Q2 of 2015. 
As mentioned, we expect our tax rate for the full year 2016 to be approximately 14%. As a result, we expect adjusted earnings per share for the full year 2016 to be in a range of $1.03 to $1.07, representing 11% to 15% adjusted earnings per share growth. We expect 2016 adjusted earnings per share to be impacted negatively by approximately $0.06 of FX or roughly $80 million of adjusted income. In terms of timing, this $0.06 should be roughly $0.02 per quarter in Q1 and Q2 and $0.01 per quarter in Q3 and Q4. 
Excluding the $0.06 of unfavorable foreign exchange, our full year adjusted EPS guidance range represents growth of 17% to 21%. Despite this approximate $0.06 hit, we remain confident in our ability to deliver double-digit adjusted EPS growth. 
Let me walk you through the 2016 adjusted EPS guidance. We delivered adjusted EPS of $0.93 in 2015, representing 11% growth or 23% growth excluding the $0.10 of negative FX impact. As you know, our stated goal is to grow EPS double digits, which would imply $1.02 in 2016. Adding $0.03 of AMS accretion gets us to $1.05, which is the midpoint of our guidance. 
We expect unfavorable FX of approximately $0.06, as I mentioned, but our goal is to offset this through operational initiatives and savings as we did in 2015. And as mentioned, the medical device tax is worth roughly 100 basis points on the OM line, but we intend to reinvest substantially all of that back into innovation and have developed the detailed plans to do so. On a GAAP basis, we expect EPS to be in a range of $0.62 to $0.67. Lastly, for 2016 our guidance assumes pretax amortization of approximately $534 million. 
Now turning to the first quarter of 2016. We expect consolidated revenues to be in a range of $1,890,000,000 to $1,940,000,000. If current foreign exchange rates hold constant, the headwind from foreign exchange should be approximately $45 million or 250 basis points relative to Q1 2015. 
We expect consolidated Q1 sales to grow year-over-year in a range of 4% to 6% organically and 9% to 11% operationally. 
For the first quarter, adjusted earnings per share is expected to be in a range of $0.23 to $0.25 per share, and GAAP earnings per share is expected to be in a range of $0.11 to $0.13 per share. 
I encourage you to check our Investor Relations website for Q4 2015 financial and operational highlights, which outlines Q4 results as well as Q1 and full year 2016 guidance, including P&L line item guidance. 
So with that, I will turn it back to Susie, who will moderate the Q&A."

We're expanding that, and we're going to be moving beyond the replacement cycle headwind. In terms of the product launches, we feel comfortable with a second quarter launch of both the quad system and MRI pacer. The MRI pacer likely slipped a little bit out of first quarter into second quarter. We'll also have EMBLEM MRI approval likely in the third quarter of 2016. So big, big approvals in the second quarter and third quarter. And then as we go forward with the ICD MRI capability, we'll start that trial very quickly here, and we anticipate approval of that product likely in second quarter or third quarter of 2017. So we've got a really strong cadence of product approvals coming, MRI capabilities. But I think what's most unique about our offering is this S-ICD momentum that we're seeing around the world. We just received approval in Japan. We have a 5% premium -- reimbursement premium in Japan, continued strong acceptance of the product and training in a multiyear head start. So as you looked at our business going forward, these product cadence will come through. SICD is continuing to grow, and our replacement cycle headwind will reverse itself.

So that's happening. And we likely we'll see continued softness in Q1, but improving in terms of the legacy AMS business, and that's been offset by the BSC legacy business. As we go forward in the second quarter, we expect that legacy AMS business to grow much closer to the BSC overall growth rate. And then we'll see additional benefit on top of that as we see synergies between the BPH portfolio, the stone portfolio, the ED portfolio and the incontinence portfolio overall. So really, we're right on track. We're going to deliver our EPS accretion commitment of $0.03 in '16, and I think it's $0.07 in 2017. So the integration's going well.

So we continue to register new products, add commercial capabilities, we're building R&D capabilities, new education training centers. I just got back from there last night. So we put a lot of time and effort in it. We just did a joint venture deal with Frankenman there in the endo business.

317627,321212230,926870,"Boston Scientific Corporation, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 04, 2016",2016-02-04,"Earnings Calls","Boston Scientific Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Susie, and good morning, everyone. In fourth quarter, Boston Scientific posted another quarter of strong results and closed out an excellent 2015 as we continued to execute against our strategic plan goals. At our May 2015 Investor Day meetin",2224,"Thank you, Susie, and good morning, everyone. 
In fourth quarter, Boston Scientific posted another quarter of strong results and closed out an excellent 2015 as we continued to execute against our strategic plan goals. At our May 2015 Investor Day meeting, we outlined plans to drive mid-single-digit organic revenue growth and consistent adjusted operating margin expansion, which, in turn, will drive double-digit adjusted EPS growth excluding the impact of FX. 
We are delivering against these objectives. In Q4, we grew worldwide sales 5% organically and 10% operationally, which includes the benefit of the AMS urology business. We also grew adjusted operating income by 10% in the fourth quarter, which represents 100 basis point year-over-year improvement to 21.7%. 
The solid revenue growth and margin expansion drove very strong 18% adjusted EPS growth to $0.26, and our fourth quarter results reflect our focus on delivering meaningful innovation, while also providing clinical and economic value to our hospital to customers. 
Importantly, our Q4 results built upon the consistent momentum generated over the past few years and contributed to the following full year '15 results. For the full year, we delivered 5% organic revenue growth and 8% operational revenue growth, which includes the acquired sales from Bayer Peripheral and AMS.
In parallel with the consistent revenue growth, we are driving a strong improvements through our operating margin. In 2014, we delivered 130-basis-point improvement in adjusted operating margin. In 2015, we delivered an additional 210-basis-point improvement to a full year 22.3%. In per our previous goals, we continue to expect to deliver 25% plus adjusted operating margin in 2017 with plans to deliver an additional 200 to 300 basis points of improvement by year-end 2020. 
We delivered full year of '15 adjusted EPS growth -- I'm sorry, EPS of $0.93, representing 11% growth for the full year. It's important to note that the 11% adjusted EPS growth includes a significant negative foreign exchange impact of $0.10 versus our original expectation of a $0.04 hit when we originally gave '15 guidance. We're very pleased that we're able to overcome this FX headwind while investing in the long-term growth of the company, yet still delivering on our commitment for double-digit adjusted EPS growth. 
We continue to believe that Boston Scientific is uniquely positioned to deliver differentiated shareholder value through durable mid-single-digit revenue growth and double-digit adjusted EPS growth to beat our ongoing operating margin improvement initiatives. We're excited by our 2016 and our plans to build upon our global momentum. 
In 2016, we're targeting full year organic revenue growth of 4% to 7% and operational revenue growth of 7% to 10%. We're guiding adjusted EPS to $1.03 to $1.07, which represents 11% to 15% earnings growth. Importantly, this EPS once again includes an expected $0.06 negative impact from foreign exchange. 
I'll now provide some highlights on fourth quarter and '15 results along with thoughts on our '16 outlook. In my remarks, I'll reference to growth in an organic year-over-year constant currency basis, unless otherwise specified. 
Our fourth quarter organic revenue growth of 5% was broad-based across businesses and regions. It's led by exciting new product launches, which continued; global expansion; and execution of our category leadership strategy. With the exception of the anticipated 1% decline in CRM sales, all of our other businesses grew organic revenue by at least 6%, led by 10% growth in PI. IC had a strong quarter, growing 6% against a very tough 10% comp in Q4 2014. And importantly, all 3 medical/surgical businesses grew revenue at 7%, while also improving segmented adjusted operating margin by 90 basis points year-over-year to 34.1%. 
We delivered another quarter of balanced global growth, led by 6% revenue growth in Asia, 5% growth in the U.S. and Europe. Another highlight was strong 15% revenue growth in emerging markets, led by 20% growth in China and Brazil. 
The MedSurg businesses continued to deliver. In Endoscopy, we delivered 7% growth in Q4, fueled by the strength of our portfolio, our expanding global commercial reach and ongoing launches of our SpyGlass DS and AXIOS Stents. SpyGlass DS was launched in July 2015, and is an advanced single-use visualization system for the diagnosis and treatment of complex disorders of the pancreas and bile ducts. It's truly a cornerstone product that is highly differentiated and complementary to our core Endo portfolio. Our AXIOS Stent is used for transluminal drainage of pancreatic fluid collections and is also off to a strong start. We'll continue to innovate in endoscopic ultrasound and other exciting therapeutic categories, including pulmonary and oncology, to further enhance our global leadership in Endoscopy. 
Urology and Pelvic Health also continued a strong performance trend, growing 7% organically in Q4, led by laser fibers, capital equipment and strong international growth. Importantly, this quarter, we launched LithoVue, a disposable uterus scope, which provides customers with visualization and navigation capabilities to diagnose and treat stones and other conditions of the kidney, uterus and bladder. And after closing the AMS Urology acquisition in August, we remain on track to realize our adjusted EPS accretion goals of at least $0.03 in 2016 and $0.07 in 2017. 
Neuromodulation revenue grew 7% in the fourth quarter, led by strong growth in both the U.S. and international. Sales were driven by the market-leading Spectra platform and the launch of Precision Novi, our first product of the primary cell non-rechargeable market. 
In addition, we're seeing really promising uptake of our precise Deep Brain Stimulation system due to its Cartesian directional lead system and our partnership with Brainlab. Our U.S. DBS trial is making progress, and we expect to complete enrollment in 2016 and enter the market in late 2017 or early '18. 
Our Cardiovascular group grew 7% in Q4, led by impressive 10% growth in Peripheral Interventions. The core PI business continues to execute, and we're very pleased with integration of the legacy Bayer business. The legacy Bayer business grew over 20% for the second quarter in a row as we continue to grow share in the atherectomy market, and we're encouraged by our early results from the global launch of our ZelanteDVT catheter and the U.S. launch of our Innova Stent for the SFA. We also recently began to enroll our IMPERIAL U.S. IDE trial for Eluvia, our drug-eluting stent, and remain on track for a European launch of Eluvia this quarter. 
In addition, we recently closed the CeloNova transaction, which is a synergistic tuck-in acquisition focused on the treatment of liver cancer via localized delivery of chemotherapeutic agents. 
And finally in PI, we continue to benefit from our commercial relationship with C.R. Bard and the Lutonix Drug Coated Balloon technology. 
Interventional Cardiology continues to deliver, with 6% growth in the quarter, which represents the sixth consecutive quarter of plus 6% growth in IC. Growth was led by worldwide imaging, U.S. and European drug-eluting stents, our complex PCI portfolio and structural heart. 
PCI guidance grew low-teens globally, and we're encouraged by the market enthusiasm of our integrated fractional flow reserve platform. In DES, the U.S. SYNERGY launch is going extremely well. We anticipate that SYNERGY will represent approximately 50% of our DES revenue mix in the U.S. by the end of 2016. 
In addition, we're launching SYNERGY in Japan, and we'll continue to expand SYNERGY in other international markets. We also continue to invest in building upon a strong clinical evidence for SYNERGY as we have initiated the EVOLVE Short DAPT Study. 
Finally, the IC performance was fueled by our strengthening structural heart business, which includes our Lotus Aortic Valve and WATCHMAN Left Atrial Appendage Closure Device. We're truly in an exciting position to drive growth and share gains over the long run in these fast-growing markets. 
Lotus delivered a strong quarter for the -- in the European market as the platform continues to build momentum despite our near-term size matrix limitations. Lotus offers physicians excellent control during implantation and best-in-class paravalvular leakage rates. In our RESPOND Post-Market Study, 95.1% of patients had 0 to trace PVL.
Importantly, we completed enrollment in our REPRISE III IDE study in December, which we anticipate will position us for a late 2017 U.S. market entrance. We're also pleased to announce completion of the 1,000-patient RESPOND Lotus Post-Market Study and those results will be presented at EuroPCR in May. We're expanding the Lotus platform and expect to launch our next-gen 14 French delivery system along with additional sizes in Europe this year. 
Also in structural heart, the U.S. WATCHMAN launch continues to progress ahead of plan. We're pleased with the implant success rates and the high quality of patient outcomes thus far, which reflect our controlled rollout and proven training program. 
In addition, Dr. Vivek Reddy of Mount Sinai recently published in JACC a study highlighting WATCHMAN's cost-effectiveness versus both warfarin and novel oral anticoagulants. In the U.S., we opened more than 100 WATCHMAN accounts in 2015 and expect to open an additional 100 accounts in 2016. 
In Europe, we're looking forward to a full launch of our second-gen WATCHMAN FLX, which also -- which already has CE Mark. After U.S. reimbursement, we will await final NCD decision from CMS by February 8, and we remain confident that WATCHMAN will represent at least a $500 million worldwide market opportunity. 
So overall, we're very pleased with our progress in structural heart and excited about our capabilities and the long-term prospects for this business. We exceeded our full year of '15 structural heart revenue goal of $75 million to $100 million, and in 2016, we anticipate structural heart sales between $175 million and $200 million. 
Now turning to CRM. On our first quarter '15 earnings call, we projected a slowdown in our worldwide CRM sales for the balance of '15 and through first quarter '16, primarily due to replacement cycle headwinds and competitive launches in the U.S. Our forecast is accurate as global CRM sales declined 1% in Q4. However, we're very encouraged about our forward-looking CRM position given the strong cadence of new launches expected in the U.S. and Japan in '16, our leading position and growing awareness of S-ICD and our replacement cycle headwind becoming more favorable as we exit 2016. 
In the U.S., we plan to launch our full X4 quad system with our ACCOLADE brady MRI-safe system in the first half and the EMBLEM MRI-safe in the second half of '16. And we anticipate these releases will strengthen 2016 CRM performance, particularly in the second half. 
Pacemaker sales again grew 2%, and we recently launched X4 CRT-P quad device. And while our ICD sales declined 2%, we continue to be pleased with our de novo ICD performance in the EMBLEM S-ICD in particular. EMBLEM continues to drive strong growth in de novo shared gains in both the Europe and the U.S. EMBLEM is building momentum globally, and we look forward to launching EMBLEM in Japan this quarter with a reimbursement premium and expanding S-ICD to additional international markets in 2016. 
In Europe, we continue to gain share and grow our CRM business in the mid-single-digit range with our complete portfolio. These consistent European CRM results are encouraging as we look forward to our anticipated U.S. approvals in '16. 
Lastly in CRM, we're continuously mounting third-party evidence of the economic benefits associated with our EnduraLife extended battery technology. And recently, another third-party data set from the Europace was published, demonstrating the 6-year survival of BSC CRT-Ds over our competitors. 
Also, recent U.S. study modeled a 14% reduction in Medicare cost from a 2-year increase in ICD battery longevity. And an Italian study showed Extended Longevity drove a 29% to 34% reduction in long-term health care costs over a 15-year period. 
Turning to our EP business. We delivered 8% growth in the quarter. Arrhythmia platform continues to rollout nicely, driven by new installations and higher case volumes. We have a strong arrhythmia customer pipeline in 2016 as well as new platform enhancements scheduled for release. 
We did see some softness in EP in fourth quarter, primarily driven by the delay in our European launch of our IntellaMap ablation catheter, which we anticipate launching later in the first quarter. We continue to strengthen our EP business, and we look forward to continued progress in 2016. 
Our strategy of category leadership is working, and it's helping us to become a stronger partner with our global customers. As the health care environment continues to evolve, we're building new capabilities to support our customers beyond our product portfolio with our ADVANTICS solutions offerings. These offerings are focused on driving operational excellence within Cardiovascular and GI labs and improving a standardizing care for chronic cardiovascular diseases. And just last week, we announced an alliance with Accenture to develop a data-driven digital health solution to improve patient outcomes and reduce costs to treat patients with chronic cardiovascular diseases. 
So to wrap up my section, our company has great momentum, and our 2015 results reflect the strength of our portfolio and our ongoing investment into faster growth markets, our globalization efforts and the execution of our global teams. More importantly, we believe that we are well positioned to continue and strengthen our performance track record in 2016 and beyond. I would like to thank our employees for their winning spirit and a great commitment to Boston Scientific. 
Now let me turn the call over to Dan for a more detailed review of our financials."
317627,321212230,926870,"Boston Scientific Corporation, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 04, 2016",2016-02-04,"Earnings Calls","Boston Scientific Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Mike. I'll start with some overall perspective on the quarter before getting into the details. We generated adjusted earnings per share of $0.26, exceeding the high end of our guidance range of $0.23 to $0.25 and representing 18% year-over-year",2753,"Thanks, Mike. I'll start with some overall perspective on the quarter before getting into the details. 
We generated adjusted earnings per share of $0.26, exceeding the high end of our guidance range of $0.23 to $0.25 and representing 18% year-over-year growth in the quarter. Excluding a $0.03 unfavorable foreign exchange impact, Q4 adjusted earnings per share grew 31% year-over-year. The strong performance in Q4 was driven primarily by operational revenue growth and gross margin expansion. 
Our Q4 2015 adjusted operating margin of 21.7% represents an improvement of 100 basis points over the fourth quarter of 2014. For the full year 2015, total company adjusted operating margin expanded by 210 basis points over the full year of '14, and we effectively offset a $0.10 FX headwind through operational savings and initiatives. 
Our full year 2015 adjusted earnings per share of $0.93 represents 11% growth and 23% growth excluding FX versus 2014. 
Now for the P&L highlights. For the fourth quarter of 2015, consolidated revenue of $1,978,000,000 represented operational growth of 10%, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange. Excluding an approximate 500 basis point contribution from the AMS male urology portfolio, organic revenue growth was 5% in the quarter. 
On an as-reported basis, revenue grew 5% year-over-year. The foreign exchange impact on sales was a $110 million headwind compared to the prior year period, which was about $25 million worse than we assumed in our Q4 guidance range. 
Adjusted gross margin for the fourth quarter was 72.8%, increasing 140 basis points year-over-year. The increase resulted primarily from cost improvements, driven by our value improvement programs, as the impact of foreign exchange was negligible in the quarter. 
For the full year 2015, adjusted gross margin was 72% compared to 70.7% for the full year 2014. The 130 basis point full year adjusted gross margin improvement was driven by benefits of 180 and 50 basis points from cost improvements and FX, respectively. This was partially offset by 100 basis points of headwinds attributed primarily to price. 
Adjusted SG&A expenses were $757 million or 38.3% of sales in the fourth quarter, down 10 basis points year-over-year. The Q4 rate includes 80 basis points of higher spend related to fixed asset write-offs, full year related benefits and litigation fees. 
Our full year 2015 adjusted SG&A rate of 37.4% is down 50 basis points versus the full year 2014. As a reminder, the medical device tax has been suspended for 2016 and 2017, which would benefit our adjusted SG&A rate by roughly 100 basis points annually. We're pleased to see that this tax has been temporarily suspended and intend to reinvest virtually all of the benefit into jobs, innovation, R&D, collaborations with universities and other initiatives that will help treat patients and sustain top line growth over the long term. 
We expect the reinvestment of approximately 100 basis points to be split roughly equally between R&D and SG&A. Our guidance for full year 2016 assumes our adjusted SG&A rate will come down by a total of 140 basis points at the midpoint, which breaks down into 50 basis points from the medical device tax suspension and 90 basis points from operational improvements. 
Adjusted research and development expenses were $238 million in the fourth quarter or 12% of sales. For the full year 2015, adjusted R&D expenses were $850 million or 11.4% of sales. We expect our full year 2016 adjusted R&D rate to be roughly 11.5%. Again, this includes a 50 basis point increase due to the reinvestment of the medical device tax, offset by increased efficiencies and improved utilization of our global footprint. 
Royalty expense was 0.9% of sales in both the fourth quarter and the full year 2015. This represents a 60-basis-point reduction compared to the full year 2014 rate, and we expect our royalty rate to remain at approximately 1% of sales in 2016. 
On an adjusted basis, operating income was $429 million in the quarter or 21.7% of sales, up 100 basis points year-over-year. We are very pleased with our consistent adjusted operating margin improvement throughout 2015 as we saw year-over-year improvement of at least 100 basis points in each of the 4 quarters. 
Rhythm Management's adjusted operating margin in Q4 was 13.9%, down substantially from Q3 2015, which resulted in a second half 2015 Rhythm Management adjusted operating margin of 15.9%, falling short of our expectation of 17% due to the timing of manufacturing variances and reserve charges as we transition our portfolio and prepare for new product launches in 2016. Full year 2015 Rhythm Management adjusted operating margin of 15% represents an improvement of 160 basis points over the full year 2014. 
And turning to 2016, we expect Rhythm Management adjusted operating margins to increase sequentially in Q1 versus Q4 of '15, with more noticeable improvement in Q2 as we begin to realize the full benefit of 2016 product costs and leverage the improved top line performance expected from the global CRM and EP franchises. And the second half 2016 Rhythm Management adjusted operating margin is also expected to benefit from our Plant Network Optimization program completed at the end of 2015, which transferred a portion of our EP manufacturing to lower-cost locations. 
The net of all these factors drive our expectation for full year Rhythm Management adjusted operating margin to approach 18% for the full year 2016, and we remain confident in 20% plus in 2017. 
GAAP operating income, which includes GAAP to adjusted items of $700 million, was a loss of $271 million in Q4 2015. The primary GAAP to adjusted items for the quarter included restructuring-related charges of $26 million, acquisition-related SG&A expenses of $15 million, contingent consideration expense of $37 million, amortization expense of $135 million and litigation-related charges of $456 million. 
The $456 million in litigation-related net charges were primarily related to increases in our litigation reserve for a recent appellate court ruling in Maryland in the Mirowski case, with the remainder related to a combination of increases in our transvaginal surgical mesh product liability reserves and other adjustments. The Mirowski case traces back to the mid-2000 and relates to licensing agreements on patents that have expired. We continue to believe that the facts and the law do not support the court's findings or the amount of the damages, and we plan to seek review of the judgment by the Maryland Supreme Court. 
We increased our mesh reserve this quarter as we became aware of additional claims during the quarter as we continue to work through the settlement evaluation process. Currently, our known claim count is approximately 35,000, and we've agreed in principle to settle over 10,000 of those 35,000 claims. We intend to continue to contest cases against us vigorously, while also looking to settle when reasonable terms are presented. Our total legal reserve was $1,936,000,000 as of December 31, 2015. 
Separately, a case was recently filed against Boston Scientific in West Virginia regarding the resin used in our transvaginal mesh products. We are confident that the resin used in the manufacturing of these devices is neither counterfeit nor adulterated and meets required material biocompatibility and design specifications. We've provided information and materials to DEKRA, a European notified body, the FDA and the Department of Justice regarding the resin, our quality processes and our commitment to producing medical devices of the highest quality. 
Now I'll move on to other income and expense. Interest expense for the quarter was $59 million compared to $54 million in Q4 of 2014. The increase was primarily due to the incremental debt raised in Q2 of 2015 to finance the AMS male urology portfolio acquisition. 
Our average interest rate was 3.9% in Q4 2015 compared to 4.8% in Q4 2014. The lower interest expense rate in Q4 2015 was primarily due to lower average cost of debt resulting from the senior notes refinancing completed in Q2 of 2015. 
Other expense was $10 million, and this consisted primarily of foreign exchange losses and investment losses incurred during the quarter. Our tax rate for the fourth quarter was 58% on a reported basis and 0.2% on an adjusted basis. 
Our Q4 adjusted tax rate includes $3.9 million of favorable discrete tax items and other onetime benefits primarily related to foreign exchange. Excluding these items, our Q4 operational tax rate would have been 13%. 
Now I'll provide a bit more detail on our full year 2015 adjusted tax rate, where our guidance as of the third quarter had been 13%. As you may know, the U.S. R&D tax credit was permanently reinstated in December, which benefited the full year 2015 adjusted tax rate by slightly more than 100 basis points. We've decided to reinvest this benefit in our tax structure to improve long-term flexibility in our capital structure. The net result of this being a 13% adjusted tax rate for the full year excluding discrete and onetime tax items and a 9.2% rate including them. After this onetime investment, we continue to expect an approximately 100-basis-point increase in our adjusted tax rate annually, and therefore continue to expect our full year 2016 adjusted tax rate to be approximately 14%. 
Finally, as mentioned, Q4 2015 adjusted EPS of $0.26 includes approximately $0.03 of unfavorable foreign exchange and represents 18% year-over-year growth or 31% growth, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. On a reported GAAP basis, Q4 2015 EPS was a loss of $0.11 and includes net charges and amortization expenses totaling $504 million after tax. The GAAP loss of $0.11 compares to a GAAP loss of $0.23 in the fourth quarter of 2014. For the full year 2015, we reported adjusted EPS of $0.93, exceeding our guidance range while absorbing $0.10 of unfavorable FX. Recall this is $0.02 more than we expected as of our Q3 2015 earnings call and $0.06 more than we had expected at the beginning of 2015. 
Full year 2015 adjusted EPS grew 11% over prior year and 23% excluding the impact of foreign exchange. On a reported GAAP basis, 2015 EPS was a loss of $0.18 compared to a full year 2014 GAAP loss per share of $0.09. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. Days sales outstanding of 59 days, increased 1 day compared to December of 2014. Days inventory on hand of 163 days, was up 7 days compared to December of last year due primarily to the acquisition of the AMS male urology portfolio. 
Capital expenditures were $86 million in Q4 2015 compared to $79 million in Q4 2014. For the full year 2015, capital expenditures were $248 million. For the full year 2016, we expect capital expenditures to be roughly $100 million higher, primarily due to the construction of our new manufacturing facility and distribution center in Malaysia. Beyond 2016, we expect capital expenditures to return to our historical run rate of approximately $250 million annually. 
Adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was $448 million compared to $508 million in Q4 2014. Our full year 2015 adjusted free cash flow of $1,366,000,000 represents growth of 8% over the full year 2014. For 2016, we expect full year adjusted free cash flow to exceed $1.5 billion, representing growth of 10%, and have a stretch goal to exceed $1.6 billion for the year with initiatives aimed at improving the working capital contribution to cash flow. 
In Q4, we repaid $150 million of our term loan and expect to repay an additional $250 million by the end of 2016. At which time, we expect our debt leverage will be consistent with our goal of returning to pre-AMS debt leverage by year-end. There were no share repurchases in the quarter, consistent with our decision to suspend the share repurchase program temporarily following the announcement of the AMS male urology portfolio acquisition. And near term, our capital allocation priorities are to repay debt, manage contingencies and pursue tuck-in M&A. 
We ended 2015 with 1,363,000,000 fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding. Consistent with our prior guidance, we expect our share count to increase by roughly 5 million per quarter through the end of 2016 as we plan to keep the buyback suspended for the balance of 2016. We expect this to result in a fully diluted weighted average share count of approximately 1,380,000,000 for the full year 2016. 
I'd like to conclude with guidance for Q1 and full year 2016. For the full year, we expect consolidated revenue to be in the range of $7,900,000,000 to $8,100,000,000, which represents year-over-year growth of 4% to 7% on an organic basis, 7% to 10% on an operational basis and 6% to 8% on a reported basis. 
As a result of a stronger dollar, at current rates, we expect foreign exchange to be a roughly $150 million headwind for the full year 016 on revenue. We expect our adjusted gross margin for the year, as a percentage of sales, to be in a range of 72% to 73%. We expect foreign exchange to have an unfavorable impact of approximately 50 basis points on adjusted gross margin in 2016 as hedging contracts from our 3-year program are layered in. We expect this headwind be offset by a favorable mix, market segmentation, the ramp of accretive new products and our standard cost-reduction programs. 
As mentioned, we expect our full year 2016 adjusted SG&A rate to be between 35.5% and 36.5% of sales and our full year adjusted R&D rate to be between 11% and 12% of sales. This implies a full year 2016 adjusted operating margin in the range of 23.5% to 24.5%, the midpoint of which represents 170 basis points of improvement over full year 2015. 
And importantly, we remain on track to achieve an adjusted operating margin of 25% plus in 2017. Full year 2016 interest expense is expected to be $245 million, about $10 million higher than the full year 2015 due to incremental debt raised in Q2 of 2015. 
As mentioned, we expect our tax rate for the full year 2016 to be approximately 14%. As a result, we expect adjusted earnings per share for the full year 2016 to be in a range of $1.03 to $1.07, representing 11% to 15% adjusted earnings per share growth. We expect 2016 adjusted earnings per share to be impacted negatively by approximately $0.06 of FX or roughly $80 million of adjusted income. In terms of timing, this $0.06 should be roughly $0.02 per quarter in Q1 and Q2 and $0.01 per quarter in Q3 and Q4. 
Excluding the $0.06 of unfavorable foreign exchange, our full year adjusted EPS guidance range represents growth of 17% to 21%. Despite this approximate $0.06 hit, we remain confident in our ability to deliver double-digit adjusted EPS growth. 
Let me walk you through the 2016 adjusted EPS guidance. We delivered adjusted EPS of $0.93 in 2015, representing 11% growth or 23% growth excluding the $0.10 of negative FX impact. As you know, our stated goal is to grow EPS double digits, which would imply $1.02 in 2016. Adding $0.03 of AMS accretion gets us to $1.05, which is the midpoint of our guidance. 
We expect unfavorable FX of approximately $0.06, as I mentioned, but our goal is to offset this through operational initiatives and savings as we did in 2015. And as mentioned, the medical device tax is worth roughly 100 basis points on the OM line, but we intend to reinvest substantially all of that back into innovation and have developed the detailed plans to do so. On a GAAP basis, we expect EPS to be in a range of $0.62 to $0.67. Lastly, for 2016 our guidance assumes pretax amortization of approximately $534 million. 
Now turning to the first quarter of 2016. We expect consolidated revenues to be in a range of $1,890,000,000 to $1,940,000,000. If current foreign exchange rates hold constant, the headwind from foreign exchange should be approximately $45 million or 250 basis points relative to Q1 2015. 
We expect consolidated Q1 sales to grow year-over-year in a range of 4% to 6% organically and 9% to 11% operationally. 
For the first quarter, adjusted earnings per share is expected to be in a range of $0.23 to $0.25 per share, and GAAP earnings per share is expected to be in a range of $0.11 to $0.13 per share. 
I encourage you to check our Investor Relations website for Q4 2015 financial and operational highlights, which outlines Q4 results as well as Q1 and full year 2016 guidance, including P&L line item guidance. 
So with that, I will turn it back to Susie, who will moderate the Q&A."

So I think the way I would think of it is the 13.9% in Q4, I'd expect a little bit of a sequential improvement in Q1. Not a tremendous amount, just a little bit. Q2 gets a little bit better than that. And really, the back half is where it accelerates to get to that overall 18% for the year. So I wouldn't look for Q1 to be in that 18% range or Q2.

But we've got these product launches coming in the second half of '16. The S-ICD is really gaining excellent momentum globally. We're expanding that, and we're going to be moving beyond the replacement cycle headwind. In terms of the product launches, we feel comfortable with a second quarter launch of both the quad system and MRI pacer. The MRI pacer likely slipped a little bit out of first quarter into second quarter. We'll also have EMBLEM MRI approval likely in the third quarter of 2016. So big, big approvals in the second quarter and third quarter. And then as we go forward with the ICD MRI capability, we'll start that trial very quickly here, and we anticipate approval of that product likely in second quarter or third quarter of 2017. So we've got a really strong cadence of product approvals coming, MRI capabilities. But I think what's most unique about our offering is this S-ICD momentum that we're seeing around the world. We just received approval in Japan. We have a 5% premium -- reimbursement premium in Japan, continued strong acceptance of the product and training and a multiyear head start. So as you looked at our business going forward, these product cadence will come through. SICD is continuing to grow, and our replacement cycle headwind will reverse itself. So as you look forward to CRM, I really believe that you're going to see this business strengthen in the second half of '16 and '17 and '18."

We did project some softness the first 6 months post-acquisition as we wanted to bleed down distributor inventory levels to appropriate levels, and that's exactly what we're seeing. So that's happening. And we likely we'll see continued softness in Q1, but improving in terms of the legacy AMS business, and that's being offset by the BSC legacy business. As we go forward in the second quarter, we expect that legacy AMS business to grow much closer to the BSC overall growth rate. And then we'll see additional benefit on top of that as we see synergies between the BPH portfolio, the stone portfolio, the ED portfolio and the incontinence portfolio overall.

In fourth quarter, Boston Scientific posted another quarter of strong results and closed out an excellent 2015 as we continued to execute against our strategic plan goals. At our May 2015 Investor Day meeting, we outlined plans to drive mid-single-digit organic revenue growth and consistent adjusted operating margin expansion, which, in turn, will drive double-digit adjusted EPS growth excluding the impact of FX. 
We are delivering against these objectives. In Q4, we grew worldwide sales 5% organically and 10% operationally, which includes the benefit of the AMS urology business. We also grew adjusted operating income by 10% in the fourth quarter, which represents 100 basis point year-over-year improvement to 21.7%. 
The solid revenue growth and margin expansion drove very strong 18% adjusted EPS growth to $0.26, and our fourth quarter results reflect our focus on delivering meaningful innovation, while also providing clinical and economic value to our hospital to customers. 
Importantly, our Q4 results built upon the consistent momentum generated over the past few years and contributed to the following full year '15 results. For the full year, we delivered 5% organic revenue growth and 8% operational revenue growth, which includes the acquired sales from Bayer Peripheral and AMS.
In parallel with the consistent revenue growth, we are driving a strong improvements through our operating margin. In 2014, we delivered 130-basis-point improvement in adjusted operating margin. In 2015, we delivered an additional 210-basis-point improvement to a full year 22.3%. In per our previous goals, we continue to expect to deliver 25% plus adjusted operating margin in 2017 with plans to deliver an additional 200 to 300 basis points of improvement by year-end 2020. 
We delivered full year of '15 adjusted EPS growth -- I'm sorry, EPS of $0.93, representing 11% growth for the full year. It's important to note that the 11% adjusted EPS growth includes a significant negative foreign exchange impact of $0.10 versus our original expectation of a $0.04 hit when we originally gave '15 guidance. We're very pleased that we're able to overcome this FX headwind while investing in the long-term growth of the company, yet still delivering on our commitment for double-digit adjusted EPS growth. 
We continue to believe that Boston Scientific is uniquely positioned to deliver differentiated shareholder value through durable mid-single-digit revenue growth and double-digit adjusted EPS growth to beat our ongoing operating margin improvement initiatives. We're excited by our 2016 and our plans to build upon our global momentum. 
In 2016, we're targeting full year organic revenue growth of 4% to 7% and operational revenue growth of 7% to 10%. We're guiding adjusted EPS to $1.03 to $1.07, which represents 11% to 15% earnings growth. Importantly, this EPS once again includes an expected $0.06 negative impact from foreign exchange. 
I'll now provide some highlights on fourth quarter and '15 results along with thoughts on our '16 outlook. In my remarks, I'll reference to growth in an organic year-over-year constant currency basis, unless otherwise specified. 
Our fourth quarter organic revenue growth of 5% was broad-based across businesses and regions. It's led by exciting new product launches, which continued; global expansion; and execution of our category leadership strategy. With the exception of the anticipated 1% decline in CRM sales, all of our other businesses grew organic revenue by at least 6%, led by 10% growth in PI. IC had a strong quarter, growing 6% against a very tough 10% comp in Q4 2014. And importantly, all 3 medical/surgical businesses grew revenue at 7%, while also improving segmented adjusted operating margin by 90 basis points year-over-year to 34.1%. 
We delivered another quarter of balanced global growth, led by 6% revenue growth in Asia, 5% growth in the U.S. and Europe. Another highlight was strong 15% revenue growth in emerging markets, led by 20% growth in China and Brazil. 
The MedSurg businesses continued to deliver. In Endoscopy, we delivered 7% growth in Q4, fueled by the strength of our portfolio, our expanding global commercial reach and ongoing launches of our SpyGlass DS and AXIOS Stents. SpyGlass DS was launched in July 2015, and is an advanced single-use visualization system for the diagnosis and treatment of complex disorders of the pancreas and bile ducts. It's truly a cornerstone product that is highly differentiated and complementary to our core Endo portfolio. Our AXIOS Stent is used for transluminal drainage of pancreatic fluid collections and is also off to a strong start. We'll continue to innovate in endoscopic ultrasound and other exciting therapeutic categories, including pulmonary and oncology, to further enhance our global leadership in Endoscopy. 
Urology and Pelvic Health also continued a strong performance trend, growing 7% organically in Q4, led by laser fibers, capital equipment and strong international growth. Importantly, this quarter, we launched LithoVue, a disposable uterus scope, which provides customers with visualization and navigation capabilities to diagnose and treat stones and other conditions of the kidney, uterus and bladder. And after closing the AMS Urology acquisition in August, we remain on track to realize our adjusted EPS accretion goals of at least $0.03 in 2016 and $0.07 in 2017. 
Neuromodulation revenue grew 7% in the fourth quarter, led by strong growth in both the U.S. and international. Sales were driven by the market-leading Spectra platform and the launch of Precision Novi, our first product of the primary cell non-rechargeable market. 
In addition, we're seeing really promising uptake of our precise Deep Brain Stimulation system due to its Cartesian directional lead system and our partnership with Brainlab. Our U.S. DBS trial is making progress, and we expect to complete enrollment in 2016 and enter the market in late 2017 or early '18. 
Our Cardiovascular group grew 7% in Q4, led by impressive 10% growth in Peripheral Interventions. The core PI business continues to execute, and we're very pleased with integration of the legacy Bayer business. The legacy Bayer business grew over 20% for the second quarter in a row as we continue to grow share in the atherectomy market, and we're encouraged by our early results from the global launch of our ZelanteDVT catheter and the U.S. launch of our Innova Stent for the SFA. We also recently began to enroll our IMPERIAL U.S. IDE trial for Eluvia, our drug-eluting stent, and remain on track for a European launch of Eluvia this quarter. 
In addition, we recently closed the CeloNova transaction, which is a synergistic tuck-in acquisition focused on the treatment of liver cancer via localized delivery of chemotherapeutic agents. 
And finally in PI, we continue to benefit from our commercial relationship with C.R. Bard and the Lutonix Drug Coated Balloon technology. 
Interventional Cardiology continues to deliver, with 6% growth in the quarter, which represents the sixth consecutive quarter of plus 6% growth in IC. Growth was led by worldwide imaging, U.S. and European drug-eluting stents, our complex PCI portfolio and structural heart. 
PCI guidance grew low-teens globally, and we're encouraged by the market enthusiasm of our integrated fractional flow reserve platform. In DES, the U.S. SYNERGY launch is going extremely well. We anticipate that SYNERGY will represent approximately 50% of our DES revenue mix in the U.S. by the end of 2016. 
In addition, we're launching SYNERGY in Japan, and we'll continue to expand SYNERGY in other international markets. We also continue to invest in building upon a strong clinical evidence for SYNERGY as we have initiated the EVOLVE Short DAPT Study. 
Finally, the IC performance was fueled by our strengthening structural heart business, which includes our Lotus Aortic Valve and WATCHMAN Left Atrial Appendage Closure Device. We're truly in an exciting position to drive growth and share gains over the long run in these fast-growing markets. 
Lotus delivered a strong quarter for the -- in the European market as the platform continues to build momentum despite our near-term size matrix limitations. Lotus offers physicians excellent control during implantation and best-in-class paravalvular leakage rates. In our RESPOND Post-Market Study, 95.1% of patients had 0 to trace PVL.
Importantly, we completed enrollment in our REPRISE III IDE study in December, which we anticipate will position us for a late 2017 U.S. market entrance. We're also pleased to announce completion of the 1,000-patient RESPOND Lotus Post-Market Study and those results will be presented at EuroPCR in May. We're expanding the Lotus platform and expect to launch our next-gen 14 French delivery system along with additional sizes in Europe this year. 
Also in structural heart, the U.S. WATCHMAN launch continues to progress ahead of plan. We're pleased with the implant success rates and the high quality of patient outcomes thus far, which reflect our controlled rollout and proven training program. 
In addition, Dr. Vivek Reddy of Mount Sinai recently published in JACC a study highlighting WATCHMAN's cost-effectiveness versus both warfarin and novel oral anticoagulants. In the U.S., we opened more than 100 WATCHMAN accounts in 2015 and expect to open an additional 100 accounts in 2016. 
In Europe, we're looking forward to a full launch of our second-gen WATCHMAN FLX, which also -- which already has CE Mark. After U.S. reimbursement, we will await final NCD decision from CMS by February 8, and we remain confident that WATCHMAN will represent at least a $500 million worldwide market opportunity. 
So overall, we're very pleased with our progress in structural heart and excited about our capabilities and the long-term prospects for this business. We exceeded our full year of '15 structural heart revenue goal of $75 million to $100 million, and in 2016, we anticipate structural heart sales between $175 million and $200 million. 
Now turning to CRM. On our first quarter '15 earnings call, we projected a slowdown in our worldwide CRM sales for the balance of '15 and through first quarter '16, primarily due to replacement cycle headwinds and competitive launches in the U.S. Our forecast is accurate as global CRM sales declined 1% in Q4. However, we're very encouraged about our forward-looking CRM position given the strong cadence of new launches expected in the U.S. and Japan in '16, our leading position and growing awareness of S-ICD and our replacement cycle headwind becoming more favorable as we exit 2016. 
In the U.S., we plan to launch our full X4 quad system with our ACCOLADE brady MRI-safe system in the first half and the EMBLEM MRI-safe in the second half of '16. And we anticipate these releases will strengthen 2016 CRM performance, particularly in the second half. 
Pacemaker sales again grew 2%, and we recently launched X4 CRT-P quad device. And while our ICD sales declined 2%, we continue to be pleased with our de novo ICD performance in the EMBLEM S-ICD in particular. EMBLEM continues to drive strong growth in de novo shared gains in both the Europe and the U.S. EMBLEM is building momentum globally, and we look forward to launching EMBLEM in Japan this quarter with a reimbursement premium and expanding S-ICD to additional international markets in 2016. 
In Europe, we continue to gain share and grow our CRM business in the mid-single-digit range with our complete portfolio. These consistent European CRM results are encouraging as we look forward to our anticipated U.S. approvals in '16. 
Lastly in CRM, we're continuously mounting third-party evidence of the economic benefits associated with our EnduraLife extended battery technology. And recently, another third-party data set from the Europace was published, demonstrating the 6-year survival of BSC CRT-Ds over our competitors. 
Also, recent U.S. study modeled a 14% reduction in Medicare cost from a 2-year increase in ICD battery longevity. And an Italian study showed Extended Longevity drove a 29% to 34% reduction in long-term health care costs over a 15-year period. 
Turning to our EP business. We delivered 8% growth in the quarter. Arrhythmia platform continues to rollout nicely, driven by new installations and higher case volumes. We have a strong arrhythmia customer pipeline in 2016 as well as new platform enhancements scheduled for release. 
We did see some softness in EP in fourth quarter, primarily driven by the delay in our European launch of our IntellaMap ablation catheter, which we anticipate launching later in the first quarter. We continue to strengthen our EP business, and we look forward to continued progress in 2016. 
Our strategy of category leadership is working, and it's helping us to become a stronger partner with our global customers. As the health care environment continues to evolve, we're building new capabilities to support our customers beyond our product portfolio with our ADVANTICS solutions offerings. These offerings are focused on driving operational excellence within Cardiovascular and GI labs and improving a standardizing care for chronic cardiovascular diseases. And just last week, we announced an alliance with Accenture to develop a data-driven digital health solution to improve patient outcomes and reduce costs to treat patients with chronic cardiovascular diseases. 
So to wrap up my section, our company has great momentum, and our 2015 results reflect the strength of our portfolio and our ongoing investment into faster growth markets, our globalization efforts and the execution of our global teams. More importantly, we believe that we are well positioned to continue and strengthen our performance track record in 2016 and beyond. I would like to thank our employees for their winning spirit and a great commitment to Boston Scientific. 
Now let me turn the call over to Dan for a more detailed review of our financials."
317627,321212230,927695,"Boston Scientific Corporation, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 04, 2016",2016-02-04,"Earnings Calls","Boston Scientific Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Mike. I'll start with some overall perspective on the quarter before getting into the details. We generated adjusted earnings per share of $0.26, exceeding the high end of our guidance range of $0.23 to $0.25 and representing 18% year-over-year",2753,"Thanks, Mike. I'll start with some overall perspective on the quarter before getting into the details. 
We generated adjusted earnings per share of $0.26, exceeding the high end of our guidance range of $0.23 to $0.25 and representing 18% year-over-year growth in the quarter. Excluding a $0.03 unfavorable foreign exchange impact, Q4 adjusted earnings per share grew 31% year-over-year. The strong performance in Q4 was driven primarily by operational revenue growth and gross margin expansion. 
Our Q4 2015 adjusted operating margin of 21.7% represents an improvement of 100 basis points over the fourth quarter of 2014. For the full year 2015, total company adjusted operating margin expanded by 210 basis points over the full year of '14, and we effectively offset a $0.10 FX headwind through operational savings and initiatives. 
Our full year 2015 adjusted earnings per share of $0.93 represents 11% growth and 23% growth excluding FX versus 2014. 
Now for the P&L highlights. For the fourth quarter of 2015, consolidated revenue of $1,978,000,000 represented operational growth of 10%, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange. Excluding an approximate 500 basis point contribution from the AMS male urology portfolio, organic revenue growth was 5% in the quarter. 
On an as-reported basis, revenue grew 5% year-over-year. The foreign exchange impact on sales was a $110 million headwind compared to the prior year period, which was about $25 million worse than we assumed in our Q4 guidance range. 
Adjusted gross margin for the fourth quarter was 72.8%, increasing 140 basis points year-over-year. The increase resulted primarily from cost improvements, driven by our value improvement programs, as the impact of foreign exchange was negligible in the quarter. 
For the full year 2015, adjusted gross margin was 72% compared to 70.7% for the full year 2014. The 130 basis point full year adjusted gross margin improvement was driven by benefits of 180 and 50 basis points from cost improvements and FX, respectively. This was partially offset by 100 basis points of headwinds attributed primarily to price. 
Adjusted SG&A expenses were $757 million or 38.3% of sales in the fourth quarter, down 10 basis points year-over-year. The Q4 rate includes 80 basis points of higher spend related to fixed asset write-offs, full year related benefits and litigation fees. 
Our full year 2015 adjusted SG&A rate of 37.4% is down 50 basis points versus the full year 2014. As a reminder, the medical device tax has been suspended for 2016 and 2017, which would benefit our adjusted SG&A rate by roughly 100 basis points annually. We're pleased to see that this tax has been temporarily suspended and intend to reinvest virtually all of the benefit into jobs, innovation, R&D, collaborations with universities and other initiatives that will help treat patients and sustain top line growth over the long term. 
We expect the reinvestment of approximately 100 basis points to be split roughly equally between R&D and SG&A. Our guidance for full year 2016 assumes our adjusted SG&A rate will come down by a total of 140 basis points at the midpoint, which breaks down into 50 basis points from the medical device tax suspension and 90 basis points from operational improvements. 
Adjusted research and development expenses were $238 million in the fourth quarter or 12% of sales. For the full year 2015, adjusted R&D expenses were $850 million or 11.4% of sales. We expect our full year 2016 adjusted R&D rate to be roughly 11.5%. Again, this includes a 50 basis point increase due to the reinvestment of the medical device tax, offset by increased efficiencies and improved utilization of our global footprint. 
Royalty expense was 0.9% of sales in both the fourth quarter and the full year 2015. This represents a 60-basis-point reduction compared to the full year 2014 rate, and we expect our royalty rate to remain at approximately 1% of sales in 2016. 
On an adjusted basis, operating income was $429 million in the quarter or 21.7% of sales, up 100 basis points year-over-year. We are very pleased with our consistent adjusted operating margin improvement throughout 2015 as we saw year-over-year improvement of at least 100 basis points in each of the 4 quarters. 
Rhythm Management's adjusted operating margin in Q4 was 13.9%, down substantially from Q3 2015, which resulted in a second half 2015 Rhythm Management adjusted operating margin of 15.9%, falling short of our expectation of 17% due to the timing of manufacturing variances and reserve charges as we transition our portfolio and prepare for new product launches in 2016. Full year 2015 Rhythm Management adjusted operating margin of 15% represents an improvement of 160 basis points over the full year 2014. 
And turning to 2016, we expect Rhythm Management adjusted operating margins to increase sequentially in Q1 versus Q4 of '15, with more noticeable improvement in Q2 as we begin to realize the full benefit of 2016 product costs and leverage the improved top line performance expected from the global CRM and EP franchises. And the second half 2016 Rhythm Management adjusted operating margin is also expected to benefit from our Plant Network Optimization program completed at the end of 2015, which transferred a portion of our EP manufacturing to lower-cost locations. 
The net of all these factors drive our expectation for full year Rhythm Management adjusted operating margin to approach 18% for the full year 2016, and we remain confident in 20% plus in 2017. 
GAAP operating income, which includes GAAP to adjusted items of $700 million, was a loss of $271 million in Q4 2015. The primary GAAP to adjusted items for the quarter included restructuring-related charges of $26 million, acquisition-related SG&A expenses of $15 million, contingent consideration expense of $37 million, amortization expense of $135 million and litigation-related charges of $456 million. 
The $456 million in litigation-related net charges were primarily related to increases in our litigation reserve for a recent appellate court ruling in Maryland in the Mirowski case, with the remainder related to a combination of increases in our transvaginal surgical mesh product liability reserves and other adjustments. The Mirowski case traces back to the mid-2000 and relates to licensing agreements on patents that have expired. We continue to believe that the facts and the law do not support the court's findings or the amount of the damages, and we plan to seek review of the judgment by the Maryland Supreme Court. 
We increased our mesh reserve this quarter as we became aware of additional claims during the quarter as we continue to work through the settlement evaluation process. Currently, our known claim count is approximately 35,000, and we've agreed in principle to settle over 10,000 of those 35,000 claims. We intend to continue to contest cases against us vigorously, while also looking to settle when reasonable terms are presented. Our total legal reserve was $1,936,000,000 as of December 31, 2015. 
Separately, a case was recently filed against Boston Scientific in West Virginia regarding the resin used in our transvaginal mesh products. We are confident that the resin used in the manufacturing of these devices is neither counterfeit nor adulterated and meets required material biocompatibility and design specifications. We've provided information and materials to DEKRA, a European notified body, the FDA and the Department of Justice regarding the resin, our quality processes and our commitment to producing medical devices of the highest quality. 
Now I'll move on to other income and expense. Interest expense for the quarter was $59 million compared to $54 million in Q4 of 2014. The increase was primarily due to the incremental debt raised in Q2 of 2015 to finance the AMS male urology portfolio acquisition. 
Our average interest rate was 3.9% in Q4 2015 compared to 4.8% in Q4 2014. The lower interest expense rate in Q4 2015 was primarily due to lower average cost of debt resulting from the senior notes refinancing completed in Q2 of 2015. 
Other expense was $10 million, and this consisted primarily of foreign exchange losses and investment losses incurred during the quarter. Our tax rate for the fourth quarter was 58% on a reported basis and 0.2% on an adjusted basis. 
Our Q4 adjusted tax rate includes $3.9 million of favorable discrete tax items and other onetime benefits primarily related to foreign exchange. Excluding these items, our Q4 operational tax rate would have been 13%. 
Now I'll provide a bit more detail on our full year 2015 adjusted tax rate, where our guidance as of the third quarter had been 13%. As you may know, the U.S. R&D tax credit was permanently reinstated in December, which benefited the full year 2015 adjusted tax rate by slightly more than 100 basis points. We've decided to reinvest this benefit in our tax structure to improve long-term flexibility in our capital structure. The net result of this being a 13% adjusted tax rate for the full year excluding discrete and onetime tax items and a 9.2% rate including them. After this onetime investment, we continue to expect an approximately 100-basis-point increase in our adjusted tax rate annually, and therefore continue to expect our full year 2016 adjusted tax rate to be approximately 14%. 
Finally, as mentioned, Q4 2015 adjusted EPS of $0.26 includes approximately $0.03 of unfavorable foreign exchange and represents 18% year-over-year growth or 31% growth, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. On a reported GAAP basis, Q4 2015 EPS was a loss of $0.11 and includes net charges and amortization expenses totaling $504 million after tax. The GAAP loss of $0.11 compares to a GAAP loss of $0.23 in the fourth quarter of 2014. For the full year 2015, we reported adjusted EPS of $0.93, exceeding our guidance range while absorbing $0.10 of unfavorable FX. Recall this is $0.02 more than we expected as of our Q3 2015 earnings call and $0.06 more than we had expected at the beginning of 2015. 
Full year 2015 adjusted EPS grew 11% over prior year and 23% excluding the impact of foreign exchange. On a reported GAAP basis, 2015 EPS was a loss of $0.18 compared to a full year 2014 GAAP loss per share of $0.09. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. Days sales outstanding of 59 days, increased 1 day compared to December of 2014. Days inventory on hand of 163 days, was up 7 days compared to December of last year due primarily to the acquisition of the AMS male urology portfolio. 
Capital expenditures were $86 million in Q4 2015 compared to $79 million in Q4 2014. For the full year 2015, capital expenditures were $248 million. For the full year 2016, we expect capital expenditures to be roughly $100 million higher, primarily due to the construction of our new manufacturing facility and distribution center in Malaysia. Beyond 2016, we expect capital expenditures to return to our historical run rate of approximately $250 million annually. 
Adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was $448 million compared to $508 million in Q4 2014. Our full year 2015 adjusted free cash flow of $1,366,000,000 represents growth of 8% over the full year 2014. For 2016, we expect full year adjusted free cash flow to exceed $1.5 billion, representing growth of 10%, and have a stretch goal to exceed $1.6 billion for the year with initiatives aimed at improving the working capital contribution to cash flow. 
In Q4, we repaid $150 million of our term loan and expect to repay an additional $250 million by the end of 2016. At which time, we expect our debt leverage will be consistent with our goal of returning to pre-AMS debt leverage by year-end. There were no share repurchases in the quarter, consistent with our decision to suspend the share repurchase program temporarily following the announcement of the AMS male urology portfolio acquisition. And near term, our capital allocation priorities are to repay debt, manage contingencies and pursue tuck-in M&A. 
We ended 2015 with 1,363,000,000 fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding. Consistent with our prior guidance, we expect our share count to increase by roughly 5 million per quarter through the end of 2016 as we plan to keep the buyback suspended for the balance of 2016. We expect this to result in a fully diluted weighted average share count of approximately 1,380,000,000 for the full year 2016. 
I'd like to conclude with guidance for Q1 and full year 2016. For the full year, we expect consolidated revenue to be in the range of $7,900,000,000 to $8,100,000,000, which represents year-over-year growth of 4% to 7% on an organic basis, 7% to 10% on an operational basis and 6% to 8% on a reported basis. 
As a result of a stronger dollar, at current rates, we expect foreign exchange to be a roughly $150 million headwind for the full year '16 on revenue. We expect our adjusted gross margin for the year, as a percentage of sales, to be in a range of 72% to 73%. We expect foreign exchange to have an unfavorable impact of approximately 50 basis points on adjusted gross margin in 2016 as hedging contracts from our 3-year program are layered in. We expect this headwind be offset by a favorable mix, market segmentation, the ramp of accretive new products and our standard cost-reduction programs. 
As mentioned, we expect our full year 2016 adjusted SG&A rate to be between 35.5% and 36.5% of sales and our full year adjusted R&D rate to be between 11% and 12% of sales. This implies a full year 2016 adjusted operating margin in the range of 23.5% to 24.5%, the midpoint of which represents 170 basis points of improvement over full year 2015. 
And importantly, we remain on track to achieve an adjusted operating margin of 25% plus in 2017. Full year 2016 interest expense is expected to be $245 million, about $10 million higher than the full year 2015 due to incremental debt raised in Q2 of 2015. 
As mentioned, we expect our tax rate for the full year 2016 to be approximately 14%. As a result, we expect adjusted earnings per share for the full year 2016 to be in a range of $1.03 to $1.07, representing 11% to 15% adjusted earnings per share growth. We expect 2016 adjusted earnings per share to be impacted negatively by approximately $0.06 of FX or roughly $80 million of adjusted income. In terms of timing, this $0.06 should be roughly $0.02 per quarter in Q1 and Q2 and $0.01 per quarter in Q3 and Q4. 
Excluding the $0.06 of unfavorable foreign exchange, our full year adjusted EPS guidance range represents growth of 17% to 21%. Despite this approximate $0.06 hit, we remain confident in our ability to deliver double-digit adjusted EPS growth. 
Let me walk you through the 2016 adjusted EPS guidance. We delivered adjusted EPS of $0.93 in 2015, representing 11% growth or 23% growth excluding the $0.10 of negative FX impact. As you know, our stated goal is to grow EPS double digits, which would imply $1.02 in 2016. Adding $0.03 of AMS accretion gets us to $1.05, which is the midpoint of our guidance. 
We expect unfavorable FX of approximately $0.06, as I mentioned, but our goal is to offset this through operational initiatives and savings as we did in 2015. And as mentioned, the medical device tax is worth roughly 100 basis points on the OM line, but we intend to reinvest substantially all of that back into innovation and have developed the detailed plans to do so. On a GAAP basis, we expect EPS to be in a range of $0.62 to $0.67. Lastly, for 2016 our guidance assumes pretax amortization of approximately $534 million. 
Now turning to the first quarter of 2016. We expect consolidated revenues to be in a range of $1,890,000,000 to $1,940,000,000. If current foreign exchange rates hold constant, the headwind from foreign exchange should be approximately $45 million or 250 basis points relative to Q1 2015. 
We expect consolidated Q1 sales to grow year-over-year in a range of 4% to 6% organically and 9% to 11% operationally. 
For the first quarter, adjusted earnings per share is expected to be in a range of $0.23 to $0.25 per share, and GAAP earnings per share is expected to be in a range of $0.11 to $0.13 per share. 
I encourage you to check our Investor Relations website for Q4 2015 financial and operational highlights, which outlines Q4 results as well as Q1 and full year 2016 guidance, including P&L line item guidance. 
So with that, I will turn it back to Susie, who will moderate the Q&A."

The manufacturing and the inventory reserve charges are really in anticipation of the launches that Mike just mentioned around the MRI-safe brady and the quad launch in the U.S. So those are kind of out of the way now at this point as opposed to having had to take those in different quarters. So I think the way I would think of it is the 13.9% in Q4, I'd expect a little bit of a sequential improvement in Q1. Not a tremendous amount, just a little bit. Q2 gets a little bit better than that. And really, the back half is where it accelerates to get to that overall 18% for the year. So I wouldn't look for Q1 to be in that 18% range or Q2.

We just launched a new DBT product; and also, clearly, the growing acceptance of the drug coated technologies. So the markets, overall, are strong. And we really have a unique position in terms of our portfolio. You've heard a lot about our drug-eluting stent, Eluvia. We'll be the only company with both a drug-eluting stent in a drug-eluting balloon in Europe. And we're also kicking off our Eluvia IMPERIAL trial in the first half of 2016. So we are uniquely positioned in our DES. We're also launching a number of our core SFA metal stents in Japan and Asia, in China, which will help us grow that business. And we also continue to really expand globally. We've been -- we were lightweight in terms of the emerging markets in Peripheral 5 years ago, and we've put a lot of investment in there. We're starting to see that become more meaningful in places like China and Brazil. And lastly, we commented on the call about our CeloNova deal. Our Interventional Oncology may be a little bit different than some competitors' Peripheral business, but that IO business is a strong grower for us, and we like that CeloNova transaction, particularly for the emerging markets."

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us.

We issued a press release earlier this morning announcing our Q1 2016 results, which included reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in the release.
We have posted a copy of that release as well as reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in today's call to the Investor Relations section of our website under the heading, Financial Information.

Good morning, everyone. We continue to perform against our strategic plan goals, and we're encouraged by the consistent strong execution of our global team.

We continue to perform against our strategic plan goals, and we're encouraged by the consistent strong execution of our global team. The success of our new product launches across many of our businesses is helping us accelerate expansion into faster-growth markets and deliver solutions that address unmet clinical needs. 
We continue to believe that Boston Scientific is uniquely positioned to deliver differentiated shareholder value through durable mid-single-digit organic revenue growth and double-digit adjusted EPS growth through our ongoing operating margin improvement initiatives. We're very excited about the excellent start to 2016 and our plans to build upon our global momentum in 2017 and beyond. 
We posted excellent results this quarter with total operational revenue growth of 13% and organic revenue growth of 8%, excluding the impact of AMS acquisition benefit. 4 of our 7 businesses grew revenue double digits organically, and we, in turn, leveraged that revenue growth to drive 24% adjusted operating income growth, resulting in adjusted operating margin of 25.1% and a 260 basis point improvement year-over-year. 
We delivered adjusted EPS of $0.28, exceeding the high end of guidance and representing 31% growth, including the negative impact from foreign currency. Importantly, we're increasing our 2016 guidance for revenue, adjusted operating margin and adjusted EPS. We're increasing our full year organic revenue growth guidance from 4% to 7% previously to 6% to 8% full year operational revenue, which includes the benefit of AMS has been increased from 7% to 10% to 9% to 11%. We're increasing our adjusted operating margin guidance to 24% to 24.5%, and we're also increasing our adjusted EPS guidance up $0.03 over our prior range to $1.06 to $1.10, which now represents 14% to 18% growth, and importantly, this EPS guidance includes an expected $0.05 to $0.06 negative impact from foreign exchange. 
I'll now try to highlight on Q1 results and the 2016 outlook. And in my remarks, all references to growth are in constant currency organic year-over-year basis, excluding the benefit of AMS unless otherwise specified. 
Our Q1 revenue growth of 8% was broad based across our businesses and regions, led again by exciting new product launches, continued global expansion and execution of our category leadership strategy. With the exception of a 3% decline in our Cardiac Rhythm Management sales, all of our other businesses delivered strong organic growth, led by Endo at plus 11%, Urology and Pelvic Health of plus 12%, Interventional Cardiology up [ph] 13%, and Peripheral intervention up [ph] 14%. 
We also saw strong growth globally with Asia delivering 14%; U.S., 7%; and Europe, up 6%. Our emerging market sales grew 21%, including China, sales at 19%. The businesses all accelerated in Q4 of last year and delivered adjusted operating margin of 32.6%, up 360 basis points year-over-year. 
Endoscopy revenue grew 11% driven by a single SpyGlass digital DES visualization system, the stent for drainage of pancreatic fluid and the limited launch of our next-generation hemostasis clip, the Resolution 360. We're also extending our category leadership in Endoscopy by developing commercial capabilities in the emerging markets, adding a focus in pulmonary, which helped drive 15% growth in bronchial thermoplasty as recently launched in both Japan and China. Urology and Pelvic Health organic growth accelerated 12% and was broadly based with double-digit growth in kidney stone, pelvic floor and our legacy business grew 15% internationally, led by 36% growth in the emerging markets. The AMS remediation and integration are on track, and we are delivering against our synergy commitments and a global teams are now fully integrated. 
As expected, stand-alone AMS sales declined slightly in the quarter, and we expect inventory to be appropriate levels in the second quarter. At LithoVue, an innovative single digital scope that provides customers with visualization and navigation capabilities, will be featured in multiple presentations next weekend at the American Urology Association meeting in San Diego. 
Neuromodulation revenue growth accelerated 8% in the first quarter, and sales were driven by the market-leading Spectra platform, the most flexible spinal cord stimulation system in the market; the launch of precision Novi for the primary cell nonrechargeable market; and the solid contribution from our emerging Deep Brain Stimulation platform. 
Our U.S. DBS trial is making great progress, and we expect the launch of the U.S. in late 2017 or early 2018. In Cardiovascular, our segment sales grew 14% in the quarter and a delivered adjusted operating margin of 34.1%, up over 350 basis points, both sequentially and year-over-year. 
Peripheral sales grew 14% in the strong results in atherectomy, thrombectomy and our Innova bare metal and Eluvia drug-eluting stent platforms. The legacy Peripheral business continued impressive trend as we grow share atherectomy market and see very strong demand for our new deep vein thrombosis platform. 
The Eluvia IDE trial called IMPERIAL is on track to complete enrollment by late 2016 or early 2017, and we look forward to presenting 24-month data from our initial trial, MAJESTIC, which had a 12-month patency rate of 96.1% later this year. We're also seeing continued progress for our Lutonix distribution agreement and encouraging EU sales of our ranger drug-coated balloon. We're excited to be the only company developing leading drug-eluting technologies globally on multiple platforms, providing physicians with a variety of tools for treating complex peripheral vascular disease. 
Interventional Cardiology turned another double-digit quarter, a 13% growth, led by complex core drug-eluting stents, PCI guidance and Structural Heart. SYNERGY had a very strong quarter, and we estimate that we added to our market-leading share position in the U.S. and regain market-leading position in Japan. 
DES sales grew 14% in the quarter, and we believe SYNERGY is on track to represent approximately 50% of our U.S. DES revenue mix by the end of the year '16. 
PCI guidance again grew double digits on continued share gains on intravascular ultrasound, and we're encouraged by strong feedback on the ease-of-use of our common fractional flow reserve platform. Our leading portal of solutions for complex high-risk PCI patients continues to drive global growth as well. 
The 13% IC revenue growth is also fueled by our strengthening Structural Heart business, which includes our Lotus transcatheter aortic valve and WATCHMAN Left Atrial Appendage Closure Device. We believe we are uniquely positioned to drive long-term growth in these 2 fast-growing markets via our differentiated platforms. 
Our Lotus valve continues to gain share in Europe, and we are investing significantly to further develop our capabilities. Most recently, a best-in-class paravalvular leakage rates reported for Lotus at ACC last month with predischarge rates of 0.4% for moderate regurgitation in the first 750 patients in the RESPOND Post-Market Study. 
We also continue to plan for the U.S. launch with a Lotus EDGE delivery system at the end of 2017, and we also completed enrollment in our REPRISE Japan trial, where we targeted a 2018 launch. 
Importantly the Lotus EDGE features 14 French compatible, more flexibility, simplified deployment and our new depth guard technology, which controls depth of the valve left particular outflow tract. Studies that demonstrate an improved permanent pacemaker rate with this optimize technique will begin enrollment in mid-2016. 
Also at Structural Heart, WATCHMAN sales were strong and procedure growth annual account openings, both helped by the finalized national coverage determination. We're developing additional WATCHMAN capabilities, primarily by adding resources in field clinical support, market development and training courses. Implant success rates and patient outcomes remain very high quality due to our controlled rollout and proven training programs. 
In the ACC earlier this month, Dr. David Holmes of the Mayo Clinic presented data from the first 1,600 patients implanted with a WATCHMAN commercially and reveals 96% procedural success at an average procedure time of 15 [ph] minutes. So overall, we are very pleased with our progress and our 2016 revenue guidance of $175 million to $200 million in Structural Heart revenue. 
Rhythm Management segment sales declined 2% in the quarter yet delivered adjusted operating margin of 16.8, which is up 290 basis points sequentially as improving profitability remains a core focus. In CRM, as anticipated, sales declined 3% as we faced competitive launches in the U.S. and replacement cycle headwinds. We're optimistic for a second quarter and second half 2016 improvement in our CRM performance. 
Also, as projected, we received 2 key FDA approvals in March for our ACUITY X4 quad CRT lead and earlier this week for our ACCOLADE brady MRI platforms, including the INGEVITY MRI patient lead. Pacemaker sales grew 3% globally, aided by a recently launched X4 CRTD quad device while worldwide ICD sales declined 4%. 
We continue to be very pleased with the performance of the EMBLEM S-ICD, which is enjoying strong growth in both Europe and the U.S. and is currently launching in Japan. And we're encouraged by the growth in Europe, led by our arrhythmia installations and recent launches of the IntellaMap OI and IntellaMap MiFi OI ablation catheters. In the U.S., we're now launching our Blazer open-irrigated therapeutic catheter for the treatment of Type 1 atrial flutter as we continue to invest in the franchise, launch a portfolio of navigation-enabled therapeutic catheters and build capabilities in capital equipment sales and service. 
We have a stronger arrhythmia customer pipeline as many of our new platform enhancements scheduled for release in 2016. So to wrap up, our company had an excellent quarter. First quarter results reflect the strength of our portfolio, our ongoing investment into faster-growth markets and our globalization efforts. More importantly, we are well positioned to continue our strong performance in 2016 and beyond. I want to thank our employees for their continued winning spirit and their commitment to the company. 
Now let me turn the call over to Dan for a more detailed review of our financials."

In Q1, we generated organic revenue growth of 8% versus our 4% to 6% guidance range and adjusted EPS of $0.28, exceeding our guidance range of $0.23 to $0.25 and representing 31% year-over-year growth. Adjusted EPS of $0.28 includes a slig",1942,"Thanks, Mike. In Q1, we generated organic revenue growth of 8% versus our 4% to 6% guidance range and adjusted EPS of $0.28, exceeding our guidance range of $0.23 to $0.25 and representing 31% year-over-year growth. 
Adjusted EPS of $0.28 includes a slightly lower-than-expected tax rate for the quarter due to some discrete tax items. Strong performance in Q1 was driven primarily by revenue growth upside, gross margin expansion and a lower SG&A rate versus the prior year. 
And as Mike mentioned, given the outperformance in Q1, we are raising full year guidance for revenue growth, adjusted operating margins and adjusted EPS. Consolidated revenue of $1,964,000,000 represented operational revenue growth of 13%, which excludes the impact of a $58 million headwind from foreign exchange. Excluding an approximate 500 basis point contribution from the AMS male urology portfolio acquisition, organic revenue growth was 8% in the quarter. 
On an as-reported basis, revenue grew 11% year-over-year. Adjusted gross margin for the first quarter was 72.3%, increasing 100 basis points year-over-year. The increase resulted primarily from cost improvements driven by our value improvement programs and favorable mix, partially offset by price. And similar to Q4 2015, the impact of foreign exchange on gross margin was negligible in the quarter. 
We continue to expect full year 2016 adjusted gross margin to be in the range of 72% to 73%, which we forecast to include approximately 50 basis points of unfavorable FX. Our Q1 2016 adjusted operating margin of 25.1% represents a 260 basis point improvement over Q1 2015, which marks the 7th consecutive quarter in which we've expanded adjusted operating margin by 100 basis points or more. 
There was very modest reinvestment of the medical device tax benefit in Q1, which represents some timing favorability in the quarter, but we are committed to reinvesting substantially all of the full year benefit during the year. Thus, adjusted SG&A expenses were $698 million or 35.5% of sales in the quarter, down 150 basis points year-over-year with some of the benefit due to our targeted initiatives focused on reducing SG&A and a portion due to the more modest medical device tax benefit reinvestments I just mentioned. 
Our Q1 adjusted SG&A rate was the lowest in the last 12 quarters, and we continue to believe our full year rate will be between 35.5% and 36.5%, which, at the midpoint, would be a 140 basis point reduction compared to 2015. 
Adjusted research and development expenses were $209 million in the first quarter or 10.7% of sales, which is roughly flat year-over-year. This is another key area for us to reinvest the benefit of the medical device tax expansion. As a result, we expect our full year 2016 adjusted R&D rate to be between 11% and 12% of sales. 
Royalty expense was 1% of sales in both Q1 of this year and last year and consistent with our guidance. On an adjusted basis, operating income was $494 million in the quarter or 25.1% of sales, up 260 basis points year-over-year. 
Q1 adjusted operating income grew 24% year-over-year, with all 3 reportable segments expanding adjusted operating margin by at least 250 basis points over Q1 of last year. Of particular focus is Rhythm Management, which delivered an adjusted operating margin of 16.8%, which is up from Q4 2015's 13.9% and the full year 2015 rate of 15%. 
For the first half of 2016, we expect Rhythm Management adjusted operating margin to be slightly above 16%. In the second half of 2016, we expect Rhythm Management adjusted operating margin to increase roughly 200 basis points over the first half rate. This second half improvement is expected to result from realizing the full benefit of 2016 product costs, leveraging the improved top line performance expected of the global CRM and EP businesses and realizing the full benefits of our Plant Network Optimization program, which is transferring a portion of our EP manufacturing to lower-cost locations. We continue to believe Rhythm Management is on track to deliver an adjusted operating margin of 20% in 2017. 
GAAP operating income, which includes GAAP to adjusted items of $201 million, was $293 million in Q1 2016. The primary GAAP to adjusted items for the quarter included amortization expense of $136 million, restructuring and related charges of $13 million, acquisition-related SG&A expenses of $14 million and litigation-related charges of $10 million. Our total legal reserve was $1,895,000,000 as of March 31, 2016. 
Now I'll move on to other income and expense. Interest expense for the quarter was $59 million compared to $56 million in Q1 last year, and the increase was primarily due to the incremental debt raised in Q2 of last year to finance the AMS male urology portfolio acquisition. 
Our average interest rate was 4% in Q1 2016 compared to 5.1% in Q1 last year, and the lower interest expense rate in Q1 this year was primarily due to a lower average cost of debt resulting from the senior notes refinancing, which we completed in Q2 last year. 
Other expense was $10 million, and this consisted primarily of foreign exchange losses and investment losses incurred during the quarter. 
Our tax rate for the quarter was 11.4% on a reported basis and 11.8% on an adjusted basis. Excluding discrete tax items in the quarter, our adjusted tax rate would have been 13.5%, and we continue to expect our full year 2016 adjusted tax rate to be approximately 14%. 
On a reported GAAP basis, Q1 2016 EPS was $0.15 and includes net charges and amortization expense totaling $176 million after tax. GAAP EPS of $0.15 compares to break even in Q1 of last year. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. DSO of 60 days increased 1 day compared to March of last year. Days inventory on hand of 162 days was down 4 days compared to March of last year and 1 day from year-end 2015. 
Capital expenditures were $59 million in the quarter compared to $46 million in Q1 2015. And as a reminder, we expect full year 2016 capital expenditures to be roughly $350 million. This is $100 million higher than the full year 2015, primarily due to the construction of our new manufacturing facility and distribution center in Malaysia. And beyond 2016, we expect capital expenditures to return to our more historical run rate of approximately $250 million annually. 
Adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was $250 million compared to $118 million in Q1 2015, and this strong start gives us confidence in our adjusted free cash flow target of $1.5 billion, which represents 10% growth and better visibility to our stretch goal of $1.6 billion, which would represent 17% growth, even in a year with an incremental $100 million in CapEx spend as I mentioned. 
We are also continuing to pursue inventory management initiatives designed to improve the working capital contribution to cash flow. In Q1, we used cash primarily to fund previously agreed legal settlements as well as business development activities. 
Consistent with our goal of returning to pre-AMS debt leverage by year-end 2016, we still expect to repay $250 million of bank term loans by the end of this year. As of March 31 this year, we had cash on hand of $338 million. 
Near term, our capital allocation priorities are to prepay debt, manage contingencies and pursue tuck-in M&A. We ended the quarter with 1,370,000,000 fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding. Consistent with our prior guidance, we expect our share count to increase by roughly 5 million per quarter through the end of the year as we plan to keep the buybacks suspended for the balance of 2016. We would expect this to result in a fully diluted weighted average share count of approximately 1,380,000,000 for the full year 2016. 
I'd like to conclude with revenue and earnings per share guidance for Q2 and full year 2016. For the full year, we now expect consolidated revenue to be in the range of $8,075,000,000 to $8,225,000,000, which represents year-over-year growth of 6% to 8% on an organic basis; 9% to 11% on an operational basis, which includes the AMS revenue; and 8% to 10% on a reported basis. 
As a result of a stronger dollar at current rates, we expect foreign exchange to be a headwind of approximately $100 million for the full year 2016. As we move through 2016, we are reinvesting the benefit of the medical device tax suspension and innovation to help treat patients and sustain top line growth over the long term. Focus areas will include R&D efforts, including clinical trial spend as well as market development, and in Q2, we've already begun to ramp this reinvestment, primarily in the areas of Structural Heart with both Lotus and WATCHMAN and other durable long-term revenue growth platforms such as the EMBLEM S-ICD, our Electrophysiology portfolio, Deep Brain Stimulation and other fast-growing adjacent markets. 
In addition, Q2 is our seasonally high SG&A spend quarter partially due to the highest trade show activity of the year. Thus, for Q2 2016, and consistent with prior years, we would expect a sequential decline in adjusted operating margin to a range of 23% to 24%, which, at the midpoint, represents 140 basis points of improvement year-over-year and puts first half 2016 adjusted operating margin at 200 basis points up versus the first half of last year. 
And for the full year 2016, we are raising our adjusted operating margin guidance from 23.5% to 24.5% to a range of 24% to 24.5% now, which also represents a 200 basis point year-over-year gain. This gain is from operational efficiencies and not the med device tax as we are reinvesting the benefits. 
Turning to adjusted EPS. We now expect full year adjusted EPS for 2016 to be in a range of $1.06 to $1.10, representing 14% to 18% adjusted earnings growth and an increase of $0.03 to each end of the range compared to our prior guidance. 
Now let me walk you through our updated assumptions for the FX impact on adjusted EPS. Our initial 2016 guidance assumed $0.02 of unfavorable FX on adjusted EPS in Q1 and $0.06 for the full year. 
In Q1, the combination of exchange rate movements and timing of hedging contracts resulted in an unfavorable impact of $0.01, and we now believe the full year 2016 unfavorable impact will be $0.05 to $0.06. 
In addition to the $0.01 in Q1, we would expect the remaining $0.04 to $0.05 of unfavorable FX for the full year to break down into $0.02 in Q2 and $0.02 to $0.03 in the second half of 2016. Excluding the unfavorable foreign exchange, our full year adjusted EPS guidance range represents growth of 19% to 24%. 
On a GAAP basis, we expect EPS to be in a range of $0.64 to $0.69. 
Now turning to specifically to Q2 2016. We expect consolidated revenues to be in a range of $2,010,000,000 to $2,060,000,000. If current foreign exchange rates hold constant, the headwind from FX should be approximately $25 million or 135 basis points relative to Q2 of last year. 
We expect consolidated Q2 sales to grow year-over-year in a range of 6% to 8% organically and 11% to 13% operationally. For the second quarter, adjusted EPS is expected to be in a range of $0.25 to $0.27 per share, and GAAP EPS is expected to be in a range of $0.14 to $0.17 per share. 
Please check our Investor Relations website for Q1 2016 financial and operational highlights, which outlines Q1 results as well as Q2 and full year 2016 guidance, including P&L line item guidance. 
So with that, I'll turn it back to Susie, who will moderate the Q&A."

So kind of similar growth rates in IC and cardiology and CRM kind of in the low single-digit range and more in the 4% to 5% market growth rates for our MedSurg, but I guess, what we're most proud of is really across-the-board with the exception of CRM, we're going and EP, we're going significant faster than our competition and based on -- it's really driven by our product launches and really excellent global execution. We're really pleased with the growth in Asia product, almost 15%, very strong growth in Japan, a very strong growth in Europe. So across our businesses, our regions, our teams are really delivering. In terms of your question on Endo and Urology, we are very thoughtful about the AMS acquisition, and we're seeing the benefits of the commercial synergies between those organizations, given the additional commercial footprint that we have as well as the broadness of the bag, and you're seeing that with a really acceleration of our legacy Urology division, in part due to the synergies of our AMS business. We continue to invest in physician training for our Stone Institute, and we continue to benefit from the category leadership based on the premise of the AMS acquisition. In Endoscopy, it's a very innovative division, and we continue to lead in innovation with our digital SpyGlass system, which is really a terrific platform for us that we can continue to build from, and that also helps drive pull-through of our core portfolio. So the R&D teams are executing as well as the commercial teams, and we continue to be committed to our durable mid-single-digit revenue growth, our operating margin expansion and our double-digit EPS growth over the long term."

First quickly on the calendar. No, we don't believe there is an extra impact on Q1. There was obviously a leap year day but then when you factor in the timing of the Easter holiday, I believe it's a true 8% growth for the quarter organically. Relative to operating margin, so I think the -- when you look at Q1 at the 25% and then you look at the 24.25%, which is the midpoint for the full year, one of the key changes there is that as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the reinvestment of the medical device tax benefit over the rest of the year. So a little delayed in Q1 getting off to that start but committed to reinvesting the entire amount for the rest of the year. So that's one, and I think the -- this R&D timing as well in Q1 so our Q1 R&D was 10.7%. If you look at the guidance range, you'd see 11.5% at the midpoint. Part of that's the med device tax reinvestment, and part of it's just the timing of overall R&D. So that's another 80 basis points there going from the 10.7% in Q1 to the overall average of the 11.5% for the full year. So still as you look at the 24.25%, still significant growth versus last year, 190 basis points and feel good that we're striking a good balance between delivering differentiated adjusted operating margin and investing for a continually growing top line for the future."

As we look, we obviously anticipate a solid second quarter, given our 6% to 8% guidance in second quarter. We do face a couple of headwinds through the year. We do anniversary some key product launches in our Peripheral vascular as well as our Endoscopy business. We do anticipate some Japan reimbursement that we'll be working through, and we're very bullish on our WATCHMAN program, but we're also anniversary-ing the initial launch. So there are a few headwinds. But overall, we have an excellent product cadence. The business is performing well, and we feel comfortable with raising our guidance to 6% to 8%. On the cardiology side, we're seeing excellent -- our strategy plan play out. We continue to diversify our Interventional Cardiology as we talked in the future, we really see in the future about 1/3 of our business coming from Structural Heart, about 1/3 from imaging and complex coronary, about 1/3 from drug-eluting stent. And across those kind of 3 slices of the pie, we're doing nice job delivering in the short term and investing for the long term. Our SYNERGY programs really going as planned. We're on track for SYNERGY to represent about 50% of our mix at a appropriate premium price, and physicians continue to see the benefit of the deliverability and the excellent 0 stent thrombosis beyond the first 24 hours. So excellent clinical data there. Our complex coronary business continues to do well as does our Imaging business, and in Structural Heart, as Dan mentioned, actually over in Korea as we speak here, we just had a piece is from Australia today, and just the physician reaction to the deliverability and the low PVL rates of our Lotus valve continues to be very high, and so we are really increasing our investment in that category, given the size of the market potential in the future and also given the differentiation that we believe that Lotus delivers and our commercial capability. So hopefully that gives you a bit of flavor.

Can you give us any more concrete thoughts about what -- when that happens and the kind of drag it is now and how that can change as we look to '17 and beyond?"

So and also the team continues to improve operating margins despite a negative growth of the quarter, which is good to see. On the replacement headwinds, we don't have any additional breakdown of data that we're going to provide on this call, but I will say, and I think in the future, we'll consider providing some additional detail so we can quantify that, but similar to our last call, I do think we have brighter days ahead of us at CRM, whether they be patient MRI approval, with the quad approval. We've also initiate our MRI approval for our defib platform, which we see getting approval in mid-'17. So the portfolio is very strong. the EMBLEM MRI likely approved in U.S. in third quarter, and so we do see the headwind of the replacement cycle improving at the end of 2016, which will help us in 2017. So with the product cadence and improved replacement cycle headwind, we see some brighter days for our CRM business, and in the future, we look at quantifying more precisely some of the benefit of that tailwind on the replacement cycle."

We continue to perform against our strategic plan goals, and we're encouraged by the consistent strong execution of our global team.

We continue to perform against our strategic plan goals, and we're encouraged by the consistent strong execution of our global team. The success of our new product launches across many of our businesses is helping us accelerate expansion into faster-growth markets and deliver solutions that address unmet clinical needs. 
We continue to believe that Boston Scientific is uniquely positioned to deliver differentiated shareholder value through durable mid-single-digit organic revenue growth and double-digit adjusted EPS growth through our ongoing operating margin improvement initiatives. We're very excited about the excellent start to 2016 and our plans to build upon our global momentum in 2017 and beyond. 
We posted excellent results this quarter with total operational revenue growth of 13% and organic revenue growth of 8%, excluding the impact of AMS acquisition benefit. 4 of our 7 businesses grew revenue double digits organically, and we, in turn, leveraged that revenue growth to drive 24% adjusted operating income growth, resulting in adjusted operating margin of 25.1% and a 260 basis point improvement year-over-year. 
We delivered adjusted EPS of $0.28, exceeding the high end of guidance and representing 31% growth, including the negative impact from foreign currency. Importantly, we're increasing our 2016 guidance for revenue, adjusted operating margin and adjusted EPS. We're increasing our full year organic revenue growth guidance from 4% to 7% previously to 6% to 8%. Full year operational revenue, which includes the benefit of AMS, has been increased from 7% to 10% to 9% to 11%. We're increasing our adjusted operating margin guidance to 24% to 24.5%, and we're also increasing our adjusted EPS guidance up $0.03 over our prior range to $1.06 to $1.10, which now represents 14% to 18% growth. And importantly, this EPS guidance includes an expected $0.05 to $0.06 negative impact from foreign exchange. 
I'll now provide some highlight on Q1 results and the 2016 outlook. And in my remarks, all references to growth are in a constant currency organic year-over-year basis, excluding the benefit of AMS, unless otherwise specified. 
Our Q1 revenue growth of 8% was broad based across our businesses and regions, led again by exciting new product launches, continued global expansion and execution of our category leadership strategy. With the exception of a 3% decline in our Cardiac Rhythm Management sales, all of our other businesses delivered strong organic growth, led by Endo at plus 11%, Urology and Pelvic Health of plus 12%, Interventional Cardiology at 13% and Peripheral Intervention at 14%. 
We also saw strong growth globally with Asia delivering 14%; U.S., 7%; and Europe, up 6%. Emerging market sales grew 21%, including China, sales at 19%. The MedSurg businesses all accelerated from Q4 of last year and delivered adjusted operating margin of 32.6%, up 360 basis points year-over-year. 
Endoscopy revenue grew 11%, driven by our single-use SpyGlass digital DES visualization system, the AXIOS Stent for drainage of pancreatic fluid and the limited launch of our next-generation hemostasis clip, the Resolution 360. We're also extending our category leadership in Endoscopy by developing commercial capabilities in the emerging markets, adding a focus in pulmonary, which helped drive 15% growth in bronchial thermoplasty as they recently launched in both Japan and China. Urology and Pelvic Health organic growth accelerated 12% and was broadly based with double-digit growth in kidney stone, pelvic floor and surg/gyn. Our legacy business grew 15% internationally, led by 36% growth in the emerging markets. The AMS remediation and integration are on track, and we're delivering against our synergy commitments and the global teams are now fully integrated. 
As expected, stand-alone AMS sales declined slightly in the quarter, and we expect inventory to be appropriate levels in the second quarter. At LithoVue, an innovative single digital ureteroscope that provides customers with visualization and navigation capabilities, will be featured in multiple presentations next weekend at the American Urology Association meeting in San Diego. 
Neuromodulation revenue growth accelerated 8% in the first quarter, and sales were driven by the market-leading Spectra platform, the most flexible spinal cord stimulation system in the market; the launch of Precision Novi for the primary cell non-rechargeable market; and the solid contribution from our Vercise, our emerging Deep Brain Stimulation platform. 
Our U.S. DBS trial is making great progress, and we expect to launch in the U.S. in late 2017 or early 2018. In Cardiovascular, our segment sales grew 14% in the quarter and delivered adjusted operating margin of 34.1%, up over 350 basis points, both sequentially and year-over-year. 
Peripheral sales grew 14% in the strong results in atherectomy, thrombectomy and our Innova bare metal and Eluvia drug-eluting stent platforms. The legacy Peripheral business continued its recent impressive trend as we grow share in the atherectomy market and see very strong demand for our new Zelante deep vein thrombosis platform. 
The Eluvia IDE trial called IMPERIAL is on track to complete enrollment by late 2016 or early '17, and we look forward to presenting 24-month data from our initial trial, MAJESTIC, which had a 12-month patency rate of 96.1% later this year. We're also seeing continued progress for our Lutonix distribution agreement and encouraging EU sales of our Ranger Drug-Coated Balloon. We're excited to be the only company developing leading drug-eluting technologies globally on multiple platforms, providing physicians with a variety of tools for treating complex peripheral vascular disease. 
Interventional Cardiology turned another double-digit quarter, a 13% growth, led by complex coronary drug-eluting stents, PCI guidance and structural heart. SYNERGY had a very strong quarter, and we estimate that we add it to our market-leading share position in the U.S. and regain market leadership position in Japan. 
DES sales grew 14% in the quarter, and we believe SYNERGY is on track to represent approximately 50% of our U.S. DES revenue mix by the end of the year '16. 
PCI guidance again grew double digits on continued share gains on intravascular ultrasound, and we're encouraged by strong feedback on the ease-of-use of our common fractional flow reserve platform. Our leading portfolio of solutions for complex high-risk PCI patients continues to drive global growth as well. 
The 13% IC revenue growth was also fueled by our strengthening structural heart business, which includes our Lotus transcatheter aortic valve and WATCHMAN Left Atrial Appendage Closure device. We believe we are uniquely positioned to drive long-term growth in these 2 fast-growing markets via our differentiated platforms. 
Our Lotus valve continues to gain share in Europe, and we are investing significantly to further develop our capabilities. Most recently, best-in-class paravalvular leakage rates were reported for Lotus at ACC last month with predischarge rates of 0.4% for moderate paravalvular regurgitation in the first 750 patients of the RESPOND Post-Market Study. 
We also continue to plan for the U.S. launch with the Lotus EDGE delivery system at the end of 2017, and we also completed enrollment in our REPRISE Japan trial, where we targeted a 2018 launch. 
Importantly the Lotus EDGE features 14 French compatible, more flexibility, simplified deployment and our new depth guard technology, which controls depth of the valve in the left ventricular outflow tract. Studies that demonstrate an improved permanent pacemaker rate with this optimized technique will begin enrollment in mid-2016. 
Also at structural heart, WATCHMAN sales were strong on procedure growth and new account openings, both helped by the finalized national coverage determination. We're developing additional WATCHMAN capabilities, primarily by adding resources in field clinical support, market development and training courses. Implant success rates and patient outcomes remain very high quality due to our controlled rollout and proven training programs. 
In the ACC earlier this month, Dr. David Holmes of the Mayo Clinic presented data from the first 1,600 patients implanted with a WATCHMAN commercially and revealed 96% procedural success at an average procedure time of 15 minutes. So overall, we are very pleased with our progress and our 2016 revenue guidance of $175 million to $200 million in Structural Heart revenue. 
Rhythm Management segment sales declined 2% in the quarter yet delivered adjusted operating margin of 16.8%, which is up 290 basis points sequentially as improving profitability remains a core focus. In CRM, as anticipated, sales declined 3% as we faced competitive launches in the U.S. and replacement cycle headwinds. We're optimistic for a second quarter and second half 2016 improvement in our CRM performance. 
Also, as projected, we received 2 key FDA approvals in March for our ACUITY X4 quad CRT lead, and earlier this week for our ACCOLADE brady MRI platforms, including the INGEVITY MRI patient lead. Pacemaker sales grew 3% globally, aided by a recently launched X4 CRT-P quad device while worldwide ICD sales declined 4%. 
We continue to be very pleased with the performance of the EMBLEM S-ICD, which is enjoying a strong growth in both Europe and the U.S. and is currently launching in Japan. In Electrophysiology, we're encouraged by double-digit growth in Europe, led by our arrhythmia installations and the recent launches of the IntellaMap OI and IntellaTip MiFi OI ablation catheters. In the U.S., we're now launching our Blazer Open-Irrigated Therapeutic Catheter for the treatment of Type 1 atrial flutter as we continue to invest in the franchise, launch a portfolio of navigation-enabled therapeutic catheters and build capabilities in capital equipment sales and service. 
We have a stronger arrhythmia customer pipeline as many of our new platform enhancements scheduled for release in 2016. So to wrap up, our company had an excellent quarter. First quarter results reflect the strength of our portfolio, our ongoing investment in faster-growth markets and our globalization efforts. More importantly, we are well positioned to continue our strong performance in 2016 and beyond. I wanted to thank our employees for their continued winning spirit and their commitment to the company. 
Now let me turn the call over to Dan for a more detailed review of our financials."
317627,329821425,964245,"Boston Scientific Corporation, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2016",2016-04-27,"Earnings Calls","Boston Scientific Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Mike. In Q1, we generated organic revenue growth of 8% versus our 4% to 6% guidance range and adjusted EPS of $0.28, exceeding our guidance range of $0.23 to $0.25 and representing 31% year-over-year growth. Adjusted EPS of $0.28 includes a slig",1943,"Thanks, Mike. In Q1, we generated organic revenue growth of 8% versus our 4% to 6% guidance range and adjusted EPS of $0.28, exceeding our guidance range of $0.23 to $0.25 and representing 31% year-over-year growth. 
Adjusted EPS of $0.28 includes a slightly lower-than-expected tax rate for the quarter due to some discrete tax items. The strong performance in Q1 was driven primarily by revenue growth upside, gross margin expansion and a lower SG&A rate versus the prior year. 
And as Mike mentioned, given the outperformance in Q1, we are raising full year guidance for revenue growth, adjusted operating margin and adjusted EPS. Consolidated revenue of $1,964,000,000 represented operational revenue growth of 13%, which excludes the impact of a $58 million headwind from foreign exchange. Excluding an approximate 500 basis point contribution from the AMS male urology portfolio acquisition, organic revenue growth was 8% in the quarter. 
On an as-reported basis, revenue grew 11% year-over-year. Adjusted gross margin for the first quarter was 72.3%, increasing 100 basis points year-over-year. The increase resulted primarily from cost improvements driven by our value improvement programs and favorable mix, partially offset by price. And similar to Q4 of 2015, the impact of foreign exchange on gross margin was negligible in the quarter. 
We continue to expect full year 2016 adjusted gross margin to be in the range of 72% to 73%, which we forecast to include approximately 50 basis points of unfavorable FX. Our Q1 2016 adjusted operating margin of 25.1% represents a 260 basis point improvement over Q1 2015, which marks the 7th consecutive quarter in which we've expanded adjusted operating margin by 100 basis points or more. 
There was very modest reinvestment of the medical device tax benefit in Q1, which represents some timing favorability in the quarter, but we are committed to reinvesting substantially all of the full year benefit during the year. Thus, adjusted SG&A expenses were $698 million or 35.5% of sales in the quarter, down 150 basis points year-over-year with some of the benefit due to our targeted initiatives focused on reducing SG&A and a portion due to the more modest medical device tax benefit reinvestment I just mentioned. 
Our Q1 adjusted SG&A rate was the lowest in the last 12 quarters, and we continue to believe our full year rate will be between 35.5% and 36.5%, which, at the midpoint, would be a 140 basis point reduction compared to 2015. 
Adjusted research and development expenses were $209 million in the first quarter or 10.7% of sales, which is roughly flat year-over-year. This is another key area for us to reinvest the benefit of the medical device tax suspension. As a result, we expect our full year 2016 adjusted R&D rate to be between 11% and 12% of sales. 
Royalty expense was 1% of sales in both Q1 of this year and last year and consistent with our guidance. On an adjusted basis, operating income was $494 million in the quarter or 25.1% of sales, up 260 basis points year-over-year. 
Q1 adjusted operating income grew 24% year-over-year, with all 3 reportable segments expanding adjusted operating margin by at least 250 basis points over Q1 of last year. Of particular focus is Rhythm Management, which delivered an adjusted operating margin of 16.8%, which is up from Q4 2015's 13.9% and the full year 2015 rate of 15%. 
For the first half of 2016, we expect Rhythm Management adjusted operating margin to be slightly above 16%. In the second half of 2016, we expect Rhythm Management adjusted operating margin to increase roughly 200 basis points over the first half rate. This second half improvement is expected to result from realizing the full benefit of 2016 product costs, leveraging the improved top line performance expected of the global CRM and EP businesses and realizing the full benefits of our Plant Network Optimization program, which is transferring a portion of our EP manufacturing to lower-cost locations. We continue to believe Rhythm Management is on track to deliver an adjusted operating margin of 20% in 2017. 
GAAP operating income, which includes GAAP to adjusted items of $201 million, was $293 million in Q1 2016. The primary GAAP to adjusted items for the quarter included amortization expense of $136 million, restructuring and related charges of $13 million, acquisition-related SG&A expenses of $14 million and litigation-related charges of $10 million. Our total legal reserve was $1,895,000,000 as of March 31, 2016. 
Now I'll move on to other income and expense. Interest expense for the quarter was $59 million compared to $56 million in Q1 last year, and the increase was primarily due to the incremental debt raised in Q2 of last year to finance the AMS male urology portfolio acquisition. 
Our average interest rate was 4% in Q1 2016 compared to 5.1% in Q1 last year, and the lower interest expense rate in Q1 this year was primarily due to lower average cost of debt resulting from the senior notes refinancing, which we completed in Q2 last year. 
Other expense was $10 million, and this consisted primarily of foreign exchange losses and investment losses incurred during the quarter. 
Our tax rate for the quarter was 11.4% on a reported basis and 11.8% on an adjusted basis. Excluding discrete tax items in the quarter, our adjusted tax rate would have been 13.5%, and we continue to expect our full year 2016 adjusted tax rate to be approximately 14%. 
On a reported GAAP basis, Q1 2016 EPS was $0.15 and includes net charges and amortization expense totaling $176 million after tax. GAAP EPS of $0.15 compares to breakeven in Q1 of last year. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. DSO of 60 days increased 1 day compared to March of last year. Days inventory on hand of 162 days was down 4 days compared to March of last year and 1 day from year-end 2015. 
Capital expenditures were $59 million in the quarter compared to $46 million in Q1 2015. And as a reminder, we expect full year 2016 capital expenditures to be roughly $350 million. This is $100 million higher than the full year 2015, primarily due to the construction of our new manufacturing facility and distribution center in Malaysia. And beyond 2016, we expect capital expenditures to return to our more historical run rate of approximately $250 million annually. 
Adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was $250 million compared to $118 million in Q1 2015, and this strong start gives us confidence in our adjusted free cash flow target of $1.5 billion, which represents 10% growth and better visibility to our stretch goal of $1.6 billion, which would represent 17% growth, even in a year with an incremental $100 million in CapEx spend as I mentioned. 
We're also continuing to pursue inventory management initiatives designed to improve the working capital contribution to cash flow. In Q1, we used cash primarily to fund previously agreed legal settlements as well as business development activities. 
Consistent with our goal of returning to pre-AMS debt leverage by year-end 2016, we still expect to repay $250 million of bank term loans by the end of this year. As of March 31 this year, we had cash on hand of $338 million. 
Near term, our capital allocation priorities are to prepay debt, manage our contingencies and pursue tuck-in M&A. We ended the quarter with 1,370,000,000 fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding. Consistent with our prior guidance, we expect our share count to increase by roughly 5 million per quarter through the end of the year as we plan to keep the buybacks suspended for the balance of 2016. We would expect this to result in a fully diluted weighted average share count of approximately 1,380,000,000 for the full year 2016. 
I'd like to conclude with revenue and earnings per share guidance for Q2 and full year 2016. For the full year, we now expect consolidated revenue to be in the range of $8,075,000,000 to $8,225,000,000, which represents year-over-year growth of 6% to 8% on an organic basis; 9% to 11% on an operational basis, which includes the AMS revenue; and 8% to 10% on a reported basis. 
As a result of a stronger dollar, at current rates, we expect foreign exchange to be a headwind of approximately $100 million for the full year 2016. As we move through 2016, we are reinvesting the benefit of the medical device tax suspension and to innovation to help treat patients and sustain top line growth over the long term. Focus areas will include R&D efforts, including clinical trial spend as well as market development, and in Q2, we've already begun to ramp this reinvestment, primarily in the areas of structural heart with both Lotus and WATCHMAN, and other durable long-term revenue growth platforms such as the EMBLEM S-ICD, our Electrophysiology portfolio, Deep Brain Stimulation and other fast-growing adjacent market. 
In addition, Q2 is our seasonally high SG&A spend quarter partially due to the highest trade show activity of the year. Thus, for Q2 2016, and consistent with prior years, we would expect a sequential decline in adjusted operating margin to a range of 23% to 24%, which, at the midpoint, represents 140 basis points of improvement year-over-year and puts first half 2016 adjusted operating margin at 200 basis points up versus the first half of last year. 
And for the full year 2016, we are raising our adjusted operating margin guidance from 23.5% to 24.5% to a range of 24% to 24.5% now, which also represents a 200 basis point year-over-year gain. This gain is from operational efficiencies and not the med device tax as we are reinvesting the benefits. 
Turning to adjusted EPS. We now expect full year adjusted EPS for 2016 to be in a range of $1.06 to $1.10, representing 14% to 18% adjusted earnings growth and an increase of $0.03 to each end of the range compared to our prior guidance. 
Now let me walk you through our updated assumptions for the FX impact on adjusted EPS. Our initial 2016 guidance assumed $0.02 of unfavorable FX on adjusted EPS in Q1 and $0.06 for the full year. 
In Q1, the combination of exchange rate movements and timing of hedging contracts resulted in an unfavorable impact of $0.01, and we now believe the full year 2016 unfavorable impact will be $0.05 to $0.06. 
In addition to the $0.01 in Q1, we would expect the remaining $0.04 to $0.05 of unfavorable FX for the full year to break down into $0.02 in Q2 and $0.02 to $0.03 in the second half of 2016. Excluding the unfavorable foreign exchange, our full year adjusted EPS guidance range represents growth of 19% to 24%. 
On a GAAP basis, we expect EPS to be in a range of $0.64 to $0.69. 
Now turning to specifically to Q2 2016. We expect consolidated revenues to be in a range of $2,010,000,000 to $2,060,000,000. If current foreign exchange rates hold constant, the headwind from FX should be approximately $25 million or 135 basis points relative to Q2 of last year. 
We expect consolidated Q2 sales to grow year-over-year in a range of 6% to 8% organically and 11% to 13% operationally. For the second quarter, adjusted EPS is expected to be in a range of $0.25 to $0.27 per share, and GAAP EPS is expected to be in a range of $0.14 to $0.17 per share. 
Please check our Investor Relations website for Q1 2016 financial and operational highlights, which outlines Q1 results as well as Q2 and full year 2016 guidance, including P&L line item guidance. 
So with that, I'll turn it back to Susie, who will moderate the Q&A."

So kind of similar growth rates in IC and cardiology and CRM kind of in the low single-digit range and more in the 4% to 5% market growth rates for our MedSurg. But I guess, what we're most proud of is really across the board with the exception of CRM. We're going -- and EP. We're growing significantly faster than our competition. And based on -- that's really driven by our product launches and really excellent global execution. Really pleased with the growth in Asia product, almost 15%, very strong growth in Japan, a very strong growth in Europe. So across our businesses, our regions, our teams are really delivering. In terms of your question on Endo and Urology, we are very thoughtful about the AMS acquisition, and we're seeing the benefits of the commercial synergies between those organizations, given the additional commercial footprint that we have as well as the broadness of the bag, and you're seeing that with a really acceleration of our legacy Urology division, in part due to the synergies of our AMS business. We continue to invest in physician training for our Stone Institute, and we continue to benefit from the category leadership based on the premise of the AMS acquisition. In Endoscopy, it's a very innovative division, and we continue to lead in innovation with our digital SpyGlass system, which is really a terrific platform for us that we can continue to build from, and that also helps drive pull-through of our core portfolio. So the R&D teams are executing as well as the commercial teams, and we continue to be committed to our durable mid-single-digit revenue growth, our operating margin expansion and our double-digit EPS growth over the long term."

There was obviously a leap year day, but then when you factor in the timing of the Easter holiday, I believe it's a true 8% growth for the quarter organically. Relative to operating margin, so I think the -- when you look at Q1 at the 25% and then you look at the 24.25%, which is the midpoint for the full year, one of the key changes there is that, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the reinvestment of the medical device tax benefit over the rest of the year. So a little delayed in Q1 getting off to that start but committed to reinvesting the entire amount for the rest of the year. So that's one. And I think the -- this R&D timing as well in Q1 so our Q1 R&D was 10.7%. If you look at the guidance range, you'd see 11.5% at the midpoint. Part of that's the med device tax reinvestment and part of it's just the timing of overall R&D. So that's another 80 basis points there going from the 10.7% in Q1 to the overall average of 11.5% for the full year. So still -- I mean, as you look at the 24.25%, still significant growth versus last year, 190 basis points and feel good that we're striking a good balance between delivering differentiated adjusted operating margin and investing for a continually growing top line for the future."

We took the guidance up from 4% to 7% to 6% to 8% organically, not impacting AMS. And as I mentioned, the businesses and regions are performing at a nice level. As we look, we obviously anticipate a solid second quarter, given our 6% to 8% guidance in second quarter. We do face a couple of headwinds throughout the year. We do anniversary some key product launches in our peripheral vascular as well as our Endoscopy business. We do anticipate some Japan reimbursement cuts that we'll be working through. And we're very bullish on our WATCHMAN program, but we're also anniversary-ing the initial launch. So there are a few headwinds. But overall, we have an excellent product cadence. The business is performing well, and we feel comfortable with raising our guidance to 6% to 8%. On the cardiology side, we're seeing excellent -- our strategy play out. We continue to diversify our Interventional Cardiology portfolio. As we talked in the future, we really see in the future about 1/3 of our business coming from structural heart, about 1/3 from imaging and complex coronary and about 1/3 from drug-eluting stents. And across those kind of 3 slices of the pie, we're doing a nice job of delivering in the short term and investing for the long term. Our SYNERGY program is really going as planned. We're on track for SYNERGY to represent about 50% of our mix at an appropriate premium price, and physicians continue to see the benefit of the deliverability and the excellent 0 stent thrombosis beyond the first 24 hours. So excellent clinical data there. Our complex coronary business continues to do well as does our Imaging business. And in structural heart, as Dan mentioned, I'm actually over in Korea as we speak here, we just had a live case from Australia today and just the physician reaction to the deliverability and the low PVL rates of our Lotus Valve continues to be very high. And so we are really increasing our investment in that category, given the size of the market potential in the future and also given the differentiation that we believe that Lotus delivers and our commercial capability. So hopefully that gives you a bit of flavor. We're pleased with our raise on the guidance, and we'll manage our headwinds and continue to hopefully deliver revenue growth at the top tier of our sector."

We're getting nice mix benefit from S-ICD as well as global uptake of the S-ICD, particularly in Japan. And I think our strategy of category leadership, which we've really stressed for a number of years now, is starting to pay off, what made the large systems in the U.S. willing and wanting to partner with Boston Scientific, given our current platform as well as the pipeline that we've committed to. So I think the markets are steady. We have a nice pipeline that's helping some of our mix benefit. And I think, importantly, we're really building up our capabilities outside the U.S. Our Asia business grew very well, and just this year, we've done a grand opening for our Malaysia plant. We have a new R&D center in India. We have new training centers. So our capabilities in Asia are significantly stronger than they used to be. So that's also helping strengthen our business."

On the replacement headwinds, we don't have any additional breakdown of data that we're going to provide on this call, but I will say, and I think in the future, we'll consider providing some additional detail so we can quantify that. But similar to our last call, I do think we have brighter days ahead of us in CRM with the pacer MRI approval, with the quad approval. We've also initiated our MRI approval for our defib platform, which we see getting approval in mid-'17. So the portfolio is very strong. We'll have EMBLEM MRI likely approved in U.S. in third quarter. And so we do see the headwind of the replacement cycle improving at the end of 2016, which will help us in 2017. So with the product cadence and improved replacement cycle headwind, we see some brighter days for our CRM business.

And from a cash flow as well as the other metrics that you mentioned, reduce inventory overall by the end of the year as a company. So my goal would be that as we go through the year, you'd see that. It was pretty reasonable compared to Q4 of last year, inventory this year, and so we've kind of stemmed the tide of it now and I'd look to, for the last 3 quarters, to see that reduce, which will help all the turnover and asset metrics as well as the contribution of working capital to cash flow."

We continue to perform against our strategic plan goals, and we're encouraged by the consistent strong execution of our global team. The success of our new product launches across many of our businesses is helping us accelerate expansion into faster-growth markets and deliver solutions that address unmet clinical needs. 
We continue to believe that Boston Scientific is uniquely positioned to deliver differentiated shareholder value through durable mid-single-digit organic revenue growth and double-digit adjusted EPS growth through our ongoing operating margin improvement initiatives. We're very excited about the excellent start to 2016 and our plans to build upon our global momentum in 2017 and beyond. 
We posted excellent results this quarter with total operational revenue growth of 13% and organic revenue growth of 8%, excluding the impact of AMS acquisition benefit. Four of our 7 businesses grew revenue double-digits organically, and we, in turn, leveraged that revenue growth to drive 24% adjusted operating income growth, resulting in an adjusted operating margin of 25.1% and a 260 basis point improvement year-over-year. 
We delivered adjusted EPS of $0.28, exceeding the high end of guidance and representing 31% growth, including the negative impact from foreign currency. Importantly, we're increasing our 2016 guidance for revenue, adjusted operating margin and adjusted EPS. We're increasing our full year organic revenue growth guidance from 4% to 7% previously to 6% to 8%. Full year operational revenue, which includes the benefit of AMS, has been increased from 7% to 10%, to 9% to 11%. We're increasing our adjusted operating margin guidance to 24% to 24.5%, and we're also increasing our adjusted EPS guidance up $0.03 over our prior range to $1.06 to $1.10, which now represents 14% to 18% growth. And importantly, this EPS guidance includes an expected $0.05 to $0.06 negative impact from foreign exchange. 
I'll now provide some highlight on Q1 results and the 2016 outlook. And in my remarks, all references to growth are on a constant currency organic year-over-year basis, excluding the benefit of AMS, unless otherwise specified. 
Our Q1 revenue growth of 8% was broad based across our businesses and regions, led again by exciting new product launches, continued global expansion and execution of our category leadership strategy. With the exception of a 3% decline in our Cardiac Rhythm Management sales, all of our other businesses delivered strong organic growth, led by Endo at plus 11%, Urology and Pelvic Health of plus 12%, Interventional Cardiology at 13% and Peripheral Intervention at 14%. 
We also saw strong growth globally with Asia delivering 14%; U.S., 7%; and Europe, up 6%. Emerging market sales grew 21%, including China, sales at 19%. The MedSurg businesses all accelerated from Q4 of last year and delivered adjusted operating margin of 32.6%, up 360 basis points year-over-year. 
Endoscopy revenue grew 11%, driven by our single-use SpyGlass digital DS visualization system, the AXIOS Stent for drainage of pancreatic fluid and the limited launch of our next-generation hemostasis clip, the Resolution 360. We're also extending our category leadership in Endoscopy by developing commercial capabilities in the emerging markets, adding a focus in pulmonary, which helped drive 15% growth in bronchial thermoplasty as they recently launched in both Japan and China. Urology and pelvic health organic growth accelerated 12% and was broadly based with double-digit growth in kidney stone, and pelvic floor and surg/gyn. Our legacy business grew 15% internationally, led by 36% growth in the emerging markets. The AMS remediation and integration are on track, and we're delivering against our synergy commitments and the global teams are now fully integrated. 
As expected, stand-alone AMS sales declined slightly in the quarter, and we expect inventory to be appropriate levels in the second quarter. At LithoVue, an innovative single digital ureteroscope that provides customers with visualization and navigation capabilities, will be featured in multiple presentations next weekend at the American Urology Association meeting in San Diego. 
Neuromodulation revenue growth accelerated 8% in the first quarter, and sales were driven by the market-leading Spectra platform, the most flexible spinal cord stimulation system in the market; the launch of Precision Novi for the primary cell non-rechargeable market; and the solid contribution from our Vercise, our emerging Deep Brain Stimulation platform. 
Our U.S. DBS trial is making great progress, and we expect to launch in the U.S. in late 2017 or early 2018. In Cardiovascular, our segment sales grew 14% in the quarter and delivered adjusted operating margin of 34.1%, up over 350 basis points, both sequentially and year-over-year. 
Peripheral sales grew 14% in strong results in atherectomy, thrombectomy and our Innova bare metal and Eluvia drug-eluting stent platforms. The legacy Peripheral business continued its recent impressive trend as we grow share in the atherectomy market and see very strong demand for our new Zelante Deep Vein Thrombosis platform. 
The Eluvia IDE trial called IMPERIAL is on track to complete enrollment by late 2016 or early '17, and we look forward to presenting 24-month data from our initial trial of MAJESTIC -- which had a 12-month patency rate of 96.1% -- later this year. We're also seeing continued progress for our Lutonix distribution agreement and encouraging EU sales of our Ranger Drug-Coated Balloon. We're excited to be the only company developing leading drug-eluting technologies globally on multiple platforms, providing physicians with a variety of tools for treating complex peripheral vascular disease. 
Interventional Cardiology turned another double-digit quarter, a 13% growth, led by complex coronary drug-eluting stents, PCI guidance and structural heart. SYNERGY had a very strong quarter, and we estimate that we add it to our market-leading share position in the U.S. and regain market leadership position in Japan. 
DES sales grew 14% in the quarter, and we believe SYNERGY is on track to represent approximately 50% of our U.S. DES revenue mix by the end of the year '16. 
PCI guidance again grew double digits on continued share gains on intravascular ultrasound, and we're encouraged by strong feedback on the ease-of-use of our Comet Fractional Flow Reserve platform. Our leading portfolio of solutions for complex high-risk PCI patients continues to drive global growth as well. 
The 13% IC revenue growth was also fueled by our strengthening structural heart business, which includes our Lotus transcatheter aortic valve and WATCHMAN Left Atrial Appendage Closure device. We believe we are uniquely positioned to drive long-term growth in these 2 fast-growing markets via our differentiated platforms. 
Our Lotus valve continues to gain share in Europe, and we are investing significantly to further develop our capabilities. Most recently, best-in-class paravalvular leakage rates were reported for Lotus at ACC last month with predischarge rates of 0.4% for moderate paravalvular regurgitation in the first 750 patients of the RESPOND Post-Market Study. 
We also continue to plan for the U.S. launch with the Lotus EDGE delivery system at the end of 2017, and we also completed enrollment in our REPRISE Japan trial, where we target a 2018 launch. 
Importantly the Lotus EDGE features a 14 French compatible sheath, more flexibility, simplified deployment and our new depth guard technology, which controls depth of the valve in the left ventricular outflow tract. Studies to demonstrate an improved permanent pacemaker rate with this optimized technique will begin enrollment in mid-2016. 
Also at structural heart, WATCHMAN sales were strong on procedure growth and new account openings, both helped by the finalized national coverage determination. We're developing additional WATCHMAN capabilities, primarily by adding resources in field clinical support, market development and training courses. Implant success rates and patient outcomes remain very high quality due to our controlled rollout and proven training programs. 
In the ACC earlier this month, Dr. David Holmes of the Mayo Clinic presented data from the first 1,600 patients implanted with a WATCHMAN commercially and revealed 96% procedural success at an average procedure time of 15 minutes. So overall, we are very pleased with our progress in our 2016 revenue guidance of $175 million to $200 million in Structural Heart revenue. 
Rhythm Management segment sales declined 2% in the quarter yet delivered adjusted operating margin of 16.8%, which is up 290 basis points sequentially as improving profitability remains a core focus. In CRM, as anticipated, sales declined 3% as we faced competitive launches in the U.S. and replacement cycle headwinds. We're optimistic for a second quarter and second half 2016 improvement in our CRM performance. 
Also, as projected, we received 2 key FDA approvals in March for our ACUITY X4 quad CRT lead, and earlier this week for our ACCOLADE Brady MRI platforms, including the INGEVITY MRI patient lead. Pacemaker sales grew 3% globally, aided by a recently launched X4 CRT-P quad device while worldwide ICD sales declined 4%. 
We continue to be very pleased with the performance of the EMBLEM S-ICD, which is enjoying strong growth in both Europe and the U.S. and is currently launching in Japan. In Electrophysiology, we're encouraged by double-digit growth in Europe, led by our arrhythmia installations and the recent launches of the IntellaMap OI and IntellaTip MiFi OI ablation catheters. In the U.S., we're now launching our Blazer Open-Irrigated Therapeutic Catheter for the treatment of Type 1 atrial flutter as we continue to invest in the franchise, launch a portfolio of navigation-enabled therapeutic catheters and build capabilities in capital equipment sales and service. 
We have a strong arrhythmia customer pipeline as many of our new platform enhancements scheduled for release in 2016. So to wrap up, our company had an excellent quarter. First quarter results reflect the strength of our portfolio, our ongoing investment in faster-growth markets and our globalization efforts. More importantly, we are well positioned to continue our strong performance in 2016 and beyond. I want to thank our employees for their continued winning spirit and their commitment to the company. 
Now let me turn the call over to Dan for a more detailed review of our financials."

In Q1, we generated organic revenue growth of 8% versus our 4% to 6% guidance range and adjusted EPS of $0.28, exceeding our guidance range of $0.23 to $0.25 and representing 31% year-over-year growth. Adjusted EPS of $0.28 includes a slig",1941,"Thanks, Mike. In Q1, we generated organic revenue growth of 8% versus our 4% to 6% guidance range and adjusted EPS of $0.28, exceeding our guidance range of $0.23 to $0.25 and representing 31% year-over-year growth. 
Adjusted EPS of $0.28 includes a slightly lower-than-expected tax rate for the quarter due to some discrete tax items. The strong performance in Q1 was driven primarily by revenue growth upside, gross margin expansion and a lower SG&A rate versus the prior year. 
And as Mike mentioned, given the outperformance in Q1, we are raising full year guidance for revenue growth, adjusted operating margin and adjusted EPS. Consolidated revenue of $1,964,000,000 represented operational revenue growth of 13%, which excludes the impact of a $58 million headwind from foreign exchange. Excluding an approximate 500 basis point contribution from the AMS male urology portfolio acquisition, organic revenue growth was 8% in the quarter. 
On an as-reported basis, revenue grew 11% year-over-year. Adjusted gross margin for the first quarter was 72.3%, increasing 100 basis points year-over-year. The increase resulted primarily from cost improvements driven by our value improvement programs and favorable mix, partially offset by price. And similar to Q4 of 2015, the impact of foreign exchange on gross margin was negligible in the quarter. 
We continue to expect full year 2016 adjusted gross margin to be in the range of 72% to 73%, which we forecast to include approximately 50 basis points of unfavorable FX. Our Q1 2016 adjusted operating margin of 25.1% represents a 260 basis point improvement over Q1 2015, which marks the 7th consecutive quarter in which we've expanded adjusted operating margin by 100 basis points or more. 
There was very modest reinvestment of the medical device tax benefit in Q1, which represents some timing favorability in the quarter, but we are committed to reinvesting substantially all of the full year benefit during the year. Thus, adjusted SG&A expenses were $698 million or 35.5% of sales in the quarter, down 150 basis points year-over-year with some of the benefit due to our targeted initiatives focused on reducing SG&A and a portion due to the more modest medical device tax benefit reinvestment I just mentioned. 
Our Q1 adjusted SG&A rate was the lowest in the last 12 quarters, and we continue to believe our full year rate will be between 35.5% and 36.5%, which, at the midpoint, would be a 140 basis point reduction compared to 2015. 
Adjusted research and development expenses were $209 million in the first quarter or 10.7% of sales, which is roughly flat year-over-year. This is another key area for us to reinvest the benefit of the medical device tax suspension. As a result, we expect our full year 2016 adjusted R&D rate to be between 11% and 12% of sales. 
Royalty expense was 1% of sales in both Q1 of this year and last year and consistent with our guidance. On an adjusted basis, operating income was $494 million in the quarter or 25.1% of sales, up 260 basis points year-over-year. 
Q1 adjusted operating income grew 24% year-over-year, with all 3 reportable segments expanding adjusted operating margin by at least 250 basis points over Q1 of last year. Of particular focus is Rhythm Management, which delivered an adjusted operating margin of 16.8%, which is up from Q4 2015's 13.9% and the full year 2015 rate of 15%. 
For the first half of 2016, we expect Rhythm Management adjusted operating margin to be slightly above 16%. In the second half of 2016, we expect Rhythm Management adjusted operating margin to increase roughly 200 basis points over the first half rate. This second half improvement is expected to result from realizing the full benefit of 2016 product costs, leveraging the improved top line performance expected of the global CRM and EP businesses and realizing the full benefits of our Plant Network Optimization program, which is transferring a portion of our EP manufacturing to lower-cost locations. We continue to believe Rhythm Management is on track to deliver an adjusted operating margin of 20% in 2017. 
GAAP operating income, which includes GAAP to adjusted items of $201 million, was $293 million in Q1 2016. The primary GAAP to adjusted items for the quarter included amortization expense of $136 million, restructuring and related charges of $13 million, acquisition-related SG&A expenses of $14 million and litigation-related charges of $10 million. Our total legal reserve was $1,895,000,000 as of March 31, 2016. 
Now I'll move on to other income and expense. Interest expense for the quarter was $59 million compared to $56 million in Q1 last year, and the increase was primarily due to the incremental debt raised in Q2 of last year to finance the AMS male urology portfolio acquisition. 
Our average interest rate was 4% in Q1 2016 compared to 5.1% in Q1 last year, and the lower interest expense rate in Q1 this year was primarily due to lower average cost of debt resulting from the senior notes refinancing, which we completed in Q2 last year. 
Other expense was $10 million, and this consisted primarily of foreign exchange losses and investment losses incurred during the quarter. 
Our tax rate for the quarter was 11.4% on a reported basis and 11.8% on an adjusted basis. Excluding discrete tax items in the quarter, our adjusted tax rate would have been 13.5%, and we continue to expect our full year 2016 adjusted tax rate to be approximately 14%. 
On a reported GAAP basis, Q1 2016 EPS was $0.15 and includes net charges and amortization expense totaling $176 million after tax. GAAP EPS of $0.15 compares to breakeven in Q1 of last year. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. DSO of 60 days increased 1 day compared to March of last year. Days inventory on hand of 162 days was down 4 days compared to March of last year and 1 day from year-end 2015. 
Capital expenditures were $59 million in the quarter compared to $46 million in Q1 2015. And as a reminder, we expect full year 2016 capital expenditures to be roughly $350 million. This is $100 million higher than the full year 2015, primarily due to the construction of our new manufacturing facility and distribution center in Malaysia. And beyond 2016, we expect capital expenditures to return to our more historical run rate of approximately $250 million annually. 
Adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was $250 million compared to $118 million in Q1 2015, and this strong start gives us confidence in our adjusted free cash flow target of $1.5 billion, which represents 10% growth and better visibility to our stretch goal of $1.6 billion, which would represent 17% growth, even in a year with an incremental $100 million in CapEx spend as I mentioned. 
We're also continuing to pursue inventory management initiatives designed to improve the working capital contribution to cash flow. In Q1, we used cash primarily to fund previously agreed legal settlements as well as business development activities. 
Consistent with our goal of returning to pre-AMS debt leverage by year-end 2016, we still expect to repay $250 million of bank term loans by the end of this year. As of March 31 this year, we had cash on hand of $338 million. 
Near term, our capital allocation priorities are to prepay debt, manage our contingencies and pursue tuck-in M&A. We ended the quarter with 1,370,000,000 fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding. Consistent with our prior guidance, we expect our share count to increase by roughly 5 million per quarter through the end of the year as we plan to keep the buybacks suspended for the balance of 2016. We would expect this to result in a fully diluted weighted average share count of approximately 1,380,000,000 for the full year 2016. 
I'd like to conclude with revenue and earnings per share guidance for Q2 and full year 2016. For the full year, we now expect consolidated revenue to be in the range of $8,075,000,000 to $8,225,000,000, which represents year-over-year growth of 6% to 8% on an organic basis; 9% to 11% on an operational basis, which includes the AMS revenue; and 8% to 10% on a reported basis. 
As a result of a stronger dollar, at current rates, we expect foreign exchange to be a headwind of approximately $100 million for the full year 2016. As we move through 2016, we are reinvesting the benefit of the medical device tax suspension into innovation to help treat patients and sustain top line growth over the long term. Focus areas will include R&D efforts, including clinical trial spend as well as market development, and in Q2, we've already begun to ramp this reinvestment, primarily in the areas of structural heart with both Lotus and WATCHMAN, and other durable long-term revenue growth platforms such as the EMBLEM S-ICD, our electrophysiology portfolio, deep brain stimulation and other fast-growing adjacent market. 
In addition, Q2 is our seasonally high SG&A spend quarter partially due to the highest trade show activity of the year. Thus, for Q2 2016, and consistent with prior years, we would expect a sequential decline in adjusted operating margin to a range of 23% to 24%, which, at the midpoint, represents 140 basis points of improvement year-over-year and puts first half 2016 adjusted operating margin at 200 basis points up versus the first half of last year. 
And for the full year 2016, we are raising our adjusted operating margin guidance from 23.5% to 24.5% to a range of 24% to 24.5% now, which also represents a 200 basis point year-over-year gain. This gain is from operational efficiencies and not the med device act, as we are reinvesting the benefits. 
Turning to adjusted EPS. We now expect full year adjusted EPS for 2016 to be in a range of $1.06 to $1.10, representing 14% to 18% adjusted earnings growth and an increase of $0.03 to each end of the range compared to our prior guidance. 
Now let me walk you through our updated assumptions for the FX impact on adjusted EPS. Our initial 2016 guidance assumed $0.02 of unfavorable FX on adjusted EPS in Q1 and $0.06 for the full year. 
In Q1, the combination of exchange rate movements and timing of hedging contracts resulted in an unfavorable impact of $0.01, and we now believe the full year 2016 unfavorable impact will be $0.05 to $0.06. 
In addition to the $0.01 in Q1, we would expect the remaining $0.04 to $0.05 of unfavorable FX for the full year to break down into $0.02 in Q2 and $0.02 to $0.03 in the second half of 2016. Excluding the unfavorable foreign exchange, our full year adjusted EPS guidance range represents growth of 19% to 24%. 
On a GAAP basis, we expect EPS to be in a range of $0.64 to $0.69. 
Now turning specifically to Q2 2016. We expect consolidated revenues to be in a range of $2,010,000,000 to $2,060,000,000. If current foreign exchange rates hold constant, the headwind from FX should be approximately $25 million or 135 basis points relative to Q2 of last year. 
We expect consolidated Q2 sales to grow year-over-year in a range of 6% to 8% organically and 11% to 13% operationally. For the second quarter, adjusted EPS is expected to be in a range of $0.25 to $0.27 per share, and GAAP EPS is expected to be in a range of $0.14 to $0.17 per share. 
Please check our Investor Relations website for Q1 2016 financial and operational highlights, which outlines Q1 results as well as Q2 and full year 2016 guidance, including P&L line item guidance. 
So with that, I'll turn it back to Susie, who will moderate the Q&A."

We're investing into faster-growth markets that would basically accelerate the growth profile another 100, 200 basis points of the markets that we serve. So kind of similar growth rates in IC and cardiology and CRM, kind of in the low single-digit range and more in the 4% to 5% market growth rates for our MedSurg. But I guess, what we're most proud of is really across the board with the exception of CRM, we're growing -- and EP, we're growing significantly faster than our competition. And based on -- that's really driven by our product launches and really excellent global execution. Really pleased with the growth in Asia product; almost 15%, very strong growth in Japan, a very strong growth in Europe. So across our businesses, our regions, our teams are really delivering. In terms of your question on endo and urology, we are very thoughtful about the AMS acquisition, and we're seeing the benefits of the commercial synergies between those organizations, given the additional commercial footprint that we have as well as the broadness of the bag, and you're seeing that with really acceleration of our legacy Urology division, in part due to the synergies of our AMS business. We continue to invest in physician training for our Stone Institute, and we continue to benefit from the category leadership based on the premise of the AMS acquisition. In Endoscopy, it's a very innovative division, and we continue to lead innovation with our digital SpyGlass system, which is really a terrific platform for us that we can continue to build from, and that also helps drive pull-through of our core portfolio. So the R&D teams are executing, as well as the commercial teams, and we continue to be committed to our durable mid-single-digit revenue growth, our operating margin expansion and our double-digit EPS growth over the long term."

First quickly on the calendar. No, we don't believe there's an extra impact in Q1. There was obviously a Leap year day, but then when you factor in the timing of the Easter holiday, I believe it's a true 8% growth for the quarter organically. Relative to operating margin, so I think the -- when you look at Q1 at the 25% and then you look at the 24.25%, which is the midpoint for the full year, one of the key changes there is that, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the reinvestment of the medical device tax benefit over the rest of the year. So a little delayed in Q1 getting off to that start but committed to reinvesting the entire amount for the rest of the year. So that's one. And I think the -- there's R&D timing as well in Q1 so our Q1 R&D was 10.7%. If you look at the guidance range, you'd see 11.5% at the midpoint. Part of that's the med device tax reinvestment and part of it's just the timing of overall R&D. So that's another 80 basis points there going from the 10.7% in Q1 to the overall average of 11.5% for the full year. So still -- I mean, as you look at the 24.25%, still significant growth versus last year, 190 basis points and feel good that we're striking a good balance between delivering differentiated adjusted operating margin and investing for a continually growing top line for the future."

We took the guidance up from 4% to 7% to 6% to 8% organically, not impacting AMS. And as I mentioned, the businesses and regions are performing at a nice level. As we look -- we obviously anticipate a solid second quarter, given our 6% to 8% guidance in second quarter -- we do face a couple of headwinds throughout the year. We do anniversary some key product launches in our Peripheral Vascular as well as our Endoscopy business. We do anticipate some Japan reimbursement cuts that we'll be working through. And we're very bullish on our WATCHMAN program, but we're also anniversary-ing the initial launch. So there are a few headwinds. But overall, we have an excellent product cadence. The business is performing well, and we feel comfortable with raising our guidance to 6% to 8%. On the cardiology side, we're seeing excellent -- our strategy play out. We continue to diversify our interventional cardiology portfolio. As we talked in the future, we really see in the future about 1/3 of our business coming from structural heart, about 1/3 from imaging and complex coronary and about 1/3 from drug-eluting stents. And across those kind of 3 slices of the pie, we're doing a nice job of delivering in the short term and investing for the long term. Our SYNERGY program is really going as planned. We're on track for SYNERGY to represent about 50% of our mix at an appropriate premium price, and physicians continue to see the benefit of the deliverability and the excellent 0 stent thrombosis at beyond the first 24 hours. So excellent clinical data there. Our complex coronary business continues to do well as does our imaging business. And in structural heart, as Dan mentioned, I'm actually over in Korea as we speak here, we just had a live case from Australia today and just the physician reaction to the deliverability and the low PVL rates of our Lotus Valve continues to be very high. And so we are really increasing our investment in that category, given the size of the market potential in the future and also given the differentiation that we believe that Lotus delivers and our commercial capability. So hopefully that gives you a bit of flavor. We're pleased with our raise on the guidance, and we'll manage our headwinds and continue to hopefully deliver revenue growth at the top tier of our sector."

That we clearly see a lot of enthusiasm, for example, for S-ICD despite our headwinds in the near term on MRI -- which we're pleased with the pacer approval -- we're getting nice mix benefit from S-ICD as well as global uptake of the S-ICD, particularly in Japan. And I think our strategy of category leadership, which we've really stressed for a number of years now, is starting to pay off; what made large systems in the U.S. willing and wanting to partner with Boston Scientific, given our current platform as well as the pipeline that we've committed to. So I think the markets are steady. We have a nice pipeline that's helping some of our mix benefit. And I think, importantly, we're really building up our capabilities outside the U.S. Our Asia business grew very well, and just this year, we've done a grand opening for our Malaysia plant.

On the replacement headwinds, we don't have any additional breakdown of data that we're going to provide on this call, but I will say, and I think in the future, we'll consider providing some additional detail so we can quantify that. But similar to our last call, I do think we have brighter days ahead of us in CRM with a pacer MRI approval, with a quad approval. We've also initiated our MRI approval for our defib platform, which we see getting approval in mid-'17. So the portfolio is very strong. We'll have EMBLEM MRI likely approved in U.S. in third quarter. And so we do see the headwind of the replacement cycle improving at the end of 2016, which will help us in 2017.

But we continue to grow above market in the markets that we're serving, particularly in Germany. And the physician feedback continues to be very strong on the low PVL rates, which we believe are best-in-class and really the control, and fully retrievable and reposition-able capabilities of the platform.

We continue to perform against our strategic plan goals, and we're encouraged by the consistent strong execution of our global team. The success of our new product launches across many of our businesses is helping us accelerate expansion into faster-growth markets and deliver solutions that address unmet clinical needs. 
We continue to believe that Boston Scientific is uniquely positioned to deliver differentiated shareholder value through durable mid-single-digit organic revenue growth and double-digit adjusted EPS growth through our ongoing operating margin improvement initiatives. We're very excited about the excellent start to 2016 and our plans to build upon our global momentum in 2017 and beyond. 
We posted excellent results this quarter with total operational revenue growth of 13% and organic revenue growth of 8%, excluding the impact of AMS acquisition benefit. Four of our 7 businesses grew revenue double-digits organically, and we, in turn, leveraged that revenue growth to drive 24% adjusted operating income growth, resulting in an adjusted operating margin of 25.1% and a 260 basis point improvement year-over-year. 
We delivered adjusted EPS of $0.28, exceeding the high end of guidance and representing 31% growth, including the negative impact from foreign currency. Importantly, we're increasing our 2016 guidance for revenue, adjusted operating margin and adjusted EPS. We're increasing our full year organic revenue growth guidance from 4% to 7% previously to 6% to 8%. Full year operational revenue, which includes the benefit of AMS, has been increased from 7% to 10%, to 9% to 11%. We're increasing our adjusted operating margin guidance to 24% to 24.5%, and we're also increasing our adjusted EPS guidance up $0.03 over our prior range to $1.06 to $1.10, which now represents 14% to 18% growth. And importantly, this EPS guidance includes an expected $0.05 to $0.06 negative impact from foreign exchange. 
I'll now provide some highlight on Q1 results and the 2016 outlook. And in my remarks, all references to growth are on a constant currency organic year-over-year basis, excluding the benefit of AMS, unless otherwise specified. 
Our Q1 revenue growth of 8% was broad based across our businesses and regions, led again by exciting new product launches, continued global expansion and execution of our category leadership strategy. With the exception of a 3% decline in our Cardiac Rhythm Management sales, all of our other businesses delivered strong organic growth, led by Endo at plus 11%, Urology and Pelvic Health of plus 12%, Interventional Cardiology at 13% and Peripheral Intervention at 14%. 
We also saw strong growth globally with Asia delivering 14%; U.S., 7%; and Europe, up 6%. Emerging market sales grew 21%, including China, sales at 19%. The MedSurg businesses all accelerated from Q4 of last year and delivered adjusted operating margin of 32.6%, up 360 basis points year-over-year. 
Endoscopy revenue grew 11%, driven by our single-use SpyGlass digital DS visualization system, the AXIOS Stent for drainage of pancreatic fluid and the limited launch of our next-generation hemostasis clip, the Resolution 360. We're also extending our category leadership in Endoscopy by developing commercial capabilities in the emerging markets, adding a focus in pulmonary, which helped drive 15% growth in bronchial thermoplasty as they recently launched in both Japan and China. Urology and pelvic health organic growth accelerated 12% and was broadly based with double-digit growth in kidney stone, and pelvic floor and surg/gyn. Our legacy business grew 15% internationally, led by 36% growth in the emerging markets. The AMS remediation and integration are on track, and we're delivering against our synergy commitments and the global teams are now fully integrated. 
As expected, stand-alone AMS sales declined slightly in the quarter, and we expect inventory to be appropriate levels in the second quarter. At LithoVue, an innovative single digital ureteroscope that provides customers with visualization and navigation capabilities, will be featured in multiple presentations next weekend at the American Urology Association meeting in San Diego. 
Neuromodulation revenue growth accelerated 8% in the first quarter, and sales were driven by the market-leading Spectra platform, the most flexible spinal cord stimulation system in the market; the launch of Precision Novi for the primary cell non-rechargeable market; and the solid contribution from our Vercise, our emerging Deep Brain Stimulation platform. 
Our U.S. DBS trial is making great progress, and we expect to launch in the U.S. in late 2017 or early 2018. In Cardiovascular, our segment sales grew 14% in the quarter and delivered adjusted operating margin of 34.1%, up over 350 basis points, both sequentially and year-over-year. 
Peripheral sales grew 14% in strong results in atherectomy, thrombectomy and our Innova bare metal and Eluvia drug-eluting stent platforms. The legacy Peripheral business continued its recent impressive trend as we grow share in the atherectomy market and see very strong demand for our new Zelante Deep Vein Thrombosis platform. 
The Eluvia IDE trial called IMPERIAL is on track to complete enrollment by late 2016 or early '17, and we look forward to presenting 24-month data from our initial trial of MAJESTIC -- which had a 12-month patency rate of 96.1% -- later this year. We're also seeing continued progress for our Lutonix distribution agreement and encouraging EU sales of our Ranger Drug-Coated Balloon. We're excited to be the only company developing leading drug-eluting technologies globally on multiple platforms, providing physicians with a variety of tools for treating complex peripheral vascular disease. 
Interventional Cardiology turned another double-digit quarter, a 13% growth, led by complex coronary drug-eluting stents, PCI guidance and structural heart. SYNERGY had a very strong quarter, and we estimate that we add it to our market-leading share position in the U.S. and regain market leadership position in Japan. 
DES sales grew 14% in the quarter, and we believe SYNERGY is on track to represent approximately 50% of our U.S. DES revenue mix by the end of the year '16. 
PCI guidance again grew double digits on continued share gains on intravascular ultrasound, and we're encouraged by strong feedback on the ease-of-use of our Comet Fractional Flow Reserve platform. Our leading portfolio of solutions for complex high-risk PCI patients continues to drive global growth as well. 
The 13% IC revenue growth was also fueled by our strengthening structural heart business, which includes our Lotus transcatheter aortic valve and WATCHMAN Left Atrial Appendage Closure device. We believe we are uniquely positioned to drive long-term growth in these 2 fast-growing markets via our differentiated platforms. 
Our Lotus valve continues to gain share in Europe, and we are investing significantly to further develop our capabilities. Most recently, best-in-class paravalvular leakage rates were reported for Lotus at ACC last month with predischarge rates of 0.4% for moderate paravalvular regurgitation in the first 750 patients of the RESPOND Post-Market Study. 
We also continue to plan for the U.S. launch with the Lotus EDGE delivery system at the end of 2017, and we also completed enrollment in our REPRISE Japan trial, where we target a 2018 launch. 
Importantly the Lotus EDGE features a 14 French compatible sheath, more flexibility, simplified deployment and our new depth guard technology, which controls depth of the valve in the left ventricular outflow tract. Studies to demonstrate an improved permanent pacemaker rate with this optimized technique will begin enrollment in mid-2016. 
Also at structural heart, WATCHMAN sales were strong on procedure growth and new account openings, both helped by the finalized national coverage determination. We're developing additional WATCHMAN capabilities, primarily by adding resources in field clinical support, market development and training courses. Implant success rates and patient outcomes remain very high quality due to our controlled rollout and proven training programs. 
In the ACC earlier this month, Dr. David Holmes of the Mayo Clinic presented data from the first 1,600 patients implanted with a WATCHMAN commercially and revealed 96% procedural success at an average procedure time of 15 minutes. So overall, we are very pleased with our progress in our 2016 revenue guidance of $175 million to $200 million in Structural Heart revenue. 
Rhythm Management segment sales declined 2% in the quarter yet delivered adjusted operating margin of 16.8%, which is up 290 basis points sequentially as improving profitability remains a core focus. In CRM, as anticipated, sales declined 3% as we faced competitive launches in the U.S. and replacement cycle headwinds. We're optimistic for a second quarter and second half 2016 improvement in our CRM performance. 
Also, as projected, we received 2 key FDA approvals in March for our ACUITY X4 quad CRT lead, and earlier this week for our ACCOLADE Brady MRI platforms, including the INGEVITY MRI patient lead. Pacemaker sales grew 3% globally, aided by a recently launched X4 CRT-P quad device while worldwide ICD sales declined 4%. 
We continue to be very pleased with the performance of the EMBLEM S-ICD, which is enjoying strong growth in both Europe and the U.S. and is currently launching in Japan. In Electrophysiology, we're encouraged by double-digit growth in Europe, led by our arrhythmia installations and the recent launches of the IntellaMap OI and IntellaTip MiFi OI ablation catheters. In the U.S., we're now launching our Blazer Open-Irrigated Therapeutic Catheter for the treatment of Type 1 atrial flutter as we continue to invest in the franchise, launch a portfolio of navigation-enabled therapeutic catheters and build capabilities in capital equipment sales and service. 
We have a strong arrhythmia customer pipeline as many of our new platform enhancements scheduled for release in 2016. So to wrap up, our company had an excellent quarter. First quarter results reflect the strength of our portfolio, our ongoing investment in faster-growth markets and our globalization efforts. More importantly, we are well positioned to continue our strong performance in 2016 and beyond. I want to thank our employees for their continued winning spirit and their commitment to the company. 
Now let me turn the call over to Dan for a more detailed review of our financials."
317627,329821425,966462,"Boston Scientific Corporation, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2016",2016-04-27,"Earnings Calls","Boston Scientific Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Mike. In Q1, we generated organic revenue growth of 8% versus our 4% to 6% guidance range and adjusted EPS of $0.28, exceeding our guidance range of $0.23 to $0.25 and representing 31% year-over-year growth. Adjusted EPS of $0.28 includes a slig",1941,"Thanks, Mike. In Q1, we generated organic revenue growth of 8% versus our 4% to 6% guidance range and adjusted EPS of $0.28, exceeding our guidance range of $0.23 to $0.25 and representing 31% year-over-year growth. 
Adjusted EPS of $0.28 includes a slightly lower-than-expected tax rate for the quarter due to some discrete tax items. The strong performance in Q1 was driven primarily by revenue growth upside, gross margin expansion and a lower SG&A rate versus the prior year. 
And as Mike mentioned, given the outperformance in Q1, we are raising full year guidance for revenue growth, adjusted operating margin and adjusted EPS. Consolidated revenue of $1,964,000,000 represented operational revenue growth of 13%, which excludes the impact of a $58 million headwind from foreign exchange. Excluding an approximate 500 basis point contribution from the AMS male urology portfolio acquisition, organic revenue growth was 8% in the quarter. 
On an as-reported basis, revenue grew 11% year-over-year. Adjusted gross margin for the first quarter was 72.3%, increasing 100 basis points year-over-year. The increase resulted primarily from cost improvements driven by our value improvement programs and favorable mix, partially offset by price. And similar to Q4 of 2015, the impact of foreign exchange on gross margin was negligible in the quarter. 
We continue to expect full year 2016 adjusted gross margin to be in the range of 72% to 73%, which we forecast to include approximately 50 basis points of unfavorable FX. Our Q1 2016 adjusted operating margin of 25.1% represents a 260 basis point improvement over Q1 2015, which marks the 7th consecutive quarter in which we've expanded adjusted operating margin by 100 basis points or more. 
There was very modest reinvestment of the medical device tax benefit in Q1, which represents some timing favorability in the quarter, but we are committed to reinvesting substantially all of the full year benefit during the year. Thus, adjusted SG&A expenses were $698 million or 35.5% of sales in the quarter, down 150 basis points year-over-year with some of the benefit due to our targeted initiatives focused on reducing SG&A and a portion due to the more modest medical device tax benefit reinvestment I just mentioned. 
Our Q1 adjusted SG&A rate was the lowest in the last 12 quarters, and we continue to believe our full year rate will be between 35.5% and 36.5%, which, at the midpoint, would be a 140 basis point reduction compared to 2015. 
Adjusted research and development expenses were $209 million in the first quarter or 10.7% of sales, which is roughly flat year-over-year. This is another key area for us to reinvest the benefit of the medical device tax suspension. As a result, we expect our full year 2016 adjusted R&D rate to be between 11% and 12% of sales. 
Royalty expense was 1% of sales in both Q1 of this year and last year and consistent with our guidance. On an adjusted basis, operating income was $494 million in the quarter or 25.1% of sales, up 260 basis points year-over-year. 
Q1 adjusted operating income grew 24% year-over-year, with all 3 reportable segments expanding adjusted operating margin by at least 250 basis points over Q1 of last year. Of particular focus is Rhythm Management, which delivered an adjusted operating margin of 16.8%, which is up from Q4 2015's 13.9% and the full year 2015 rate of 15%. 
For the first half of 2016, we expect Rhythm Management adjusted operating margin to be slightly above 16%. In the second half of 2016, we expect Rhythm Management adjusted operating margin to increase roughly 200 basis points over the first half rate. This second half improvement is expected to result from realizing the full benefit of 2016 product costs, leveraging the improved top line performance expected of the global CRM and EP businesses and realizing the full benefits of our Plant Network Optimization program, which is transferring a portion of our EP manufacturing to lower-cost locations. We continue to believe Rhythm Management is on track to deliver an adjusted operating margin of 20% in 2017. 
GAAP operating income, which includes GAAP to adjusted items of $201 million, was $293 million in Q1 2016. The primary GAAP to adjusted items for the quarter included amortization expense of $136 million, restructuring and related charges of $13 million, acquisition-related SG&A expenses of $14 million and litigation-related charges of $10 million. Our total legal reserve was $1,895,000,000 as of March 31, 2016. 
Now I'll move on to other income and expense. Interest expense for the quarter was $59 million compared to $56 million in Q1 last year, and the increase was primarily due to the incremental debt raised in Q2 of last year to finance the AMS male urology portfolio acquisition. 
Our average interest rate was 4% in Q1 2016 compared to 5.1% in Q1 last year, and the lower interest expense rate in Q1 this year was primarily due to lower average cost of debt resulting from the senior notes refinancing, which we completed in Q2 last year. 
Other expense was $10 million, and this consisted primarily of foreign exchange losses and investment losses incurred during the quarter. 
Our tax rate for the quarter was 11.4% on a reported basis and 11.8% on an adjusted basis. Excluding discrete tax items in the quarter, our adjusted tax rate would have been 13.5%, and we continue to expect our full year 2016 adjusted tax rate to be approximately 14%. 
On a reported GAAP basis, Q1 2016 EPS was $0.15 and includes net charges and amortization expense totaling $176 million after tax. GAAP EPS of $0.15 compares to breakeven in Q1 of last year. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. DSO of 60 days increased 1 day compared to March of last year. Days inventory on hand of 162 days was down 4 days compared to March of last year and 1 day from year-end 2015. 
Capital expenditures were $59 million in the quarter compared to $46 million in Q1 2015. And as a reminder, we expect full year 2016 capital expenditures to be roughly $350 million. This is $100 million higher than the full year 2015, primarily due to the construction of our new manufacturing facility and distribution center in Malaysia. And beyond 2016, we expect capital expenditures to return to our more historical run rate of approximately $250 million annually. 
Adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was $250 million compared to $118 million in Q1 2015, and this strong start gives us confidence in our adjusted free cash flow target of $1.5 billion, which represents 10% growth and better visibility to our stretch goal of $1.6 billion, which would represent 17% growth, even in a year with an incremental $100 million in CapEx spend as I mentioned. 
We're also continuing to pursue inventory management initiatives designed to improve the working capital contribution to cash flow. In Q1, we used cash primarily to fund previously agreed legal settlements as well as business development activities. 
Consistent with our goal of returning to pre-AMS debt leverage by year-end 2016, we still expect to repay $250 million of bank term loans by the end of this year. As of March 31 this year, we had cash on hand of $338 million. 
Near term, our capital allocation priorities are to prepay debt, manage our contingencies and pursue tuck-in M&A. We ended the quarter with 1,370,000,000 fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding. Consistent with our prior guidance, we expect our share count to increase by roughly 5 million per quarter through the end of the year as we plan to keep the buybacks suspended for the balance of 2016. We would expect this to result in a fully diluted weighted average share count of approximately 1,380,000,000 for the full year 2016. 
I'd like to conclude with revenue and earnings per share guidance for Q2 and full year 2016. For the full year, we now expect consolidated revenue to be in the range of $8,075,000,000 to $8,225,000,000, which represents year-over-year growth of 6% to 8% on an organic basis; 9% to 11% on an operational basis, which includes the AMS revenue; and 8% to 10% on a reported basis. 
As a result of a stronger dollar, at current rates, we expect foreign exchange to be a headwind of approximately $100 million for the full year 2016. As we move through 2016, we are reinvesting the benefit of the medical device tax suspension into innovation to help treat patients and sustain top line growth over the long term. Focus areas will include R&D efforts, including clinical trial spend as well as market development, and in Q2, we've already begun to ramp this reinvestment, primarily in the areas of structural heart with both Lotus and WATCHMAN, and other durable long-term revenue growth platforms such as the EMBLEM S-ICD, our electrophysiology portfolio, deep brain stimulation and other fast-growing adjacent market. 
In addition, Q2 is our seasonally high SG&A spend quarter partially due to the highest trade show activity of the year. Thus, for Q2 2016, and consistent with prior years, we would expect a sequential decline in adjusted operating margin to a range of 23% to 24%, which, at the midpoint, represents 140 basis points of improvement year-over-year and puts first half 2016 adjusted operating margin at 200 basis points up versus the first half of last year. 
And for the full year 2016, we are raising our adjusted operating margin guidance from 23.5% to 24.5% to a range of 24% to 24.5% now, which also represents a 200 basis point year-over-year gain. This gain is from operational efficiencies and not the med device act, as we are reinvesting the benefits. 
Turning to adjusted EPS. We now expect full year adjusted EPS for 2016 to be in a range of $1.06 to $1.10, representing 14% to 18% adjusted earnings growth and an increase of $0.03 to each end of the range compared to our prior guidance. 
Now let me walk you through our updated assumptions for the FX impact on adjusted EPS. Our initial 2016 guidance assumed $0.02 of unfavorable FX on adjusted EPS in Q1 and $0.06 for the full year. 
In Q1, the combination of exchange rate movements and timing of hedging contracts resulted in an unfavorable impact of $0.01, and we now believe the full year 2016 unfavorable impact will be $0.05 to $0.06. 
In addition to the $0.01 in Q1, we would expect the remaining $0.04 to $0.05 of unfavorable FX for the full year to break down into $0.02 in Q2 and $0.02 to $0.03 in the second half of 2016. Excluding the unfavorable foreign exchange, our full year adjusted EPS guidance range represents growth of 19% to 24%. 
On a GAAP basis, we expect EPS to be in a range of $0.64 to $0.69. 
Now turning specifically to Q2 2016. We expect consolidated revenues to be in a range of $2,010,000,000 to $2,060,000,000. If current foreign exchange rates hold constant, the headwind from FX should be approximately $25 million or 135 basis points relative to Q2 of last year. 
We expect consolidated Q2 sales to grow year-over-year in a range of 6% to 8% organically and 11% to 13% operationally. For the second quarter, adjusted EPS is expected to be in a range of $0.25 to $0.27 per share, and GAAP EPS is expected to be in a range of $0.14 to $0.17 per share. 
Please check our Investor Relations website for Q1 2016 financial and operational highlights, which outlines Q1 results as well as Q2 and full year 2016 guidance, including P&L line item guidance. 
So with that, I'll turn it back to Susie, who will moderate the Q&A."

We're investing into faster-growth markets that would basically accelerate the growth profile another 100, 200 basis points of the markets that we serve. So kind of similar growth rates in IC and cardiology and CRM, kind of in the low single-digit range and more in the 4% to 5% market growth rates for our MedSurg. But I guess, what we're most proud of is really across the board with the exception of CRM, we're growing -- and EP, we're growing significantly faster than our competition. And based on -- that's really driven by our product launches and really excellent global execution. Really pleased with the growth in Asia product; almost 15%, very strong growth in Japan, a very strong growth in Europe. So across our businesses, our regions, our teams are really delivering. In terms of your question on endo and urology, we are very thoughtful about the AMS acquisition, and we're seeing the benefits of the commercial synergies between those organizations, given the additional commercial footprint that we have as well as the broadness of the bag, and you're seeing that with really acceleration of our legacy Urology division, in part due to the synergies of our AMS business. We continue to invest in physician training for our Stone Institute, and we continue to benefit from the category leadership based on the premise of the AMS acquisition. In Endoscopy, it's a very innovative division, and we continue to lead innovation with our digital SpyGlass system, which is really a terrific platform for us that we can continue to build from, and that also helps drive pull-through of our core portfolio. So the R&D teams are executing, as well as the commercial teams, and we continue to be committed to our durable mid-single-digit revenue growth, our operating margin expansion and our double-digit EPS growth over the long term."

First quickly on the calendar. No, we don't believe there's an extra impact in Q1. There was obviously a Leap year day, but then when you factor in the timing of the Easter holiday, I believe it's a true 8% growth for the quarter organically. Relative to operating margin, so I think the -- when you look at Q1 at the 25% and then you look at the 24.25%, which is the midpoint for the full year, one of the key changes there is that, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the reinvestment of the medical device tax benefit over the rest of the year. So a little delayed in Q1 getting off to that start but committed to reinvesting the entire amount for the rest of the year. So that's one. And I think the -- there's R&D timing as well in Q1 so our Q1 R&D was 10.7%. If you look at the guidance range, you'd see 11.5% at the midpoint. Part of that's the med device tax reinvestment and part of it's just the timing of overall R&D. So that's another 80 basis points there going from the 10.7% in Q1 to the overall average of 11.5% for the full year. So still -- I mean, as you look at the 24.25%, still significant growth versus last year, 190 basis points and feel good that we're striking a good balance between delivering differentiated adjusted operating margin and investing for a continually growing top line for the future."

We took the guidance up from 4% to 7% to 6% to 8% organically, not impacting AMS. And as I mentioned, the businesses and regions are performing at a nice level. As we look -- we obviously anticipate a solid second quarter, given our 6% to 8% guidance in second quarter -- we do face a couple of headwinds throughout the year. We do anniversary some key product launches in our Peripheral Vascular as well as our Endoscopy business. We do anticipate some Japan reimbursement cuts that we'll be working through. And we're very bullish on our WATCHMAN program, but we're also anniversary-ing the initial launch. So there are a few headwinds. But overall, we have an excellent product cadence. The business is performing well, and we feel comfortable with raising our guidance to 6% to 8%. On the cardiology side, we're seeing excellent -- our strategy play out. We continue to diversify our interventional cardiology portfolio. As we talked in the future, we really see in the future about 1/3 of our business coming from structural heart, about 1/3 from imaging and complex coronary and about 1/3 from drug-eluting stents. And across those kind of 3 slices of the pie, we're doing a nice job of delivering in the short term and investing for the long term. Our SYNERGY program is really going as planned. We're on track for SYNERGY to represent about 50% of our mix at an appropriate premium price, and physicians continue to see the benefit of the deliverability and the excellent 0 stent thrombosis at beyond the first 24 hours. So excellent clinical data there. Our complex coronary business continues to do well as does our imaging business. And in structural heart, as Dan mentioned, I'm actually over in Korea as we speak here, we just had a live case from Australia today and just the physician reaction to the deliverability and the low PVL rates of our Lotus Valve continues to be very high. And so we are really increasing our investment in that category, given the size of the market potential in the future and also given the differentiation that we believe that Lotus delivers and our commercial capability. So hopefully that gives you a bit of flavor. We're pleased with our raise on the guidance, and we'll manage our headwinds and continue to hopefully deliver revenue growth at the top tier of our sector."

That we clearly see a lot of enthusiasm, for example, for S-ICD despite our headwinds in the near term on MRI -- which we're pleased with the pacer approval -- we're getting nice mix benefit from S-ICD as well as global uptake of the S-ICD, particularly in Japan. And I think our strategy of category leadership, which we've really stressed for a number of years now, is starting to pay off; what made large systems in the U.S. willing and wanting to partner with Boston Scientific, given our current platform as well as the pipeline that we've committed to. So I think the markets are steady. We have a nice pipeline that's helping some of our mix benefit. And I think, importantly, we're really building up our capabilities outside the U.S. Our Asia business grew very well, and just this year, we've done a grand opening for our Malaysia plant. We have a new R&D center in India. We have new training centers. So our capabilities in Asia are significantly stronger than they used to be. So that's also helping strengthen our business."

On the replacement headwinds, we don't have any additional breakdown of data that we're going to provide on this call, but I will say, and I think in the future, we'll consider providing some additional detail so we can quantify that. But similar to our last call, I do think we have brighter days ahead of us in CRM with a pacer MRI approval, with a quad approval. We've also initiated our MRI approval for our defib platform, which we see getting approval in mid-'17. So the portfolio is very strong. We'll have EMBLEM MRI likely approved in U.S. in third quarter. And so we do see the headwind of the replacement cycle improving at the end of 2016, which will help us in 2017. So with the product cadence and improved replacement cycle headwind, we see some brighter days for our CRM business.

It was pretty reasonable compared to Q4 of last year -- inventory this year -- and so we've kind of stemmed the tide of it now and I'd look to, for the last 3 quarters, to see that reduce, which will help all the turnover and asset metrics as well as the contribution of working capital to cash flow."

We continue to beat our long-range strategic plan goals and execute very well as a global team. The success of our category leadership strategy is helping us gain share in our core markets, expanding the faste",2090,"Thank you, Susie, and good morning, everyone. We continue to beat our long-range strategic plan goals and execute very well as a global team. The success of our category leadership strategy is helping us gain share in our core markets, expanding the faster growth adjacencies and deliver solutions that address unmet clinical needs.  Our consistent results continue to demonstrate that Boston Scientific is uniquely positioned to deliver differentiated long-term shareholder value. With long term visibility to mid-single digit organic revenue growth, complemented by ongoing operating margin improvement initiatives, our goal is to consistently drive double-digit adjusted EPS growth.
We're very excited about our excellent second quarter performance, first half results and most importantly, our plans for the future.  In Q2, we drove total operational revenue growth of 16% and organic revenue growth of 10%, excluding the impact of the AMS Urology acquisition. We had strong results across all regions, and 5 of our sovereign business units grew revenue double digits organically. We leverage the revenue growth to drive adjusted operating income growth of 22%, resulting in an adjusted operating margin of 23.4% and 130 basis point improvement year-over-year.
We delivered adjusted EPS of $0.27, achieving the high end of guidance and representing 25% growth, including the negative $0.015 [ph] impact from or foreign currency. So given our strong performance we're increasing our 2016 guidance for revenue and adjusted EPS. We're are increasing our full year organic revenue growth guidance from 6% to 8% to 8% to 9% full year operational revenue growth guidance, which includes the benefit of AMS, is increased from 9% to 11% to 11% to 12%. We're maintaining our full year adjusted operating margin guidance of 24% to 24.5%, which is the midpoint is roughly 200 basis points of improvement over 2015. We're also increasing our adjusted EPS guidance by $0.01 over our prior range to $1.07 to $1.11, which represents 15% and [ph] 19% growth. Importantly, this adjusted EPS guidance includes an expected $0.05 negative impact from foreign exchange.
I'll now provide some highlight on Q2 results and our 2016 outlook. And Mars, all references to growth are in a constant currency organic year-over-year basis, and they exclude the benefit of AMS. Our second quarter revenue growth of 10% was broad based across businesses and regions, led again by exciting new product launches, continued global expansion and execution of our category leadership strategy. We drove double-digit growth in 5 businesses: endo, urology public-health, Neuromodulation, Interventional Cardiology and Peripheral Interventions. In addition, each region accelerated sequentially. The U.S. grew 8%; Europe, grew 9%; Asia PAC delivered 16% growth, with every major country in the Asia Pac region up double digits this quarter.  The emerging markets also continued to deliver sales grew [ph] 20%, including China revenue act of 21%. 
Our MedSurg businesses, endo, Urology public health and Neuromodulation continue to be a priority focus area for the company, and each of the businesses maintained or accelerated growth from first quarter. These 3 businesses represent 40% of our operating income in the second quarter and they delivered adjusted operating margin of 32.8%. This is up 20 basis points sequentially and 240 basis points year-over-year.  Our global Endoscopy team continues to perform at a high level with the revenue growing 11% in the second quarter. We continue to see strong growth in our core endo business, supported by our innovative portfolio and broad-based global expansion initiatives. Key endo growth drivers include the single-use SpyGlass, DS visualization system, the Axia stent for drainage of pancreatic fluid and our next-generation hemostasis clip, the Resolution 360. High single-digit growth in U.S. endo was complemented by double-digit growth in every region outside the U.S. As we continue to develop commercial and position-training abilities in emerging markets and add focus in pulmonary, which helped drive 25% growth in BT, bronchial thermoplasty, led by the U.S., Japan and China. 
In Urology and public health, our investments to become the clear market leader and category leader have been rewarded, as growth excluding AMS accelerated to 18%. The business is performing at a high-level across the various regions in segment, including kidney stone, BPH, ED and surg. Our global commercial footprint and focus on physician education has helped us to convert a meaningful portion of the market opportunity, created by a store's exit from the market at the end of March. 
AMS sales strength in the quarter and importantly, remediation and integration efforts remain on track. An exciting new growth platform in our urology business is the launch of a LithoVue platform. LithoVue is an innovative single-use digital scope for treatment of kidney stones that provide customers with enhanced visualization and navigation capabilities. LithoVue resonates with physicians and hospitals to the less OR downtime for sterile processing of reusable scopes. Performance navigation characteristics that allows physicians to tackle tougher procedures and the ability to schedule full-day procedures without the fear of cancellation due to reusable scopes being down.
In Neuromodulation, we continue to invest in the fast-growing microelectronics market, where we enjoy innovation and supply chain leverage between our CRM and neuromod business. Neuromodulation revenues and grew in the quarter to 12% -- grew 12%. Sales were driven by the U.S. market-leading Spectra platform, the launch of precision montage which offers full body MRI capability; and our PRECISE brain stimulation platform.  Our U.S. DBS trial continues to progress, and we expect to launch in the U.S. in first quarter 2018. Additionally, earlier this week, we announced the acquisition of Cosman Medical, a technology leader in the field of radiofrequency ablation systems for the treatment of chronic pain. This acquisition broadens our neuromodulation portfolio and is highly synergistic with our U.S. commercial team. We're excited to offer physicians treating patients with chronic pain, another non-opioid therapeutic option earlier in the treatment  continuum.
Now turning to Cardiovascular, which includes our peripheral and Interventional Cardiology businesses. Overall, this segment grew sales 13% in the quarter and delivered adjusted operating margin of 32.2%, up more than 170 basis points year-over-year.  Our peripheral business delivered exceptional results with strong global sales across all regions, fueled by an innovative portfolio. Sales grew 14% on strong results across all regions and segments, including stents, thrombectomy and our emerging drug-eluting portfolio. We also delivered strong growth in Interventional Oncology, with the integration of Interventional Radiology business of Solmolva remains on track. In our Venus segment, we continue to see very strong demand for our Zante, deep vein thrombosis system. With leading drug-eluting technologies globally on multiple platforms, noted to treat complex, peripheral vascular disease. The Eluvia peripheral drug stent ID trial called IMPERIAL is on track to complete enrollment by yearend  2016. 
In Interventional Cardiology, we are focused on getting share in our core businesses and while expanding in faster growth segments that leverage our capabilities. This strategy is working. In the second quarter interventional cardiology grew 12% led by structural heart, drug-eluting stent and PCI guidance. Synergy had an excellent quarter as we grew DES sales 9%. Synergy is now the market-leading premium DS platform and it's on track to represent 50% to 60% of our U.S. DES revenue mix by the end of 2016.  PCI guidance grew mid-teens and continued share gains in intravascular ultrasound, and we're encouraged by strong early feedback on the ease-of-use of our Comma and fractional flow reserve system. Our leading portfolio of solutions for complex high-risk PCI patients also contributed to global growth.
The 12% IT revenue growth was fueled by our strength in structural heart business, which includes our LOTUS transcatheter aortic valve and WATCHMAN Left Atrial Appendage Closure. We believe we are well-positioned to drive long-term growth in these 2 fast-growing markets via our differentiated platforms and expanded capabilities.  We also aim to deliver the high-end of our 2016 structural our guidance range of $175 million turning to $200 million.
Our LOTUS valve continues to gain share in Europe, and we're investing significantly in clinical studies, R&D in our global supply chain to develop our capabilities further. We remain on track to launch LOTUS EDGE at PCR London in September. The LOTUS EDGE delivery system features a 14 French expandable sheet called iSleeve and is designed for more flexibility and simplified deployment. It also offers an new Depth Guard technology, which limits the depth of the valve in the left ventricular outflow tract. LOTUS also offers best-in-class [indiscernible] leakage rates and we aim to enhance LOTUS with studies to demonstrate improve permanent pacemaker rates with LOTUS EDGE and Depth Guard.  So our goal is to provide initial LOTUS EDGE data at PCR london valves. We do expect a slight delay in our expanded LOTUS Valve matrix in Europe, with a 21-millimeter valve estimated CE Mark timing first quarter '17, and a 29-millimeter valve in Europe in mid-2017.  We continue to invest in plan for U.S. launch with the LOTUS EDGE platform in late 2017.
Also at structural heart, WATCHMAN sales were strong and procedure growth and new account openings. we're developing additional WATCHMAN capabilities in field clinical support, market development and physician training courses. Implant success rates and patient outcomes remain very high as evidenced by the 98.5% success rate and evolution registry detailed at HRS in May.
We continue to expand WATCHMAN in new markets and we're pleased with the recent reimbursement approval and launch in France.  Importantly, the unique clinical benefits of WATCHMAN are being rewarded, as evidenced by the French reimbursement at a meaningful premium to competitive LAAC devices.
We post a limited market release of our next generation WATCHMAN FLX device. We have decided to pursue design enhancements before we turn in next-gen platform to market. Importantly, we anticipate this delay will have no impact on our current WATCHMAN product and thus no change to our market outlook for LAAC.
Rhythm Management sales increased 5% in the quarter and delivered adjusted operating margin of 16.9%, up 200 basis points year-over-year as improving profitability remains a core focus.
In CRM, we improved our global performance in delivered 4% growth in second quarter. Our European and Asia PAC CRM businesses continue to grow faster than the market, offset by slower growth in U.S. CRM. Pacemaker sales grew 15% globally, with excellent U.S. performance, fueled by our ACCOLADE, MRI launch. And growth from our X4 CRT-P quad device. Worldwide ICD sales are flat as we delivered above-market growth internationally that was offset by weaker sales in the U.S.  In the U.S., we faced some near-term headwinds due to our tachy MRI product app and replacement cycle headwinds. However, we recently earned FDA approval of our ACUITY X4 quad CRT lead and the early results are promising. Importantly, EMBLEM S-ICD is a key differentiator and growth continues to accelerate globally.  We continue to expand global S-ICD utilization with more long-term data from the EFFORTLESS Registry, growing physician implant experience, geographic expansion and the recent second quarter '16 EU launch of EMBLEM MRI, which contributed to our solid international growth.
Due to change in protocol of our U.S. enabled MRI clinical trial, we are revising our goal for transvenous tachy MRI U.S. approval by yearend 2017, but continue to expect to gain MRI labeling for both new and previously implanted ICDs and CRT-Ds with a new timeline.  The continued cadence of data proving the superiority of EnduraLife batteries and the pending FDA approval of EMBLEM MRI S-ICD, which is expected in the third quarter, will help us offset the near-term headwinds from the U.S. MRI high-voltage segment.
In the second quarter, European CRM sales grew 5%, representing 9 straight quarters of above-market growth, giving us further confidence in our long-term CRM outlook.  Our EP business grew 6% in the second quarter and were encouraged by double-digit growth in Europe, led by new arrhythmia installs and the recent launches of and IntellaTip MiFi OI ablation catheters. The U.S. launch in late first quarter of Blazer OI catheter will be augmented in Q3 with the upcoming launch with a navigable version of this catheter. 
So to wrap up, our company delivered another excellent quarter. Our second quarter  performance reflects the strength of our global team, the depth and breadth of our portfolio, our globalization efforts in our ongoing investment in the faster growing markets. Importantly, we believe we are well-positioned to deliver continued strong results in the second half of '16 and beyond.  I really want to thank our employees globally for their winning spirit and their strong commitment to Boston Scientific.
Now let me turn the call over to Dan for more detailed review of our financial results."

In Q2, we generated organic revenue growth of 10% versus our 6% to 8% guidance range, and adjusted EPS of $0.27, representing 25% year-over-year growth in the high-end of our guidance range of $0.25 to $0.27.  The strong adjusted EPS growth",1917,"Thanks, Mike. In Q2, we generated organic revenue growth of 10% versus our 6% to 8% guidance range, and adjusted EPS of $0.27, representing 25% year-over-year growth in the high-end of our guidance range of $0.25 to $0.27.  The strong adjusted EPS growth performance in Q2 was driven primarily by revenue growth upside and a lower SG&A rate versus prior year.  And given the strong performance in the first half of 2016, we are again raising full year guidance of revenue growth and adjusted EPS.  Consolidated revenue of $2,126,000,000 represented operational revenue growth of 16%, exceeding the high end of guidance and excludes the impact of a $24 million headwind from foreign exchange, which was in line with guidance. Excluding an approximate 500 basis point contribution from the AMS male urology portfolio acquisition, organic revenue growth was 10% in the quarter and 15% on an as-reported basis.
Adjusted gross margin for the second quarter was 70.7%, decreasing 60 basis points year-over-year and unfortunately, 130 basis points below the midpoint of Q2 guidance due to a few factors that I will detail.  The year-over-year decrease is due to the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange, which was a 120 basis point headwind, as well as costs related to our new Malaysia manufacturing plant, the AMS integration, including the AMS quarterly mediation expense. Compared to guidance, the shortfall is due to inventory charges in advance of new product launches, inventory write-offs related to WATCHMAN FLX and more unfavorable FX.
We now expect Q3 and full year 2016 adjusted gross margin to be in the range of a 71.5% to 72.5%, which includes an expected 75 to 100 basis point of unfavorable foreign exchange. A key element in the second half increase is a lower expected inventory charges, and will also benefit fully from the lower 2016 standard cost of our products as we will have sold through all of the inventory valued at last year's higher standards.  Adjusted SG&A expenses were $763 million or 35.9% of sales in Q2, down 140 basis points year-over-year.  We continue to believe our full year rate will be between 35.5% and 36.5%, which at the midpoint would be a 140 basis point improvement compared to last year.
Adjusted research and development expenses were $222 million  in the second quarter or 10.4% of sales, which is down 50 basis points year-over-year. As a result of a slightly lower R&D rate in the first half, we expect our full year 2016 adjusted R&D rate to be between 10.5% and 11.5% of sales or 50 basis points lower than prior guidance.  Royalty expense was 0.9% of sales in Q2, roughly flat year-over-year. Our Q2 2016 adjusted operating margin of 23.4% was in line with our guidance and represents a 130 basis point improvement over Q2 last year, which marks the eighth consecutive quarter in which we will have expanded adjusted operating margin by 100 basis points or more.
As a reminder, we've signaled a sequential decrease in adjusted operating margin from Q1's rate as we experienced the usual increase in SG&A from Q1 to Q2 due to seasonal trade show activity and began to ramp reinvestment of the medical device excise tax expansion.  Our first half 2016 adjusted operating margin of 24.2% positions us well to achieve our full year adjusted operating margin guidance of 24% to 24.5%, and we remain on track to reach 25%-plus in 2017.
Q2 adjusted operating income grew 22% year-over-year, with all 3 reportable segments expanding adjusted operating margin by at least 170 basis points over Q2 2015. Specific to Rhythm Management, the team has delivered an adjusted operating margin of 16.9%, up 280 basis points year-over-year.  In the second half of 2016, we expect Rhythm Management adjusted operating margin to continue to improve and be 18% and 19%.  This second half gain is expected to result from realizing the full benefit of 2016 product costs, leveraging the improved top line performance expected of the global CRM and EP businesses, and we continue to believe that the management is on track to deliver an adjusted operating margin of 20% in 2017.
Turning to the balance sheet, we had some key developments in the quarter that helped reduce future uncertainties. Before I get into the details of the activity in the quarter, let me try to frame out the next 3 years of expected cash flow at a high level.  From 2017 through 2019, we believe we can generate cumulative adjusted free cash flow after CapEx approaching $6 billion. We expect to allocate roughly 2/3 of that $6 billion to a combination of M&A and share repurchases.  As you are aware, the 2 most significant liabilities on our balance sheet are our IRS Chesser pricing case and the mesh litigation. During the quarter, which are 2 important steps to manage these liabilities. First, we reached the stipulation of settled issues with the IRS for the 2001 to 2007 tax years. And importantly, this stipulation also provides a framework to settle the remaining years 2008 through 2015 as well.  While there's work to do, to conclude all the years, we are confident we will bring these to conclusion over the coming quarters.  With a payment in 12 to 24 months, this would eliminate one of the most significant liabilities on our balance sheet. With regards to mash, we increased our reserved by $608 million during the quarter. With the same goal of managing our liabilities, we reached conditional or final settlements on 12,000 claims and made significant progress towards reaching agreement on principle on another 7,000 claims  for a total of 19,000 claims. This represents approximately half of the roughly 40,000 known claims, and we expect to make even more progress during the remainder of 2016.  As you know, every quarter, we assess all 4 key components involving calculating the reserve and make any necessary adjustments for all probable and estimable charges, including the volume of known claims, the estimated cost to resolve each claim, an estimate of future claims and the cost to defend each claim.
Our total legal reserve of which mesh is included, was $2,375,000,000 as of June 30, 2016 and we believe it reflected our best estimate of what is probable and estimable. Of note as well, is that included in this reserve is the Maresca adjustment which we have paid in full sequential to quarter end. So as of today, the reserve would be closer to $2 billion.  As a reminder, this $2 billion includes a number of claims we have agreed in principle to settle but have not yet paid. Once those settlements are funded, the amount of the reserve will be adjusted accordingly.
Now I'll move on to interest expense. Interest expense for the quarter was $59 million, compared to $106 million in Q2 of last year. The decrease is primarily due to the pretax onetime charge of approximately $45 million associated with the senior note refinancing in Q2 of last year. Excluding this charge, Q2 2015 interest expense was $61 million [ph].  Our average interest expense rate was 4% in Q2 this year compared to 8% in Q2 last year. The low interest-rate expense in Q2 of '16 was primarily due to lower average cost of debt resulting from the senior notes refinancing and the inclusion of the pretax onetime charge in Q2 of last year that I mentioned.  Excluding this charge, Q2 2015 interest expense would have been 4.6%.
Our tax rate for the second quarter was 47.8% on a reported basis and 14.2% on an adjusted basis. As reported last week, we're pleased with the conditional settlement reached with the IRS council regarding our transfer pricing litigation and plan to use some of the current benefit to repatriate overseas cash, thus we continue to expect our full year 2016 adjusted tax rate to be approximately 14%.  We believe this IRS settlement in addition to recent progress we've made towards reaching agreements in principle to settle additional mesh claims, as I mentioned, are prudent actions to take in the management of our balance sheet.
Finally, Q2 2016 adjusted EPS of $0.27  includes approximately $0.015 [ph] of unfavorable FX and represents 25% year-over-year growth or 32% growth, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. On a reported GAAP basis, Q2 2016 EPS was a loss of $0.15 and includes net charges and amortization expense totaling $580 million after tax.
Adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was $464 million [ph] compared to $406 million in Q2 of last year. Given the strong adjusted free cash flow generation in the first half of this year, we are raising our full year adjusted free cash flow guidance from $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion, which was formally our stretch goal. Achieving adjusted free cash flow of $1.6 billion would represent 17% growth, and we continue to pursue inventory management initiatives designed to improve the working capital contribution to cash flow.
In Q2, we used cash primarily to repay $250 million of bank term loans, as well as fund the previously agreed legal settlements. As of June 30, 2016, we had cash on hand of $438 million.  Near term, our capital allocation priorities are to manage contingencies and pursue tuck-in M&A. 
We ended Q2 with 1,375,000,000 fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding. Consistent with our prior guidance, we expect our share count to increase by roughly 5 million per quarter through the end of 2016 as we plan to keep the buybacks suspended for the balance of this year. We expect this to result in a fully diluted weighted average share count of approximately 1,380,000,000 shares for full year 2016.
I'll now walk-through guidance for Q3 and full year 2016. For the full year, we now expect consolidated revenue to be in a range of $8,270,000,000 to $8,370,000,000, which represents year-over-year growth of 8% to 9% on an organic basis and 11% to 12% on both an operational and reported basis.  As a result of a stronger dollar, at current rates, we expect foreign exchange to be a headwind of approximately $70 million for the full year 2016. 
Turning to adjusted EPS, we now expect full year 2016 adjusted EPS to be in a range of $1.07 to $1.11, representing 15% to 19% adjusted earnings growth. Our previous guidance assumed the unfavorable FX on full year adjusted EPS would be between $0.05 and $0.06, given the fact that Q2 saw slightly less unfavorable impact on affected we know we believe the full year impact will be closer to $0.05.  Which is assumes $0.02 to $0.03 in the second half of this year.  On a GAAP basis, we expect EPS to be in a range of $0.30 to $0.35.
Now turning to Q3 2016, we expect consolidated revenues to be in a range of $2,035,000,000 to $2,085,000,000. This represents year-over-year growth in a range of 7% to 9% organically and 8% to 10% operationally.  We expect the foreign exchange headwind on Q3 revenue to be negligible. For the third year -- for the third quarter, adjusted EPS is expected to be in a range of $0.25 to $0.27 per share, and GAAP EPS is expected to be in a range of $0.13 to $0.15 per share.
Please check our Investor Relations website for Q2 2016 financial and operational highlights, which outlines Q2 results, as well as Q3 and full year 2016 guidance, including P&L line item guidance.  So with that, I'll turn it back over to Susie who will moderate the Q&A."

The guidance range for Q3 and the full year is 71.5% to 72.5% so it implies the uptick that you mentioned in the second half. I think that to key drivers of that are the inventory charges for the CRM products related to the better uptake of MRI-safe Brady and Quad in the U.S. as well as the WATCHMAN FLX. We don't believe that those repeat themselves. And then secondly, we will get the full benefit in the second half of the lower manufacturing costs that we had for 2016 standards because we'll now be selling all the inventory at the new standards, and we will have sold off all of the inventory at last year's standards. So those are the 2 main drivers that put us back in the 71.5% to 72.5% range. FX, we actually assume is probably somewhat in the same range as where it was in Q2. That's really the reason if you think back to the last quarter, our guidance for FX in gross margin would have implied about 70 to 75 basis points each quarter for Qs 2, 3 and 4. Now it's 120. So that's a 50 basis point difference. And that's the reason why the guidance for the full year came from 72% to 73% to 71.5% to 72.5%."

So we get that back hopefully each of the next 3 years and then expanding margins. So our goal next year is 25%-plus and as we've given guidance for long-term goals for 27% to 28% by 2020, the combination of those 2 factors and the CapEx I think gets you a long way there. And then the other piece is that we're going to continue to try from a working capital perspective to make that be our friend. We have a lot of inventory initiatives in place to really hopefully lead the industry in that regard, and be best-in-class, and when we do that, that'll turn something that's been a drag on cash flow into a positive and hopefully see the beginnings of that this year.

So our and the business enjoys a first of all, a strong market, a bit fewer competitors in our Endoscopy markets in some of our others. It is very strong growth profile in terms of the market growth in OUS expansion. and we're a very strong category leader. Across the globe, we continue to expand emerging markets. The portfolio is really driving a lot of the launch out of the success that you're seeing in 2016, led by our SpyGlass digital DS platform, which is driving solid double-digit growth and helps pull through the core portfolio. We also launched a product called the AXIOS Stent, which is doing very well, as well as a hemostasis clip. So the portfolio cadence for Endo is very strong. It's very well-led. It's very globally oriented, and they also do a great job of laying out the economic value proposition for hospitals beyond the portfolio. So they continue to perform very well and intentionally, some of my comments with Mike in his first question, we're intentionally focusing on investing greater in faster-growth markets, in faster growth businesses and they represent 40% of our operating income, the MedSurg sector does now for BSC, so more to come there. DS is doing excellent. We had a few critics early on in our launch saying we won't be as aggressive we've signaled all along that we're going to be driving an appropriate premium price for this product because we believe it is the best product available in the marketplace and the data is proving that out and maybe Keith can comment in a minute. So we believe it's in the premium product. We do operate a premium price for it. And so we've been smart in our rollout of it and I think physicians and customers are seeing the value of the ease-of-use and the clinical data synergy and we expect the U.S. penetration to be probably above 50% closer to 50% to 60% in the U.S. in 2016. And we continue to roll that out globally. So the team is doing a nice job there but again, it's part of the overall story in cardiology again, faster growth segments, our DS is doing well a lot of investments and complex coronary and imaging which are part of the portfolio and clearly our structural heart. So Kevin and his team is doing a nice job."

And looking at the second half, it's going to be 11.5% to get to the full year rate of 11% so that's 100 basis point increase in R&D, largely related to timing in the investments in structural heart that Mike have mentioned.

We continue to beat our long-range strategic plan goals and execute very well as a global team.

We continue to beat our long-range strategic plan goals and execute very well as a global team. The success of our category leadership strategy is helping us gain share in our core markets, expanding the faster growth adjacencies and deliver solutions that address unmet clinical needs. Our consistent results continue to demonstrate that Boston Scientific is uniquely positioned to deliver differentiated long-term shareholder value. With long term visibility to mid-single digit organic revenue growth, complemented by ongoing operating margin improvement initiatives, our goal is to consistently drive double-digit adjusted EPS growth.
We're very excited about our excellent second quarter performance, first half results, and most importantly, our plans for the future. In Q2, we drove total operational revenue growth of 16% and organic revenue growth of 10%, excluding the impact of the AMS Urology acquisition. We had strong results across all regions, and 5 of our 7 business units grew revenue double digits organically. We leveraged that revenue growth to drive adjusted operating income growth of 22%, resulting in an adjusted operating margin of 23.4% and 130 basis point improvement year-over-year.
We delivered adjusted EPS of $0.27, achieving the high end of guidance and representing 25% growth, including the negative $0.015 impact from foreign currency. So given our strong performance, we are increasing our 2016 guidance for revenue and adjusted EPS. We're are increasing our full year organic revenue growth guidance from 6% to 8% to 8% to 9%, full year operational revenue growth guidance, which includes the benefit of AMS, is increased from 9% to 11% to 11% to 12%. We're maintaining our full year adjusted operating margin guidance of 24% to 24.5%, which at the midpoint is roughly 200 basis points of improvement over 2015. We're also increasing our adjusted EPS guidance by $0.01 over our prior range to $1.07 to $1.11, which represents 15% and 19% growth. Importantly, this adjusted EPS guidance includes an expected $0.05 negative impact from foreign exchange.
I'll now provide some highlights on Q2 results and our '16 outlook. In my remarks, all references to growth are in a constant currency organic year-over-year basis, and they exclude the benefit of AMS. Our second quarter revenue growth of 10% was broad based across businesses and regions, led again by exciting new product launches, continued global expansion and execution of our category leadership strategy. We drove double-digit growth in 5 businesses: endo, urology public-health, Neuromodulation, Interventional Cardiology and Peripheral Interventions. In addition, each region accelerated sequentially. The U.S. grew 8%; Europe, grew 9%; Asia PAC delivered 16% growth, with every major country in the Asia Pac region up double digits this quarter. The emerging markets also continued to deliver. Sales grew 20%, including China revenue at 21%. 
Our MedSurg businesses, endo, Urology public health and Neuromodulation, continue to be a priority focus area for the company, and each of the businesses maintained or accelerated growth from first quarter. These 3 businesses represent 40% of our operating income in the second quarter and they delivered adjusted operating margin of 32.8%. This is up 20 basis points sequentially and 240 basis points year-over-year. Our global Endoscopy team continues to perform at a high level with the revenue growing 11% in the second quarter. We continue to see strong growth in our core endo business, supported by our innovative portfolio and broad-based global expansion initiatives. Key endo growth drivers include the single-use SpyGlass DS Visualization System, the AXIOS Stent for drainage of pancreatic fluid and our next-generation hemostasis clip, the Resolution 360. High single-digit growth in U.S. endo was complemented by double-digit growth in every region outside the U.S., as we continue to develop commercial and position-training abilities in emerging markets and add focus in pulmonary, which helped drive 25% growth in BT, bronchial thermoplasty, led by the U.S., Japan and China. 
In Urology and public health, our investments to become the clear market leader and category leader have been rewarded, as growth excluding AMS accelerated to 18%. The business is performing at a high-level across the various regions and segments, including kidney stone, BPH, ED and surg gyn. Our global commercial footprint and focus on physician education has helped us to convert a meaningful portion of the market opportunity created by a STORZ's exit from the market at the end of March. 
AMS sales strength in the quarter and importantly, remediation and integration efforts remain on track. An exciting new growth platform in our urology business is the launch of a LithoVue platform. LithoVue is an innovative single-use digital scope for treatment of kidney stones that provide customers with enhanced visualization and navigation capabilities. LithoVue resonates with physicians and hospitals due to less OR downtime for sterile processing of reusable scopes. Performance navigation characteristics that allow physicians to tackle tougher procedures and the ability to schedule full day of procedures without the fear of cancellation due to reusable scopes being down.
In Neuromodulation, we continue to invest in the fast-growing microelectronics market, where we enjoy innovation and supply chain leverage between our CRM and neuromod business. Neuromodulation revenues grew in the quarter to 12% -- grew 12%. Sales were driven by the U.S. market-leading Spectra platform; the launch of Precision montage, which offers full body MRI capability; and our Vercise Deep Brain Stimulation platform. Our U.S. DBS trial continues to progress, and we expect to launch in the U.S. in the first quarter of 2018. Additionally, earlier this week, we announced the acquisition of Cosman Medical, a technology leader in the field of radiofrequency ablation systems for the treatment of chronic pain. This acquisition broadens our neuromodulation portfolio and is highly synergistic with our U.S. commercial team. We're excited to offer physicians treating patients with chronic pain another non-opioid therapeutic option earlier in the treatment continuum.
Now turning to Cardiovascular, which includes our peripheral and Interventional Cardiology businesses. Overall, this segment grew sales 13% in the quarter and delivered adjusted operating margin of 32.2%, up more than 170 basis points year-over-year. Our peripheral business delivered exceptional results with strong global sales across all regions fueled by an innovative portfolio. Sales grew 14% on strong results across all regions and segments, including stents, thrombectomy and our emerging drug-eluting portfolio. We also delivered strong growth in Interventional Oncology, where the integration of Interventional Radiology business of CeloNova remains on track. In our Venous segment, we continue to see very strong demand for our Zelante deep vein thrombosis system. We are the only company that have been leading drug-eluting technology globally on multiple platforms in order to treat complex, peripheral vascular disease. The Eluvia peripheral drug-eluting stent ID trial called IMPERIAL is on track to complete enrollment by yearend 2016. 
In Interventional Cardiology, we are focused on gaining share in our core businesses while expanding in faster growth segments that leverage our capabilities. This strategy is working. In the second quarter, interventional cardiology grew 12% led by structural heart, drug-eluting stents and PCI guidance. SYNERGY had an excellent quarter, as we grew DES sales 9%. SYNERGY is now the market-leading premium DES platform and it's on track to represent 50% to 60% of our U.S. DES revenue mix by the end of 2016. PCI guidance grew mid-teens and continues its share gains in intravascular ultrasound, and we're encouraged by strong early feedback on the ease-of-use of our COMET fractional flow reserve system. Our leading portfolio of solutions for complex high-risk PCI patients also contributed to global growth.
The 12% IT revenue growth was fueled by our strength in the structural heart business, which includes our Lotus transcatheter aortic valve and WATCHMAN Left Atrial Appendage Closure. We believe we are well-positioned to drive long-term growth in these 2 fast-growing markets via our differentiated platforms and expanded capabilities. We also aim to deliver the high-end of our 2016 Structural OR guidance range of $175 million to $200 million.
Our Lotus Valve continues to gain share in Europe, and we are investing significantly in clinical studies, R&D and a global supply chain to develop our capabilities further. We remain on track to launch Lotus EDGE at PCR London Valves in September. The Lotus EDGE delivery system features a 14 French expandable sheet called iSleeve [ph] and is designed for more flexibility and simplified deployment. It also offers our new Depth Guard technology, which limits the depth of the valve in the left ventricular outflow tract. Lotus also offers best-in-class paravalvular leakage rates, and we aim to enhance Lotus with studies to demonstrate improved permanent pacemaker rates with Lotus EDGE and Depth Guard. So our goal is to provide initial Lotus EDGE data at PCR London Valves. We do expect a slight delay in our expanded Lotus Valve matrix in Europe, with a 21-millimeter valve estimated CE Mark timing first quarter '17, and a 29-millimeter valve in Europe in mid-2017. We continue to invest and plan for a U.S. launch with the Lotus EDGE platform in late 2017.
Also in structural heart, WATCHMAN sales were strong on procedure growth and new account openings. We are developing additional WATCHMAN capabilities in field clinical support, market development and physician training courses. Implant success rates and patient outcomes remain very high as evidenced by the 98.5% success rate in the evolution registry detailed at HRS in May.
We continue to expand WATCHMAN in the new markets and we're pleased with the recent reimbursement approval and launch in France. Importantly, the unique clinical benefits of WATCHMAN are being rewarded, as evidenced by the French reimbursement at a meaningful premium to competitive LAAC devices.
We post a limited market release of our next generation WATCHMAN FLX device. We've have decided to pursue design enhancements before we turn in the next-gen platform to market. Importantly, we anticipate this delay will have no impact on our current WATCHMAN product and thus, no change to our market outlook for LAAC.
Rhythm Management sales increased 5% in the quarter and delivered adjusted operating margin of 16.9%, up 200 basis points year-over-year, as improving profitability remains a core focus.
In CRM, we improved our global performance and delivered 4% growth in second quarter. Our European and Asia PAC CRM businesses continue to grow faster than the market, offset by slower growth in U.S. CRM. Pacemaker sales grew 15% globally, with excellent U.S. performance fueled by our ACCOLADE MRI launch, and growth from our X4 CRT-P quad device. Worldwide ICD sales were flat as we delivered above-market growth internationally that was offset by weaker sales in the U.S. In the U.S., we faced some near-term headwinds due to our tachy MRI product gap and replacement cycle headwinds. However, we recently we earned FDA approval of our ACUITY X4 quad CRT lead and the early results are promising. Importantly, EMBLEM S-ICD is a key differentiator, and growth continues to accelerate globally. We continue to expand global S-ICD utilization with more long-term data from the EFFORTLESS Registry, growing physician implant experience, geographic expansion and the recent second quarter of '16 EU launch at EMBLEM MRI, which contributed to our solid international growth.
Due to a change in protocol of our U.S. enabled MRI clinical trial, we are revising our goal for transvenous tachy MRI U.S. approval by year-end 2017, but continue to expect a gain in MRI labeling for both new and previously implanted ICDs and CRT-Ds with a new timeline. The continued cadence of data proving the superiority of EnduraLife batteries and the pending FDA approval of EMBLEM MRI S-ICD, which is expected in the third quarter, will help us offset the near-term headwinds from the U.S. MRI high-voltage segment.
In the second quarter, European CRM sales grew 5%, representing 9 straight quarters of above-market growth, giving us further confidence in our long-term CRM outlook. Our EP business grew 6% in the second quarter and we're encouraged by double-digit growth in Europe, led by new arrhythmia installs and the recent launches of Nitinol OI and IntellaTip MiFi OI ablation catheters. The U.S. launch in late first quarter of Blazer OI catheter will be augmented in Q3 with the upcoming launch of the nav-enabled version of this catheter. 
So to wrap up, our company delivered another excellent quarter. Our second quarter performance reflects the strength of our global team, the depth and breadth of our portfolio, our globalization efforts and our ongoing investment in the faster growing markets. Importantly, we believe we are well-positioned to deliver continued strong results in the second half of '16 and beyond. I really want to thank our employees globally for their winning spirit and their strong commitment to Boston Scientific.
Now let me turn the call over to Dan for a more detailed review of our financial results."
317627,370563598,1015457,"Boston Scientific Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2016",2016-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Boston Scientific Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Mike. In Q2, we generated organic revenue growth of 10% versus our 6% to 8% guidance range, and adjusted EPS of $0.27, representing 25% year-over-year growth in the high-end of our guidance range of $0.25 to $0.27. The strong adjusted EPS growth p",1909,"Thanks, Mike. In Q2, we generated organic revenue growth of 10% versus our 6% to 8% guidance range, and adjusted EPS of $0.27, representing 25% year-over-year growth in the high-end of our guidance range of $0.25 to $0.27. The strong adjusted EPS growth performance in Q2 was driven primarily by revenue growth upside and a lower SG&A rate versus prior year. And given the strong performance in the first half of 2016, we are again raising full year guidance for revenue growth and adjusted EPS. Consolidated revenue of $2,126,000,000 represented operational revenue growth of 16%, exceeding the high end of guidance and excludes the impact of a $24 million headwind from foreign exchange, which was in line with guidance. Excluding an approximate 500 basis point contribution from the AMS male urology portfolio acquisition, organic revenue growth was 10% in the quarter and 15% on an as-reported basis.
Adjusted gross margin for the second quarter was 70.7%, decreasing 60 basis points year-over-year and unfortunately, 130 basis points below the midpoint of Q2 guidance due to a few factors that I will detail. The year-over-year decrease is due to the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange, which was a 120 basis point headwind, as well as costs related to our new Malaysia manufacturing plant, the AMS integration, including the AMS quality remediation expense. Compared to guidance, the shortfall is due to inventory charges in advance of new product launches, inventory write-offs related to WATCHMAN FLX and more unfavorable FX.
We now expect Q3 and full year 2016 adjusted gross margin to be in the range of a 71.5% to 72.5%, which includes an expected 75 to 100 basis point of unfavorable foreign exchange. A key element in the second half increase is lower expected inventory charges, and we will also benefit fully from the lower 2016 standard cost of our products as we will have sold through all of the inventory valued at last year's higher standards. Adjusted SG&A expenses were $763 million or 35.9% of sales in Q2, down 140 basis points year-over-year. We continue to believe our full year rate will be between 35.5% and 36.5%, which at the midpoint would be a 140 basis point improvement compared to last year.
Adjusted research and development expenses were $222 million in the second quarter or 10.4% of sales, which is down 50 basis points year-over-year. As a result of a slightly lower R&D rate in the first half, we expect our full year 2016 adjusted R&D rate to be between 10.5% and 11.5% of sales or 50 basis points lower than prior guidance. Royalty expense was 0.9% of sales in Q2, roughly flat year-over-year. Our Q2 2016 adjusted operating margin of 23.4% was in line with our guidance and represents a 130 basis point improvement over Q2 last year, which marks the eighth consecutive quarter in which we will have expanded adjusted operating margin by 100 basis points or more.
As a reminder, we've signaled a sequential decrease in adjusted operating margin from Q1's rate as we experienced the usual increase in SG&A from Q1 to Q2 due to seasonal trade show activity and began to ramp reinvestment of the medical device excise tax suspension. Our first half 2016 adjusted operating margin of 24.2% positions us well to achieve our full year adjusted operating margin guidance of 24% to 24.5%, and we remain on track to reach 25%-plus in 2017.
Q2 adjusted operating income grew 22% year-over-year, with all 3 reportable segments expanding adjusted operating margin by at least 170 basis points over Q2 2015. Specific to Rhythm Management, the team delivered an adjusted operating margin of 16.9%, up 280 basis points year-over-year. In the second half of 2016, we expect Rhythm Management adjusted operating margin to continue to improve and be 18% to 19%. This second half gain is expected to result from realizing the full benefit of 2016 product costs, leveraging the improved top line performance expected of the global CRM and EP businesses, and we continue to believe Rhythm management is on track to deliver an adjusted operating margin of 20% in 2017.
Turning to the balance sheet, we had some key developments in the quarter that helped reduce future uncertainties. Before I get into the details of the activity in the quarter, let me try to frame out the next 3 years of expected cash flow at a high level. From 2017 through 2019, we believe we can generate cumulative adjusted free cash flow after CapEx approaching $6 billion. We expect to allocate roughly 2/3 of that $6 billion to a combination of M&A and share repurchases. As you're aware, the 2 most significant liabilities on our balance sheet are our IRS transfer pricing case and the mesh litigation. During the quarter, we took 2 important steps to manage these liabilities. First, we reached a stipulation of settled issues with the IRS for the 2001 to 2007 tax years. And importantly, this stipulation also provides a framework to settle the remaining years 2008 through 2015 as well. While there's work to do to conclude all the years, we are confident we will bring these to conclusion over the coming quarters. With the payment in 12 to 24 months, this would eliminate one of the most significant liabilities on our balance sheet. With regards to mesh, we increased our reserve by $608 million during the quarter. With the same goal of managing our liabilities, we've reached conditional or final settlements on 12,000 claims and made significant progress towards reaching agreement in principle on another 7,000 claims for a total of 19,000 claims. This represents approximately half of the roughly 40,000 known claims, and we expect to make even more progress during the remainder of 2016. As you know, every quarter, we assess all 4 key components involving calculating the reserve and make any necessary adjustments for all probable and estimable charges, including the volume of known claims, the estimated cost to resolve each claim, an estimate of future claims and the cost to defend each claim.
Our total legal reserve, of which mesh is included, was $2,375,000,000 as of June 30, 2016 and we believe it reflected our best estimate of what is probable and estimable. Of note as well, is that included in this reserve is the Mirowski Judgment which we have paid in full, subsequent to quarter end. So as of today, the reserve would be closer to $2 billion. As a reminder, this $2 billion includes a number of claims we have agreed in principle to settle but have not yet paid. Once those settlements are funded, the amount of the reserve will be adjusted accordingly.
Now I'll move on to interest expense. Interest expense for the quarter was $59 million, compared to $106 million in Q2 of last year. The decrease is primarily due to the pretax onetime charge of approximately $45 million associated with a senior note refinancing in Q2 of last year. Excluding this charge, Q2 2015 interest expense was $61 million. Our average interest expense rate was 4% in Q2 this year compared to 8% in Q2 last year. The lower interest-rate expense in Q2 of '16 was primarily due to lower average cost of debt resulting from the senior notes refinancing and the inclusion of the pretax onetime charge in Q2 of last year that I mentioned. Excluding this charge, Q2 2015 interest expense would have been 4.6%.
Our tax rate for the second quarter was 47.8% on a reported basis and 14.2% on an adjusted basis. As reported last week, we're pleased with the conditional settlement reached with the IRS council regarding our transfer pricing litigation, and plan to use some of the current benefit to repatriate overseas cash. Thus we continue to expect our full year 2016 adjusted tax rate to be approximately 14%. We believe this IRS settlement, in addition to recent progress we've made towards reaching agreements in principle to settle additional mesh claims, as I mentioned, are prudent actions to take in the management of our balance sheet.
Finally, Q2 2016 adjusted EPS of $0.27 includes approximately $0.015 of unfavorable FX and represents 25% year-over-year growth or 32% growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange. On a reported GAAP basis, Q2 2016 EPS was a loss of $0.15 and includes net charges and amortization expense totaling $580 million after tax.
Adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was $464 million compared to $406 million in Q2 of last year. Given the strong adjusted free cash flow generation in the first half of this year, we are raising our full year adjusted free cash flow guidance from $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion, which was formally our stretch goal. Achieving adjusted free cash flow of $1.6 billion would represent 17% growth, and we continue to pursue inventory management initiatives designed to improve the working capital contribution to cash flow.
In Q2, we used cash primarily to repay $250 million of bank term loans, as well as fund the previously agreed legal settlements. As of June 30, 2016, we had cash on hand of $438 million. Near term, our capital allocation priorities are to manage contingencies and pursue tuck-in M&A. 
We ended Q2 with 1,375,000,000 fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding. Consistent with our prior guidance, we expect our share count to increase by roughly 5 million per quarter through the end of 2016, as we plan to keep the buybacks suspended for the balance of this year. We expect this to result in a fully diluted weighted average share count of approximately 1,380,000,000 shares for full year 2016.
I'll now walk-through guidance for Q3 and full year 2016. For the full year, we now expect consolidated revenue to be in a range of $8,270,000,000 to $8,370,000,000, which represents year-over-year growth of 8% to 9% on an organic basis and 11% to 12% on both on operational and reported basis. As a result of a stronger dollar, at current rates, we expect foreign exchange to be a headwind of approximately $70 million for the full year 2016. 
Turning to adjusted EPS, we now expect full year 2016 adjusted EPS to be in a range of $1.07 to $1.11, representing 15% to 19% adjusted earnings growth. Our previous guidance assumed the unfavorable FX on full year adjusted EPS would be between $0.05 and $0.06. Given the fact that Q2 saw a slightly less unfavorable impact than expected, we now believe the full year impact will be closer to $0.05 which assumes $0.02 to $0.03 in the second half of this year. On a GAAP basis, we expect EPS to be in a range of $0.30 to $0.35.
Now turning to Q3 2016, we expect consolidated revenues to be in a range of $2,035,000,000 to $2,085,000,000. This represents year-over-year growth in a range of 7% to 9% organically and 8% to 10% operationally. We expect the foreign exchange headwind on Q3 revenue to be negligible. For the third year -- for the third quarter, adjusted EPS is expected to be in a range of $0.25 to $0.27 per share, and GAAP EPS is expected to be in a range of $0.13 to $0.15 per share.
Please check our Investor Relations website for Q2 2016 financial and operational highlights, which outlines Q2 results, as well as Q3 and full year 2016 guidance, including P&L line item guidance. So with that, I'll turn it back over to Susie, who'll moderate the Q&A."

Let me just make sure we're clear on that. So we're at 70.7% in the quarter. The guidance range for Q3 and the full year is 71.5% to 72.5%, so it implies the uptick that you mentioned in the second half. I think the 2 key drivers of that are, the inventory charges for the CRM products related to the better uptake of MRI-safe brady and quad in the U.S. as well as the WATCHMAN FLX. We don't believe that those repeat themselves. And then secondly, we will get the full benefit in the second half of the lower manufacturing costs that for 2016 standards because we'll now be selling all the inventory at the new standards, and we'll have sold off all of the inventory at last year's standards. Those are the 2 main drivers that put us back in the 71.5% to 72.5% range. FX, we actually assume is probably somewhat in the same range as where it was in Q2. That's really the reason. If you think back to last quarter, our guidance for FX in gross margin would have implied about 70 to 75 basis points each quarter for Qs 2, 3 and 4. Now it's 120. So that's a 50 basis point difference. And that's the reason why the guidance for the full year came from 72% to 73% to 71.5% to 72.5%."

So we get that back hopefully each of the next 3 years. And then, the expanding margins. So our goal next year is 25%-plus, and as we've given guidance for long-term goals for 27% to 28% by 2020, the combination of those 2 factors and the CapEx, I think, gets you a long way there. And then the other piece is that, we're going to continue to try from a working capital perspective to make that be our friend. We have a lot of inventory initiatives in place to really hopefully lead the industry in that regard, and be best-in-class, and when we do that, that'll turn something that's been a drag on cash flow into a positive, and hopefully see the beginnings of that this year.

And it really had just continue to do -- continue to grow and expand. So our endo business enjoys, a, first of all, a strong market, a bit fewer competitors in our Endoscopy markets than some of our others. It has very strong growth profile in terms of the market growth in OUS expansion, and we are a very strong category leader. Across the globe, when we continue to expand and taking emerging markets. The portfolio is really driving a lot of the launch out of the success that you're seeing in 2016, led by our SpyGlass digital DS platform, which is driving solid double-digit growth and helps pull through the core portfolio. We also launched a product called the AXIOS Stents, which is doing very well, as well as a hemostasis clip. So the portfolio cadence for endo is very strong, it's very well-led, it's very globally oriented, and they also do a great job of laying out the economic value proposition for hospitals beyond the portfolio. So they continue to perform very well and intentionally, in some of my comments with Mike in his first question, we are intentionally focusing on investing greater in faster-growth markets, in faster growth businesses and they represent 40% of our operating income, the MedSurg sector does now for BSC. So more to come there. DES is doing excellent. We had a few critics early on in our launch saying we won't be an aggressive NOAS. We signaled all along that we're going to be drive an appropriate premium price for this product because we believe it is the best product available in the marketplace and the data is proving that out, and maybe Keith can comment in a minute. So we believe it's the premium product. We do operate a premium price for it. And so we've been smart in our rollout of it, and I think physicians and customers are seeing the value of the ease-of-use and the clinical data synergy and we expect the U.S. penetration to be probably above 50%, closer to 50% to 60% in the U.S. in 2016. And we continue to roll that out globally. So the team is doing a nice job there. But again, it's part of the overall story in interventional cardiology. Again pointing to faster growth segments, our DES is doing well. A lot of investments in complex coronary and imaging, which are part of the portfolio, and then clearly our structural heart. So Kevin Ballinger and the team are doing a nice job."

I think the main factor that's offsetting that is, if you look at our R&D rate, our R&D rate in the first half was 10.5%. And looking at the second half, it's going to be 11.5% to get to the full year rate of 11%. So that's 100 basis point increase in R&D, largely related to the timing in the investments in structural heart that Mike had mentioned.

Maybe give us a little more color on that. Are you ready to quantify that at all? You've talked about a penetration or share of greater than 30% in your selected accounts. And maybe just add some more color on the EDGE launch coming up in September. Is this is share gainer or no? That's going to require more time and those additional sizes that are coming in the first half of '17?"

Again, this is a big investment for us in structural heart with the WATCHMAN and TAVR. And we're playing it for the long-term here, particularly with our TAVR, given the market growth profile and how large the market is. And our view that we have a very differentiated platform from the other market contenders given the controlled release of our Lotus Valve and the low paravalvular leakage rates. So we think we have -- truly have a differentiated platform in a very large market. We're a bit hamstrung in the near term in Europe without having all 5 sizes. We have 3 of them today. So that hurts us a bit, but we'll solve that with a 21-millimeter in 2000 -- first quarter '17 and eventually the largest size in probably first half of 2017. So that'll help. So in the meantime, we continue to do very well with the 3 valve sizes that we have. We won't provide any additional guidance in terms of number of accounts or penetration. But clearly, it is a share taking strategy. The market's already large, the market's growing, and we're quite confident that we're currently the strong #3 player. But that's not going to be our aspiration over the years, particularly as we launch Lotus EDGE and Depth Guard."

Also of note, this call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws, which may be identified by words like anticipate, expect, believe, estimate and other similar words. 
They include, among other things, statements about our growth and market share; new product approvals and launches; clinical trials; cost savings and growth opportunities; our cash flow and expected use; our financial performance, including sales, margins, earnings and other Q2 2016 results and Q3 and full year 2016 guidance as well as our tax rates, R&D spend and other expenses.
Actual results may differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. 
Factors that may cause such differences include those described in the Risk Factors section of our most recent 10-K and subsequent 10-Qs filed with the SEC.

We continue to beat our long-range strategic plan goals and execute very well as a global team.

We continue to beat our long-range strategic plan goals and execute very well as a global team. The success of our category leadership strategy is helping us gain share in our core markets, expanding the faster growth adjacencies and deliver solutions that address unmet clinical needs. Our consistent results continue to demonstrate that Boston Scientific is uniquely positioned to deliver differentiated long-term shareholder value. With long term visibility to mid-single digit organic revenue growth, complemented by ongoing operating margin improvement initiatives, our goal is to consistently drive double-digit adjusted EPS growth.
We're very excited about our excellent second quarter performance, first half results, and most importantly, our plans for the future. In Q2, we drove total operational revenue growth of 16% and organic revenue growth of 10%, excluding the impact of the AMS Urology acquisition. We had strong results across all regions, and 5 of our 7 business units grew revenue double digits organically. We leveraged that revenue growth to drive adjusted operating income growth of 22%, resulting in an adjusted operating margin of 23.4% and 130 basis point improvement year-over-year.
We delivered adjusted EPS of $0.27, achieving the high end of guidance and representing 25% growth, including the negative $0.015 impact from foreign currency. So given our strong performance, we are increasing our 2016 guidance for revenue and adjusted EPS. We're are increasing our full year organic revenue growth guidance from 6% to 8% to 8% to 9%, full year operational revenue growth guidance, which includes the benefit of AMS, is increased from 9% to 11% to 11% to 12%. We're maintaining our full year adjusted operating margin guidance of 24% to 24.5%, which at the midpoint is roughly 200 basis points of improvement over 2015. We're also increasing our adjusted EPS guidance by $0.01 over our prior range to $1.07 to $1.11, which represents 15% and 19% growth. Importantly, this adjusted EPS guidance includes an expected $0.05 negative impact from foreign exchange.
I'll now provide some highlights on Q2 results and our '16 outlook. In my remarks, all references to growth are in a constant currency organic year-over-year basis, and they exclude the benefit of AMS. Our second quarter revenue growth of 10% was broad based across businesses and regions, led again by exciting new product launches, continued global expansion and execution of our category leadership strategy. We drove double-digit growth in 5 businesses: endo, urology public-health, Neuromodulation, Interventional Cardiology and Peripheral Interventions. In addition, each region accelerated sequentially. The U.S. grew 8%; Europe, grew 9%; Asia PAC delivered 16% growth, with every major country in the Asia Pac region up double digits this quarter. The emerging markets also continued to deliver. Sales grew 20%, including China revenue at 21%. 
Our MedSurg businesses, endo, Urology public health and Neuromodulation, continue to be a priority focus area for the company, and each of the businesses maintained or accelerated growth from first quarter. These 3 businesses represent 40% of our operating income in the second quarter and they delivered adjusted operating margin of 32.8%. This is up 20 basis points sequentially and 240 basis points year-over-year. Our global Endoscopy team continues to perform at a high level with the revenue growing 11% in the second quarter. We continue to see strong growth in our core endo business, supported by our innovative portfolio and broad-based global expansion initiatives. Key endo growth drivers include the single-use SpyGlass DS Visualization System, the AXIOS Stent for drainage of pancreatic fluid and our next-generation hemostasis clip, the Resolution 360. High single-digit growth in U.S. endo was complemented by double-digit growth in every region outside the U.S., as we continue to develop commercial and position-training abilities in emerging markets and add focus in pulmonary, which helped drive 25% growth in BT, bronchial thermoplasty, led by the U.S., Japan and China. 
In Urology and public health, our investments to become the clear market leader and category leader have been rewarded, as growth excluding AMS accelerated to 18%. The business is performing at a high-level across the various regions and segments, including kidney stone, BPH, ED and surg gyn. Our global commercial footprint and focus on physician education has helped us to convert a meaningful portion of the market opportunity created by a STORZ's exit from the market at the end of March. 
AMS sales strength in the quarter and importantly, remediation and integration efforts remain on track. An exciting new growth platform in our urology business is the launch of a LithoVue platform. LithoVue is an innovative single-use digital scope for treatment of kidney stones that provide customers with enhanced visualization and navigation capabilities. LithoVue resonates with physicians and hospitals due to less OR downtime for sterile processing of reusable scopes. Performance navigation characteristics that allow physicians to tackle tougher procedures and the ability to schedule full day of procedures without the fear of cancellation due to reusable scopes being down.
In Neuromodulation, we continue to invest in the fast-growing microelectronics market, where we enjoy innovation and supply chain leverage between our CRM and neuromod business. Neuromodulation revenues grew in the quarter to 12% -- grew 12%. Sales were driven by the U.S. market-leading Spectra platform; the launch of Precision montage, which offers full body MRI capability; and our Vercise Deep Brain Stimulation platform. Our U.S. DBS trial continues to progress, and we expect to launch in the U.S. in the first quarter of 2018. Additionally, earlier this week, we announced the acquisition of Cosman Medical, a technology leader in the field of radiofrequency ablation systems for the treatment of chronic pain. This acquisition broadens our neuromodulation portfolio and is highly synergistic with our U.S. commercial team. We're excited to offer physicians treating patients with chronic pain another non-opioid therapeutic option earlier in the treatment continuum.
Now turning to Cardiovascular, which includes our peripheral and Interventional Cardiology businesses. Overall, this segment grew sales 13% in the quarter and delivered adjusted operating margin of 32.2%, up more than 170 basis points year-over-year. Our peripheral business delivered exceptional results with strong global sales across all regions fueled by an innovative portfolio. Sales grew 14% on strong results across all regions and segments, including stents, thrombectomy and our emerging drug-eluting portfolio. We also delivered strong growth in Interventional Oncology, where the integration of Interventional Radiology business of CeloNova remains on track. In our Venous segment, we continue to see very strong demand for our Zelante deep vein thrombosis system. We are the only company that have been leading drug-eluting technology globally on multiple platforms in order to treat complex, peripheral vascular disease. The Eluvia peripheral drug-eluting stent ID trial called IMPERIAL is on track to complete enrollment by yearend 2016. 
In Interventional Cardiology, we are focused on gaining share in our core businesses while expanding in faster growth segments that leverage our capabilities. This strategy is working. In the second quarter, interventional cardiology grew 12% led by a structural heart, drug-eluting stents and PCI guidance. SYNERGY had an excellent quarter, as we grew DES sales 9%. SYNERGY is now the market-leading premium DES platform and it's on track to represent 50% to 60% of our U.S. DES revenue mix by the end of 2016. PCI guidance grew mid-teens and continues share gains in intravascular ultrasound, and we're encouraged by strong early feedback on the ease-of-use of our COMET fractional flow reserve system. Our leading portfolio of solutions for complex high-risk PCI of patients also contributed to global growth.
The 12% IT revenue growth was fueled by our strength in the structural heart business, which includes our Lotus transcatheter aortic valve and WATCHMAN Left Atrial Appendage Closure. We believe we are well-positioned to drive long-term growth in these 2 fast-growing markets via our differentiated platforms and expanded capabilities. We also aim to deliver at the high-end of our 2016 Structural OR guidance range of $175 million to $200 million.
Our Lotus Valve continues to gain share in Europe, and we are investing significantly in clinical studies, R&D and our global supply chain to develop our capabilities further. We remain on track to launch Lotus EDGE at PCR London Valves in September. The Lotus EDGE delivery system features a 14 French expandable sheet called iSleeve and is designed for more flexibility and simplified deployment. It also offers our new Depth Guard technology, which limits the depth of the valve in the left ventricular outflow tract. Lotus also offers best-in-class paravalvular leakage rates, and we aim to enhance Lotus with studies to demonstrate improved permanent pacemaker rates with Lotus EDGE and Depth Guard. So our goal is to provide initial Lotus EDGE data at PCR London Valves. We do expect a slight delay in our expanded Lotus Valve matrix in Europe, with a 21-millimeter valve estimated CE Mark timing first quarter '17, and the 29-millimeter valve in Europe in mid-2017. We continue to invest and plan for a U.S. launch with the Lotus EDGE platform in late 2017.
Also in structural heart, WATCHMAN sales were strong on procedure growth and new account openings. We are developing additional WATCHMAN capabilities in field clinical support, market development and physician training courses. Implant success rates and patient outcomes remain very high as evidenced by the 98.5% success rate in the evolution registry detailed at HRS in May.
We continue to expand WATCHMAN in the new markets and we're pleased with the recent reimbursement approval and launch in France. Importantly, the unique clinical benefits of WATCHMAN are being rewarded, as evidenced by the French reimbursement at a meaningful premium to competitive LAAC devices.
We post a limited market release of our next generation WATCHMAN FLX device. We've have decided to pursue design enhancements before we turn in the next-gen platform to market. Importantly, we anticipate this delay will have no impact on our current WATCHMAN product and thus, no change to our market outlook for LAAC.
Rhythm Management sales increased 5% in the quarter and delivered adjusted operating margin of 16.9%, up 200 basis points year-over-year, as improving profitability remains a core focus.
In CRM, we improved our global performance and delivered 4% growth in second quarter. Our European and Asia PAC CRM businesses continue to grow faster than the market, offset by slower growth in U.S. CRM. Pacemaker sales grew 15% globally, with excellent U.S. performance fueled by our ACCOLADE MRI launch, and growth from our X4 CRT-P quad device. Worldwide ICD sales were flat as we delivered above-market growth internationally that was offset by weaker sales in the U.S. In the U.S., we faced some near-term headwinds due to our tachy MRI product gap and replacement cycle headwinds. However, we recently we earned FDA approval of our ACUITY X4 quad CRT lead and the early results are promising. Importantly, EMBLEM S-ICD is a key differentiator, and growth continues to accelerate globally. We continue to expand global S-ICD utilization with more long-term data from the EFFORTLESS Registry, growing physician implant experience, geographic expansion and the recent second quarter of '16 EU launch at EMBLEM MRI, which contributed to our solid international growth.
Due to a change in protocol of our U.S. enabled MRI clinical trial, we are revising our goal for transvenous tachy MRI U.S. approval by year-end 2017, but continue to expect to gain MRI labeling for both new and previously implanted ICDs and CRT-Ds with a new timeline. The continued cadence of data proving the superiority of EnduraLife batteries and the pending FDA approval of EMBLEM MRI S-ICD, which is expected in third quarter, will help us offset the near-term headwinds from the U.S. MRI high-voltage segment.
In the second quarter, European CRM sales grew 5%, representing 9 straight quarters of above-market growth, giving us further confidence in our long-term CRM outlook. Our EP business grew 6% in second quarter and we're encouraged by double-digit growth in Europe, led by new arrhythmia installs and the recent launches of Nitinol OI and IntellaTip MiFi OI ablation catheters. The U.S. launch in late first quarter of the Blazer OI catheter will be augmented in Q3 with the upcoming launch of the nav-enabled version of this catheter. 
So to wrap up, our company delivered another excellent quarter. Our second quarter performance reflects the strength of our global team, the depth and breadth of our portfolio, our globalization efforts and our ongoing investments in the faster growth markets. Importantly, we believe we are well-positioned to deliver continued strong results in the second half of '16 and beyond. I really want to thank our employees globally for their winning spirit and their strong commitment to Boston Scientific.
Now let me turn the call over to Dan for a more detailed review of our financial results."
317627,370563598,1015673,"Boston Scientific Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2016",2016-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Boston Scientific Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Mike. In Q2, we generated organic revenue growth of 10% versus our 6% to 8% guidance range, and adjusted EPS of $0.27, representing 25% year-over-year growth in the high-end of our guidance range of $0.25 to $0.27. The strong adjusted EPS growth p",1909,"Thanks, Mike. In Q2, we generated organic revenue growth of 10% versus our 6% to 8% guidance range, and adjusted EPS of $0.27, representing 25% year-over-year growth in the high-end of our guidance range of $0.25 to $0.27. The strong adjusted EPS growth performance in Q2 was driven primarily by revenue growth upside and a lower SG&A rate versus prior year. And given the strong performance in the first half of 2016, we are again raising full year guidance for revenue growth and adjusted EPS. Consolidated revenue of $2,126,000,000 represented operational revenue growth of 16%, exceeding the high end of guidance and excludes the impact of a $24 million headwind from foreign exchange, which was in line with guidance. Excluding an approximate 500 basis point contribution from the AMS male urology portfolio acquisition, organic revenue growth was 10% in the quarter and 15% on an as-reported basis.
Adjusted gross margin for the second quarter was 70.7%, decreasing 60 basis points year-over-year and unfortunately, 130 basis points below the midpoint of Q2 guidance due to a few factors that I will detail. The year-over-year decrease is due to the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange, which was a 120 basis point headwind, as well as costs related to our new Malaysia manufacturing plant, the AMS integration, including the AMS quality remediation expense. Compared to guidance, the shortfall is due to inventory charges in advance of new product launches, inventory write-offs related to WATCHMAN FLX and more unfavorable FX.
We now expect Q3 and full year 2016 adjusted gross margin to be in the range of a 71.5% to 72.5%, which includes an expected 75 to 100 basis point of unfavorable foreign exchange. A key element in the second half increase is lower expected inventory charges, and we will also benefit fully from the lower 2016 standard cost of our products as we will have sold through all of the inventory valued at last year's higher standards. Adjusted SG&A expenses were $763 million or 35.9% of sales in Q2, down 140 basis points year-over-year. We continue to believe our full year rate will be between 35.5% and 36.5%, which at the midpoint would be a 140 basis point improvement compared to last year.
Adjusted research and development expenses were $222 million in the second quarter or 10.4% of sales, which is down 50 basis points year-over-year. As a result of a slightly lower R&D rate in the first half, we expect our full year 2016 adjusted R&D rate to be between 10.5% and 11.5% of sales or 50 basis points lower than prior guidance. Royalty expense was 0.9% of sales in Q2, roughly flat year-over-year. Our Q2 2016 adjusted operating margin of 23.4% was in line with our guidance and represents a 130 basis point improvement over Q2 last year, which marks the eighth consecutive quarter in which we will have expanded adjusted operating margin by 100 basis points or more.
As a reminder, we've signaled a sequential decrease in adjusted operating margin from Q1's rate as we experienced the usual increase in SG&A from Q1 to Q2 due to seasonal trade show activity and began to ramp reinvestment of the medical device excise tax suspension. Our first half 2016 adjusted operating margin of 24.2% positions us well to achieve our full year adjusted operating margin guidance of 24% to 24.5%, and we remain on track to reach 25%-plus in 2017.
Q2 adjusted operating income grew 22% year-over-year, with all 3 reportable segments expanding adjusted operating margin by at least 170 basis points over Q2 2015. Specific to Rhythm Management, the team delivered an adjusted operating margin of 16.9%, up 280 basis points year-over-year. In the second half of 2016, we expect Rhythm Management adjusted operating margin to continue to improve and be 18% to 19%. This second half gain is expected to result from realizing the full benefit of 2016 product costs, leveraging the improved top line performance expected of the global CRM and EP businesses, and we continue to believe Rhythm management is on track to deliver an adjusted operating margin of 20% in 2017.
Turning to the balance sheet, we had some key developments in the quarter that helped reduce future uncertainties. Before I get into the details of the activity in the quarter, let me try to frame out the next 3 years of expected cash flow at a high level. From 2017 through 2019, we believe we can generate cumulative adjusted free cash flow after CapEx approaching $6 billion. We expect to allocate roughly 2/3 of that $6 billion to a combination of M&A and share repurchases. As you're aware, the 2 most significant liabilities on our balance sheet are our IRS transfer pricing case and the mesh litigation. During the quarter, we took 2 important steps to manage these liabilities. First, we reached a stipulation of settled issues with the IRS for the 2001 to 2007 tax years. And importantly, this stipulation also provides a framework to settle the remaining years 2008 through 2015 as well. While there's work to do to conclude all the years, we are confident we will bring these to conclusion over the coming quarters. With the payment in 12 to 24 months, this would eliminate one of the most significant liabilities on our balance sheet. With regards to mesh, we increased our reserve by $608 million during the quarter. With the same goal of managing our liabilities, we've reached conditional or final settlements on 12,000 claims and made significant progress towards reaching agreement in principle on another 7,000 claims for a total of 19,000 claims. This represents approximately half of the roughly 40,000 known claims, and we expect to make even more progress during the remainder of 2016. As you know, every quarter, we assess all 4 key components involving calculating the reserve and make any necessary adjustments for all probable and estimable charges, including the volume of known claims, the estimated cost to resolve each claim, an estimate of future claims and the cost to defend each claim.
Our total legal reserve, of which mesh is included, was $2,375,000,000 as of June 30, 2016 and we believe it reflected our best estimate of what is probable and estimable. Of note as well, is that included in this reserve is the Mirowski Judgment which we have paid in full, subsequent to quarter end. So as of today, the reserve would be closer to $2 billion. As a reminder, this $2 billion includes a number of claims we have agreed in principle to settle but have not yet paid. Once those settlements are funded, the amount of the reserve will be adjusted accordingly.
Now I'll move on to interest expense. Interest expense for the quarter was $59 million, compared to $106 million in Q2 of last year. The decrease is primarily due to the pretax onetime charge of approximately $45 million associated with a senior note refinancing in Q2 of last year. Excluding this charge, Q2 2015 interest expense was $61 million. Our average interest expense rate was 4% in Q2 this year compared to 8% in Q2 last year. The lower interest-rate expense in Q2 of '16 was primarily due to lower average cost of debt resulting from the senior notes refinancing and the inclusion of the pretax onetime charge in Q2 of last year that I mentioned. Excluding this charge, Q2 2015 interest expense would have been 4.6%.
Our tax rate for the second quarter was 47.8% on a reported basis and 14.2% on an adjusted basis. As reported last week, we're pleased with the conditional settlement reached with the IRS council regarding our transfer pricing litigation, and plan to use some of the current benefit to repatriate overseas cash. Thus we continue to expect our full year 2016 adjusted tax rate to be approximately 14%. We believe this IRS settlement, in addition to recent progress we've made towards reaching agreements in principle to settle additional mesh claims, as I mentioned, are prudent actions to take in the management of our balance sheet.
Finally, Q2 2016 adjusted EPS of $0.27 includes approximately $0.015 of unfavorable FX and represents 25% year-over-year growth or 32% growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange. On a reported GAAP basis, Q2 2016 EPS was a loss of $0.15 and includes net charges and amortization expense totaling $580 million after tax.
Adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was $464 million compared to $406 million in Q2 of last year. Given the strong adjusted free cash flow generation in the first half of this year, we are raising our full year adjusted free cash flow guidance from $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion, which was formally our stretch goal. Achieving adjusted free cash flow of $1.6 billion would represent 17% growth, and we continue to pursue inventory management initiatives designed to improve the working capital contribution to cash flow.
In Q2, we used cash primarily to repay $250 million of bank term loans, as well as fund the previously agreed legal settlements. As of June 30, 2016, we had cash on hand of $438 million. Near term, our capital allocation priorities are to manage contingencies and pursue tuck-in M&A. 
We ended Q2 with 1,375,000,000 fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding. Consistent with our prior guidance, we expect our share count to increase by roughly 5 million per quarter through the end of 2016, as we plan to keep the buybacks suspended for the balance of this year. We expect this to result in a fully diluted weighted average share count of approximately 1,380,000,000 shares for full year 2016.
I'll now walk-through guidance for Q3 and full year 2016. For the full year, we now expect consolidated revenue to be in a range of $8,270,000,000 to $8,370,000,000, which represents year-over-year growth of 8% to 9% on an organic basis and 11% to 12% on both an operational and reported basis. As a result of a stronger dollar, at current rates, we expect foreign exchange to be a headwind of approximately $70 million for the full year 2016. 
Turning to adjusted EPS, we now expect full year 2016 adjusted EPS to be in a range of $1.07 to $1.11, representing 15% to 19% adjusted earnings growth. Our previous guidance assumed the unfavorable FX on full year adjusted EPS would be between $0.05 and $0.06. Given the fact that Q2 saw a slightly less unfavorable impact than expected, we now believe the full year impact will be closer to $0.05 which assumes $0.02 to $0.03 in the second half of this year. On a GAAP basis, we expect EPS to be in a range of $0.30 to $0.35.
Now turning to Q3 2016, we expect consolidated revenues to be in a range of $2,035,000,000 to $2,085,000,000. This represents year-over-year growth in a range of 7% to 9% organically and 8% to 10% operationally. We expect the foreign exchange headwind on Q3 revenue to be negligible. For the third year -- for the third quarter, adjusted EPS is expected to be in a range of $0.25 to $0.27 per share, and GAAP EPS is expected to be in a range of $0.13 to $0.15 per share.
Please check our Investor Relations website for Q2 2016 financial and operational highlights, which outlines Q2 results, as well as Q3 and full year 2016 guidance, including P&L line item guidance. So with that, I'll turn it back over to Susie, who'll moderate the Q&A."

We were ready for that launch for quite a while and the team -- our commercial team's did an excellent job executing it. So we think it's a very innovative product and long in coming. And the U.S. team, essentially, has did what the OUS teams have done with that product for a while. And now, structural heart, we continue to be really excited about the future for structural heart. It continues to be our largest investment area as a company. We were comfortable with the high-end of our guidance that we provided at $175 million to $200 million. We continued to invest long-term in R&D capabilities, clinical capabilities and commercial capabilities to prepare ourselves for the launch in the U.S. And we're really excited about the upcoming data that we expect to see in London Valves on our pacemaker rate with the addition of Lotus EDGE and Depth Guard. So it's really an important category for us. As you know, we continue to -- we outlined at Investor Day, back in, I think 2013 and '15, our focus to continue to grow in our core businesses and take share, which we're doing, and importantly, expand in the faster-growth markets.

The guidance range for Q3 and the full year is 71.5% to 72.5%, so it implies the uptick that you mentioned in the second half. I think the 2 key drivers of that are, the inventory charges for the CRM products related to the better uptake of MRI-safe brady and quad in the U.S. as well as the WATCHMAN FLX. We don't believe that those repeat themselves. And then secondly, we will get the full benefit in the second half of the lower manufacturing costs that we have for 2016 standards because we'll now be selling all the inventory at the new standards, and we'll have sold off all of the inventory at last year's standards. Those are the 2 main drivers that put us back in the 71.5% to 72.5% range. FX, we actually assume is probably somewhat in the same range as where it was in Q2. That's really the reason. If you think back to last quarter, our guidance for FX in gross margin would have implied about 70 to 75 basis points each quarter for Qs 2, 3 and 4. Now it's 120. So that's a 50 basis point difference. And that's the reason why the guidance for the full year came from 72% to 73% to 71.5% to 72.5%."

It's really an incredibly high performing business and it has been for a number of years. And they really have just continue to do -- continue to grow and expand. So our endo business enjoys, a, first of all, a strong market, a bit fewer competitors in our Endoscopy markets than some of our others. It has very strong growth profile in terms of the market growth in OUS expansion, and we are a very strong category leader. Across the globe, when we continue to expand into emerging markets. The portfolio is really driving a lot of the launch out of the success that you're seeing in 2016, led by our SpyGlass digital DS platform, which is driving solid double-digit growth and helps pull through the core portfolio. We also launched a product called the AXIOS Stents, which is doing very well, as well as a hemostasis clip. So the portfolio cadence for endo is very strong, it's very well-led, it's very globally oriented, and they also do a great job of laying out the economic value proposition for hospitals beyond the portfolio. So they continue to perform very well and intentionally, some of my comments with Mike in his first question, we're intentionally focusing on investing greater in faster-growth markets, in faster growth businesses and they represent 40% of our operating income, the MedSurg sector does now for BSC. So more to come there. DES is doing excellent. We had a few critics early on in our launch saying we weren't be an aggressive enough. We signaled all along that we're going to be -- drive an appropriate premium price for this product because we believe it is the best product available in the marketplace and the data is proving that out, and maybe Keith can comment in a minute. So we believe it's the premium product. We do offer a premium price for it. And so we've been smart in our rollout of it, and I think physicians and customers are seeing the value of the ease-of-use and the clinical data synergy and we expect the U.S. penetration to be probably above 50%, closer to 50% to 60% in the U.S. in 2016. And we continue to roll that out globally. So the team is doing a nice job there. But again, it's part of the overall story in interventional cardiology. Again pointing to faster growth segments, our DES is doing well. A lot of investments in complex coronary and imaging, which are part of the portfolio, and then clearly our structural heart. So Kevin Ballinger and the team are doing a nice job."

So the revenue is $170 million higher at the midpoint of guidance and that breaks down into 3 things: $20 million comes from FX, $75 million comes from revenue that already came in Q2, and then $75 million comes in the second half. I think the main factor that's offsetting that is, if you look at our R&D rate, our R&D rate in the first half was 10.5%. And looking at the second half, it's going to be 11.5% to get to the full year rate of 11%. So that's 100 basis point increase in R&D, largely related to the timing in the investments in structural heart that Mike had mentioned. So that for, the most part, offsets the additional flow through in the revenue that you get -- the additional $75 million of revenue you get in the second half."

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. With me on today's call are Mike Mahoney, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Dan Brennan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
We issued a press release earlier this morning announcing our Q2 2016 results, which included reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in the release. 
We have posted a copy of that release as well as reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in today's call to the Investor Relations section of our website under the heading Financial Information.

We continue to beat our long-range strategic plan goals and execute very well as a global team. The success of our category leadership strategy is helping us gain share in our core markets, expanding the faste",2113,"Thank you, Susie, and good morning, everyone. We continue to beat our long-range strategic plan goals and execute very well as a global team. The success of our category leadership strategy is helping us gain share in our core markets, expanding the faster growth adjacencies and deliver solutions that address unmet clinical needs. Our consistent results continue to demonstrate that Boston Scientific is uniquely positioned to deliver differentiated long-term shareholder value. With long term visibility to mid-single digit organic revenue growth, complemented by ongoing operating margin improvement initiatives, our goal is to consistently drive double-digit adjusted EPS growth.
We're very excited about our excellent second quarter performance, first half results, and most importantly, our plans for the future. In Q2, we drove total operational revenue growth of 16% and organic revenue growth of 10%, excluding the impact of the AMS Urology acquisition. We had strong results across all regions, and 5 of our 7 business units grew revenue double digits organically. We leveraged that revenue growth to drive adjusted operating income growth of 22%, resulting in an adjusted operating margin of 23.4% and 130 basis point improvement year-over-year.
We delivered adjusted EPS of $0.27, achieving the high end of guidance and representing 25% growth, including the negative $0.015 impact from foreign currency. So given our strong performance, we are increasing our 2016 guidance for revenue and adjusted EPS. We're are increasing our full year organic revenue growth guidance from 6% to 8% to 8% to 9%, full year operational revenue growth guidance, which includes the benefit of AMS, is increased from 9% to 11% to 11% to 12%. We're maintaining our full year adjusted operating margin guidance of 24% to 24.5%, which at the midpoint is roughly 200 basis points of improvement over 2015. We're also increasing our adjusted EPS guidance by $0.01 over our prior range to $1.07 to $1.11, which represents 15% and 19% growth. Importantly, this adjusted EPS guidance includes an expected $0.05 negative impact from foreign exchange.
I'll now provide some highlights on Q2 results and our '16 outlook. In my remarks, all references to growth are in a constant currency organic year-over-year basis, and they exclude the benefit of AMS. Our second quarter revenue growth of 10% was broad based across businesses and regions, led again by exciting new product launches, continued global expansion and execution of our category leadership strategy. We drove double-digit growth in 5 businesses: endo, urology public-health, Neuromodulation, Interventional Cardiology and Peripheral Interventions. In addition, each region accelerated sequentially. The U.S. grew 8%; Europe, grew 9%; Asia PAC delivered 16% growth, with every major country in the Asia Pac region up double digits this quarter. The emerging markets also continued to deliver. Sales grew 20%, including China revenue at 21%. 
Our MedSurg businesses, endo, Urology public health and Neuromodulation, continue to be a priority focus area for the company, and each of the businesses maintained or accelerated growth from first quarter. These 3 businesses represent 40% of our operating income in the second quarter and they delivered adjusted operating margin of 32.8%. This is up 20 basis points sequentially and 240 basis points year-over-year. Our global Endoscopy team continues to perform at a high level with the revenue growing 11% in the second quarter. We continue to see strong growth in our core endo business, supported by our innovative portfolio and broad-based global expansion initiatives. Key endo growth drivers include the single-use SpyGlass DS Visualization System, the AXIOS Stent for drainage of pancreatic fluid and our next-generation hemostasis clip, the Resolution 360. High single-digit growth in U.S. endo was complemented by double-digit growth in every region outside the U.S., as we continue to develop commercial and position-training abilities in emerging markets and add focus in pulmonary, which helped drive 25% growth in BT, bronchial thermoplasty, led by the U.S., Japan and China. 
In Urology and public health, our investments to become the clear market leader and category leader have been rewarded, as growth excluding AMS accelerated to 18%. The business is performing at a high-level across the various regions and segments, including kidney stone, BPH, ED and surg gyn. Our global commercial footprint and focus on physician education has helped us to convert a meaningful portion of the market opportunity created by a STORZ's exit from the market at the end of March. 
AMS sales strength in the quarter and importantly, remediation and integration efforts remain on track. An exciting new growth platform in our urology business is the launch of a LithoVue platform. LithoVue is an innovative single-use digital scope for treatment of kidney stones that provide customers with enhanced visualization and navigation capabilities. LithoVue resonates with physicians and hospitals due to less OR downtime for sterile processing of reusable scopes. Performance navigation characteristics that allow physicians to tackle tougher procedures and the ability to schedule full day of procedures without the fear of cancellation due to reusable scopes being down.
In Neuromodulation, we continue to invest in the fast-growing microelectronics market, where we enjoy innovation and supply chain leverage between our CRM and neuromod business. Neuromodulation revenues grew in the quarter to 12% -- grew 12%. Sales were driven by the U.S. market-leading Spectra platform; the launch of Precision montage, which offers full body MRI capability; and our Vercise Deep Brain Stimulation platform. Our U.S. DBS trial continues to progress, and we expect to launch in the U.S. in the first quarter of 2018. Additionally, earlier this week, we announced the acquisition of Cosman Medical, a technology leader in the field of radiofrequency ablation systems for the treatment of chronic pain. This acquisition broadens our neuromodulation portfolio and is highly synergistic with our U.S. commercial team. We're excited to offer physicians treating patients with chronic pain another non-opioid therapeutic option earlier in the treatment continuum.
Now turning to Cardiovascular, which includes our peripheral and Interventional Cardiology businesses. Overall, this segment grew sales 13% in the quarter and delivered adjusted operating margin of 32.2%, up more than 170 basis points year-over-year. Our peripheral business delivered exceptional results with strong global sales across all regions fueled by an innovative portfolio. Sales grew 14% on strong results across all regions and segments, including stents, thrombectomy and our emerging drug-eluting portfolio. We also delivered strong growth in Interventional Oncology, where the integration of Interventional Radiology business of CeloNova remains on track. In our Venous segment, we continue to see very strong demand for our Zelante deep vein thrombosis system. We are the only company that have been leading drug-eluting technology globally on multiple platforms in order to treat complex, peripheral vascular disease. The Eluvia peripheral drug-eluting stent ID trial called IMPERIAL is on track to complete enrollment by yearend 2016. 
In Interventional Cardiology, we are focused on gaining share in our core businesses while expanding in faster growth segments that leverage our capabilities. This strategy is working. In the second quarter, interventional cardiology grew 12% led by a structural heart, drug-eluting stents and PCI guidance. SYNERGY had an excellent quarter, as we grew DES sales 9%. SYNERGY is now the market-leading premium DES platform and it's on track to represent 50% to 60% of our U.S. DES revenue mix by the end of 2016. PCI guidance grew mid-teens and continues share gains in intravascular ultrasound, and we're encouraged by strong early feedback on the ease-of-use of our COMET fractional flow reserve system. Our leading portfolio of solutions for complex high-risk PCI of patients also contributed to global growth.
The 12% IT revenue growth was fueled by our strength in the structural heart business, which includes our Lotus transcatheter aortic valve and WATCHMAN Left Atrial Appendage Closure. We believe we are well-positioned to drive long-term growth in these 2 fast-growing markets via our differentiated platforms and expanded capabilities. We also aim to deliver at the high-end of our 2016 Structural OR guidance range of $175 million to $200 million.
Our Lotus Valve continues to gain share in Europe, and we are investing significantly in clinical studies, R&D and our global supply chain to develop our capabilities further. We remain on track to launch Lotus EDGE at PCR London Valves in September. The Lotus EDGE delivery system features a 14 French expandable sheet called iSleeve and is designed for more flexibility and simplified deployment. It also offers our new Depth Guard technology, which limits the depth of the valve in the left ventricular outflow tract. Lotus also offers best-in-class paravalvular leakage rates, and we aim to enhance Lotus with studies to demonstrate improved permanent pacemaker rates with Lotus EDGE and Depth Guard. So our goal is to provide initial Lotus EDGE data at PCR London Valves. We do expect a slight delay in our expanded Lotus Valve matrix in Europe, with a 21-millimeter valve estimated CE Mark timing first quarter '17, and the 29-millimeter valve in Europe in mid-2017. We continue to invest and plan for a U.S. launch with the Lotus EDGE platform in late 2017.
Also in structural heart, WATCHMAN sales were strong on procedure growth and new account openings. We are developing additional WATCHMAN capabilities in field clinical support, market development and physician training courses. Implant success rates and patient outcomes remain very high as evidenced by the 98.5% success rate in the evolution registry detailed at HRS in May.
We continue to expand WATCHMAN in the new markets and we're pleased with the recent reimbursement approval and launch in France. Importantly, the unique clinical benefits of WATCHMAN are being rewarded, as evidenced by the French reimbursement at a meaningful premium to competitive LAAC devices.
We post a limited market release of our next generation WATCHMAN FLX device. We've have decided to pursue design enhancements before we turn in the next-gen platform to market. Importantly, we anticipate this delay will have no impact on our current WATCHMAN product and thus, no change to our market outlook for LAAC.
Rhythm Management sales increased 5% in the quarter and delivered adjusted operating margin of 16.9%, up 200 basis points year-over-year, as improving profitability remains a core focus.
In CRM, we improved our global performance and delivered 4% growth in second quarter. Our European and Asia PAC CRM businesses continue to grow faster than the market, offset by slower growth in U.S. CRM. Pacemaker sales grew 15% globally, with excellent U.S. performance fueled by our ACCOLADE MRI launch, and growth from our X4 CRT-P quad device. Worldwide ICD sales were flat as we delivered above-market growth internationally that was offset by weaker sales in the U.S. In the U.S., we faced some near-term headwinds due to our tachy MRI product gap and replacement cycle headwinds. However, we recently we earned FDA approval of our ACUITY X4 quad CRT lead and the early results are promising. Importantly, EMBLEM S-ICD is a key differentiator, and growth continues to accelerate globally. We continue to expand global S-ICD utilization with more long-term data from the EFFORTLESS Registry, growing physician implant experience, geographic expansion and the recent second quarter of '16 EU launch at EMBLEM MRI, which contributed to our solid international growth.
Due to a change in protocol of our U.S. enabled MRI clinical trial, we are revising our goal for transvenous tachy MRI U.S. approval by year-end 2017, but continue to expect to gain MRI labeling for both new and previously implanted ICDs and CRT-Ds with a new timeline. The continued cadence of data proving the superiority of EnduraLife batteries and the pending FDA approval of EMBLEM MRI S-ICD, which is expected in third quarter, will help us offset the near-term headwinds from the U.S. MRI high-voltage segment.
In the second quarter, European CRM sales grew 5%, representing 9 straight quarters of above-market growth, giving us further confidence in our long-term CRM outlook. Our EP business grew 6% in second quarter and we're encouraged by double-digit growth in Europe, led by new arrhythmia installs and the recent launches of Nitinol OI and IntellaTip MiFi OI ablation catheters. The U.S. launch in late first quarter of the Blazer OI catheter will be augmented in Q3 with the upcoming launch of the nav-enabled version of this catheter. 
So to wrap up, our company delivered another excellent quarter. Our second quarter performance reflects the strength of our global team, the depth and breadth of our portfolio, our globalization efforts and our ongoing investments in the faster growth markets. Importantly, we believe we are well-positioned to deliver continued strong results in the second half of '16 and beyond. I really want to thank our employees globally for their winning spirit and their strong commitment to Boston Scientific.
Now let me turn the call over to Dan for a more detailed review of our financial results."

The strong adjusted EPS growth p",1909,"Thanks, Mike. In Q2, we generated organic revenue growth of 10% versus our 6% to 8% guidance range, and adjusted EPS of $0.27, representing 25% year-over-year growth in the high-end of our guidance range of $0.25 to $0.27. The strong adjusted EPS growth performance in Q2 was driven primarily by revenue growth upside and a lower SG&A rate versus prior year. And given the strong performance in the first half of 2016, we are again raising full year guidance for revenue growth and adjusted EPS. Consolidated revenue of $2,126,000,000 represented operational revenue growth of 16%, exceeding the high end of guidance and excludes the impact of a $24 million headwind from foreign exchange, which was in line with guidance. Excluding an approximate 500 basis point contribution from the AMS male urology portfolio acquisition, organic revenue growth was 10% in the quarter and 15% on an as-reported basis.
Adjusted gross margin for the second quarter was 70.7%, decreasing 60 basis points year-over-year and unfortunately, 130 basis points below the midpoint of Q2 guidance due to a few factors that I will detail. The year-over-year decrease is due to the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange, which was a 120 basis point headwind, as well as costs related to our new Malaysia manufacturing plant, the AMS integration, including the AMS quality remediation expense. Compared to guidance, the shortfall is due to inventory charges in advance of new product launches, inventory write-offs related to WATCHMAN FLX and more unfavorable FX.
We now expect Q3 and full year 2016 adjusted gross margin to be in the range of a 71.5% to 72.5%, which includes an expected 75 to 100 basis point of unfavorable foreign exchange. A key element in the second half increase is lower expected inventory charges, and we will also benefit fully from the lower 2016 standard cost of our products as we will have sold through all of the inventory valued at last year's higher standards. Adjusted SG&A expenses were $763 million or 35.9% of sales in Q2, down 140 basis points year-over-year. We continue to believe our full year rate will be between 35.5% and 36.5%, which at the midpoint would be a 140 basis point improvement compared to last year.
Adjusted research and development expenses were $222 million in the second quarter or 10.4% of sales, which is down 50 basis points year-over-year. As a result of a slightly lower R&D rate in the first half, we expect our full year 2016 adjusted R&D rate to be between 10.5% and 11.5% of sales or 50 basis points lower than prior guidance. Royalty expense was 0.9% of sales in Q2, roughly flat year-over-year. Our Q2 2016 adjusted operating margin of 23.4% was in line with our guidance and represents a 130 basis point improvement over Q2 last year, which marks the eighth consecutive quarter in which we will have expanded adjusted operating margin by 100 basis points or more.
As a reminder, we've signaled a sequential decrease in adjusted operating margin from Q1's rate as we experienced the usual increase in SG&A from Q1 to Q2 due to seasonal trade show activity and began to ramp reinvestment of the medical device excise tax suspension. Our first half 2016 adjusted operating margin of 24.2% positions us well to achieve our full year adjusted operating margin guidance of 24% to 24.5%, and we remain on track to reach 25%-plus in 2017.
Q2 adjusted operating income grew 22% year-over-year, with all 3 reportable segments expanding adjusted operating margin by at least 170 basis points over Q2 2015. Specific to Rhythm Management, the team delivered an adjusted operating margin of 16.9%, up 280 basis points year-over-year. In the second half of 2016, we expect Rhythm Management adjusted operating margin to continue to improve and be 18% to 19%. This second half gain is expected to result from realizing the full benefit of 2016 product costs, leveraging the improved top line performance expected of the global CRM and EP businesses, and we continue to believe Rhythm management is on track to deliver an adjusted operating margin of 20% in 2017.
Turning to the balance sheet, we had some key developments in the quarter that helped reduce future uncertainties. Before I get into the details of the activity in the quarter, let me try to frame out the next 3 years of expected cash flow at a high level. From 2017 through 2019, we believe we can generate cumulative adjusted free cash flow after CapEx approaching $6 billion. We expect to allocate roughly 2/3 of that $6 billion to a combination of M&A and share repurchases. As you're aware, the 2 most significant liabilities on our balance sheet are our IRS transfer pricing case and the mesh litigation. During the quarter, we took 2 important steps to manage these liabilities. First, we reached a stipulation of settled issues with the IRS for the 2001 to 2007 tax years. And importantly, this stipulation also provides a framework to settle the remaining years 2008 through 2015 as well. While there's work to do to conclude all the years, we are confident we will bring these to conclusion over the coming quarters. With the payment in 12 to 24 months, this would eliminate one of the most significant liabilities on our balance sheet. With regards to mesh, we increased our reserve by $608 million during the quarter. With the same goal of managing our liabilities, we've reached conditional or final settlements on 12,000 claims and made significant progress towards reaching agreement in principle on another 7,000 claims for a total of 19,000 claims. This represents approximately half of the roughly 40,000 known claims, and we expect to make even more progress during the remainder of 2016. As you know, every quarter, we assess all 4 key components involving calculating the reserve and make any necessary adjustments for all probable and estimable charges, including the volume of known claims, the estimated cost to resolve each claim, an estimate of future claims and the cost to defend each claim.
Our total legal reserve, of which mesh is included, was $2,375,000,000 as of June 30, 2016 and we believe it reflected our best estimate of what is probable and estimable. Of note as well, is that included in this reserve is the Mirowski Judgment which we have paid in full, subsequent to quarter end. So as of today, the reserve would be closer to $2 billion. As a reminder, this $2 billion includes a number of claims we have agreed in principle to settle but have not yet paid. Once those settlements are funded, the amount of the reserve will be adjusted accordingly.
Now I'll move on to interest expense. Interest expense for the quarter was $59 million, compared to $106 million in Q2 of last year. The decrease is primarily due to the pretax onetime charge of approximately $45 million associated with a senior note refinancing in Q2 of last year. Excluding this charge, Q2 2015 interest expense was $61 million. Our average interest expense rate was 4% in Q2 this year compared to 8% in Q2 last year. The lower interest-rate expense in Q2 of '16 was primarily due to lower average cost of debt resulting from the senior notes refinancing and the inclusion of the pretax onetime charge in Q2 of last year that I mentioned. Excluding this charge, Q2 2015 interest expense would have been 4.6%.
Our tax rate for the second quarter was 47.8% on a reported basis and 14.2% on an adjusted basis. As reported last week, we're pleased with the conditional settlement reached with the IRS council regarding our transfer pricing litigation, and plan to use some of the current benefit to repatriate overseas cash. Thus we continue to expect our full year 2016 adjusted tax rate to be approximately 14%. We believe this IRS settlement, in addition to recent progress we've made towards reaching agreements in principle to settle additional mesh claims, as I mentioned, are prudent actions to take in the management of our balance sheet.
Finally, Q2 2016 adjusted EPS of $0.27 includes approximately $0.015 of unfavorable FX and represents 25% year-over-year growth or 32% growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange. On a reported GAAP basis, Q2 2016 EPS was a loss of $0.15 and includes net charges and amortization expense totaling $580 million after tax.
Adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was $464 million compared to $406 million in Q2 of last year. Given the strong adjusted free cash flow generation in the first half of this year, we are raising our full year adjusted free cash flow guidance from $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion, which was formally our stretch goal. Achieving adjusted free cash flow of $1.6 billion would represent 17% growth, and we continue to pursue inventory management initiatives designed to improve the working capital contribution to cash flow.
In Q2, we used cash primarily to repay $250 million of bank term loans as well as fund the previously agreed legal settlements. As of June 30, 2016, we had cash on hand of $438 million. Near term, our capital allocation priorities are to manage contingencies and pursue tuck-in M&A. 
We ended Q2 with 1,375,000,000 fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding. Consistent with our prior guidance, we expect our share count to increase by roughly 5 million per quarter through the end of 2016, as we plan to keep the buybacks suspended for the balance of this year. We expect this to result in a fully diluted weighted average share count of approximately 1,380,000,000 shares for full year 2016.
I'll now walk-through guidance for Q3 and full year 2016. For the full year, we now expect consolidated revenue to be in a range of $8,270,000,000 to $8,370,000,000, which represents year-over-year growth of 8% to 9% on an organic basis and 11% to 12% on both an operational and reported basis. As a result of a stronger dollar, at current rates, we expect foreign exchange to be a headwind of approximately $70 million for the full year 2016. 
Turning to adjusted EPS, we now expect full year 2016 adjusted EPS to be in a range of $1.07 to $1.11, representing 15% to 19% adjusted earnings growth. Our previous guidance assumed the unfavorable FX on full year adjusted EPS would be between $0.05 and $0.06. Given the fact that Q2 saw a slightly less unfavorable impact than expected, we now believe the full year impact will be closer to $0.05 which assumes $0.02 to $0.03 in the second half of this year. On a GAAP basis, we expect EPS to be in a range of $0.30 to $0.35.
Now turning to Q3 2016, we expect consolidated revenues to be in a range of $2,035,000,000 to $2,085,000,000. This represents year-over-year growth in a range of 7% to 9% organically and 8% to 10% operationally. We expect the foreign exchange headwind on Q3 revenue to be negligible. For the third year -- for the third quarter, adjusted EPS is expected to be in a range of $0.25 to $0.27 per share, and GAAP EPS is expected to be in a range of $0.13 to $0.15 per share.
Please check our Investor Relations website for Q2 2016 financial and operational highlights, which outlines Q2 results, as well as Q3 and full year 2016 guidance, including P&L line item guidance. So with that, I'll turn it back over to Susie, who'll moderate the Q&A."

We were ready for that launch for quite a while and the team -- our commercial team's did an excellent job executing it. So we think it's a very innovative product and long in coming. And the U.S. team, essentially, has did what the OUS teams have done with that product for a while. And now structural heart, we continue to be really excited about the future for structural heart. It continues to be our largest investment area as a company. We were comfortable with the high-end of our guidance that we provided at $175 million to $200 million. We continued to invest long-term in R&D capabilities, clinical capabilities and commercial capabilities to prepare ourselves for the launch in the U.S. And we're really excited about the upcoming data that we expect to see in London Valves on our pacemaker rate with the addition of Lotus EDGE and Depth Guard. So it's really an important category for us. As you know, we continue to -- we outlined at Investor Day, back in, I think 2013 and '15, our focus to continue to grow in our core businesses and take share, which we're doing, and importantly, expand in the faster-growth markets.

I think the 2 key drivers of that are, the inventory charges for the CRM products related to the better uptake of MRI-safe brady and quad in the U.S. as well as the WATCHMAN FLX. We don't believe that those repeat themselves. And then secondly, we will get the full benefit in the second half of the lower manufacturing costs that we have for 2016 standards because we'll now be selling all the inventory at the new standards, and we'll have sold off all of the inventory at last year's standards. Those are the 2 main drivers that put us back in the 71.5% to 72.5% range. FX, we actually assume is probably somewhat in the same range as where it was in Q2. That's really the reason. If you think back to last quarter, our guidance for FX in gross margin would have implied about 70 to 75 basis points each quarter for Qs 2, 3 and 4. Now it's 120. So that's a 50 basis point difference. And that's the reason why the guidance for the full year came from 72% to 73% to 71.5% to 72.5%."

So our goal next year is 25%-plus, and as we've given guidance for long-term goals for 27% to 28% by 2020, the combination of those 2 factors and the CapEx, I think, gets you a long way there. And then the other piece is that, we're going to continue to try from a working capital perspective to make that be our friend.

It has very strong growth profile in terms of the market growth in OUS expansion, and we are a very strong category leader. Across the globe, when we continue to expand into emerging markets. The portfolio is really driving a lot of the launch out of the success that you're seeing in 2016, led by our SpyGlass digital DS platform, which is driving solid double-digit growth and helps pull through the core portfolio. We also launched a product called the AXIOS Stents, which is doing very well as well as a hemostasis clip. So the portfolio cadence for endo is very strong, it's very well-led, it's very globally oriented, and they also do a great job of laying out the economic value proposition for hospitals beyond the portfolio. So they continue to perform very well and intentionally, some of my comments with Mike in his first question, we're intentionally focusing on investing greater in faster-growth markets, in faster growth businesses and they represent 40% of our operating income, the MedSurg sector does now for BSC. So more to come there. DES is doing excellent. We had a few critics early on in our launch saying we weren't be an aggressive enough. We signaled all along that we're going to be -- drive an appropriate premium price for this product because we believe it is the best product available in the marketplace and the data is proving that out, and maybe Keith can comment in a minute. So we believe it's the premium product. We do offer a premium price for it. And so we've been smart in our rollout of it, and I think physicians and customers are seeing the value of the ease-of-use and the clinical data synergy and we expect the U.S. penetration to be probably above 50%, closer to 50% to 60% in the U.S. in 2016. And we continue to roll that out globally. So the team is doing a nice job there. But again, it's part of the overall story in interventional cardiology. Again pointing to faster growth segments, our DES is doing well. A lot of investments in complex coronary and imaging, which are part of the portfolio, and then clearly our structural heart.

So that's 100 basis point increase in R&D, largely related to the timing in the investments in structural heart that Mike had mentioned. So that for, the most part, offsets the additional flow through in the revenue that you get -- the additional $75 million of revenue you get in the second half."

So we feel like we're in a position of strength in terms of our product portfolio, and you know we continue to look at DBS. It's an interesting technology, and we've got a number of bets and it's a fact in the future. We can look at a second gen or a third generation device, then we'll eventually bring that to market.

With me on today's call are Mike Mahoney, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Dan Brennan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
We issued a press release earlier this morning announcing our Q3 2016 results, which included reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in the release. We have posted a copy of that release as well as reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in today's call to the Investor Relations section of our website under the heading, Financial Information.
The duration of this morning's call will be up to 1 hour. Mike will provide strategic and revenue highlights of Q3 '16. Dan will review the financials for the quarter and then Q4 '16 and full year guidance, and then we'll take your questions. During today's Q&A session, Mike and Dan will be joined by our Chief Medical Officers, Dr. Keith Dawkins and Dr. Ken Stein. 
Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that on the call, organic revenue growth is defined as excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and sales from the acquisition of the American Medical Systems, AMS, Male Urology portfolio over the prior year period. Also of note, this call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws, which may be identified by words like anticipate, expect, believe, estimates and other similar words. They include, among other things, statements about our growth and market share; new product approvals and launches; clinical trials; cost savings and growth opportunities; our cash flow and expected use; our financial performance, including sales, margins, earnings and other Q4 2016 guidance; as well as our tax rates, R&D spend and other expenses. Actual results may differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that may cause such differences include those described in the Risk Factors section of our most recent 10-K and subsequent 10-Qs filed with the SEC.These statements speak only as of today's date, and we disclaim any intention or obligation to update them.
At this point, I'll turn it over to Mike for his comments. Mike?"
317627,403595084,1061269,"Boston Scientific Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2016",2016-10-26,"Earnings Calls","Boston Scientific Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Susie. Good morning, everyone. Our third quarter 2016 results are excellent and reinforces success of our category leadership strategy and the strong execution of our global teams. We continue to grow faster than the market in most or all of ou",1821,"Thank you, Susie. Good morning, everyone. Our third quarter 2016 results are excellent and reinforces success of our category leadership strategy and the strong execution of our global teams. We continue to grow faster than the market in most or all of our business units while consistently improving operating income margin. As a result, we continue to deliver strong double-digit adjusted EPS growth. 
Importantly, we are investing in new adjacencies, capabilities and end markets that position Boston Scientific for very exciting future. In third quarter '16 we drove operational growth of 10% and organic revenue growth of 9%, normalized for currency and excluding the impact of 1 month of sales of the AMS acquisition, which anniversary-ed on August 3. Of note, we delivered this 9% organic growth against our toughest comparison of the year. And we leveraged that growth with 120 basis point equipment year-over-year in adjusted operating margin of 24.3%, which beat the high end of our guidance range by 30 basis points. 9% organic revenue growth in the quarter was leveraged to 12% EPS growth or $0.27 per share, which was at the high end of guidance range. For the full year '16, we're maintaining our strong guidance and point the low end of our ranges, and Dan will provide the details in a few minutes.
I'll now provide some highlights on Q3 results and our Q4 '16 outlook. In my remarks, all references of growth are at constant currency organic year-over-year basis, and they exclude the 1 month benefit of AMS unless otherwise specified. Organic revenue growth of 9% was broad-based across our businesses and regions with particular strength from new global product launches, emerging market expansion and share gains led by innovation and our category leadership strategy. On a regional basis EMEA led the pack with 12% growth, followed by the U.S. at 9% and Europe at 5%. Emerging markets sales grew 19%, led by an acceleration in growth in China at 26% and Latin America turning strong quarter with 21% growth. 
Across our businesses for the third straight quarter, both our cardiovascular and MedSurg segments grew sales organically double digits, 12% for cardiovascular and 10% for MedSurg. and Rhythm Management strong and consistent performance with second quarter sales up 3%. MedSurg continue to deliver growth and strong profitability. MedSurg remains a high priority segment for the company, with 2 recent tuck-in acquisition to enhance category leadership in neuromodulation in our and Endoscopy with the recently announced tender offer for EndoChoice. 9% global growth in Endoscopy was led by double-digit gains in both our Biliary and hemostasis franchises, with Spyglass digital DS and the AXIOS stent leading the charge in Biliary, and our newly launched Resolution 360 clip is driving growth in hemostasis. We continue to see upside from new product launches and strong emerging market growth in endo. 
We're also excited about the acquisition of EndoChoice, which we expect to close by year-end. EndoChoice is focused on the development of innovative products and services for gastroenterology health care providers, with a portfolio that's particularly well suited for the ambulatory surgery center. It also brings a portfolio of value-added services to the ASC market, including infection control and pathology services. This acquisition will further enhance the position of Boston Scientific as the global leader in the field of GI endoscopy. As previously announced, we expect to pursue strategic options for EndoChoice's  FUSE colonoscope business. We plan to provide an update at or around the time of closing of this transaction.
Turning to Urology and Pelvic Health. Uro and Pelvic Health grew double digits for the third consecutive quarter, up 13% in Q3. We're a strong category leader in the Urology segment, and we delivered broad-based growth across the combined Boston Scientific and AMS portfolio. International sales remained very strong with EMEA, Latin America and emerging markets all growing at double-digit rates. AMS sales grew 5% in the quarter, which is a nice acceleration from trend prior to acquisition. And importantly, our remediation and integration efforts are both on track.
Our Lithovue single-use ureteroscope continues to launch and is enjoying strong uptake in a variety of accounts. And finally, our growth was assisted by tailwinds from our market share capture post Astora's exit from the pelvic health market. 
Neuromod grew double digits, plus 12%, against a strong comp and robust Precision Spectra sales now with full-body MRI compatibility in our Vercise Deep Brain Stimulation platform in Europe. We continue to expect U.S. market entry for Vercise by late 2017 and believe this is an exciting new market opportunity for us.
Cosman Medical, an acquisition announced in July, broadens our Neuromodulation portfolio with RF ablation systems that enable us to offer patients with chronic pain another treatment option in non-opioid therapeutics. We will provide an update on our ACCELERATE clinical trial on our fourth quarter 2016 call. 
In Cardiovascular, segment sales grew 12% and reported an adjusted operating margin of 32.8%, up 160 basis points year-over-year. Peripheral Interventions revenue grew 11% and was led by strong balanced global growth in developed and emerging markets. This is PI's fourth straight quarter of double-digit above-market growth, fueled by our leadership -- category leadership strategy and the depth of our portfolio rather than any single product. 
We drove strong growth in the atherectomy and thrombectomy businesses, and new product launches are also going very well, including the AngioJet ZelanteDVT catheter; the Innova vascular stent; and our drug-eluting technologies, Eluvia DES and Ranger DCB. Finally, we're also pleased with the contribution and integration progress of the Spherical Embolics platform acquired from CeloNova. 
We continue to invest in the peripheral market, particularly in drug-eluting strategies, venous diseases and interventional oncology. Two important clinical trials were presented in the third quarter at the major European peripheral congresses, CIRSE. Our drug-eluting stent, Eluvia, in the MAJESTIC clinical trial demonstrated an unprecedented 92.5% freedom from total lesion revascularization at 2 years. And enrollment continues in our global IDE trial, IMPERIAL. This 92.5% freedom from TLR is of particular note given the patient population studied. 65% of patients had severely calcified lesions and 46% had chronic total occlusions. 
In addition, we reported results for our Ranger Drug-Coated Balloon from 105-patient randomized clinical trial studying the superficial femoral artery. With 94.4% freedom from total lesion revascularization at 6 months, average lesion length was 68 millimeters. We also posted strong results from our Ranger all-comers registry with 91.9% freedom from TLR at 6 months and an average lesion length of 135 millimeters. 
We plan to bring our Ranger DCB to the U.S., and we'll reveal details of our IDE trial shortly. We're excited to be the only company investing in a complete portfolio of drug-eluting therapies.
Turning to Interventional Cardiology. This business segment grew 13% in Q3, led by strong sales in structural heart, drug-eluting stents and PCI guidance or imaging. SYNERGY continues to penetrate the market as we grew worldwide DES sales 14%, and we remain on track to represent 50% to 60% of our global DES revenue mix by the end of fourth quarter. PCI guidance grew mid-teens as well, with strong IVUS catheter and service sales augmented by the ongoing global launch of our COMET FFR system. 
In structural heart, which includes our Lotus transcatheter aortic valve and WATCHMAN Left Atrial Appendage Closure Device, we're driving growth via our unique innovative platform technologies, and they're resonating with physicians and are supported by the strength of our commercial teams. Both franchises are performing very well, and we continue to expect to deliver structural heart revenue at the high end of our $175 million to $200 million guidance for 2016.
We also recently began the early launch of our Lotus EDGE valve in Europe, and thus, the results from our feasibility study of Lotus EDGE will be presented this Sunday at a lunchtime symposium at TCT. Also at TCT next week, we look forward to a number of Lotus presentations, including 4-year outcomes on REPRISE I, 3-year outcomes for REPRISE II and our Lotus EDGE feasibility study with a 7-day discharge data. We expect to present results of REPRISE III, our U.S. pivotal trial and the first to provide head-to-head data, at EuroPCR in May. 
The WATCHMAN platform also delivered an exciting quarter, with strong growth from opening new centers as well as driving growth in existing centers. We're very encouraged to see a strong initial launch in France, where we received higher reimbursement to peers based on the strength of our data. And we expect to enroll our first patient in ASP II [ph] , which is a study examining the use of WATCHMAN in warfarin-ineligible patients before the end of the year.
Turning now to Rhythm Management. Segment sales grew 3%, with another impressive gain in the adjusted operating margins of 20.1%, which is 320 basis points quarter-over-quarter and a 230 basis points growth year-over-year. Growth in CRM at 3% was above market and led by worldwide patient growth of 22%, with meaningful share capture from our premium-based brady MRI device. High-voltage sales declined 4% globally due to replacement cycle headwinds and competitive pressures in the U.S. and MRI-compatible tachy devices. We continue to be pleased with the growth and momentum of EMBLEM S-ICD, which has been fueled by a recent FDA approval for both MRI and MRI-backwards compatibility and increased physician acceptance of this differentiated therapy. 
In Europe, our CRM business grew above market for the 10th consecutive quarter, and in Japan, our above-market growth was driven by a strong launch of EMBLEM S-ICD, transvenous tachy MRI and 3.0T brady MRI. We also achieved important CRM clinical milestones in the quarter, including the first patients enrolled in the APPRAISE ATP trial to help clinicians understand which ICD patients could benefit from antitachycardia pacing and which may be harmed. 
Also, our MultiSENSE trial is accepted as a late breaker for the upcoming AHA scientific sessions in New Orleans. MultiSENSE is an international multicenter, non-randomized study, which is designed to develop and to evaluate prospectively a multi-sensor-based algorithm for the early detection of worsening heart failure. 
In Electrophysiology, 5% growth was led by strength in international markets. In Europe, we are pleased with the early feedback of our IntellaMap OI catheter, which was launched in the second quarter. We expect to launch this catheter in the U.S. in fourth quarter, which, combined with IntellaNav XP and MiFi XP catheters, will unlock the use of Rhythmia to a higher mix of procedures. We remain bullish that continued penetration of our next-generation mapping and navigation system, Rhythmia HDX and the commercialization of our complete portfolio of nav-enabled therapeutic catheters will strengthen our global EP business and improve growth in 2017. 
So to wrap up, I would like to thank our employees for their incredible winning spirit, terrific execution and commitment to the company. So with that, I'll turn it over to Dan for more details on the P&L and guidance."

In Q3, we generated organic revenue growth of 9% versus our 7% to 9% guidance range and adjusted earnings per share of $0.27, representing 12% year-over-year growth and hitting the high end of our guidance range of $0.25 to $0.27. The double",1256,"Thanks, Mike. In Q3, we generated organic revenue growth of 9% versus our 7% to 9% guidance range and adjusted earnings per share of $0.27, representing 12% year-over-year growth and hitting the high end of our guidance range of $0.25 to $0.27. The double-digit adjusted EPS growth in Q3 was driven primarily by strong revenue growth and solid gross margin, which was at the high end of our guidance range. 
Consolidated revenue of $2,105,000,000 represented operational revenue growth of 10%, at the high end of guidance and reflects an immaterial impact from foreign exchange, which was in line with guidance.
Excluding an approximate 100 basis point contribution from the AMS Male Urology portfolio acquisition for the month of July, organic revenue growth was 9% in the quarter and 11% on an as-reported basis. As a reminder, we completed the acquisition of the AMS Male Urology portfolio on August 3 last year, so August and September AMS sales were included in our organic sales growth calculation. 
Adjusted gross margin for the third quarter was 72.5%, at the high end of our guidance range and consistent with prior year despite a year-over-year negative 120 basis point impact from foreign exchange. In Q3, as expected, we had lower inventory charges than in Q2, and we're now realizing the full benefit of the lower 2016 standard cost of our products due to ongoing value improvement programs. We continue to expect full year 2016 adjusted gross margin to be approximately 72%, which includes an expected 75 to 100 basis point negative impact from unfavorable foreign exchange. 
Adjusted SG&A expenses were $763 million or 36.2% of sales in Q3, down 70 basis points year-over-year as we realize the benefit of our targeted initiatives focused on reducing SG&A, offset partially by the reinvestment of the medical device excise tax benefit. We continue to believe our full year rate will be approximately 36%, which would be a 140 basis point improvement compared to 2015.
Adjusted research and development expenses were $232 million in the third quarter or 11% of sales, which is down 70 basis points year-over-year. We continue to expect our full year 2016 adjusted R&D rate to be approximately 11% of sales. Royalty expense was 0.9% of sales in Q3, roughly flat year-over-year.
Q3 2016 adjusted operating income grew 17% year-over-year and adjusted operating margin of 24.3% was above our guidance range of 23% to 24% and represented a 120 basis point improvement over Q3 last year, the ninth consecutive quarter in which we have expanded adjusted operating margin by 100 basis points or more over the prior year comparable period.
The Rhythm Management team delivered an adjusted operating margin of 20.1%, up 230 basis points year-over-year. The increase year-over-year is a result of realizing the full benefit of 2016 product costs and leveraging the improved top line performance of the global business. For the first 9 months of 2016, Rhythm Management adjusted operating margin is 17.9%, and we continue to believe that, that segment is on track to deliver an adjusted full year operating margin of 20% in 2017.
With total company adjusted operating margin for the first 9 months of 2016 at 24.3%, this positions us well to achieve our full year adjusted operating margin guidance of 24% to 24.5%, and we remain on track to reach our goal of 25%-plus in 2017 we will provide more guidance on 2017 adjusted operating margin with our Q4 earnings call in February.
Now I'll move on to interest and other expense. Interest expense for the quarter was $58 million, roughly flat to Q3 of 2015. Our average interest expense rate was 3.9% in Q3 this year compared to the same 3.9% in Q3 of last year. Other expenses was $33 million in the quarter and includes approximately $20 million of impairment charges related to certain of our strategic investments. Other expenses for the quarter primarily included foreign exchange losses related to our hedging program. 
Our tax rate for the third quarter was 11.2% on a reported basis and 12.4% on an adjusted basis. We are making progress towards finalizing our conditional stipulation of settled issues with the Internal Revenue Service and expect to make a series of payments related to the settlement, most of which we expect to remit during the second half of 2017 and into the first half of 2018.
Finally, Q3 2016 adjusted earnings per share of $0.27 includes approximately $0.01 of unfavorable FX and represents 12% year-over-year growth or 17% growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Earnings per share upside from the strong revenue and margin performance was partially offset by the $0.01 of impairment charges we recorded. On a reported GAAP basis, which includes net charges and amortization expense totaling $140 million after tax, Q3 2016 EPS was $0.17. 
Adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was $440 million compared to $394 million in Q3 last year, and we continue to pursue inventory management initiatives designed to improve the working capital contribution to cash flow. Given the strong adjusted free cash flow generation year-to-date this year, we believe we can achieve our full year adjusted free cash flow guidance of $1.6 billion. In Q3, we used cash primarily to fund previously agreed legal settlements as well as business development activities. As of September 30, 2016, we had cash on hand of $237 million, and near term, our capital allocation priorities continue to be managing contingencies and pursuing tuck-in M&A. 
We ended the third quarter with 1,380,000,000 fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding. Consistent with our prior guidance, we expect our share count to increase by less than 5 million through the end of 2016. As consistent with our commitment at the time of the AMS Men's Health acquisition last year, we plan to keep the buybacks suspended for the balance of 2016. We expect this to result in a fully weighted average share count of approximately 1,380,000,000 shares for full year 2016. 
I'll now walk through the guidance for the fourth quarter and the full year 2016. For the full year, we now expect consolidated revenue to be in a range of $8,335,000,000 to $8,385,000,000, which represents year-over-year growth of 9% on an organic basis, 12% on an operational basis and 11% to 12% on a reported basis. We continue to expect foreign exchange to be a headwind of approximately $70 million for the full year.
Turning to adjusted earnings per share. We now expect full year 2016 adjusted EPS to be in a range of $1.09 to $1.11, representing 17% to 19% adjusted earnings growth, which continues to assume the full year negative impact of FX will be $0.05. On a GAAP basis, we expect earnings per share to be in a range of $0.32 to $0.34. 
Now turning specifically to the fourth quarter. We expect consolidated revenue to be in a range of $2,140,000,000 to $2,190,000,000. This represents year-over-year growth in a range of 7% to 9% operationally. We expect foreign exchange impact on Q4 revenue to be a slight tailwind. For the fourth quarter, adjusted earnings per share is expected to be in a range of $0.27 to $0.29 per share, and GAAP earnings per share is expected to be in a range of $0.15 to $0.17 per share.

So obviously, very pleased to be at that 20% here in Q3 for Rhythm Management operating margin. It's 320 basis points sequentially and 230 points year-over-year. As you would expect in any given quarter, you'll see some variation in that. Would actually expect that to go back down in Q4, a little more spending in Q4 on SG&A initiatives and such. The full year should be about 18%, which is what we've said consistently that we'd be this year. And I think that puts us right in line to get to that 20% next year in Rhythm Management, which, as part of us getting to 25%-plus as a company, I think gives us the confidence in both those numbers. So I don't think we're going to talk more specifically about the 20%, where we'd go from there. Certainly, it goes north of that. We're not going to stop at 20% in 2017. Just as a company, we're not going to stop at 25%. So there's more room in that Rhythm Management segment to increase well beyond 20% as the company goes to, what we've said publicly, our goal of 27% to 28% operating margin by 2020."

So first, just on the modeling side. It's a little thing, but it stuck out to us, which was that your other income line was an expense of $33 million and that hit EPS by probably up to $0.02.

We're doing very well outside the United States, and S-ICD is continuing to support us and differentiate that platform. So we're very bullish on the future of our CRM business and the portfolio. And despite that, the team continues to drive operating income margin improvements. So really nice job there. With WATCHMAN, I mean, we're continuing to build momentum there. As you mentioned, the reimbursement headwinds really are beginning to neutralize based on the advances that we've made there. We continue to open up new centers, and we're really tracking. And we're not giving you much visibility to that, and in the future, we'll determine how to do that. But we're continuing to focus on our utilization rate and driving more physician awareness, more patient awareness and, in parallel, doing a really nice job on physician training, so oftentimes, training multiple physicians at the same site to increase utilization. And in parallel, we're opening up a new center. So again, on the structural heart side, we're at the high end of our range, $175 million to $200 million, and the WATCHMAN contribution is significant within there."

We don't yet have our largest valve and our smallest valve. And so we're doing quite well in the market with 3 valves and we're excited by getting the additional 2 valve sizes for the full matrix. And I think what's really different is kind of the same drumbeat. It's a different devise, it's a next-generation platform that doctors really enjoy the control that they have with it. And so I wouldn't say it's easy, but it's easier to differentiate this valve from some of the other balloon expandable devices that they have options to use in Europe. So we're very bullish on the future of it. In terms of France, we expect to have reimbursement by year-end '17. So hopefully, we'll see some upside from France reimbursement ideally in the fourth quarter '17."

So we really [indiscernible] one big product, but overall you're seeing us increase the R&D spending those businesses over the past few years.

So we do think safety is an important metric, and we don't think we have any competition in that area. I think what will be interesting in TCT is some of the longer-term follow-up of fully resolvable stents particularly the 3-year data from Absorb II because if fully resolvable stents get better, the longer they're in terms of your modeling and so on, that will be an important finding. Clearly, the 2-year data in that regard, [indiscernible]. So we also like the key performance of Synergy. The ease-of-use for interventional cardiologists worldwide is well appreciated.

I think just in terms of this deal is very consistent, the Endo deal with our strategy which is one is to continue to strengthen and diversify the company in the faster-growth market. So the MedSurg segment is a significant contributor. Endo business is a leader, but we're a little bit lighter in terms of our portfolio in the ambulatory surgery center. We also had that offered a pathology solution for this business. So it gives us the capability for surgery center market, which is a nice extension and expands us into some adjacencies in pathologies, builds in a few products in our core business. So it will be a nice tuck-in acquisition, nice cost synergies and probably on a lower risk scale in terms of integration. But we've also complemented those deals with some nice strong investments obviously the WATCHMAN acquisition. And also I think hopefully our M&A track record is pretty solid.

317627,403595084,1061434,"Boston Scientific Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2016",2016-10-26,"Earnings Calls","Boston Scientific Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Susie. Good morning, everyone. Our third quarter 2016 results are excellent and reinforce the success of our category leadership strategy and the strong execution of our global teams. We continue to grow faster than the market in almost all of",1834,"Thank you, Susie. Good morning, everyone. Our third quarter 2016 results are excellent and reinforce the success of our category leadership strategy and the strong execution of our global teams. We continue to grow faster than the market in almost all of our business units while consistently improving operating income margin. As a result, we continue to deliver strong double-digit adjusted EPS growth. 
Importantly, we are investing in new adjacencies, capabilities and end markets that position Boston Scientific for a very exciting future. In third quarter '16, we drove operational growth of 10% and organic revenue growth of 9%, normalized for currency and excluding the impact of 1 month of sales of the AMS acquisition, which anniversary-ed on August 3. Of note, we delivered this 9% organic growth against our toughest comparison of the year, and we leveraged that growth with 120 basis point improvement year-over-year in adjusted operating margin of 24.3%, which beat the high end of our guidance range by 30 basis points. Thus, 9% organic revenue growth in the quarter was leveraged to 12% EPS growth or $0.27 per share, which was at the high end of our guidance range. For the full year '16, we're maintaining our strong guidance and pulling up the low end of our previous ranges, and Dan will provide the details in a few minutes.
I'll now provide some highlights on Q3 results and our Q4 '16 outlook. In my remarks, all references of growth are on a constant-currency organic year-over-year basis, and they exclude the 1-month benefit of AMS unless otherwise specified. 
Organic revenue growth of 9% was broad-based across our businesses and regions, with particular strength from new global product launches, emerging market expansion and share gains led by innovation and our category leadership strategy. On a regional basis EMEA led the pack with 12% growth, followed by the U.S. at 9% and Europe at 5%. Emerging markets sales grew 19%, led by an acceleration in growth in China at 26% and Latin America turning a strong quarter with 21% growth. 
Across our businesses, for the third straight quarter, both our Cardiovascular and MedSurg segments grew sales organically double digits, 12% for cardiovascular and 10% for MedSurg. And Rhythm Management turned in a strong and consistent performance with second (sic) [ third ] quarter sales up 3%. MedSurg continues to deliver excellent growth and strong profitability. MedSurg remains a high-priority segment for the company, with 2 recent tuck-in acquisitions to enhance category leadership in Neuromodulation with Cosman Medical in RF ablation and Endoscopy with the recently announced tender offer for EndoChoice. 
9% global growth in Endoscopy was led by double-digit gains in both our Biliary and hemostasis franchises, with Spyglass digital DS and the AXIOS stent leading the charge in Biliary, and our newly launched Resolution 360 clip is driving growth in hemostasis. We continue to see upside from new product launches and strong emerging market growth in endo. 
We're also excited about the acquisition of EndoChoice, which we expect to close by year-end. EndoChoice is focused on the development of innovative products and services for gastroenterology health care providers, with a portfolio that's particularly well suited for the ambulatory surgery center. It also brings a portfolio of value-added services to the ASC market, including infection control and pathology services. This acquisition will further enhance the position of Boston Scientific as the global leader in the field of GI endoscopy. As previously announced, we expect to pursue strategic options for EndoChoice's  FUSE colonoscope business. We plan to provide an update at or around the time of closing of this transaction.
Turning to Urology and Pelvic Health. Uro and Pelvic Health grew double digits for the third consecutive quarter, up 13% in Q3. We're a strong category leader in the Urology segment, and we delivered broad-based growth across the combined Boston Scientific and AMS portfolio. International sales remained very strong with EMEA, Latin America and emerging markets all growing at double-digit rates. AMS sales grew 5% in the quarter, which is a nice acceleration from trend prior to acquisition. And importantly, our remediation and integration efforts are both on track.
Our Lithovue single-use ureteroscope continues to launch and is enjoying strong uptake in a variety of accounts. And finally, our growth was assisted by tailwinds from our market share capture post Astora's exit from the pelvic health market. 
Neuromod grew double digits, plus 12%, against a strong comp and robust Precision Spectra sales now with full-body MRI compatibility in our Vercise Deep Brain Stimulation platform in Europe. We continue to expect U.S. market entry for Vercise by late 2017 and believe this is an exciting new market opportunity for us.
Cosman Medical, an acquisition announced in July, broadens our Neuromodulation portfolio with RF ablation systems that enable us to offer patients with chronic pain another treatment option in non-opioid therapeutics. We will provide an update on our ACCELERATE clinical trial on our fourth quarter 2016 call. 
In Cardiovascular, segment sales grew 12% and reported an adjusted operating margin of 32.8%, up 160 basis points year-over-year. Peripheral Interventions revenue grew 11% and was led by strong balanced global growth in developed and emerging markets. This is PI's fourth straight quarter of double-digit above-market growth, fueled by our leadership -- category leadership strategy and the depth of our portfolio rather than any single product. 
We drove strong growth in the atherectomy and thrombectomy businesses, and new product launches are also going very well, including the AngioJet ZelanteDVT catheter; the Innova vascular stent; and our drug-eluting technologies, Eluvia DES and Ranger DCB. Finally, we're also pleased with the contribution and integration progress of the Spherical Embolics platform acquired from CeloNova. 
We continue to invest in the peripheral market, particularly in drug-eluting strategies, venous diseases and interventional oncology. Two important clinical trials were presented in the third quarter at the major European peripheral congresses, CIRSE. Our drug-eluting stent, Eluvia, in the MAJESTIC clinical trial demonstrated an unprecedented 92.5% freedom from total lesion revascularization at 2 years. And enrollment continues in our global IDE trial, IMPERIAL. This 92.5% freedom from TLR is of particular note given the patient population studied. 65% of patients had severely calcified lesions and 46% had chronic total occlusions. 
In addition, we reported results for our Ranger Drug-Coated Balloon from 105-patient randomized clinical trial studying the superficial femoral artery. With 94.4% freedom from total lesion revascularization at 6 months, average lesion length was 68 millimeters. We also posted strong results from our Ranger all-comers registry with 91.9% freedom from TLR at 6 months and an average lesion length of 135 millimeters. 
We plan to bring our Ranger DCB to the U.S., and we'll reveal details of our IDE trial shortly. We're excited to be the only company investing in a complete portfolio of drug-eluting therapies.
Turning to Interventional Cardiology. This business segment grew 13% in Q3, led by strong sales in structural heart, drug-eluting stents and PCI guidance or imaging. SYNERGY continues to penetrate the market as we grew worldwide DES sales 14%, and we remain on track to represent 50% to 60% of our global DES revenue mix by the end of fourth quarter. PCI guidance grew mid-teens as well, with strong IVUS catheter and service sales augmented by the ongoing global launch of our COMET FFR system. 
In structural heart, which includes our Lotus transcatheter aortic valve and WATCHMAN Left Atrial Appendage Closure Device, we're driving growth via our unique innovative platform technologies, and they're resonating with physicians and are supported by the strength of our commercial teams. Both franchises are performing very well, and we continue to expect to deliver structural heart revenue at the high end of our $175 million to $200 million guidance for 2016.
We also recently began the early launch of our Lotus EDGE valve in Europe, and thus, the results from our feasibility study of Lotus EDGE will be presented this Sunday at a lunchtime symposium at TCT. Also at TCT next week, we look forward to a number of Lotus presentations, including 4-year outcomes on REPRISE I, 3-year outcomes for REPRISE II and our Lotus EDGE feasibility study with a 7-day discharge data. We expect to present results of REPRISE III, our U.S. pivotal trial and the first to provide head-to-head data, at EuroPCR in May. 
The WATCHMAN platform also delivered an exciting quarter, with strong growth from opening new centers as well as driving growth in existing centers. We're very encouraged to see a strong initial launch in France, where we received higher reimbursement to peers based on the strength of our data. And we expect to enroll our first patient in ASP-II, which is a study examining the use of WATCHMAN in warfarin-ineligible patients before the end of the year.
Turning now to Rhythm Management. Segment sales grew 3%, with another impressive gain in the adjusted operating margins of 20.1%, which is 320 basis points quarter-over-quarter and a 230 basis points growth year-over-year. Growth in CRM at 3% was above market and led by worldwide patient growth of 22%, with meaningful share capture from our premium-based brady MRI device. High-voltage sales declined 4% globally due to replacement cycle headwinds and competitive pressures in the U.S. and MRI-compatible tachy devices. We continue to be pleased with the growth and momentum of EMBLEM S-ICD, which has been fueled by a recent FDA approval for both MRI and MRI-backwards compatibility and increased physician acceptance of this differentiated therapy. 
In Europe, our CRM business grew above market for the 10th consecutive quarter, and in Japan, our above-market growth was driven by a strong launch of EMBLEM S-ICD, transvenous tachy MRI and 3.0T brady MRI. We also achieved important CRM clinical milestones in the quarter, including the first patients enrolled in the APPRAISE ATP trial to help clinicians understand which ICD patients could benefit from antitachycardia pacing and which may be harmed. 
Also, our MultiSENSE trial is accepted as a late breaker for the upcoming AHA scientific sessions in New Orleans. MultiSENSE is an international multicenter, non-randomized study, which is designed to develop and to evaluate prospectively a multi-sensor-based algorithm for the early detection of worsening heart failure. 
In Electrophysiology, 5% growth was led by strength in international markets. In Europe, we are pleased with the early feedback of our IntellaMap OI catheter, which was launched in the second quarter. We expect to launch this catheter in the U.S. in fourth quarter, which, combined with IntellaNav XP and MiFi XP catheters, will unlock the use of Rhythmia to a higher mix of procedures. We remain bullish that continued penetration of our next-generation mapping and navigation system, Rhythmia HDX and the commercialization of our complete portfolio of nav-enabled therapeutic catheters will strengthen our global EP business and improve growth in 2017. 
So to wrap up, I would like to thank our employees for their incredible winning spirit, terrific execution and commitment to the company. So with that, I'll turn it over to Dan for more details on the P&L and guidance."
317627,403595084,1061434,"Boston Scientific Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2016",2016-10-26,"Earnings Calls","Boston Scientific Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Mike. In Q3, we generated organic revenue growth of 9% versus our 7% to 9% guidance range and adjusted earnings per share of $0.27, representing 12% year-over-year growth and hitting the high end of our guidance range of $0.25 to $0.27. The double",1256,"Thanks, Mike. In Q3, we generated organic revenue growth of 9% versus our 7% to 9% guidance range and adjusted earnings per share of $0.27, representing 12% year-over-year growth and hitting the high end of our guidance range of $0.25 to $0.27. The double-digit adjusted EPS growth in Q3 was driven primarily by strong revenue growth and solid gross margin, which was at the high end of our guidance range. 
Consolidated revenue of $2,105,000,000 represented operational revenue growth of 10%, at the high end of guidance and reflects an immaterial impact from foreign exchange, which was in line with guidance.
Excluding an approximate 100 basis point contribution from the AMS Male Urology portfolio acquisition for the month of July, organic revenue growth was 9% in the quarter and 11% on an as-reported basis. As a reminder, we completed the acquisition of the AMS Male Urology portfolio on August 3 last year, so August and September AMS sales were included in our organic sales growth calculation. 
Adjusted gross margin for the third quarter was 72.5%, at the high end of our guidance range and consistent with prior year despite a year-over-year negative 120 basis point impact from foreign exchange. In Q3, as expected, we had lower inventory charges than in Q2, and we're now realizing the full benefit of the lower 2016 standard cost of our products due to ongoing value improvement programs. We continue to expect full year 2016 adjusted gross margin to be approximately 72%, which includes an expected 75 to 100 basis point negative impact from unfavorable foreign exchange. 
Adjusted SG&A expenses were $763 million or 36.2% of sales in Q3, down 70 basis points year-over-year as we realize the benefit of our targeted initiatives focused on reducing SG&A, offset partially by the reinvestment of the medical device excise tax benefit. We continue to believe our full year rate will be approximately 36%, which would be a 140 basis point improvement compared to 2015.
Adjusted research and development expenses were $232 million in the third quarter or 11% of sales, which is down 70 basis points year-over-year. We continue to expect our full year 2016 adjusted R&D rate to be approximately 11% of sales. Royalty expense was 0.9% of sales in Q3, roughly flat year-over-year.
Q3 2016 adjusted operating income grew 17% year-over-year and adjusted operating margin of 24.3% was above our guidance range of 23% to 24% and represented a 120 basis point improvement over Q3 last year, the ninth consecutive quarter in which we have expanded adjusted operating margin by 100 basis points or more over the prior year comparable period.
The Rhythm Management team delivered an adjusted operating margin of 20.1%, up 230 basis points year-over-year. The increase year-over-year is a result of realizing the full benefit of 2016 product costs and leveraging the improved top line performance of the global business. For the first 9 months of 2016, Rhythm Management adjusted operating margin is 17.9%, and we continue to believe that, that segment is on track to deliver an adjusted full year operating margin of 20% in 2017.
With total company adjusted operating margin for the first 9 months of 2016 at 24.3%, this positions us well to achieve our full year adjusted operating margin guidance of 24% to 24.5%, and we remain on track to reach our goal of 25%-plus in 2017 we will provide more guidance on 2017 adjusted operating margin with our Q4 earnings call in February.
Now I'll move on to interest and other expense. Interest expense for the quarter was $58 million, roughly flat to Q3 of 2015. Our average interest expense rate was 3.9% in Q3 this year compared to the same 3.9% in Q3 of last year. Other expenses was $33 million in the quarter and includes approximately $20 million of impairment charges related to certain of our strategic investments. Other expenses for the quarter primarily included foreign exchange losses related to our hedging program. 
Our tax rate for the third quarter was 11.2% on a reported basis and 12.4% on an adjusted basis. We are making progress towards finalizing our conditional stipulation of settled issues with the Internal Revenue Service and expect to make a series of payments related to the settlement, most of which we expect to remit during the second half of 2017 and into the first half of 2018.
Finally, Q3 2016 adjusted earnings per share of $0.27 includes approximately $0.01 of unfavorable FX and represents 12% year-over-year growth or 17% growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Earnings per share upside from the strong revenue and margin performance was partially offset by the $0.01 of impairment charges we recorded. On a reported GAAP basis, which includes net charges and amortization expense totaling $140 million after tax, Q3 2016 EPS was $0.17. 
Adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was $440 million compared to $394 million in Q3 last year, and we continue to pursue inventory management initiatives designed to improve the working capital contribution to cash flow. Given the strong adjusted free cash flow generation year-to-date this year, we believe we can achieve our full year adjusted free cash flow guidance of $1.6 billion. In Q3, we used cash primarily to fund previously agreed legal settlements as well as business development activities. As of September 30, 2016, we had cash on hand of $237 million, and near term, our capital allocation priorities continue to be managing contingencies and pursuing tuck-in M&A. 
We ended the third quarter with 1,380,000,000 fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding. Consistent with our prior guidance, we expect our share count to increase by less than 5 million through the end of 2016. As consistent with our commitment at the time of the AMS Men's Health acquisition last year, we plan to keep the buybacks suspended for the balance of 2016. We expect this to result in a fully weighted average share count of approximately 1,380,000,000 shares for full year 2016. 
I'll now walk through the guidance for the fourth quarter and the full year 2016. For the full year, we now expect consolidated revenue to be in a range of $8,335,000,000 to $8,385,000,000, which represents year-over-year growth of 9% on an organic basis, 12% on an operational basis and 11% to 12% on a reported basis. We continue to expect foreign exchange to be a headwind of approximately $70 million for the full year.
Turning to adjusted earnings per share. We now expect full year 2016 adjusted EPS to be in a range of $1.09 to $1.11, representing 17% to 19% adjusted earnings growth, which continues to assume the full year negative impact of FX will be $0.05. On a GAAP basis, we expect earnings per share to be in a range of $0.32 to $0.34. 
Now turning specifically to the fourth quarter. We expect consolidated revenue to be in a range of $2,140,000,000 to $2,190,000,000. This represents year-over-year growth in a range of 7% to 9% operationally. We expect foreign exchange impact on Q4 revenue to be a slight tailwind. For the fourth quarter, adjusted earnings per share is expected to be in a range of $0.27 to $0.29 per share, and GAAP earnings per share is expected to be in a range of $0.15 to $0.17 per share. Please check our Investor Relations website for Q3 2016 financial and operational highlights, which outlines Q3 results as well as Q4 and full year 2016 guidance, including P&L line item guidance.
And with that, I'll turn it back to Susie, who'll moderate the Q&A."

As you would expect in any given quarter, you'll see some variation in that. Would actually expect that to go back down in Q4, a little more spending in Q4 on SG&A initiatives and such. The full year should be about 18%, which is what we've said consistently that we'd be this year. And I think that puts us right in line to get to that 20% next year in Rhythm Management, which, as part of us getting to 25%-plus as a company, I think gives us the confidence in both those numbers. So I don't think we're going to talk more specifically about the 20%, where we'd go from there. Certainly, it goes north of that. We're not going to stop at 20% in 2017. Just as a company, we're not going to stop at 25%. So there's more room in that Rhythm Management segment to increase well beyond 20% as the company goes to, what we've said publicly, our goal of 27% to 28% operating margin by 2020."

So first, just on the modeling side. It's a little thing, but it stuck out to us, which was that your other income line was an expense of $33 million and that hit EPS by probably up to $0.02.

And importantly, in that category, we're down in the U.S. and down globally, but our European business continues to do well as our Asian business does with a full line of MRI-safe products. And the S-ICD continues to do very well. So despite not having it for what will be a decent part of '17, the pacer business continues to do very well. We're doing very well outside the United States, and S-ICD is continuing to support us and differentiate that platform. So we're very bullish on the future of our CRM business and the portfolio. And despite that, the team continues to drive operating income margin improvements. So really nice job there. With WATCHMAN, I mean, we're continuing to build momentum there. As you mentioned, the reimbursement headwinds really are beginning to neutralize based on the advances that we've made there. We continue to open up new centers, and we're really tracking. And we're not giving you much visibility to that, and in the future, we'll determine how to do that. But we're continuing to focus on our utilization rate and driving more physician awareness, more patient awareness and, in parallel, doing a really nice job on physician training, so oftentimes, training multiple physicians at the same site to increase utilization. And in parallel, we're opening up a new center. So again, on the structural heart side, we're at the high end of our range, $175 million to $200 million, and the WATCHMAN contribution is significant within there."

We got really fantastic feedback from clinicians since commercial release of that lead, validating excellent results we saw on the clinical trial. And I think in terms of what that does portend for tachy, I think we take a lot of pride in looking at how the portfolio is delivering in Europe, where we do have full approval of our tachy MRI products, including backwards compatibility to our previously released products and have MRI approval both for traditional transvenous devices as well as for our S-ICD.

And so we're doing quite well in the market with 3 valves, and we'll be excited about getting the additional 2 valve sizes for the full matrix. And I think what's really different is of the same drumbeat. It's a different device. It's a next-generation platform that doctors really enjoy the control that they have with it. And so it's -- I wouldn't say it's easy, but it's easier to differentiate this valve than some of the other balloon expandable devices that they have options to use in Europe.

In fact, no definite stent thrombosis, not a single definite stent thrombosis after the first 24 hours. So we do think safety is an important metric, and we don't think we have any competition in that area. I think what will be interesting at TCT is some of the longer-term follow-up of fully resorbable stents, particularly the 3-year data from ABSORB II because if fully resorbable stents get better, the longer they're in, in terms of remodeling and so on, that will be an important finding. Clearly, the 2-year data in that regard were disappointing. So we also like the acute performance of SYNERGY. The ease of use for interventional cardiologists worldwide is well appreciated.

And that also will come on the heels of a full '18 launch of our MRI -- full year benefit of our MRI capabilities. So I just want to maybe close the call -- and Dan talked about kind of mid-single-digit guidance for next year. We'll provide all that detail in the second quarter.
I think what we're most excited about is the future of the company, and we talked quite a bit about the platforms that we'll be entering in markets approaching $8 billion to $9 billion in 2020. And we'll detail this out at the Investor Day. But it's exciting future as we move into a very large market in TAVR, expanded indications in the future with WATCHMAN, our drug-eluting technologies, the real commitment that we have to neurostimulation, expanding the Deep Brain Stimulation potentially to other areas and really in the field of Endoscopy where our team is looking at breakthrough capabilities to take more general surgery approaches to less invasive procedures. So there's a lot of new therapies that the business will be entering that will show at our Investor Day that really give an exciting future to the company beyond our '17 guidance that we'll provide in February."

With me on today's call are Mike Mahoney, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Dan Brennan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
We issued a press release earlier this morning announcing our Q3 2016 results, which included reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in the release. We have posted a copy of that release as well as reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in today's call to the Investor Relations section of our website under the heading Financial Information.
The duration of this morning's call will be up to 1 hour. Mike will provide strategic and revenue highlights of Q3 '16. Dan will review the financials for the quarter and then Q4 '16 and full year guidance, and then we'll take your questions. During today's Q&A session, Mike and Dan will be joined by our Chief Medical Officers, Dr. Keith Dawkins and Dr. Ken Stein. 
Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that on the call, organic revenue growth is defined as excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and sales from the acquisition of the American Medical Systems, AMS, Male Urology portfolio over the prior year period. Also of note, this call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws, which may be identified by words like anticipate, expect, believe, estimate and other similar words. They include, among other things, statements about our growth and market share; new product approvals and launches; clinical trials; cost savings and growth opportunities; our cash flow and expected use; our financial performance, including sales, margins, earnings and other Q4 2016 guidance as well as our tax rates, R&D spend and other expenses. Actual results may differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. 
Factors that may cause such differences include those described in the Risk Factors section of our most recent 10-K and subsequent 10-Qs filed with the SEC. These statements speak only as of today's date, and we disclaim any intention or obligation to update them.

317627,403595084,1061719,"Boston Scientific Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2016",2016-10-26,"Earnings Calls","Boston Scientific Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Susie. Good morning, everyone. Our third quarter 2016 results are excellent and reinforce the success of our category leadership strategy and the strong execution of our global teams. We continue to grow faster than the market in almost all of",1833,"Thank you, Susie. Good morning, everyone. Our third quarter 2016 results are excellent and reinforce the success of our category leadership strategy and the strong execution of our global teams. We continue to grow faster than the market in almost all of our business units while consistently improving operating income margin. As a result, we continue to deliver strong double-digit adjusted EPS growth. 
Importantly, we are investing in new adjacencies, capabilities and markets that position Boston Scientific for a very exciting future. In third quarter '16, we drove operational growth of 10% and organic revenue growth of 9%, normalized for currency and excluding the impact of 1 month of sales of the AMS acquisition, which anniversary-ed on August 3. Of note, we delivered this 9% organic growth against our toughest comparison of the year, and we leveraged that growth with 120 basis point improvement year-over-year in adjusted operating margin of 24.3%, which beat the high end of our guidance range by 30 basis points. Thus, 9% organic revenue growth in the quarter was leveraged to 12% EPS growth or $0.27 per share, which was at the high end of our guidance range. For the full year '16, we're maintaining our strong guidance and pulling up the low end of our previous ranges, and Dan will provide the details in a few minutes.
I'll now provide some highlights on Q3 results and our Q4 '16 outlook. In my remarks, all references of growth are on a constant-currency organic year-over-year basis, and they exclude the 1-month benefit of AMS unless otherwise specified. 
Organic revenue growth of 9% was broad-based across our businesses and regions, with particular strength from new global product launches, emerging market expansion and share gains led by innovation and our category leadership strategy. On a regional basis EMEA led the pack with 12% growth, followed by the U.S. at 9% and Europe at 5%. Emerging markets sales grew 19%, led by an acceleration in growth in China at 26% and Latin America turning a strong quarter with 21% growth. 
Across our businesses, for the third straight quarter, both our Cardiovascular and MedSurg segments grew sales organically double digits, 12% for cardiovascular and 10% for MedSurg. And Rhythm Management turned in a strong and consistent performance with second (sic) [ third ] quarter sales up 3%. MedSurg continues to deliver excellent growth and strong profitability. MedSurg remains a high-priority segment for the company, with 2 recent tuck-in acquisitions to enhance category leadership in Neuromodulation with Cosman Medical in RF ablation and Endoscopy with the recently announced tender offer for EndoChoice. 
9% global growth in Endoscopy was led by double-digit gains in both our Biliary and hemostasis franchises, with SpyGlass digital DS and the AXIOS stent leading the charge in Biliary, and our newly launched Resolution 360 clip is driving growth in hemostasis. We continue to see upside from new product launches and strong emerging market growth in endo. 
We're also excited about the acquisition of EndoChoice, which we expect to close by year-end. EndoChoice is focused on the development of innovative products and services for gastroenterology health care providers, with a portfolio that's particularly well suited for the ambulatory surgery center. It also brings a portfolio of value-added services to the ASC market, including infection control and pathology services. This acquisition will further enhance the position of Boston Scientific as the global leader in the field of GI endoscopy. As previously announced, we expect to pursue strategic options for EndoChoice's  FUSE colonoscope business. We plan to provide an update at or around the time of closing of this transaction.
Turning to Urology and Pelvic Health. Uro and Pelvic Health grew double digits for the third consecutive quarter, up 13% in Q3. We're a strong category leader in the Urology segment, and we delivered broad-based growth across the combined Boston Scientific and AMS portfolio. International sales remained very strong with EMEA, Latin America and emerging markets all growing at double-digit rates. AMS sales grew 5% in the quarter, which is a nice acceleration from trend prior to acquisition. And importantly, our remediation and integration efforts are both on track.
Our Lithovue single-use ureteroscope continues to launch and is enjoying strong uptake in a variety of accounts. And finally, our growth was assisted by tailwinds from our market share capture post Astora's exit from the pelvic health market. 
Neuromod grew double digits, plus 12%, against a strong comp and robust Precision Spectra sales now with full-body MRI compatibility in our Vercise Deep Brain Stimulation platform in Europe. We continue to expect U.S. market entry for Vercise by late 2017 and believe this is an exciting new market opportunity for us.
Cosman Medical, an acquisition announced in July, broadens our Neuromodulation portfolio with RF ablation systems that enable us to offer patients with chronic pain another treatment option in non-opioid therapeutics. We will provide an update on our ACCELERATE clinical trial on our fourth quarter 2016 call. 
In Cardiovascular, segment sales grew 12% and reported an adjusted operating margin of 32.8%, up 160 basis points year-over-year. Peripheral Interventions revenue grew 11% and was led by strong balanced global growth in developed and emerging markets. This is PI's fourth straight quarter of double-digit above-market growth, fueled by our leadership -- category leadership strategy and the depth of our portfolio rather than any single product. 
We drove strong growth in the atherectomy and thrombectomy businesses, and new product launches are also going very well, including the AngioJet ZelanteDVT catheter; the Innova vascular stent; and our drug-eluting technologies, Eluvia DES and Ranger DCB. Finally, we're also pleased with the contribution and integration progress of the Spherical Embolics platform acquired from CeloNova. 
We continue to invest in the peripheral market, particularly in drug-eluting strategies, venous diseases and interventional oncology. Two important clinical trials were presented in the third quarter at the major European peripheral congresses, CIRSE. Our drug-eluting stent, Eluvia, in the MAJESTIC clinical trial demonstrated an unprecedented 92.5% freedom from total lesion revascularization at 2 years. And enrollment continues in our global IDE trial, IMPERIAL. This 92.5% freedom from TLR is of particular note given the patient population studied. 65% of patients had severely calcified lesions and 46% had chronic total occlusions. 
In addition, we reported results for our Ranger Drug-Coated Balloon from 105-patient randomized clinical trial studying the superficial femoral artery. With 94.4% freedom from total lesion revascularization at 6 months, average lesion length was 68 millimeters. We also posted strong results from our Ranger all-comers registry with 91.9% freedom from TLR at 6 months and an average lesion length of 135 millimeters. 
We plan to bring our Ranger DCB to the U.S., and we'll reveal details of our IDE trial shortly. We're excited to be the only company investing in a complete portfolio of drug-eluting therapies.
Turning to Interventional Cardiology. This business segment grew 13% in Q3, led by strong sales in structural heart, drug-eluting stents and PCI guidance or imaging. SYNERGY continues to penetrate the market as we grew worldwide DES sales 14%, and we remain on track to represent 50% to 60% of our global DES revenue mix by the end of fourth quarter. PCI guidance grew mid-teens as well, with strong IVUS catheter and service sales augmented by the ongoing global launch of our COMET FFR system. 
In structural heart, which includes our Lotus transcatheter aortic valve and WATCHMAN Left Atrial Appendage Closure Device, we're driving growth via our unique innovative platform technologies, and they're resonating with physicians and are supported by the strength of our commercial teams. Both franchises are performing very well, and we continue to expect to deliver structural heart revenue at the high end of our $175 million to $200 million guidance for 2016.
We also recently began the early launch of our Lotus EDGE valve in Europe, and thus, the results from our feasibility study of Lotus EDGE will be presented this Sunday at a lunchtime symposium at TCT. Also at TCT next week, we look forward to a number of Lotus presentations, including 4-year outcomes on REPRISE I, 3-year outcomes for REPRISE II and our Lotus EDGE feasibility study with a 7-day discharge data. We expect to present results of REPRISE III, our U.S. pivotal trial and the first to provide head-to-head data, at EuroPCR in May. 
The WATCHMAN platform also delivered an exciting quarter, with strong growth from opening new centers as well as driving growth in existing centers. We're very encouraged to see a strong initial launch in France, where we received higher reimbursement to peers based on the strength of our data. And we expect to enroll our first patient in ASP-II, which is a study examining the use of WATCHMAN in warfarin-ineligible patients before the end of the year.
Turning now to Rhythm Management. Segment sales grew 3%, with another impressive gain in the adjusted operating margins of 20.1%, which is 320 basis points quarter-over-quarter and a 230 basis points growth year-over-year. Growth in CRM at 3% was above market and led by worldwide patient growth of 22%, with meaningful share capture from our premium-based brady MRI device. High-voltage sales declined 4% globally due to replacement cycle headwinds and competitive pressures in the U.S. and MRI-compatible tachy devices. We continue to be pleased with the growth and momentum of EMBLEM S-ICD, which has been fueled by a recent FDA approval for both MRI and MRI-backwards compatibility and increased physician acceptance of this differentiated therapy. 
In Europe, our CRM business grew above market for the 10th consecutive quarter, and in Japan, our above-market growth was driven by a strong launch of EMBLEM S-ICD, transvenous tachy MRI and 3.0T brady MRI. We also achieved important CRM clinical milestones in the quarter, including the first patients enrolled in the APPRAISE ATP trial to help clinicians understand which ICD patients could benefit from antitachycardia pacing and which may be harmed. 
Also, our MultiSENSE trial is accepted as a late breaker for the upcoming AHA scientific sessions in New Orleans. MultiSENSE is an international multicenter, non-randomized study, which is designed to develop and to evaluate prospectively a multi-sensor-based algorithm for the early detection of worsening heart failure. 
In Electrophysiology, 5% growth was led by strength in international markets. In Europe, we are pleased with the early feedback of our IntellaMap OI catheter, which was launched in the second quarter. We expect to launch this catheter in the U.S. in fourth quarter, which, combined with IntellaNav XP and MiFi XP catheters, will unlock the use of Rhythmia to a higher mix of procedures. We remain bullish that continued penetration of our next-generation mapping and navigation system, Rhythmia HDX and the commercialization of our complete portfolio of nav-enabled therapeutic catheters will strengthen our global EP business and improve growth in 2017. 
So to wrap up, I would like to thank our employees for their incredible winning spirit, terrific execution and commitment to the company. So with that, I'll turn it over to Dan for more details on the P&L and guidance."

In Q3, we generated organic revenue growth of 9% versus our 7% to 9% guidance range and adjusted earnings per share of $0.27, representing 12% year-over-year growth and hitting the high end of our guidance range of $0.25 to $0.27. The double",1256,"Thanks, Mike. In Q3, we generated organic revenue growth of 9% versus our 7% to 9% guidance range and adjusted earnings per share of $0.27, representing 12% year-over-year growth and hitting the high end of our guidance range of $0.25 to $0.27. The double-digit adjusted EPS growth in Q3 was driven primarily by strong revenue growth and solid gross margin, which was at the high end of our guidance range. 
Consolidated revenue of $2,105,000,000 represented operational revenue growth of 10%, at the high end of guidance and reflects an immaterial impact from foreign exchange, which was in line with guidance.
Excluding an approximate 100 basis point contribution from the AMS Male Urology portfolio acquisition for the month of July, organic revenue growth was 9% in the quarter and 11% on an as-reported basis. As a reminder, we completed the acquisition of the AMS Male Urology portfolio on August 3 last year, so August and September AMS sales were included in our organic sales growth calculation. 
Adjusted gross margin for the third quarter was 72.5%, at the high end of our guidance range and consistent with prior year despite a year-over-year negative 120 basis point impact from foreign exchange. In Q3, as expected, we had lower inventory charges than in Q2, and we're now realizing the full benefit of the lower 2016 standard cost of our products due to ongoing value improvement programs. We continue to expect full year 2016 adjusted gross margin to be approximately 72%, which includes an expected 75 to 100 basis point negative impact from unfavorable foreign exchange. 
Adjusted SG&A expenses were $763 million or 36.2% of sales in Q3, down 70 basis points year-over-year as we realize the benefit of our targeted initiatives focused on reducing SG&A, offset partially by the reinvestment of the medical device excise tax benefit. We continue to believe our full year rate will be approximately 36%, which would be a 140 basis point improvement compared to 2015.
Adjusted research and development expenses were $232 million in the third quarter or 11% of sales, which is down 70 basis points year-over-year. We continue to expect our full year 2016 adjusted R&D rate to be approximately 11% of sales. Royalty expense was 0.9% of sales in Q3, roughly flat year-over-year.
Q3 2016 adjusted operating income grew 17% year-over-year and adjusted operating margin of 24.3% was above our guidance range of 23% to 24% and represented a 120 basis point improvement over Q3 last year, the ninth consecutive quarter in which we have expanded adjusted operating margin by 100 basis points or more over the prior year comparable period.
The Rhythm Management team delivered an adjusted operating margin of 20.1%, up 230 basis points year-over-year. The increase year-over-year is a result of realizing the full benefit of 2016 product costs and leveraging the improved top line performance of the global business. For the first 9 months of 2016, Rhythm Management adjusted operating margin is 17.9%, and we continue to believe that, that segment is on track to deliver an adjusted full year operating margin of 20% in 2017.
With total company adjusted operating margin for the first 9 months of 2016 at 24.3%, this positions us well to achieve our full year adjusted operating margin guidance of 24% to 24.5%, and we remain on track to reach our goal of 25%-plus in 2017 we will provide more guidance on 2017 adjusted operating margin with our Q4 earnings call in February.
Now I'll move on to interest and other expense. Interest expense for the quarter was $58 million, roughly flat to Q3 of 2015. Our average interest expense rate was 3.9% in Q3 this year compared to the same 3.9% in Q3 of last year. Other expenses was $33 million in the quarter and includes approximately $20 million of impairment charges related to certain of our strategic investments. Other expenses for the quarter primarily included foreign exchange losses related to our hedging program. 
Our tax rate for the third quarter was 11.2% on a reported basis and 12.4% on an adjusted basis. We are making progress towards finalizing our conditional stipulation of settled issues with the Internal Revenue Service and expect to make a series of payments related to the settlement, most of which we expect to remit during the second half of 2017 and into the first half of 2018.
Finally, Q3 2016 adjusted earnings per share of $0.27 includes approximately $0.01 of unfavorable FX and represents 12% year-over-year growth or 17% growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Earnings per share upside from the strong revenue and margin performance was partially offset by the $0.01 of impairment charges we recorded. On a reported GAAP basis, which includes net charges and amortization expense totaling $140 million after tax, Q3 2016 EPS was $0.17. 
Adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was $440 million compared to $394 million in Q3 last year, and we continue to pursue inventory management initiatives designed to improve the working capital contribution to cash flow. Given the strong adjusted free cash flow generation year-to-date this year, we believe we can achieve our full year adjusted free cash flow guidance of $1.6 billion. In Q3, we used cash primarily to fund previously agreed legal settlements as well as business development activities. As of September 30, 2016, we had cash on hand of $237 million, and near term, our capital allocation priorities continue to be managing contingencies and pursuing tuck-in M&A. 
We ended the third quarter with 1,380,000,000 fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding. Consistent with our prior guidance, we expect our share count to increase by less than 5 million through the end of 2016. As consistent with our commitment at the time of the AMS Men's Health acquisition last year, we plan to keep the buybacks suspended for the balance of 2016. We expect this to result in a fully weighted average share count of approximately 1,380,000,000 shares for full year 2016. 
I'll now walk through the guidance for the fourth quarter and the full year 2016. For the full year, we now expect consolidated revenue to be in a range of $8,335,000,000 to $8,385,000,000, which represents year-over-year growth of 9% on an organic basis, 12% on an operational basis and 11% to 12% on a reported basis. We continue to expect foreign exchange to be a headwind of approximately $70 million for the full year.
Turning to adjusted earnings per share. We now expect full year 2016 adjusted EPS to be in a range of $1.09 to $1.11, representing 17% to 19% adjusted earnings growth, which continues to assume the full year negative impact of FX will be $0.05. On a GAAP basis, we expect earnings per share to be in a range of $0.32 to $0.34. 
Now turning specifically to the fourth quarter. We expect consolidated revenue to be in a range of $2,140,000,000 to $2,190,000,000. This represents year-over-year growth in a range of 7% to 9% operationally. We expect foreign exchange impact on Q4 revenue to be a slight tailwind. For the fourth quarter, adjusted earnings per share is expected to be in a range of $0.27 to $0.29 per share, and GAAP earnings per share is expected to be in a range of $0.15 to $0.17 per share. Please check our Investor Relations website for Q3 2016 financial and operational highlights, which outlines Q3 results as well as Q4 and full year 2016 guidance, including P&L line item guidance.
And with that, I'll turn it back to Susie, who'll moderate the Q&A."

As you would expect in any given quarter, you'll see some variation in that. Would actually expect that to go back down in Q4, a little more spending in Q4 on SG&A initiatives and such. The full year should be about 18%, which is what we've said consistently that we'd be this year. And I think that puts us right in line to get to that 20% next year in Rhythm Management, which, as part of us getting to 25%-plus as a company, I think gives us the confidence in both those numbers. So I don't think we're going to talk more specifically about the 20%, where it would go from there. Certainly, it goes north of that. We're not going to stop at 20% in 2017. Just as a company, we're not going to stop at 25%. So there's more room in that Rhythm Management segment to increase well beyond 20% as the company goes to, what we've said publicly, our goal of 27% to 28% operating margin by 2020."

We guided to the high end of $175 million to $200 million range for WATCHMAN and TAVR. Really pleased about the CE Mark for Lotus EDGE that we received in one of the valves. We're very early in that phase. But over the long term, particularly I should point to the end of 2017 and the future, '18 and '19, we believe we're very well positioned with our Lotus platform in terms of our launch in these large global markets and eventually Japan, well positioned to gain share. We believe we have the very unique capabilities in terms of our operator control and physician control of the device, excellent PVL rates and our focus on improving the pacemaker rate. So our aim will be to take significant share in these larger markets, and we're building momentum there. So Keith, do you want to touch on TCT?"

We're doing very well outside the United States, and S-ICD is continuing to support us and differentiate that platform. So we're very bullish on the future of our CRM business and the portfolio. And despite that, the team continues to drive operating income margin improvements. So really nice job there. With WATCHMAN, I mean, we're continuing to build momentum there. As you mentioned, the reimbursement headwinds really are beginning to neutralize based on the advances that we've made there. We continue to open up new centers, and we're really tracking. And we're not giving you much visibility to that, and in the future, we'll determine how to do that. But we're continuing to focus on our utilization rate and driving more physician awareness, more patient awareness and, in parallel, doing a really nice job on physician training, so oftentimes, training multiple physicians at the same site to increase utilization.

I think the difference between some of the competitors and SYNERGY is that we have a very large dataset with SYNERGY, and we now have approximately 20,000 patients in multiple clinical trials in a lot of high-risk subsets of patients. And as you know from the 2-year data from the pivotal EVOLVE II trial, best-in-class stent thrombosis rates at 2 years. In fact, no definite stent thrombosis, not a single definite stent thrombosis after the first 24 hours. So we do think safety is an important metric, and we don't think we have any competition in that area. I think what will be interesting at TCT is some of the longer-term follow-up of fully resorbable stents, particularly the 3-year data from ABSORB II because if fully resorbable stents get better, the longer they're in, in terms of remodeling and so on, that will be an important finding. Clearly, the 2-year data in that regard were disappointing. So we also like the acute performance of SYNERGY. The ease of use for interventional cardiologists worldwide is well appreciated. So we're very confident in SYNERGY. We had a very nice Japanese launch, and we think the appreciation of physicians is matched by the growth that you've seen in this quarter's figures."

Dan also mentioned we had a slight impairment with one of our venture investments, but we have a pretty significant venture investment portfolio that we think will bring strong value to the company, I think, as we look out at '18 and '19, which is very exciting. I think just in terms of this deal, it's very consistent, the Endo deal, with our strategy, which is one is to continue to strengthen and diversify the company in the faster-growth markets. So the MedSurg segment is a significant contributor. Endo business is a leader, but we're a little bit lighter in terms of our portfolio in the ambulatory surgery center. We also hadn't offered a pathology solution for this business. So it gives us the capability for -- in the surgery center market, which is a nice extension and expands us into some adjacencies in pathology and fills in a few products in our core business. So it will be a nice tuck-in acquisition, nice cost synergies and probably on a lower-risk scale in terms of integration. But we've also complemented those deals with some nice strong investments. Obviously, you mentioned the WATCHMAN acquisition. And also, I think our -- hopefully, our M&A track record is pretty solid. We're ahead of our deal model with AMS. We've done a very good job, the PI team, with our Bayer acquisition. So we'll continue to look at acquisitions which support the strategy, diversifying into faster-growth markets and category leadership, and we're very active in scanning the market in those areas."

And we'll detail this out at the Investor Day. But it's exciting future as we move into a very large market in TAVR, expanded indications in the future with WATCHMAN, our drug-eluting technologies, the real commitment that we have to neurostimulation, expanding the Deep Brain Stimulation potentially to other areas and really in the field of Endoscopy where our team is looking at breakthrough capabilities to take more general surgery approaches to less invasive procedures.

317627,403595084,1062349,"Boston Scientific Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2016",2016-10-26,"Earnings Calls","Boston Scientific Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Susie. Good morning, everyone. Our third quarter 2016 results are excellent and reinforce the success of our category leadership strategy and the strong execution of our global teams. We continue to grow faster than the market in almost all of",1833,"Thank you, Susie. Good morning, everyone. Our third quarter 2016 results are excellent and reinforce the success of our category leadership strategy and the strong execution of our global teams. We continue to grow faster than the market in almost all of our business units while consistently improving operating income margin. As a result, we continue to deliver strong double-digit adjusted EPS growth. 
Importantly, we are investing in new adjacencies, capabilities and markets that position Boston Scientific for a very exciting future. In third quarter '16, we drove operational growth of 10% and organic revenue growth of 9%, normalized for currency and excluding the impact of 1 month of sales of the AMS acquisition, which anniversary-ed on August 3. Of note, we delivered this 9% organic growth against our toughest comparison of the year, and we leveraged that growth with 120 basis point improvement year-over-year in adjusted operating margin of 24.3%, which beat the high end of our guidance range by 30 basis points. Thus, 9% organic revenue growth in the quarter was leveraged to 12% EPS growth or $0.27 per share, which was at the high end of our guidance range. For the full year '16, we're maintaining our strong guidance and pulling up the low end of our previous ranges, and Dan will provide the details in a few minutes.
I'll now provide some highlights on Q3 results and our Q4 '16 outlook. In my remarks, all references of growth are on a constant-currency organic year-over-year basis, and they exclude the 1-month benefit of AMS unless otherwise specified. 
Organic revenue growth of 9% was broad-based across our businesses and regions, with particular strength from new global product launches, emerging market expansion and share gains led by innovation and our category leadership strategy. On a regional basis EMEA led the pack with 12% growth, followed by the U.S. at 9% and Europe at 5%. Emerging markets sales grew 19%, led by an acceleration in growth in China at 26% and Latin America turning a strong quarter with 21% growth. 
Across our businesses, for the third straight quarter, both our Cardiovascular and MedSurg segments grew sales organically double digits, 12% for cardiovascular and 10% for MedSurg. And Rhythm Management turned in a strong and consistent performance with second (sic) [ third ] quarter sales up 3%. MedSurg continues to deliver excellent growth and strong profitability. MedSurg remains a high-priority segment for the company, with 2 recent tuck-in acquisitions to enhance category leadership in Neuromodulation with Cosman Medical in RF ablation and Endoscopy with the recently announced tender offer for EndoChoice. 
9% global growth in Endoscopy was led by double-digit gains in both our Biliary and hemostasis franchises, with SpyGlass digital DS and the AXIOS stent leading the charge in Biliary, and our newly launched Resolution 360 clip is driving growth in hemostasis. We continue to see upside from new product launches and strong emerging market growth in endo. 
We're also excited about the acquisition of EndoChoice, which we expect to close by year-end. EndoChoice is focused on the development of innovative products and services for gastroenterology health care providers, with a portfolio that's particularly well suited for the ambulatory surgery center. It also brings a portfolio of value-added services to the ASC market, including infection control and pathology services. This acquisition will further enhance the position of Boston Scientific as the global leader in the field of GI endoscopy. As previously announced, we expect to pursue strategic options for EndoChoice's FUSE colonoscope business. We plan to provide an update at or around the time of closing of this transaction.
Turning to Urology and Pelvic Health. Uro and Pelvic Health grew double digits for the third consecutive quarter, up 13% in Q3. We're a strong category leader in the Urology segment, and we delivered broad-based growth across the combined Boston Scientific and AMS portfolio. International sales remained very strong with EMEA, Latin America and emerging markets all growing at double-digit rates. AMS sales grew 5% in the quarter, which is a nice acceleration from trend prior to acquisition. And importantly, our remediation and integration efforts are both on track.
Our Lithovue single-use ureteroscope continues to launch and is enjoying strong uptake in a variety of accounts. And finally, our growth was assisted by tailwinds from our market share capture post Astora's exit from the pelvic health market. 
Neuromod grew double digits, plus 12%, against a strong comp and robust Precision Spectra sales now with full-body MRI compatibility in our Vercise Deep Brain Stimulation platform in Europe. We continue to expect U.S. market entry for Vercise by late 2017 and believe this is an exciting new market opportunity for us.
Cosman Medical, an acquisition announced in July, broadens our Neuromodulation portfolio with RF ablation systems that enable us to offer patients with chronic pain another treatment option in non-opioid therapeutics. We will provide an update on our ACCELERATE clinical trial on our fourth quarter 2016 call. 
In Cardiovascular, segment sales grew 12% and reported an adjusted operating margin of 32.8%, up 160 basis points year-over-year. Peripheral Interventions revenue grew 11% and was led by strong balanced global growth in developed and emerging markets. This is PI's fourth straight quarter of double-digit above-market growth, fueled by our leadership -- category leadership strategy and the depth of our portfolio rather than any single product. 
We drove strong growth in the atherectomy and thrombectomy businesses, and new product launches are also going very well, including the AngioJet ZelanteDVT catheter; the Innova vascular stent; and our drug-eluting technologies, Eluvia DES and Ranger DCB. Finally, we're also pleased with the contribution and integration progress of the Spherical Embolics platform acquired from CeloNova. 
We continue to invest in the peripheral market, particularly in drug-eluting strategies, venous diseases and interventional oncology. Two important clinical trials were presented in the third quarter at the major European peripheral congresses, CIRSE. Our drug-eluting stent, Eluvia, in the MAJESTIC clinical trial demonstrated an unprecedented 92.5% freedom from total lesion revascularization at 2 years. And enrollment continues in our global IDE trial, IMPERIAL. This 92.5% freedom from TLR is of particular note given the patient population studied. 65% of patients had severely calcified lesions and 46% had chronic total occlusions. 
In addition, we reported results for our Ranger Drug-Coated Balloon from 105-patient randomized clinical trial studying the superficial femoral artery. With 94.4% freedom from total lesion revascularization at 6 months, average lesion length was 68 millimeters. We also posted strong results from our Ranger all-comers registry with 91.9% freedom from TLR at 6 months and an average lesion length of 135 millimeters. 
We plan to bring our Ranger DCB to the U.S., and we'll reveal details of our IDE trial shortly. We're excited to be the only company investing in a complete portfolio of drug-eluting therapies.
Turning to Interventional Cardiology. This business segment grew 13% in Q3, led by strong sales in structural heart, drug-eluting stents and PCI guidance or imaging. SYNERGY continues to penetrate the market as we grew worldwide DES sales 14%, and we remain on track to represent 50% to 60% of our global DES revenue mix by the end of fourth quarter. PCI guidance grew mid-teens as well, with strong IVUS catheter and service sales augmented by the ongoing global launch of our COMET FFR system. 
In structural heart, which includes our Lotus transcatheter aortic valve and WATCHMAN Left Atrial Appendage Closure Device, we're driving growth via our unique innovative platform technologies, and they're resonating with physicians and are supported by the strength of our commercial teams. Both franchises are performing very well, and we continue to expect to deliver structural heart revenue at the high end of our $175 million to $200 million guidance for 2016.
We also recently began the early launch of our Lotus EDGE valve in Europe, and thus, the results from our feasibility study of Lotus EDGE will be presented this Sunday at a lunchtime symposium at TCT. Also at TCT next week, we look forward to a number of Lotus presentations, including 4-year outcomes on REPRISE I, 3-year outcomes for REPRISE II and our Lotus EDGE feasibility study with a 7-day discharge data. We expect to present results of REPRISE III, our U.S. pivotal trial and the first to provide head-to-head data, at EuroPCR in May. 
The WATCHMAN platform also delivered an exciting quarter, with strong growth from opening new centers as well as driving growth in existing centers. We're very encouraged to see a strong initial launch in France, where we received higher reimbursement to peers based on the strength of our data. And we expect to enroll our first patient in ASP-II, which is a study examining the use of WATCHMAN in warfarin-ineligible patients before the end of the year.
Turning now to Rhythm Management. Segment sales grew 3%, with another impressive gain in the adjusted operating margins of 20.1%, which is 320 basis points quarter-over-quarter and a 230 basis points growth year-over-year. Growth in CRM at 3% was above market and led by worldwide patient growth of 22%, with meaningful share capture from our premium-based brady MRI device. High-voltage sales declined 4% globally due to replacement cycle headwinds and competitive pressures in the U.S. and MRI-compatible tachy devices. We continue to be pleased with the growth and momentum of EMBLEM S-ICD, which has been fueled by a recent FDA approval for both MRI and MRI-backwards compatibility and increased physician acceptance of this differentiated therapy. 
In Europe, our CRM business grew above market for the 10th consecutive quarter, and in Japan, our above-market growth was driven by a strong launch of EMBLEM S-ICD, transvenous tachy MRI and 3.0T brady MRI. We also achieved important CRM clinical milestones in the quarter, including the first patients enrolled in the APPRAISE ATP trial to help clinicians understand which ICD patients could benefit from antitachycardia pacing and which may be harmed. 
Also, our MultiSENSE trial is accepted as a late breaker for the upcoming AHA scientific sessions in New Orleans. MultiSENSE is an international multicenter, non-randomized study, which is designed to develop and to evaluate prospectively a multi-sensor-based algorithm for the early detection of worsening heart failure. 
In Electrophysiology, 5% growth was led by strength in international markets. In Europe, we are pleased with the early feedback of our IntellaMap OI catheter, which was launched in the second quarter. We expect to launch this catheter in the U.S. in fourth quarter, which, combined with IntellaNav XP and MiFi XP catheters, will unlock the use of Rhythmia to a higher mix of procedures. We remain bullish that continued penetration of our next-generation mapping and navigation system, Rhythmia HDX and the commercialization of our complete portfolio of nav-enabled therapeutic catheters will strengthen our global EP business and improve growth in 2017. 
So to wrap up, I would like to thank our employees for their incredible winning spirit, terrific execution and commitment to the company. So with that, I'll turn it over to Dan for more details on the P&L and guidance."
317627,403595084,1062349,"Boston Scientific Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2016",2016-10-26,"Earnings Calls","Boston Scientific Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Mike. In Q3, we generated organic revenue growth of 9% versus our 7% to 9% guidance range and adjusted earnings per share of $0.27, representing 12% year-over-year growth and hitting the high end of our guidance range of $0.25 to $0.27. The double",1256,"Thanks, Mike. In Q3, we generated organic revenue growth of 9% versus our 7% to 9% guidance range and adjusted earnings per share of $0.27, representing 12% year-over-year growth and hitting the high end of our guidance range of $0.25 to $0.27. The double-digit adjusted EPS growth in Q3 was driven primarily by strong revenue growth and solid gross margin, which was at the high end of our guidance range. 
Consolidated revenue of $2,105,000,000 represented operational revenue growth of 10%, at the high end of guidance and reflects an immaterial impact from foreign exchange, which was in line with guidance.
Excluding an approximate 100 basis point contribution from the AMS Male Urology portfolio acquisition for the month of July, organic revenue growth was 9% in the quarter and 11% on an as-reported basis. As a reminder, we completed the acquisition of the AMS Male Urology portfolio on August 3 last year, so August and September AMS sales were included in our organic sales growth calculation. 
Adjusted gross margin for the third quarter was 72.5%, at the high end of our guidance range and consistent with prior year despite a year-over-year negative 120 basis point impact from foreign exchange. In Q3, as expected, we had lower inventory charges than in Q2, and we're now realizing the full benefit of the lower 2016 standard cost of our products due to ongoing value improvement programs. We continue to expect full year 2016 adjusted gross margin to be approximately 72%, which includes an expected 75 to 100 basis point negative impact from unfavorable foreign exchange. 
Adjusted SG&A expenses were $763 million or 36.2% of sales in Q3, down 70 basis points year-over-year as we realize the benefit of our targeted initiatives focused on reducing SG&A, offset partially by the reinvestment of the medical device excise tax benefit. We continue to believe our full year rate will be approximately 36%, which would be a 140 basis point improvement compared to 2015.
Adjusted research and development expenses were $232 million in the third quarter or 11% of sales, which is down 70 basis points year-over-year. We continue to expect our full year 2016 adjusted R&D rate to be approximately 11% of sales. Royalty expense was 0.9% of sales in Q3, roughly flat year-over-year.
Q3 2016 adjusted operating income grew 17% year-over-year and adjusted operating margin of 24.3% was above our guidance range of 23% to 24% and represented a 120 basis point improvement over Q3 last year, the ninth consecutive quarter in which we have expanded adjusted operating margin by 100 basis points or more over the prior year comparable period.
The Rhythm Management team delivered an adjusted operating margin of 20.1%, up 230 basis points year-over-year. The increase year-over-year is a result of realizing the full benefit of 2016 product costs and leveraging the improved top line performance of the global business. For the first 9 months of 2016, Rhythm Management adjusted operating margin is 17.9%, and we continue to believe that, that segment is on track to deliver an adjusted full year operating margin of 20% in 2017.
With total company adjusted operating margin for the first 9 months of 2016 at 24.3%, this positions us well to achieve our full year adjusted operating margin guidance of 24% to 24.5%, and we remain on track to reach our goal of 25%-plus in 2017 we will provide more guidance on 2017 adjusted operating margin with our Q4 earnings call in February.
Now I'll move on to interest and other expense. Interest expense for the quarter was $58 million, roughly flat to Q3 of 2015. Our average interest expense rate was 3.9% in Q3 this year compared to the same 3.9% in Q3 of last year. Other expenses was $33 million in the quarter and includes approximately $20 million of impairment charges related to certain of our strategic investments. Other expenses for the quarter primarily included foreign exchange losses related to our hedging program. 
Our tax rate for the third quarter was 11.2% on a reported basis and 12.4% on an adjusted basis. We are making progress towards finalizing our conditional stipulation of settled issues with the Internal Revenue Service and expect to make a series of payments related to the settlement, most of which we expect to remit during the second half of 2017 and into the first half of 2018.
Finally, Q3 2016 adjusted earnings per share of $0.27 includes approximately $0.01 of unfavorable FX and represents 12% year-over-year growth or 17% growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Earnings per share upside from the strong revenue and margin performance was partially offset by the $0.01 of impairment charges we recorded. On a reported GAAP basis, which includes net charges and amortization expense totaling $140 million after tax, Q3 2016 EPS was $0.17. 
Adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was $440 million compared to $394 million in Q3 last year, and we continue to pursue inventory management initiatives designed to improve the working capital contribution to cash flow. Given the strong adjusted free cash flow generation year-to-date this year, we believe we can achieve our full year adjusted free cash flow guidance of $1.6 billion. In Q3, we used cash primarily to fund previously agreed legal settlements as well as business development activities. As of September 30, 2016, we had cash on hand of $237 million, and near term, our capital allocation priorities continue to be managing contingencies and pursuing tuck-in M&A. 
We ended the third quarter with 1,380,000,000 fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding. Consistent with our prior guidance, we expect our share count to increase by less than 5 million through the end of 2016. As consistent with our commitment at the time of the AMS Men's Health acquisition last year, we plan to keep the buybacks suspended for the balance of 2016. We expect this to result in a fully weighted average share count of approximately 1,380,000,000 shares for full year 2016. 
I'll now walk through the guidance for the fourth quarter and the full year 2016. For the full year, we now expect consolidated revenue to be in a range of $8,335,000,000 to $8,385,000,000, which represents year-over-year growth of 9% on an organic basis, 12% on an operational basis and 11% to 12% on a reported basis. We continue to expect foreign exchange to be a headwind of approximately $70 million for the full year.
Turning to adjusted earnings per share. We now expect full year 2016 adjusted EPS to be in a range of $1.09 to $1.11, representing 17% to 19% adjusted earnings growth, which continues to assume the full year negative impact of FX will be $0.05. On a GAAP basis, we expect earnings per share to be in a range of $0.32 to $0.34. 
Now turning specifically to the fourth quarter. We expect consolidated revenue to be in a range of $2,140,000,000 to $2,190,000,000. This represents year-over-year growth in a range of 7% to 9% operationally. We expect foreign exchange impact on Q4 revenue to be a slight tailwind. For the fourth quarter, adjusted earnings per share is expected to be in a range of $0.27 to $0.29 per share, and GAAP earnings per share is expected to be in a range of $0.15 to $0.17 per share. Please check our Investor Relations website for Q3 2016 financial and operational highlights, which outlines Q3 results as well as Q4 and full year 2016 guidance, including P&L line item guidance.
And with that, I'll turn it back to Susie, who'll moderate the Q&A."

So obviously, very pleased to be at that 20% here in Q3 for Rhythm Management operating margin. It's 320 basis points sequentially and 230 points year-over-year. As you would expect in any given quarter, you'll see some variation in that. Would actually expect that to go back down in Q4, a little more spending in Q4 on SG&A initiatives and such. The full year should be about 18%, which is what we've said consistently that we'd be this year. And I think that puts us right in line to get to that 20% next year in Rhythm Management, which, as part of us getting to 25%-plus as a company, I think gives us the confidence in both those numbers. So I don't think we're going to talk more specifically about the 20%, where it would go from there. Certainly, it goes north of that. We're not going to stop at 20% in 2017. Just as a company, we're not going to stop at 25%. So there's more room in that Rhythm Management segment to increase well beyond 20% as the company goes to, what we've said publicly, our goal of 27% to 28% operating margin by 2020."

So first, just on the modeling side. It's a little thing, but it stuck out to us, which was that your other income line was an expense of $33 million and that hit EPS by probably up to $0.02.

And importantly, in that category, we're down in the U.S. and down globally, but our European business continues to do well as our Asian business does with a full line of MRI-safe products. And the S-ICD continues to do very well. So despite not having it for what will be a decent part of '17, the pacer business continues to do very well. We're doing very well outside the United States, and S-ICD is continuing to support us and differentiate that platform. So we're very bullish on the future of our CRM business and the portfolio. And despite that, the team continues to drive operating income margin improvements. So really nice job there. With WATCHMAN, I mean, we're continuing to build momentum there. As you mentioned, the reimbursement headwinds really are beginning to neutralize based on the advances that we've made there. We continue to open up new centers, and we're really tracking. And we're not giving you much visibility to that, and in the future, we'll determine how to do that. But we're continuing to focus on our utilization rate and driving more physician awareness, more patient awareness and, in parallel, doing a really nice job on physician training, so oftentimes, training multiple physicians at the same site to increase utilization.

So even prior to some of the challenges that St. Jude has seen, we've been very clear to the marketplace that we have very unique battery technology and also excellent remote monitoring. So I think those 2 features stand the test of time and really been the anchor of our strategy for a number of years now. And we believe, over time, typically as health care modifies and more outcome-based, that having that type of capability is enjoyed by -- certainly by patients and also by physicians. So we think those unique strengths, combined with our commercial team, put us in a good position to compete."

He's done a remarkable job at Boston Scientific. He's been here for 9 years.

So Keith has done a terrific job. Transition is very smooth in the end of the year. Dr. Meredith is joining. Ian is very well known in the structural heart community. Structural heart is a big investment and a key focus area for the company. And so there'll be a seamless transition, and Ian will begin early in the year. So you'll see him at various investor conferences and so forth. But Keith did a great job of transitioning. And again, I think, just to repeat some of the comments earlier. We're very bullish on the future of our Lotus platform for the reasons we've articulated with the PVL rates, the controlled release of this device and the enhancements that depth guard and Lotus EDGE promise to deliver. And we're being very appropriate in terms of the rollout of that. And at TCT, we'll provide some additional information on pacemaker rates and some early clinical studies as well as some additional commentary from Tom Fleming, Keith and Kevin Ballinger."

So we think in our hands, the stand-alone business is performing better and will perform better. And more importantly, the complementary nature of the 2 businesses with Stone, BPH, ED is very comprehensive package for our commercial teams to take to customers. And not only is it very broad-based, but it also has unique clinical differentiation. So the combination of the 2 makes our legacy portfolio stronger.

We don't yet have our largest valve and our smallest valve. And so we're doing quite well in the market with 3 valves, and we'll be excited about getting the additional 2 valve sizes for the full matrix. And I think what's really different is of the same drumbeat. It's a different device. It's a next-generation platform that doctors really enjoy the control that they have with it. And so it's -- I wouldn't say it's easy, but it's easier to differentiate this valve than some of the other balloon expandable devices that they have options to use in Europe. So we're very bullish on the future of it. In terms of France, we expect to have reimbursement by year-end '17.

So really, not one big product, but, overall, you're seeing us increase the R&D spend in those businesses over the past few years. We've been more active in M&A in the Endoscopy, uro and neuromod area.

I think the difference between some of the competitors and SYNERGY is that we have a very large dataset with SYNERGY, and we now have approximately 20,000 patients in multiple clinical trials in a lot of high-risk subsets of patients. And as you know from the 2-year data from the pivotal EVOLVE II trial, best-in-class stent thrombosis rates at 2 years. In fact, no definite stent thrombosis, not a single definite stent thrombosis after the first 24 hours. So we do think safety is an important metric, and we don't think we have any competition in that area. I think what will be interesting at TCT is some of the longer-term follow-up of fully resorbable stents, particularly the 3-year data from ABSORB II because if fully resorbable stents get better, the longer they're in, in terms of remodeling and so on, that will be an important finding. Clearly, the 2-year data in that regard were disappointing. So we also like the acute performance of SYNERGY. The ease of use for interventional cardiologists worldwide is well appreciated. So we're very confident in SYNERGY. We had a very nice Japanese launch, and we think the appreciation of physicians is matched by the growth that you've seen in this quarter's figures."

So the MedSurg segment is a significant contributor. Endo business is a leader, but we're a little bit lighter in terms of our portfolio in the ambulatory surgery center. We also hadn't offered a pathology solution for this business. So it gives us the capability for -- in the surgery center market, which is a nice extension and expands us into some adjacencies in pathology and fills in a few products in our core business. So it will be a nice tuck-in acquisition, nice cost synergies and probably on a lower-risk scale in terms of integration. But we've also complemented those deals with some nice strong investments.
