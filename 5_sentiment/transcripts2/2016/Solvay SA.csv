Thanks all for joining us for this Full Year and the Result Q4 2015 Results presentation. So I'm here in Brussels with Maria and Karim, and we'll try to help you go for the quite significant amount of materials that we've shared with",2190,"Thank you very much. Thanks all for joining us for this Full Year and the Result Q4 2015 Results presentation. So I'm here in Brussels with Maria and Karim, and we'll try to help you go for the quite significant amount of materials that we've shared with you. This is a bit of an exception of full year presentation because we are also sharing with the you pro forma numbers 2015 for Solvay integrating Cytec as of January 1 to give you some base to start to with. So we'll try to cover the most important point another and leave enough time for questions. 
So maybe just as an introduction and the Karim going into most detailed part of our financial results. I think the 2Q for me regarding 2015, that was following transformation acceleration. I think I've shared these words at the beginning of last year. And I think that indeed, we've accelerated very significant transformation, but also delivery, because I think the set of results representing to you shows our focus on delivery. 
Transformation clearly the most important events where the INOVYN JV startup. This is clearly the key milestone for the exit of our European PVC business. JV is up and running since July 1. Very good start, very good results for the first 6 months and we are preparing the way for eventual exits. As you know, we have set conditions to exit this JV. 
On the acquisition side. Obviously, Cytec, very effectively prepared and completed. We are very pleased to be able to close this transaction on December 9. As I've mentioned that we discussed a little bit later, we are already starting very quickly right after the closing of the deal, we started working on synergies, and we are very pleased to see that we are starting in 2016 with already EUR 20 million of gross synergies already in place. But more important, as we've looked into the detail of the business now, we feel very comfortable that indeed, this is a great strategic fit for Solvay. And it puts us into some very good positions, both in the composite technologies with position as #2 player in aerospace with significant growth opportunities in other segments. But also a good complement of our formulation businesses as such, chemistries is concerned. 
And regarding portfolio, clearly, the improvements are not over. The next upgrades will come from the literature. We've said it, but I can't confirm it. This is really our priority in 2016 regarding agendas. It's to make sure that we continue to improve the quality of our portfolio. 
Delivery. I think we have delivered one of earlier strong earnings growth with over full year is up 9.6%. Net sales, up 4%. Q4, however, showed lag, as we expected, seasonality, which is more pronounced versus the past 2 years for. In the recent years, Q4 has become, for us and for a lot of industrial companies, the weakest quarter of the year. But this year, we are expecting a bit more pronounced seasonality. And this was even more significant because we've seen an unexpected in small devices and expected just means that as you might have seen some of the key players in this field are softening of their sales. It means that the, countries we are higher up and they are expecting and reacted very quickly. And we've seen how deliveries to the Smart Device segment in the very last part of the quarter, and this will see the continuation of this phenomena in Q1. You've seen very significantly as we are waiting for the next cycle, which means the next product to be put on the market and this will resume demand in this segment.
Full year REBITDA growth was significant in 3 out of our 4 segments. The ones not going were impacted by the oil and gas decline. We've seen of the Forex, which is good news in 2014 where there is significant growth. But again, a very negative impact of Forex. 
We have been able to almost compensate as far as volumes are concerned the 2 key areas of challenges, oil and gas and acetate cable by very positive development in a number of businesses, the most obvious contributed to this being our Specialty Polymer business and the Advanced Materials segment. 
Pricing power, which is always a question mark by some of you when we are in an environment where we see deflation in raw material and energy cost. We've been able to keep part of the positive impact of the production of our input costs, and it shows that, indeed, we have quite strong position in the large part of our businesses. This led to REBITDA margin increase of 100 basis point to 19%, putting us quite well in comparison with other player in this field.
Moving maybe to Slide 6 and 7 of the presentation. We are giving you a snapshot of how Solvay looks. Pro forma for the Cytec acquisition, which means including Cytec acquisition since January 1 -- January 1, 2016, I mean. EUR 12.4 billion of sales. Very well-balanced profile, both in terms of geography where you see Europe represent today only 30% of our sales, Asia Pacific 33%, North America 27%, Latin America 10%. I think you see a very good -- we see very good exposure, very well-balanced. We've seen a reduction of the [indiscernible], which is good. And we think that's for an innovative company like Solvay. I think represents in North America [indiscernible] 
In terms of end market, we have a very diversified exposure. Automotive and aeronautics representing today almost a fourth of our exposure. Very good because we think that we have a portfolio of technologies, which fits very well with key challenges of this 2 end markets in terms of fuel emission reduction and fuel efficiency and all materials puts is within a very good position to support our customers. 
We've seen earlier the reduction of exposure to [indiscernible] billing and construction, which is something very important for us. 
Electrical and electronics, 6%, but with a very contribution of smart devices segment, which will continue despite what I have just said about Q4 and Q1, which will continue to be aggressive for us to continue to develop our newest technologies and applications. 
So overall, I think a very sound business profile. 
Moving on to Slide 7. We have arranged a little bit, and I know some of you don't like it too much because it makes the [indiscernible] a little bit more complex, but we wanted to make sure that we end up with clusters, which are meaningful. And we have integrated the Cytec businesses into 2 clusters. And by the way, it means that 2 days of business organization of Cytec has been turned into 2 global JV use operating within the Solvay framework and using the just JV operates, so we've been able to integrate very quickly the businesses and having spent a part of January visiting the former Cytec teams and plans. I'm impressed to see our integration took place. 
So we have created a composite matter , which will be part of the Advanced Material clusters. We have created a technology solution Solvay Chemistry GDU, which we'll operate within our Advanced Formulations clusters. And then we have made some very slight rearrangement of businesses, putting all the activities into Functional Polymers, which means moving Emerging Biochemicals into Functional Polymers. And we have also moved Coatis from Advanced Formulations to Performance Chemical because we think that indeed, this business share strategic in turn, which is more aligned with strategic intent of other performance chemical businesses.
And you see on the left-hand side of this slide some of the key numbers. REBITDA, 2,336,000. Important because this is the basis for our 2016 growth. REBITDA margins 19%, no changes. Free cash flow EUR 500 million. CapEx almost EUR 1.1 billion, and we will tell you later what we think this was really the peak CapEx for the year of the combined entity and CFROI at 6.1%. Clearly, an area where we need to improve. 
If you move on to Slide 8, just a snapshot on what we do in terms of lightweight materials. Clearly, I've seen that this is becoming a very significant part of our portfolio. We have an opportunity to add within Solvay a strong position, both in thermoplastic and resins and formulations and the ability, thanks to the Cytec acquisition regarding composite, thanks our own development regarding foams to use these materials to produce the parts. But at the end of the day, will be used in transportation applications, both I/O space and automotive. This being very much aligned with the need to lighten vehicles, both I/O space and automotives to fit with the regulation regarding future migration, which are in place for the automotive sector and which are currently being discussed. But my understanding is that we are close to the conclusion regarding aerospace. 
In automotive, we are already have a strong presence on application, with specialty polymer, for electric or hybrid vehicle. The challenge for us is the move to chassis automotive road application, and this will be the entry point for composite in this segment. 
Aerospace. We are very strong in structure, we are strong in primary structure. We've made an interesting entry in jet engines from. We have some position in interiors, but usually, very significant opportunities to become more important in this segment.
Moving to Slide 9 and spending a minute on formulation and software chemistry. We are clearly a very good complementary between position with , synthetic polymers and the very strong technology position that Cytec is bringing, being Phosphines. We have also some complimentarity in terms of the market that we serve. Cytec is bringing a very strong position in some very, very niche markets like screens. We've been able to develop a very, very high-value application, but there also a strong position in the mining sector where they are helping the launch mining operations to optimize the output and then the cost of the materials that they extract. And we think that even in the current environment and probably even more in the current environment, this is very well with the need of our customers. 
May be one more word on what we've been doing in 2015 just to underline the fact that excellent initiatives continue to be very strong within Solvay. We started this program in 2013. It was a free up program at the -- When we started it, the objective was to generate EUR 600 million of REBITDA impact, thanks to these various program, which covers most of our activities from manufacturing, supply chain innovation, commercial. We have updated our objectives, 800 million to be delivered by 2016. This excludes Cytec, by the way, on the part of the synergy and part of integration activities is to bring our teams into the Cytec operation to help them move also in this mode of large usage of excellent initiatives. We are very confident that we'll meet our target at the end of '16. And by the way, one stop in December 2016 at Excellence Initiatives are concerned. We still have a very strong pipe of opportunities, and you can expect us to come back at the end of '16 with some objectives regarding the next few years. This has demonstrated -- this has turned to be a very significant level of performance within the company and something, which clearly is part of the sales help that we can deliver and which would help us improve our profitability whatever the outside economic situation or scenarios. 
Maybe one last -- 2 last turning 2 before turning to Karim. We have given you an outlook. We'll come back to this -- outlook for the so [indiscernible] -- my last one is on our system ability permit commitments, which is on Slide 11. We have taken the opportunity of the 21 in Paris, a chance to update our own commitment regarding sustainability. We will focus on the more limited number of key priorities, probably the most important one is CO2 emission reduction. We have taken the commitment to reduce CO2 emission intensity by 40% between 2016 and 2015, sorry and 2025. We have are building road map, which this objective. We think it will be a great opportunity for us to demonstrate that indeed the chemical company can make significant reduction in CO2 emission without impacting its profitability. 
We continue to focus very much on safety with the objective to divide by 2 the number of excellence that we have within the company although we are still operating at the benchmark level. And another number of initiatives, I don't want to go into detail of development. Just to mention that we also recognize that our innovation, for the solution, we are bringing to our customers. We will also be able to contribute to some of the very significant challenges that the world is facing. 
And with that, I'll turn to Karim to go into the details of our financial performance."

Before I start into some of the details, I want to recognize very much what Jean-Pierre said, which is we've given you a lot more information than usual and we're going to give you even more in middle of March by gi",2620,"Jean-Pierre, thank you. Good afternoon. Before I start into some of the details, I want to recognize very much what Jean-Pierre said, which is we've given you a lot more information than usual and we're going to give you even more in middle of March by giving you additional phase and segmental information to get you well ahead of our Q1 reporting. 
For today, I'm going to focus mainly on the financial highlights on the Solvay stand-alone basis, but I will refer to the pro forma briefly as well as Cytec. Recognize that Cytec will only contribute to our P&L with this materiality from the January 1, 2016 only of the 6, except for the balance sheet date, which is already incorporated. 
As usual, I'll refer to the charts that are available on the web.
So on Slide 13. I want to pick up were Jean-Pierre left off and talk about our ambitions on sustainability and our targets. I'd like to start with a numbers on the lower hand side, the green numbers. 
There is delivery on sustainability in Solvay in 2015. The intensity of our greenhouse gas emissions is down already 10%. 1/3 of our products are already in the sustainable solutions category and this is before read in the Cytec contribution, which will move this up significantly as well. Very importantly, we have improved our safety performance and the list goes on. I don't want to underestimate the importance of these nonfinancial indicators. They really do matter over the long-term, but financial numbers. We'll come in and talk more about REBITDA and free cash flow for sure, but I will highlight that our net income of EUR 177 million also comes in with CFROI that are stable, reflecting combination of the decline in profits due to oil and gas higher, but also the higher impact operational delivery. We will come back to as well. 
Now turning to Page 14 and looking at the top line. What are the facts? Sales up 4%. As you've seen in the first three quarters, foreign exchange has been very supportive and our volume is next being very strong progress in terms of material, helping to overcome the headwinds that you've also very familiar with, both in terms of oil and gas and acetate cable markets. 
On the latter, we've seen good sequential improvements, given more to come and we're confident that for acetate cable, the worst is behind as. Oil and gas is anybody's guess. If we look at the segment in brief, but again, there are little surprises here. Both combinations are down in terms of sale at 7%. Volumes have back down to 2% and there is oil and gas. I'll take a small detour, maybe quickly briefly mention the impact of chemical. And look at very carefully is that fact that yes, it is adapting to a very challenging market, but is generating cash. 
Name in 2015 has generated EUR 80 million of free cash flow after tax. We're going to. We're actually poised for growing back up to even higher levels if and when market condition recover. Other markets in Novecare have exhibited satisfactory performance to be aggro and that have each posted double-digit growth.
Advanced Materials, mentioned, was more devices. But there's more, there is 6% volume growth in the year, 21% sales advanced for the year as well. Also on the high end applications contributed to that performance. 
Performance Chemicals sales up 5%. Volume is down 2%. No surprise, given what I said and what we've seen in terms of the impact of the destocking in acetate. But by strong performance, strong pricing, in fact, in soda ash and in peroxides. 
Functional Polymers down 10%, largely pricing in commodity environment we're all familiar with. And volumes largely flat minus 1%.
EBITDA. There's a lot that I can say, but there's limited information that is being [indiscernible] I want to focus on the key factors. One, we have Advanced 9.6%. We've done that despite the headwinds that familiar with, supported by foreign exchange, of course. Momentum on more than 300 million again in 2015, well on track towards the higher target of EUR 800 million. Remember, we started 2 years ago with 670 million. So the machine is working well, it's delivering. And we can see it at a number of different areas. Clean innovation is at the heart of Solvay. We can see that coming through, for example, in Specialty Polymers. 
But it's also cost. If we look at the cross bridge, matter of fact, it cost about [ph] 48 million. So you ask yourself, where is the impact? But the 48 million reflects the good cost investment, let's say, as we commission 8 new plants. That comes in the fixed cost. You will see the volumes and the profits come through in the next year or 2 in 2016 and beyond. But that cost is after the mitigation of inflation. And that is really important. 
On the corporate cost point of view, we've really done that with installation, but also mitigated the impact of adverse foreign exchange effects. So it helps us on the bottom line, hurts on the corporate cost as well. So good progress, good discipline and that will continue. Pricing power is evident. This is -- on the hand the quarter sequentially have demonstrated strong sequential price impact. It's I believe 8 -- 8x, so very much on track [indiscernible] totality of this, we are at 18% EBITDA margin, and that is 1 year ahead of what we indicated 2 years ago. 
Again, what is -- good to what we expected and now delivered. Turning to net income on Page 16.
Again, little, but I will highlight 2 things, one is on nonrecurring costs are down against last year 2 45 against 3 0 8. Within that, there's a composition clearly is different. We'll have 130 million related to the Cytec acquisition. 40 million of that you've seen already. You've seen the premium on the contingent hedge that we booked in Q3. We also have the very first part of the initial integrated cost of Cytec. And then you have the very normal and certainly anticipated cost in terms of all the advisory professional fees on M&A in relation to Cytec.
Next, financial charges are lower, but this is 2 [ph] effects of the discount rate impacted environment of provisions, which is up 40 million. One thing we're really clear about is the fact that we're holding steady the tax rate. The underlying tax rate is 30%, significantly better than last year.
Now you'll also notice on Page 37 of our press release and on 2 other references as well the concept of underlying results, our underlying [indiscernible] you can see on Page 16. We are, from the beginning of the first quarter this year, moving towards underlying results. And I'll tell you a bit more that about that in the moment. The intention is to facilitate the understanding. The intention is to facilitate the comparability of our performance. That's really important where there are many moves in portfolio. And it really helps the track exactly how things compare over time. 
And one example, underlying net income will soon become a very helpful proxy from underlying EPS because of growth, please. So that's figuring that. You will see a lot more of that from Q1 going forward.
Page 17. What do you see here? You've got a more expensive illustration of this in the press release on Page 37, you fundamentally have. So the stand-alone IFRS 2015. You have Cytec stand-alone. These will be different from the figures you would've seen from Cytec because they report on a U.S. GAAP basis. So clearly, to do this, we've done 3 things, aligned U.S. GAAP to IFRS. We've adapted their accounting policies to Solvay, [indiscernible] differences but sure they're consistent. Thirdly, we're using obviously the euro as the default currency. 
As the currently funding Cytec, this is intended to help full the impact of the result as we've acquired Cytec on the January 1, 2015.
We then come into an IFRS pro forma column then have adjustments, which gets us underlying. To keep it simple, there 3 things I wanted to note. What did the adjustments represent? One, PPA that you're familiar with. Two, nonrecurring. And we're not changing a single thing around how it's presented, so what you're used to continues, with the exception taking all the way down to first half basis. That is new. And then finally, we've also very well that hybrid debt is in presented differently. And what we're doing now is we're going to look at it as an economic concepts as debt rather than equity. So for this purpose alone, we take as a coupon on the hybrid debt and one of them treat it as IFRS as a dividend. We say no, it's a financial charge. The combination of those 3 factors, nonrecurring first tax, EPA first tax, and again, on the hybrid , we then moved to underlying all the way down to the bottom line.
This will be something that you'll see increasing from Q1 on very complete reconciliation IFRS to underlying. 
Cytec. I'm very aware of the fact that we've acquired it on the month of December and the how well has Cytec gone in the last quarter. What you have here is on the U.S. GAAP basis, in U.S. dollars, excluding one-off items and corporate, the results of Cytec.
The overall message is that it is delivering very much in line with expectations. One or 2 will be on highlight fundamentally if delivery completely in line with what we were expecting when we approached the business and what we're seeing to the market. Aerospace, separation, businesses have achieved significant earnings growth and have helped to offset the weaker performance industrial materials. 
I won't underestimate the achievement of the progress in terms of separation, which as you recall, serves mining and resources significantly. It's a very challenging environment in mine. 
Copper went down from 2.3 to 2.05 in the fourth quarter, aluminum from 1,600 to 1,500 [indiscernible] of tonnes. Almost half of the current aluminum capacity is challenged in terms of cash cost. So challenging environment. Against that, IPS has [indiscernible] its EBIT in the fourth quarter increased by 20%. Its EBIT margin has moved forward as well compared to last year from 30% to 33%. 
But just the fourth quarter for the totality of Cytec, the fourth quarter sales were down 2% at $476 million. EBIT was up 7% and EBIT margin was up from 17 -- from 16% to 17% in the fourth quarter. And that gives you the full year figure that you have before you. 
In other words, there are pluses and minuses. The challenge aspect of the business is industrial materials, but this is something that's not being addressed. It's a very strong action to adapt the business because you basically have a blip that was signaled early in the year by Cytec and also had issues with ERP implementation, which is now behind us. 
But fundamentally, the business is going from strength to strength. And within our hands, we're very, very confident that it will contribute to the top end of our expectations. 
I'll now go back to Solvay only figures. On Page 19, there's quite a lot of information, but what are we saying. We're saying that we are investing more than 2014. No surprise. 180 million increase in our CapEx as indicated. Part of it is impacted by foreign exchange, part of it was very much expected. 
Now we've opened 8 new plants, and this is part of the reason we have a strong conviction, confidence that we're positioned for volume-driven growth in 2016 and beyond. But it's not all great news. Our big projects in Saudi has been delayed by 9 months. So we'll see the benefits of that more towards 2017 more than 2016. That's [indiscernible] around in the 1% impact earnings growth. is not loss, it's just differed for a while, and I will return back to that later. 
Now we said consistently that 2015 will be a peak. And what you see on Page 20 is our CapEx on a pro forma basis. It is 109.2 million, just over 1 billion. Our cash conversion on a pro forma basis is 53%. That's REBITDA, less CapEx by REBITDA. That figure, in terms of cash conversion, is expected to increase. Our CapEx will be contained. The mix of that CapEx will continue to be focused towards high value, high growth, strategically [indiscernible] opportunities to very much position us. And we leash and unleash the value that's embedded in our businesses. 
But the  focus is on cash. So the focus on cash and how we're doing this year. And we've the words sound. What does that mean? It means okay. It doesn't mean particularly strong or week. Why do I say that? 387 million, as a matter of fact, is 120 million lower than the equivalent free cash flow for continuing businesses in 2014. That doesn't look good. When you remember that last year we had some excellent progress on collecting overdue VAT balances, well overdue. And we had a more acute seasonal swing, and we account for those 2 factors, the underlying free cash flow if you like is flat. Why? Because the high profits of delivery in 2015 after tax has funded the increase in CapEx. We will be doing better and [indiscernible] by the outlook. You'll hear us describing that as well. Clearly, the Cytec acquisition has an impact as well. You can see here the fact that we paid 5.1 billion to acquire the business. We've integrated 0.5 billion of debt and we impact of EUR 1.5 billion capital raise. The net debt figure here is highly we expecting. But again, and the same we were saying from an underlying economic basis. We were looking at hybrid coupon as interest rather than equity than dividend. We think the hybrid bonds also looking at debt for this purpose. So economic underlying net debt is EUR 6.6 billion compared to just under EUR 2 billion at the beginning of the year on the same basis. And again, you can see the EUR 2.2 billion of hybrid bonds within that.
That is a factor that I know has been talked about quite a bit in Solvay. What you can see here is essentially the evolution of our debt profile, and there are 3 or 4 things I want to highlight. One, we have raised capital to enable us to prefinanced that debt matures in 2016. 300 million from the European Investment Bank at 3.9% has already been retired in January of this year. We have the to decide eventually to retire hybrid of 0.5 billion at currency costs 6.375%. 
The average cost of debt in Solvay is going down for senior debt is going from 5.2% to 3.3%. The average duration of our debt, which is very important from the risk point of view, is increasing from 3.1 years to 5.6 years. The fact that we now have much more the U.S. profit pool has also motivated us to add U.S. volumes currently at 1.6 billion. Again, from this point of view, very, very effective. 
So fundamentally, what we have is a debt profile we believe is optimized absolutely sustainable. I'm very, very pleased to see the confirmation from the rating agencies that we are investment grade, and we're committed to [indiscernible] over to probably, but we're BAA 2 with a negative outlook and a BBB- stable at S&P. With that, Jean-Pierre?"

So we'll just to conclude by showing with you what our priorities for us for 20 year 2016 now that we see the year moving in. First priority, obviously, is to Cytec integration not only a success, but a quick success. So inte",1464,"Thank you very much, Karim. So we'll just to conclude by showing with you what our priorities for us for 20 year 2016 now that we see the year moving in. 
First priority, obviously, is to Cytec integration not only a success, but a quick success. So integration started very quickly on December 9th. We were able to reduce the 8 quarter structure by 20 million at Johanne. And by the way, this is not the end of story, which shows our focus on delivering results. In fact, we have completely mapped today the cost synergies that we expect to see in the next couple of years, and this gives us the opportunity to leave you a very high level of confidence. the objective for cost synergies alone of over 100 million by the end of 2018, very we want. We expect [indiscernible] 100 million as P&L impact in 2018. On top of that, there will be the top line synergies. We are working also very hard to turn these synergies into action plans, to understand exactly what and when. It's a little bit too early to share with you an update on these numbers. But clearly, we are very confident that you could significantly exceed the total amount of synergies, which we have presented to you when we present of the deal at the end of July 2015. 
Integration is going very well. Teams, Cytec teams are very proactive from a business standpoint. As I was mentioning, I think the 2 are already operating as the other Solvay. We are now working very much on finishing the deliveries of cross synergy  associated with the former activities of Cytec, working into functional and sharp service integration. 
From a business standpoint, we have identified number of opportunities, short-term cross-selling opportunities, but also opportunities to develop new technology solutions to enter into new markets. Just to mention, where we are creating today. Liquid organization to deliver. One is composite. We think that thermoplastic composites are significant opportunities in front of them. Innovative obviously, but also in airspace for application where adding product easier to handle will make sense for the OEMs and [indiscernible] by the way. And we think that with our technology leadership in composite coming from Cytec with the -- our knowledge about thermoplastic resin coming from the Solvay side ideally positioned to come up with high-technology solution. 
Another interesting area is the foam area. I mean, we know today how to form our polymers, which allows to produce a very light product, but very resistant, very resilient. We think that there are significant opportunities in aerospace, mostly for our -- within the cabin application and very Cytec knowledge of the market and the Solvay technologies, which could allow us to make reasonably quickly significant progress. 
We are also leveraging the of our values teams, and again, very positive and very practice mode. By the way, We've been able to bring onboard the people that we have identified as being the key talent of Cytec. And this gives us a feeling that, indeed, this acquisition, in terms of strategic intent, in terms of cross synergies, in terms of opportunities, will be a very significant milestone in the transformation of Solvay. 
But 2016 is also about growth. Contrary to what we've seen last year, we expect to be able to generate volume growth, whole new capacity. We have 8 new site onstream, 5 or 6 of them in Asia. The other 2 in -- the other 2 in -- one in Europe and one in the U.S. The only disappointment is the project. It's a bit of a significant disappointment for 2016 because we will be losing 40 million to 50 million potential REBITDA contribution and by this represent 2% of growth, so something which is feasible. But at the end of the day, no impact because we have a very specific contract support in this projected with guaranteed returns. Once the project starts, we will be able -- we'll see the compensation of those delays coming in. 
I didn't mention it, but delay is not our project itself. The delay is being fact high complex in which we are which we are operating as we'll likely delay started by close to 9 months. 
Hopefully, there's from innovation in various segments. Advanced Materials being once again a very significant provider of innovative solution across the goal. We talked about smart devices, and we expect that for a full year, smart device will be indeed opportunity to bring new solution to our customers. But I could've mentioned batteries, which going well. Medical applications, which is also going well. 
Advanced. We expect also to see innovative solution coming. Personal-care, is -- we have some very specific expectation innovation project, which should come online during 2016. So volume growth, again, will be a significant element of priorities for 2016. By the way, I also mention performance chemical. We have a new plant in Thailand. We have a new Cogentin outside plant in China, and we expect to see some growth coming back in acetate. We see most of the inventory adjustment is now behind us, and we are seeing, again, a pattern in which volumes are going. 
Even functional polymer a business struggling for quite some years, but we see today volume growth. I was reading national plan earlier this week and plant is running at full capacity. And we are clearly seeing opportunities to continue to grow and improve profitability of this. In this business, top priority for 2016 is obviously cash as we've -- as we have mentioned. We recognize that we need to improve our cash conversion. We have decided in 2015 to have a significant CapEx budget, almost EUR 1.1 billion is the combination of Solvay and Cytec, but the project that we've done don't need to be there again. So we have an opportunity to refocus and make sure that we indeed could generate solid cash flow in 2016. And the last priority I mentioned it in the beginning is portfolio upgrade. 
So regarding the outlook. Usually, we don't give such a specific outlook early in the year, but we are listening. All the question and certainty, so it's important to show to how we feel today. So today, we feel confident that we'll be able to grow our REBITDA by high single-digit number versus a base, which is obviously the combination of Solvay and Cytec in 2015, the EUR 2.3 billion that I mentioned at the beginning of the presentation. The growth will be back ended, not so much because we expect the overall global economy to go faster in the second half, but because we have a couple of specific situations in the beginning of the year, mostly in Q1, which will lead to the situation of being ended growth. First one is small devices again. The phenomena that we've seen starting in the last part of the fourth quarter will continue during Q1 until we get into the point of the cycle where new product will be ready to be manufactured before being brought to the market. 
That's one element. The second element is need to oil and gas. We are still a strong comparable. On oil and gas, we're still a strong contributor to our results in Q1 2015. So we started to see a decrease with Q2. So this explain why Q1 in terms of comparison will be a bit challenging and this explains why we expect the REBITDA growth to be back ended in 2016. 
Then we have also, given -- we have also shared with you our free cash flow guidance. We expect free cash flow to exit EUR 650 million. What's important to us is make sure we generate free cash flow, which allows to pay for financial charges and dividend. And we are very confident that in earnings and a strong focus on CapEx, we will be able to generate an amount of free cash flow, which will meet the objective that I just mentioned. 
Obviously, this guidance takes into account the current environment. We don't expect oil and gas to recover. So far, 2016 is a young which current situation will prevail regarding the oil and gas market.
So with that, maybe my last comment is that we decided with the board yesterday to submit to shareholders a proposal to increase our dividend by 3.3%, EUR 3.30 a share. This reasonable growth shows that we are indeed confident that the company will continue to deliver growth. 
With that, I will open to questions and we'll try to make [indiscernible] 20, 25 minutes as we a bit longer than usual in the first part of this call. So we are now open for questions."

Then, a number of news coming from various ads. There was a news a couple of days ago of Bomar EDA getting meaningful orders from Canada, which could add to the production schedule in the next couple of years. We see weaknesses in some specific markets like name, mostly linked to the oil and gas situation. But overall, in a nutshell, the development of planes with much larger composite content is clearly offsetting the fact that we are seeing some in programs with less obvious composite content. So we think aerospace will be obviously a contributor for growth in 2016 for Solvay."

Can you indicate us on what good mix actually means for that business? And was honored to get visibility on 2016 in terms of good mix or bad mix, at least for the first half?

So we'll get compensation over time, which it will start only when we start shipping and invoicing product. So unfortunately for '16, it's -- we won't see the compensation, but the compensation will come as again the return in invested capital guaranteed for the contract. Cytec CapEx, again, the delay is not linked to our plan. Our plant, in fact, is ready to start up. But we don't have the utilities and the units, which could consume what we could produce. So on CapEx, CapEx guidance, I mean the guidance is based on our best view today of [indiscernible] for our business. So yes, we have relocated some of the previous forecast from the Cytec team. But I would say, it's a bit of a normal date linked to some improvements. We've been able to -- in; terms of production output, we've been able to deliver during the course of 2015. Maybe a bit of a more prudent approach in a couple of specific situations. But frankly speaking, no significant difference between guidance made public and what we have made now own plan. On Solvay side, we have, I should say, we've been a little bit more challenging on some of the project, which did not make full sense or not fully in line with our strategy. The vast majority of CapEx project is the one from new capacity in 2015 within Solvay will be focused on the advanced matter clusters where we see a significant opportunities. So again, clearly a cause of all the focus on the project, which makes most sense in terms of delivery. I would add to that that we have started our CapEx excellence project early '15 with the  objective to make sure we get the most out of REBITDA stand. And in some site project, we've seen meaningful impact of this program. Again, we are focusing very much on CapEx efficiency. On the mining business of Cytec, probably I'm a little bit too young in this business, if I may say so, to give you total clarity on whether the mix is supportive on us. We continue to see a situation where both copper and aluminum are product --  making their way into our customers. We clearly even in this challenging environment, customer needs the support of Cytec to improve the efficiency of their -- the first stage of preparations in their operation. We had a couple of innovation opportunities for specific type of mining operation in China, which could also have an impact in the later part of the year.

On the guidance, maybe just to give a bit of granularity as you are seeing maybe not as much as you would dream. On the new CapEx project, accept most of them are first the phase, which means that indeed that we'll 2 at full speed or at full capacity, but we will contribute to our growth in 2016 and from Poland to H2 in China and situation in North America where the situation in market is very tight. To in China, we are reasonably optimistic. We startup of this project is taking 2 place as expected. And yes, indeed, contribution to the 2016 growth will be meaningful. Then on Acetow, clearly, we are back in a situation where we are seeing volume growth. So normalization of the situation will continue. On oil and gas, our view is that after Q1, we should be in a situation where there's a limited negative limited risk. Because in fact, to be blunt, oil and -- unconventional oil and gas exploration and preparation production activities in the U.S. have stopped as with go much further down. And the rest of the business is going to be solid. Unconventional gas in the U.S. unconventional everywhere, so we continue to sell. And by the way, oil and gas today is generating an EBITDA, which is and EBITDA margin, which is very close to the name. So it's 2 another performing business but it's a business, which has seen huge volume last year and we don't expect volume recovery in 2016. On top of that, we expect to continue to see link or especially in Advanced Materials and Specialty Polymer. Smart devices for the whole year, but also batteries. We see strong demand in batteries as we enter into 2016 coming mostly from electric vehicle and even if it sounds surprising coming from China where the electric vehicle program is gaining speed.

Number of question marks regarding overall growth, but a good year of confidence looking at our position, looking at our market, looking at what we've done in 2015 to prepare for this year. And this led us not only to raise our dividend by 3.2%, but this leds us also to reasonably clear guidance in high-single digits. It's really what we want to deliver in terms of EBITDAR growth. Strong focus on free cash flow, 6 50 plus. And yes, we understand that free cash flow generation is keen in the next 2 years. And with that, I think that Cytec was indeed a great acquisition, a very quick integration leading to an upgrade in our 6 cost energy objective, plus the dynamic, which will allow us create opportunities in terms of top line growth.

Thanks, all, for joining us for this Full Year and the Result Q4 2015 Results Presentation. So I'm here in Brussels with Maria and Karim, and we'll try to help you go through the quite significant amount of materials that we've shared",2314,"Thank you very much. Thanks, all, for joining us for this Full Year and the Result Q4 2015 Results Presentation. So I'm here in Brussels with Maria and Karim, and we'll try to help you go through the quite significant amount of materials that we've shared with you. This is a bit of an exceptional full year presentation because we are also sharing with the you pro forma numbers 2015 for Solvay, integrating Cytec as of January 1, to give you some base to start to with. So we'll try to cover the most important points. And at the same time leave enough time for questions. 
So maybe just as an introduction and the Karim going into the most detailed part of our financial results. I think the 2 key words for me regarding 2015 are the following: Transformation acceleration. I think I've shared these words at the beginning of last year. And I think that, indeed, we've accelerated, very significantly, our transformation, but also delivery, because I think the set of results that we are presenting to you shows our focus on delivery. 
Transformation. Clearly, the 2 events, 2 most important events were the INOVYN JV start-up. This is clearly the key milestone for the exit of our European PVC business. JV is up and running since July 1. Very good start. Very good results for the first 6 months, and we are preparing the way for the eventual exit. As you know, we have set conditions to exit this JV. 
On the acquisition side. Obviously, Cytec, very effectively prepared and completed. We are very pleased to be able to close this transaction on December 9. As I've mentioned, but we'll discuss synergies a little bit later, we are really starting very quickly. Right up to the closing of the deal, we started working on synergies. And we are very pleased to see that we are starting in 2016 with already EUR 20 million of cost synergies already in place. 
But more important, as we've looked into the detail of the business now, we feel very comfortable that indeed, this is a great strategic fit for Solvay and it puts us into some very good positions, both in the composite technologies. We have a position as #2 player in aerospace with significant growth opportunities in other segments. But also a good complement of our formulation businesses as surface chemistries is concerned. 
And regarding portfolio, clearly, the improvements are not over. The next upgrades will come from divestiture. We've said it but I can confirm it, this is really our priority in 2016 regarding agenda is to make sure that we continue to improve the quality of our portfolio. 
Delivery. I think we have delivered one other year of strong earnings growth. REBITDA for the full year is up 9.6%. Net sales, up 4%. Q4, however, showed lag, as we expected, seasonality, which is more pronounced versus the past 2 years. In the recent years, Q4 has become, for us and for a lot of industrial companies, the weakest quarter of the year. But this year, we are expecting a bit more pronounced seasonality. And this was even -- it was more significant because we've seen an unexpected destocking in small devices. Unexpected just means that as you might have seen, some of the key players in this field are -- have announced a softening of their sales. It means that they ended up with inventories which were higher than what they were expecting, and they've reacted very quickly. And we've seen our deliveries to the Smart Device segment in the very last part of the quarter, and this will -- we'll see the continuation of this phenomena in Q1. So you've seen very significantly as we are waiting for the next cycle, which means the next product to be put on the market. And this will resume demand in this segment.
Full year REBITDA growth was very significant in 3 out of our 4 segments. The ones which was not growing were impacted by the oil and gas decline. We've seen a very supportive Forex, which is good news after a year in 2014, where we've delivered significant growth but against a very negative impact of Forex. 
We have been able to almost compensate as far as volumes are concerned. The 2 key areas of challenges, oil and gas and acetate cable by very positive development in a number of businesses, the most obvious contributor to this being our Specialty Polymer business and the Advanced Materials segment. 
Pricing power was very strong, which is always a question mark by some of you when we are in an environment where we see deflation in raw material and energy costs. We've been able to keep part of the positive impact of the selection [ph] of input costs, and it shows that, indeed, we have quite strong position in the large part of our businesses. This led to REBITDA margin increase of 100 basis point to 19%, putting us quite well in comparison with other player in this field.
Moving maybe to Slide 6 and 7 of the presentation. We are giving you a snapshot of how Solvay looks pro forma for the Cytec acquisition, which means including Cytec acquisition since January 1 -- January 1, 2016, I mean. EUR 12.4 billion of sales, a very well-balanced profile, both in terms of geography where you see Europe represent today only 30% of our sales; Asia Pacific, 33%; North America, 27%; Latin America, 10%. I think you see a very good -- we see the very good exposure, very well-balanced. We've seen a reduction of the of the share of Europe, which is good. And we think that's for an innovative chemical company like Solvay, having a strong presence in North America is also a must. 
In terms of end market, we have a very diversified exposure. Automotive and aeronautics representing today almost 1/4 of our exposure. Very good because we think that we have a portfolio of technologies which fits very well with key challenges of this 2 end markets in terms of C02emission reduction and fuel efficiency, and our lightweighting materials puts us really in a very good position to support our customers. 
We've seen over the years a reduction of our exposure to building and construction, which I think is also something very important for us. 
Electrical and electronics, 6%, but with a very contribution of the smart devices segment, which will continue despite what I've just said about Q4 and Q1, which will continue to be a great area for us to continue to develop our newest technologies and applications. So overall, I think a very sound business profile. 
Moving on to Slide 7. We have rearranged a little bit, and I know some of you don't like it too much because it makes the modeling a little bit more complex, but we wanted to make sure that we end up with clusters, which are meaningful. And we have integrated the Cytec businesses into 2 clusters. And by the way, it means that 2 days of business organization of Cytec has been turned into 2 global GBUs operating within the Solvay framework and using the -- just as the other GBUS operates. So we've been able to integrate very quickly the businesses. And having spent a part of January visiting the former Cytec teams and plants, I'm impressed to see how quickly integration took place. 
So we have created a composite material GBU, which will be part of the Advanced Material clusters. We have created a technology solution surface chemistry GBU, which will operate within our Advanced Formulations clusters. And then we have made some very slight rearrangement of businesses, putting all the chlorovinyl activities into Functional Polymers, which means moving Emerging Biochemicals into Functional Polymers. And we have also moved Coatis from Advanced Formulations to Performance Chemical because we think that, indeed, this business share strategic intent, which is more aligned with strategic intent of other performance chemical businesses.
And you see on the left-hand side of this slide some of the key numbers. REBITDA, EUR 2,336,000. Important because this is the basis for our 2016 growth. REBITDA margin19%, no changes. Free cash flow EUR 500 million. CapEx almost EUR 1.1 billion. And we will tell you later, but we think this was really the peak CapEx for the year of the combined entity. And CFROI at 6.1%, clearly, an area where we need to improve. 
If you move on to Slide 8, just a snapshot on what we do in terms of lightweighting materials. Clearly, I've seen that this is becoming a very significant part of our portfolio. We have the opportunity to have within Solvay a strong position, both in thermoplastic and thermoset resins and formulations and the ability, thanks to the Cytec acquisition regarding composite, thanks our own development regarding foams to use these materials to produce the parts, but at the end of the day, will be used in transportation applications, both at aerospace and automotive. This being very much aligned with the need to lighten vehicles, both aerospace and automotives to fit with the regulation regarding CO2 emission regualtions which are in place for the automotive sector and which are currently being discussed. But my understanding is that we are close to the conclusion regarding aerospace. 
In automotive, we already have a strong presence in under-the-hood application with Polyamide, with Specialty Polymer battery for electric or hybrid vehicle. The challenge for us is to move into chassis upper-body hood application, and this will be the entry point for composite in this segment. 
For Aerospace, we are very strong in secondary structure. We are strong in primary structure. We've made a very interesting entry in jet engines with the LEAP engine from Safran and GE. We have some position in cabin interiors, but clearly, very significant opportunities to become more important in this segment.
Moving to Slide 9, and just spending a minute on formulation and surface chemistry. We are clearly a very good complementarity between our position within healthcare in mild surfactants, natural guar, synthetic polymers, and we have a very strong technology position that Cytec is bringing, being phosphines. 
We have also some complimentarity in terms of the market that we serve. Cytec is bringing a very strong position in some very, very niche markets like screens where we've been able to develop a very, very high-value application [ph] that are also a strong position in the mining sector where they are helping the launch mining operations to optimize the output and then the cost of the materials that they extract. And we think that even in the current environment and probably even more in the current environment, this is very well with the needs of our customers. 
Maybe one more word on what we've been doing in 2015, just to underline the fact that excellent initiatives continue to be very strong within Solvay. 
We started this program in 2013. It was a free up program at the -- when we started it, the objective was to generate EUR 600 million of REBITDA impact, thanks to these various program, which covers most of our activities from manufacturing, supply chain innovation, commercial. We have upgraded our objectives, EUR 800 million to be delivered by 2016. This excludes Cytec, by the way, on the part of the synergy and part of integration activities is to bring our teams into the Cytec operation to help them move also in this mode of large usage of excellent initiatives. 
We are very confident that we'll meet our target at the end of '16. And by the way, the show won't stop in December 2016 as far as Excellence Initiatives are concerned. We still have a very strong pipe of opportunities, and you can expect us to come back at the end of '16 with some objectives regarding the next few years. This has turned -- this demonstrated -- this has turned to be a very significant level of performance within the company and something, which clearly is part of the sales help that we can deliver and which would help us improve our profitability whatever the outside economic situation or scenarios. 
Maybe one last word before turning to -- maybe one last 2 -- or 2 last words, I'm sorry, before turning to Karim. We have given you an outlook. We'll come back to this at the -- We'll come back -- no, sorry. I think the -- sorry, I think [indiscernible]. So my last word is on our sustainability commitments, which is on Slide 11. We have taken the opportunity of the COP21 in Paris, the conference on climate change to update our own commitment regarding sustainability. We will focus on the more limited number of key priorities. Probably the most important one is CO2 emission reduction. We have taken the commitment to reduce CO2 emission intensity by 40% between 2016 and -- 2015, sorry and 2025. We are building the road map to achieve this objective. We think it will be a great opportunity for us to demonstrate that indeed, a chemical company can make significant reduction in CO2 emission without impacting its profitability. 
We continue to focus very much on safety with the objective to divide by 2 the number of accidents that we have within the company, although we are still operating at the benchmark level. 
And another number of initiatives, I don't want to go into detail of all of them, just to mention that we also recognize that through our innovation, through the solution, we are bringing to our customers, we will also be able to contribute to some of this very significant challenges that the world is facing. 
And with that, I'll turn to Karim to go into the details of our financial performance."

Before I start into some of the details, I want to recognize very much what Jean-Pierre said, which is was we have given you a lot more information than usual, and we're going to give you even more in middle of Marc",2792,"Jean-Pierre, thank you. Good afternoon. Before I start into some of the details, I want to recognize very much what Jean-Pierre said, which is was we have given you a lot more information than usual, and we're going to give you even more in middle of March by giving you additional phased and segmental information to get you well ahead of our Q1 reporting. 
For today, I'm going to focus mainly on the financial highlights on the Solvay standalone basis, but I will refer to the pro forma briefly as well as Cytec, recognizing that Cytec will only contribute to our P&L on the basis of materiality from the January 1, 2016, obviously except for the balance sheet data, which is already incorporated. As usual, I'll refer to the charts that are available on the web.
So on Slide 13. I want to pick up were Jean-Pierre left off and talk about our ambitions on sustainability and our targets. I'd like to start with the numbers on the right-hand side, the green numbers. 
There is delivery on sustainability in Solvay in 2015. The intensity of our greenhouse gas emissions is down already 10%. 1/3 of our products are already in the sustainable solutions category, and this is before we add in the Cytec contribution, which will move this up significantly as well. Very importantly, we have improved our safety performance. And the list goes on. I don't want to underestimate the importance of these nonfinancial indicators. They really do matter over the long-term, but so do the financial numbers. We'll come in and talk a bit more about REBITDA and free cash flow for sure, but I want to highlight that our net income of EUR 477 million also comes in with a CFROI that is stable, reflecting the combination of the decline in profits due to oil and gas, but also the higher impact to the operational delivery. Dividend, when we're ready, we will come back to as well.
Now turning to Page 14, and looking at the top line. What are the facts? Sales up 4%. As you've seen in the first 3 quarters, foreign exchange has been very supportive and our volume is mixed. There have been very strong progress in terms of advanced material, helping to overcome the headwinds that you're also very familiar with, both in terms of oil and gas and acetate to our markets. 
On the latter, we've seen good sequential improvements. There will be a bit more to come. So we're confident that for acetate tow, the worst is behind as. Oil and gas, it's anybody's guess. 
If we look at the segments in brief, because again, there are no more surprises here, Advanced Formulations are down in terms of sale at 7%. Volumes have dragged that down to 2%, and there is oil and gas. I'll take a small detour, maybe quickly briefly mention the impact of Chemlogics. And one thing we look at very carefully is the that fact that, yes, it is adapting to a very challenging market, but it's generating cash. Chemlogics in 2015 has generated EUR 80 million of free cash flow after tax. Very important to note that.
But we will grow more. We're actually poised for growing back up to even higher levels if and when markets eventually recover. Other markets in Novecare have exhibited satisfactory performance, most notably in agro and in coating that have each posted double-digit growth.
Advanced materials. Jean-Pierre mentioned what's happened in -- with devices, but there's more. There is 6% volume growth in the year. 21% sales advance for the year as well. Auto, other high-end applications have contributed strongly to that performance.
Performance Chemicals. Sales up 5%. Volume is down 2%. Not a surprise, given what I said and what we've seen in terms of the impact of the destocking in acetate tow. But that has also been offset by strong performance, strong pricing, in fact, in soda ash and in peroxides. 
Functional Polymers, down 10%, largely pricing in commodity environment we're all familiar with. And volumes largely flat, minus 1%.
EBITDA. There's a lot that I can say, but there's limited information that is really new news. I want to focus on the key factors. One, we have Advanced 9.6%. We've done that despite the headwinds that we're familiar with, supported by foreign exchange, of course. The momentum on excellence, Jean-Pierre alluded to at more than EUR 300 million again in 2015, well on track towards the higher target of EUR 800 million. Remember, we started 2 years ago with 670 million. So the machine is working well, it's delivering. And we can see it permeating in a number of different areas. Clearly, innovation was at the heart of Solvay. We can see that coming through, for example, in Specialty Polymers. 
But it's also about costs. If we look at the cross bridge, what are the fact? It cost a lot, EUR 48 million. So you ask yourself, where is the impact? But the EUR 48 million reflects the good cost investment, let's say, as we commissioned 8 new plants. That comes in the fixed costs. You will see the volumes and the profits come through in the next year or 2 in 2016 and beyond. But that cost is after the mitigation of inflation. And that is really important. 
On the corporate cost point of view, we've really done that with installation, but also mitigated the impact of adverse foreign exchange effects. So what helps us on the bottom line hurts on the corporate cost as well. So good progress, good discipline, and that will continue. Pricing power is evident. This is -- I don't know how many quarters sequentially we've demonstrated strong sequential price ower. It's 9, I believe -- 8, sorry. Thank you, Maria, 8 times. So we're very much on track. As we look at the totality of this, we are at 18% EBITDA margin, and that is 1 year ahead of what we indicated 2 years ago. 
Again, no news, but it's, for my mind, good to confirm that what we expected is now delivered. 
Turning to net income on Page 16. Again, little news, but I want to highlight 2 things: One is our nonrecurring costs are down against last year EUR 245 million against EUR 308  million. Within that, though, the composition clearly is different. We'll have EUR 130 million related to the Cytec acquisition. EUR 40 million of that you've seen already. We've seen the premium on the contingent hedge that we booked in Q3. We also have the very first part of the -- the initial integrated cost of Cytec. And then you have the very normal and certainly anticipated cost in terms of all the advisory professional fees on M&A in relation to Cytec.
Net financial charges are lower, but this is linked to one-off effects of the discount rate impact on environmental provisions, which is up EUR 40 million. One thing we're really pleased about is the fact that we're holding steady the tax rate. The underlying tax rate is 30%, significantly better than last year.
Now you will also notice on Page 37 of our press release, in 1 on 2 other references as well, the concept of underlying results, our underlying net income, you can see on Page 16. We are, from the beginning of the first quarter this year, moving towards underlying results. And I'll tell you a bit more about that in a moment. The intention is to facilitate the understanding. The intention is to facilitate the comparability of our performance. And that's really important where there are many moves in portfolio. And it really helps to track and trend exactly how things compare over time. And as one example, underlying net income will soon become a very helpful proxy for underlying EPS because of growth, at least. So that's signaling that. You will see a lot more of that from Q1 going forward.
Page 17. What do you see here? You've got a more expensive illustration of risk in the press release on Page 37, you fundamentally, you have Solvay standalone IFRS 2015. You have Cytec standalone. These will be different from the figures you would have seen from Cytec because they report on a U.S. GAAP basis. So clearly, to do this, we've done 3 things: aligned U.S. GAAP to IFRS; we have adapted their accounting policies to Solvay, not huge differences but absolutely made sure they're consistent; thirdly, we're are using obviously euro as the functional currency. 
There's a column here funding Cytec. This is intended to help full the impact of the result as if we've acquired Cytec on the January 1, 2015. You then come into an IFRS pro forma column then have adjustments, which gets us to underlying. 
To keep it simple, there 3 things I wanted to note. What did the adjustments represent? One, PPA, that you're familiar with. Two, nonrecurring. And we're not changing a single thing around how it's presented. So what you've been used to continues, with the exception taking it all the way down to post-tax basis. That is new. And then finally, we're also very aware that hybrid debt is interpreted differently. And what we're doing now is we're going to look at it as an economic concepts as debt rather than equity. 
So for this purpose alone, we've taken the coupon on the hybrid debt, and rather than treat it as IFRS as a dividend, we say, ""no, it's a financial charge."" The combination of those 3 factors, nonrecurring first tax, PPA post- and then on the hybrid coupon, we then move towards underlying all the way down to the bottom line.
Again, this will be something that you'll see increasing from Q1 onwards with a very complete reconciliation from IFRS to underlying. 
Cytec. I'm very aware of the fact that we've acquired it on the 9th of December, and the market won't know well how well has Cytec done in the last quarter. What you have here is on the U.S. GAAP basis in U.S. dollars, excluding one-off items and corporate, the results of Cytec.
The overall message is that it is delivering very much in line with expectations. One or 2 will be parts that I will highlight, but fundamentally, it's delivering completely in line with what we were expecting when we approached the business and with what the business says tot he market.
Aerospace. In-process separation business separation, businesses have achieved significant earnings growth and have helped to offset the weaker performance in industrial materials. 
I wouldn't underestimate the achievement of the progress in in-process separation, which, as you recall, serves mining and resources significantly. It's a very challenging environment in mining. Copper went down from $2.3 to $2.05 in the fourth quarter. Aluminum from $1,600 to $1,500 a tonne. Almost half of the current aluminum capacity is challenged in terms of cash breakeven costs. So challenging environment. Against that, IPS has moved forward. Its EBIT in the fourth quarter increased by 20%. Its EBIT margin has moved forward as well compared to last year from 20% to 23%. 
If I just look at the fourth quarter for the totality of Cytec, the fourth quarter sales were down 2% at $476 million. EBIT was up 7% and EBIT margin was up from 17 -- from 16% to 17% in the fourth quarter. And that gives you the full year figure that you have before you. 
In other words, there are pluses and minuses. The challenged aspect of the business is industrial materials, but this is something that is now being addressed with a very strong action to adapt the business because basically, you had a bit of a blip that was signaled early in the year by Cytec, and also had issues with ERP implementation, which is now behind us. 
But fundamentally, it's a business that's going from strength to strength. And within our hands, we're very, very confident that it will contribute at the top end of our expectations. 
I'm now going to go back to Solvay-only figures. On Page 19, there's quite a lot of information, but what are we saying? We're saying that we are investing more than in 2014. No surprise. EUR 180 million increase in our CapEx, as we've indicated. Part of it is impacted by foreign exchange. Part of it was very much expected. 
Now we've opened 8 new plants, and this is part of the reason we have a strong conviction, confidence that we're positioned for volume-driven growth in 2016 and beyond. But it's not all great news. Our big projects in Saudi has been delayed by 9 months. So we'll see the benefits of that more towards 2017 rather than 2016. That alone is a 1% impact to the earnings growth. That growth is not lost. It's just deferred a while. And I will [indiscernible] the dollar here. 
Now we said consistently that 2015 will be peak. Now what you see on Page 20 is our CapEx on a pro forma basis. It is EUR 109.2 million, just over EUR 1 billion. Our cash conversion on a pro forma basis is 53%. That's REBITDA, less CapEx divided by REBITDA. That figure, in terms of cash conversion, is expected to increase. Our CapEx will be contained. The mix of that CapEx will continue to be focused towards high-value, high-growth, I would say strategically coherent opportunities to very much position us. And we leash and unleash the value that's embedded within our businesses. 
But the focus is on cash. So the focus is on cash, so how are we doing this year? And we've used the word sound. What does that mean? It means okay. It doesn't mean particularly strong or weak. Why do I say that? EUR 387 million, as a matter of fact, is EUR 120 million lower than the equivalent free cash flow for continuing businesses in 2014. That doesn't look good. When you remember that last year we had some excellent progress on collecting overdue VAT balances, well overdue, and we had a more acute seasonal swing. And when we account for those 2 factors, the underlying free cash flow, if you like, is flat. Why? Because the high profits of delivery in 2015 after tax has funded the increase in CapEx. We will be doing better. And when Jean-Pierre does the outlook, you will hear us describing that as well. 
Clearly, the Cytec acquisition has an impact as well. You can see here the fact that we've paid EUR 5.1 billion to acquire the business. We've integrated EUR 0.5 billion of debt, and you cans see the impact of EUR 1.5 billion capital raised. 
The net debt figure here is higher than you may be expecting. But again, in the same -- we were saying from an underlying economic basis, we were looking at hybrid coupon as interest rather than equity than dividend. We're saying the hybrid bonds we're also looking at debt for this purpose. So economic underlying net debt is EUR 6.6 billion compared to just under EUR 2 billion at the beginning of the year on the same basis. And again, you can see the EUR 2.2 billion of hybrid bonds within that.
That is a factor that I know has been talked about quite a bit in Solvay. What you can see here is essentially the evolution of our debt profile, and there are 3 or 4 things I want to highlight: One, we have raised capital to enable us to prefinance debt that matures in 2016. EUR 300 million from the European Investment Bank at 3.9% has already been retired in January of this year. We have the fire power to decide eventually to retire hybrid of EUR 0.5 billion at currency costs 6.375%. 
The average cost of debt in Solvay is going down -- for senior debt is going from 5.2% to 3.3%. The average duration of our debt, which is very important from our -- from the risk point of view is increasing from 3.1 years to 5.6 years. The fact that we now have much more of the U.S. profit pool has also motivated us to add U.S. bond tranche of EUR 1.6 billion. Again, from this point of view, very, very effective. 
So fundamentally what we have is a debt profile that we believe is optimized, absolutely sustainable and we're very, very pleased to continue to see the confirmation from the rating agencies that we are investment grade and we're committed to, [indiscernible] you know this already probably, but we are Baa2 with a negative outlook with Moody's and a BBB- stable at S&P.
With that, Jean-Pierre?"

First priority, obviously, is to make the Cytec integration not only a success, but a q",1583,"Thank you very much, Karim. So we'll -- I'll try just to conclude by showing with you what are priorities for us for 20 year 2016, and how do we see the year moving. 
First priority, obviously, is to make the Cytec integration not only a success, but a quick success. So integration started very quickly on December 9. We were able to reduce the 8-quarter structure by EUR 20 million at year-end. And by the way, this is not the end of story, but it shows how focused we were on delivering results. In fact, we have completely mapped today the cost synergies that we expect to see in the next couple of years, and this gives us the opportunity to leave you a very high level of confidence, a new objective for cost synergies alone of over EUR 100 million by the end of 2018. In reality, we want -- we expect to add EUR 100 million as a P&L impact in 2018. 
On top of that, there will be the top line synergies. We are working also very hard to turn these synergies into action plans, to understand exactly what and when. It's a little bit too early to share with you an update on these numbers. But clearly, we are very confident that we could significantly exceed the total amount of synergies, which we have presented to you when we presented the deal at the end of July 2015. 
Integration is going very well. Teams -- Cytec teams are very proactive. From a business standpoint, as I was mentioning, I think the 2 GBUs are already operating as the other Solvay's GBUs. We are now working very much on finishing up the deliveries of cost synergies associated with the former corporate activities of Cytec, working into functional and shared service integration. 
From a business standpoint, we have identified a number of opportunities, short-term cross-selling opportunities, but also opportunities to develop new technology solutions to enter into new markets. Just to mention 2 areas where we are creating today the adequate organization to deliver. One is on thermoplastic composite. We think that thermoplastic composite have significant opportunities in front of them in automotive, obviously, but also in aerospace for application where adding a product easier to handle will make sense for the large OEMs, and even the small ones, by the way. And we think that with our technology leadership in composite coming from Cytec with the -- our knowledge about thermoplastic coating coming from the Solvay side, we are ideally positioned to come up with a high-technology solution. 
Another very interesting area is the foam area. We know today how to form our polymers as foams, which allow us to produce a very light product but very resistant, very resilient. We think that there are significant opportunities in aerospace, mostly for -- within the cabin application. And there is really the Cytec knowledge of the market and the Solvay technologies which could allow us to make reasonably quickly significant progress.
We are also leveraging the talent of our various teams, and again, in a very positive and very proactive mode. By the way, we've been able to bring onboard the 3 people that we have identified as being the key talent of Cytec, and this gives us a feeling that, indeed, this acquisition, in terms of strategic intent, in terms of cross synergies, in terms of growth opportunities will be a very significant milestone in the transformation of Solvay. 
But 2016 is also about growth. Contrary to what we've seen last year, we expect to be able to generate volume growth from new capacity. We have new -- 8 new site onstream, 5 or 6 of them in Asia. The other 2 in -- 1 in Europe and 1 in the U.S. The only disappointment is the Sadara project. It's a bit of a significant disappointment for 2016 because we will be losing EUR 40 million to EUR 50 million potential REBITDA contribution. And by the way, this represent 2% of growth, so something which is feasible. But at the end of the day, no impact because we have a very specific contract supporting this projected with guaranteed returns.
So it means that once the project will start, we will be able to -- we will see the compensation of these delays coming in. 
And I didn't mention it but the delay is not our project itself. The delay is linked to the fact that the Sadara complex in which we are -- within which we are operating will likely delay its start-up by close to 9 months.
Growth will also come from innovation in various segments, advanced materials being once again a very significant provider of innovative solutions across the board. We've talked about smart devices, and we expect that for the full year, smart device will be indeed -- will offer us indeed the opportunity to bring new solution to our customers. But I could have mentioned batteries, which is going well, medical applications, which is also going well.
Advanced Formulations, we expect also to see innovative solution coming. Personal care is -- we have some very specific expectation regarding innovation project, which should come online during 2016. So volume growth, again, will be a significant element of priorities for 2016. 
By the way, I could also mention performance chemicals. We have a new bicarb plant in Thailand. We have a new hydrogen peroxide plant in China. And we expect to see some growth coming back in acetate. We think that most of the inventory adjustment is now behind us, and we are seeing, again, a pattern in which volumes are growing.
Even Functional Polymers -- when I say even, it's because we know it's really a business in which we've been struggling for quite some years, but we see today volume growth. I was visiting our Chalampé plant earlier this week, and the plant is running at full capacity. And we are clearly seeing opportunities to continue to grow and improve profitability of this. 
In this business, the top priority for 2016 is obviously cash, as we have mentioned. We recognize that we need to improve our cash conversion. We have decided in 2015 to have a significant CapEx budget, almost EUR 1.1 billion if I look at the combination of Solvay and Cytec. But the projects that we've done don't need to be done again, so we have an opportunity to refocus and make sure that we, indeed, could generate solid free cash flow in 2016. And the last priority, I mentioned it in the beginning, is portfolio upgrade. 
So regarding the outlook, usually, we don't give such a specific outlook early in the year, but we had a feeling that with all the question, uncertainties and so on, it was important to share with you how we feel today. So today, we feel confident that we will be able to grow our REBITDA by a high single-digit number versus a base which is obviously the combination of Solvay and Cytec in 2015, the EUR 2.3 billion that I mentioned at the beginning of the presentation. The growth will be back-ended, not so much because we expect the overall global economy to grow faster in the second half but because we have a couple of specific situations in the beginning of the year, mostly in Q1, which will lead to this situation of having a back-ended growth. The first one is smart devices again. The phenomena that we've seen starting in the last part of the fourth quarter will continue during Q1, until we get into the point of the cycle where new products will be ready to be manufactured before being brought to the market. That's one element. 
The second element is linked to oil and gas. We have still a strong comparable -- we still have -- oil and gas was still a strong contributor to our results in Q1 2015, so we started to see a decrease with Q2. So these 2 elements explain why Q1, in terms of comparison, will be a bit challenging, and this explains why we expect the REBITDA growth to be back-ended in 2016. 
Then we have also given -- we have also shared with you our free cash flow guidance. We expect free cash flow to exceed EUR 650 million. What's important to us is make sure that we generate the free cash flow which allows us to pay for financial charges and dividend. And we are very confident that with growth in earnings and a strong focus on CapEx, we will be able to generate an amount of free cash flow which will meet the objective that I've just mentioned. 
Obviously, this guidance takes into account the current environment. We don't expect oil and gas to recover. So far, 2016 is a year in which the current situation will prevail regarding the oil and gas market.
So with that, maybe my last comment is that we decided with the board yesterday to submit to shareholders a proposal to increase our dividend by 3.3%, EUR 3.30 a share. This reasonable growth shows that we are, indeed, confident that the company will continue to deliver growth. 
With that, I will open to questions, and we'll try to make ourselves available for 20, 25 minutes as we've been a little bit longer than usual in the first part of this call. So we are now open for questions."

So I'll take the second question, and I will leave Karim to take the first and the third one. What do we see in aerospace? Well, obviously, the situation is a bit different program by program, but let me just share with you a few general comments. We see significant growth opportunities coming from 2 programs, which are in ramp-up phase. The F-35 from Lockheed Martin. This fighter jet's production is increasing significantly during the course of 2016, and the latest numbers we've seen coming from the U.S. budget proposal that the President has sent to Congress give us confidence that, indeed, the ramp-up will be there. The second program which is ramping up very well is the LEAP engine from Safran. We are -- in both programs, we are a significant supplier of resin or composite. On the large commercial aircraft, growth is very much in line with previous expectation. We've seen some adjustments here and there, but these adjustments have very minimum impact on us. 747, for example, is a plane in which the composite content is limited. Then a number of news coming from various sides. There was news a couple of days ago of Bombardier getting meaningful orders from Air Canada, which could add to their production schedule in the next couple of years. We see weaknesses in some specific markets like helicopters, mostly linked to the oil and gas situation. But overall, in a nutshell, the development of planes with much larger composite content is clearly offsetting the fact that we are seeing some slowdown in programs with less obvious composite content. So we think aerospace will be, obviously, a contributor for growth in 2016 for Solvay."

And for the first one, to compare U.S. GAAP-based operating profit with IFRS-based figures, 2 things take into account. One, depreciation obviously is one element between operating income and EBITDA, but the other one is the treatment of pension cost accounting. In very simplistic terms, in U.S. GAAP, changes in discount rates can impact the P&L. In IFRS, it goes straight to other comprehensive income. So there's a very clear audit trail from one to the other. Those are the main reasons. It's not about exchange rates or anything else. To your second question, the sensitivities we used to disclose were essentially EUR 100 million for a $0.10 change. Now with Cytec, our best first estimate, okay, we'll refine it, I'm sure, is EUR 130 million. Half of that is conversion. Half of that is transactional. Given, as you know, we tend to hedge forward a lot of our transactional exposures, you can expect the variations to be basically spread over 2 years for any one change. I hope that gives you a good indication on the sensitivities."

Is that smaller pipeline? Is that actually especially related to the 777X opportunity? I think that they were very confident to get it. I don't know if you have an update on that side. And then the second question on Cytec, on the mining side. I think you mentioned good product mix. From memory, that was more already the case in the first half, and the management of Cytec was guiding towards a worse mix in the second half. Can you indicate us on what good mix actually means for that business and whether or not you get visibility on 2016 in terms of good mix or bad mix, at least for the first half? And then actually, a third question if I can sneak that in.

So unfortunately, for '16, it's -- we won't see the compensation, but the compensation will come as, again, the return on invested capital is guaranteed through the contract. Cytec CapEx, and again, the delay is not linked to our plant. Our plant, in fact, is ready to start up, but we don't have today the utilities, the energy and the units which could consume what we could produce. On CapEx guidance, I mean, the guidance is based on our best view today of what is necessary for our business. So yes, we have revisited some of the previous forecast from the Cytec team, but I would say it's a bit of a normal update linked to some improvements they've been able to, in terms of production output, that they've been able to deliver during the course of 2015. Maybe a bit of a more prudent approach in a couple of specific situations, but frankly speaking, no significant difference between their last guidance they've made public and what we have included in our own plan. On Solvay side, we have Solvay legacy, I should say, or historic side, we have also been a little bit more challenging on some of the projects which did not make full sense or were not fully aligned with our strategy. The vast majority of our CapEx projects, especially the ones for new capacity in 2015 within Solvay, will be focused on the Advanced Materials cluster, where we see significant opportunities. So again, it's clearly, across the board, a focus on the project which makes the most sense in terms of delivery. I would add to that that we have started a CapEx excellence project early '15, with the  objective to make sure we get the most out of every dollar we spend. And in some reasonable-sized projects, we've seen a meaningful impact of this program. So again, we are focusing very much on CapEx efficiency. On the mining business of Cytec, probably, I'm a little bit too young in this business, if I may say so, to give you total clarity on whether the mix is supportive or not. We continue to see a situation where, in both copper and aluminum, our products are making their way into our customers. Clearly, even in this challenging environment, customer needs the support of Cytec to improve the efficiency of the first stage of separation in their operation. We have a couple of innovation opportunities for specific type of mining operation in China, which could also have an impact in the later part of the year. I don't know, Karim, if you want to add anything on that."

Nine mines have been deferred, so there is a challenging market. Mines that were anticipated last year being deferred, it's anybody's guess if it's going to happen this year or 2017. What is anticipated, and then again, it was very encouraging, is there's about 100 individual mines that are slated for opening in the next 2 to 4 years. So the midterm outlook is still very, very positive. The importance of that is there's a very significant boost in demand as you fill the pipe with new mines. So the rates of new mine openings is something that's very important in an industry that hasn't seen many curtailments. The majority of the wins, as it happens, have to do with the minerals rather than the alumina aspects of the business. But like Jean-Pierre, I don't have enough visibility and depth in that to see where the greatest profitability come in."

Can you give us some color about the timing of impact of that?"

There's much more project there, and here, I'm really talking Specialty Polymer and Engineering Plastics. But no, we don't expect to see there a slowdown at the end of the year. We continue -- we see a situation where, in Europe and in Asia, I mean, we also have a small position in the U.S. and a small position -- big position, but overall, it's, in absolute terms, small in Latin America. But Europe and Asia, we see reasonably good prospect. I remind you that our growth is the combination of the growth of the market but also increased market share, which continues to be the situation, not increased market share versus competitors but increased market share versus competing materials. And yes, we continue to see this trend to use more and more of these polymers instead of metals in under-the-hood applications. So for us, automotive is a market which should continue to deliver, I would say, high single-digit growth. On the composite for automotive, don't expect anything meaningful soon. You know that it will take a couple of years to continue to work on some projects and, hopefully, see some signs that this is going into production. So it's -- we'll continue to serve some high-end luxury vehicle market, but for larger production vehicle, nothing which will come tomorrow, but clearly, for us, a key focus. And our teams are really organizing themselves to be able to make this possible. PEEK expansion, very well phrased. The question has been prudent. I think it should probably impact us at the end of 2016, but I don't expect the unit to be available for a large part of 2016. So it will be mostly a 2017 event but with, hopefully, some impact during the last months of 2016."

On the very helpful table you gave us about having the 2 stand-alone businesses and then combining them on a pro forma basis, could you explain what the EUR 45 million D&A adjustment is between the combined entity and the underlying number? Is that just, I don't know, different depreciation schedule or something between Cytec and Solvay? And then a couple of business questions. On the mining chemicals business, having had access to the business now for a couple of months, is there any evidence that you have particular exposure to any mines that have been shut down or mothballed? Is there any risk around -- any exceptional risk around that? And then the last question is just on electronics. Apart from the sort of normal seasonal or potentially cyclical trends, are there any, let's say, design functions or anything like that, that you are particularly exposed to, in other words, where a specific redesign of a product may have a very significant impact on your electronics and smartphone exposure?"

But I would say in the next year or 2, we don't see any significant threat there, so the issue is much more, as I've mentioned, the inventory management, which is linked to their own performance in their markets. But on the contrary, we continue to see situations where directionally, our polymers allow for more design freedom, probably the addition of specific properties or functionalities. So our view is going to be positive with the point I've made when I started answering your question, which is that we don't have, obviously, long-term full visibility on what's happening in their labs. Mining, no. I think our view is that if you look at the mines closing and the new one openings, the balance should be positive for us. So no specific identified threats here or there. Karim?"

In fact, part of the EUR 20 million synergies that Jean-Pierre mentioned is exactly that. It's corporate costs leaving through the door. Now the other point is you're absolutely right. It is on the depreciation line, but let me just be a bit more complete in my answer. And that is that when you make acquisitions, one needs to fair value the assets we acquire. We show that as a PPA adjustment for the very major acquisitions such as Cytec, in this case, and Rhodia. We didn't do it for the small ones  like Chemlogics, Flux, Ryton PPS. So what we're doing here is basically take out the PPA component that would have been shown as a PPA adjustment had we considered it material in the past. So yes, it's depreciation, but it's the fair value adjustments of the assets we acquired that we're reversing out to be consistent with the approach that we apply for the bigger ones like Rhodia and Cytec. Does that help?"

My second question is really around the guidance. If I think about the REBITDA growth in the fourth quarter, I think it was about 4%. And obviously, you've talked about some of the sort of one-off factors. But getting up to high single-digit REBITDA growth ex Cytec, can you just give a bit more granularity around some of the building blocks of that bridge on the basis that you entered the year with Novecare on a slightly sort of weaker footing? And if I think about some of the CapEx programs, clearly, that's going to contribute. But normally, you have ramp costs associated with those kind of things.

And on the guidance, maybe just to give a bit of granularity as you were asking, maybe not as much as you would dream. On the new CapEx project, if I except Sadara, most of them are past the ramp-up phase, which means that, indeed, they will contribute, probably not all at full speed or at full capacity, but they will contribute to our growth in 2016 and from silica in Poland to H2O2 in China, through alkoxylation in North America, where the situation of the market is very tight, to vanillin in China, we are reasonably optimistic. I mean, the startup of these projects is taking place -- took place as expected, and yes, indeed, a contribution to 2016 growth will be meaningful. Then on Acetow, clearly, we are back in a situation where we are seeing volume growth. So the normalization of the situation will continue. On oil and gas, our view is that after Q1, we should be in a situation where there's a limited negative -- there's limited risk because, in fact, to be blunt, oil and -- unconventional oil and gas exploration and preparation, production activities in the U.S. have stopped, so it won't go much further down. And the rest of the business is going to be solid. Unconventional gas in the U.S. and conventional everywhere, so we continue to sell. And by the way, our oil and gas business today is generating an EBITDA which is -- an EBITDA margin which is very close to the group average, so it's not an underperforming business. But it's a business which has seen huge volume loss last year, and we don't expect volume recovery in 2016. On top of that, we expect to continue to see growth linked from innovation or derived from innovation, especially in Advanced Materials. This is the case in Specialty Polymer. Smart devices for the whole year but also batteries. We see strong demand in batteries as we enter into 2016, coming mostly from electric vehicle and, even if it may sound surprising, coming from China, where the electric vehicle program is gaining speed. So overall, I would say a reasonable level of confidence that in 2016, we'll see meaningful volume growth, and this gives us confidence regarding the guidance that we've shared with you."

So thank you very much. It's time to bring this call to a close. Thank you very much. Again, we came this morning to share with you some information, which, I think, demonstrated that once again in '15, we've been able to generate a significant amount of growth on top of a number of fundamental improvement in our portfolio. 2016 is, indeed, a challenging year because we see a number of areas of volatility, especially on the commodity side of the equation. A number of question marks regarding overall growth, but a good level of confidence looking at our position, looking at our market, looking at what we've done in especially 2015 to prepare for this year. And this leads us not only to raise our dividend by 3.3%, but this leads us also to reasonably clear guidance. High single digits is really what we want to deliver in terms of REBITDA growth. Strong focus on free cash flow, EUR 650 million-plus. And yes, we understand that free cash flow generation is key in the next years. And with that, I think that Cytec is, indeed, a great acquisition, a very quick integration leading to an upgrade in our fixed cost synergy objective, plus a dynamic which will allow us create, hopefully, opportunities in terms of top line growth. All of this gives us confidence on the fact that Solvay is well positioned in its transformation. And the transformation agenda will continue to be a priority for the top management and all the Solvay team. Thank you very much and talk to you 3 months from now during our Q1 presentation."

Thanks, all, for joining us for this Full Year and the Result Q4 2015 Results Presentation. So I'm here in Brussels with Maria and Karim, and we'll try to help you go through the quite significant amount of materials that we've shared with you. This is a bit of an exceptional full year presentation because we are also sharing with the pro forma numbers 2015 for Solvay, integrating Cytec as of January 1, to give you some base to start with. So we'll try to cover the most important points. And at the same time leave enough time for questions. 
So maybe just as an introduction and the Karim going into the most detailed part of our financial results. I think the 2 key words for me regarding 2015 are the following: Transformation acceleration. I think I've shared these words at the beginning of last year. And I think that, indeed, we've accelerated, very significantly, our transformation, but also delivery, because I think the set of results that we are presenting to you shows our focus on delivery. 
Transformation. Clearly, the 2 events, 2 most important events were the INOVYN JV start-up. This is clearly the key milestone for the exit of our European PVC business. JV is up and running since July 1. Very good start. Very good results for the first 6 months, and we are preparing the way for the eventual exit. As you know, we have set conditions to exit this JV. 
On the acquisition side. Obviously, Cytec, very effectively prepared and completed. We are very pleased to be able to close this transaction on December 9. As I've mentioned, but we'll discuss synergies a little bit later, we are really starting very quickly. Right up to the closing of the deal, we started working on synergies. And we are very pleased to see that we are starting in 2016 with already EUR 20 million of cost synergies already in place. 
But more important, as we've looked into the detail of the business now, we feel very comfortable that indeed, this is a great strategic fit for Solvay and it puts us into some very good positions, both in the composite technologies. We have a position as #2 player in aerospace with significant growth opportunities in other segments. But also a good complement of our formulation businesses as surface chemistries is concerned. 
And regarding portfolio, clearly, the improvements are not over. The next upgrades will come from divestiture. We've said it but I can confirm it, this is really our priority in 2016 regarding agenda is to make sure that we continue to improve the quality of our portfolio. 
Delivery. I think we have delivered one other year of strong earnings growth. REBITDA for the full year is up 9.6%. Net sales, up 4%. Q4, however, showed lag, as we expected, seasonality, which is more pronounced versus the past 2 years. In the recent years, Q4 has become, for us and for a lot of industrial companies, the weakest quarter of the year. But this year, we are expecting a bit more pronounced seasonality. And this was even -- it was more significant because we've seen an unexpected destocking in small devices. Unexpected just means that as you might have seen, some of the key players in this field are -- have announced a softening of their sales. It means that they ended up with inventories which were higher than what they were expecting, and they've reacted very quickly. And we've seen our deliveries to the Smart Device segment in the very last part of the quarter, and this will -- we'll see the continuation of this phenomena in Q1. So you've seen very significantly as we are waiting for the next cycle, which means the next product to be put on the market. And this will resume demand in this segment.
Full year REBITDA growth was very significant in 3 out of our 4 segments. The ones which was not growing were impacted by the oil and gas decline. We've seen a very supportive Forex, which is good news after a year in 2014, where we've delivered significant growth but against a very negative impact of Forex. 
We have been able to almost compensate as far as volumes are concerned. The 2 key areas of challenges, oil and gas and acetate cable by very positive development in a number of businesses, the most obvious contributor to this being our Specialty Polymer business and mobility speaking the Advanced Materials segment. 
Pricing power was very strong, which is always a question marked by some of you when we are in an environment where we see deflation in raw material and energy costs. We've been able to keep part of the positive impact of the selection of input costs, and it shows that, indeed, we have quite strong position in the large part of our businesses. This led to REBITDA margin increase of 100 basis point to 19%, putting us quite well in comparison with other player in this field.
Moving maybe to Slide 6 and 7 of the presentation. We are giving you a snapshot of how Solvay looks pro forma for the Cytec acquisition, which means including Cytec acquisition since January 1 -- January 1, 2015, I mean. EUR 12.4 billion of sales, a very well-balanced profile, both in terms of geography where you see Europe represent today only 30% of our sales; Asia Pacific, 33%; North America, 27%; Latin America, 10%. I think you see a very good -- we see the very good exposure, very well-balanced. We've seen a reduction of the of the share of Europe, which is good. And we think that's for an innovative chemical company like Solvay, having a strong presence in North America is also a must. 
In terms of end market, we have a very diversified exposure. Automotive and aeronautics representing today almost 1/4 of our exposure. Very good because we think that we have a portfolio of technologies which fits very well with key challenges of this 2 end markets in terms of C02emission reduction and fuel efficiency, and our lightweighting materials puts us really in a very good position to support our customers. 
We've seen over the years a reduction of our exposure to building and construction, which I think is also something very important for us. 
Electrical and electronics, 6%, but with a very strong contribution of the smart devices segment, which will continue despite what I've just said about Q4 and Q1, which will continue to be a great area for us to continue to develop our newest technologies and applications. So overall, I think a very sound business profile. 
Moving on to Slide 7. We have rearranged a little bit, and I know that some of you don't like it too much because it makes the modeling a little bit more complex, but we wanted to make sure that we end up with clusters, which are meaningful. And we have integrated the Cytec businesses into 2 clusters. And by the way, it means that 2 days of business organization of Cytec has been turned into 2 global GBUs operating within the Solvay framework and using the -- just as the other GBUS operates. So we've been able to integrate very quickly the businesses. And having spent a part of January visiting the former Cytec teams and plants, I'm impressed to see how quickly integration took place. 
So we have created a composite material GBU, which will be part of the Advanced Material clusters. We have created a technology solution surface chemistry GBU, which will operate within our Advanced Formulations clusters. And then we have made some very slight rearrangement of businesses, putting all the chlorovinyl activities into Functional Polymers, which means moving Emerging Biochemicals into Functional Polymers. And we have also moved Coatis from Advanced Formulations to Performance Chemical because we think that, indeed, this business share a strategic intent, which is more aligned with strategic intent of other performance chemical businesses.
And you see on the left-hand side of this slide some of the key numbers. REBITDA, EUR 2,336,000. Important because this is the basis for our 2016 growth. REBITDA margin 19%, no changes. Free cash flow EUR 500 million. CapEx almost EUR 1.1 billion. And we will tell you later, but we think this was really the peak CapEx for the year of the combined entity. And CFROI at 6.1%, clearly, an area where we need to improve. 
If you move on to Slide 8, just a snapshot on what we do in terms of lightweighting materials. Clearly, I've seen that this is becoming a very significant part of our portfolio. We have the opportunity to have within Solvay a strong position, both in thermoplastic and thermoset resins and formulations and the ability, thanks to the Cytec acquisition regarding composite, thanks our own development regarding foams to use these materials to produce the parts, but at the end of the day, will be used in transportation applications, both at aerospace and automotive. This being very much aligned with the need to lighten vehicles, both aerospace and automotives to fit with the regulation regarding CO2 emission regulations which are in place for the automotive sector and which are currently being discussed. But my understanding is that we are close to the conclusion regarding aerospace. 
In automotive, we already have a strong presence in under-the-hood application with Polyamide, with Specialty Polymer battery for electric or hybrid vehicle. The challenge for us is to move into chassis upper-body hood application, and this will be the entry point for composite in this segment. 
For Aerospace, we are very strong in secondary structure. We are strong in primary structure. We've made a very interesting entry in jet engines with the LEAP engine from Safran and GE. We have some position in cabin interiors, but clearly, very significant opportunities to become more important in this segment.
Moving to Slide 9, and just spending a minute on formulation and surface chemistry. We are clearly a very good complementarity between our position within healthcare in mild surfactants, natural guar, synthetic polymers, and we have a very strong technology position that Cytec is bringing, regarding phosphines. 
We have also some complimentarity in terms of the market that we serve. Cytec is bringing a very strong position in some very, very niche markets like screens where we've been able to develop a very, very high-value application that are also a strong position in the mining sector where they are helping the launch mining operations to optimize the output and then the cost of the materials that they extract. And we think that even in the current environment and probably even more in the current environment, this is very well with the needs of our customers. 
Maybe one more word on what we've been doing in 2015, just to underline the fact that excellent initiatives continue to be very strong within Solvay. 
We started this program in 2013. It was a free up program at the -- when we started it, the objective was to generate EUR 600 million of REBITDA impact, thanks to these various program, which covers most of our activities from manufacturing, supply chain innovation, commercial. We have upgraded our objectives, EUR 800 million to be delivered by 2016. This excludes Cytec, by the way, on the part of the synergy and part of integration activities is to bring our teams into the Cytec operation to help them move also in this mode of large usage of excellent initiatives. 
We are very confident that we'll meet our target at the end of '16. And by the way, the show won't stop in December 2016 as far as Excellence Initiatives are concerned. We still have a very strong pipe of opportunities, and you can expect us to come back at the end of '16 with some objectives regarding the next few years. This has turned -- this demonstrated -- this has turned to be a very significant level of performance within the company and something, which clearly is part of the sales help that we can deliver and which would help us improve our profitability whatever the outside economic situation or scenarios are. 
Maybe one last word before turning to -- maybe one last 2 -- or 2 last words, I'm sorry, before turning to Karim. We have given you an outlook. We'll come back to this at the -- We'll come back -- no, sorry. I think the -- sorry, I think I give you the outlook for the end. So my last word is on our sustainability commitments, which is on Slide 11. We have taken the opportunity of the COP21 in Paris, the conference on climate change to update our own commitment regarding sustainability. We will focus on the more limited number of key priorities. Probably the most important one is CO2 emission reduction. We have taken the commitment to reduce CO2 emission intensity by 40% between 2016 and -- 2015, sorry and 2025. We are building the road map to achieve this objective. We think it will be a great opportunity for us to demonstrate that indeed, a chemical company can make significant reduction in CO2 emission without impacting its profitability. 
We continue to focus very much on safety with the objective to divide by 2 the number of accidents that we have within the company, although we are still operating at the benchmark level. 
And another number of initiatives, I don't want to go into detail of all of them, just to mention that we also recognize that through our innovation, through the solution, we are bringing to our customers, we will also be able to contribute to some of this very significant challenges that the world is facing. 
And with that, I'll turn to Karim to go into the details of our financial performance."

Before I start into some of the details, I want to recognize very much what Jean-Pierre said, which is was we have given you a lot more information than usual, and we're going to give you even more in middle of Marc",2797,"Jean-Pierre, thank you. Good afternoon. Before I start into some of the details, I want to recognize very much what Jean-Pierre said, which is was we have given you a lot more information than usual, and we're going to give you even more in middle of March by giving you additional phased and segmental information to get you ready well ahead of our Q1 reporting. 
For today, I'm going to focus mainly on the financial highlights on the Solvay standalone basis, but I will refer to the pro forma briefly as well as Cytec, recognizing that Cytec will only contribute to our P&L on the basis of materiality from the January 1, 2016, obviously except for the balance sheet data, which is already incorporated. As usual, I'll refer to the charts that are available on the web.
So on Slide 13. I want to pick up were Jean-Pierre left off and talked about our ambitions on sustainability and our targets. I'd like to start with the numbers on the right-hand side, the green numbers. 
There is delivery on sustainability in Solvay in 2015. The intensity of our greenhouse gas emissions is down already 10%. 1/3 of our products are already in the sustainable solutions category, and this is before we add in the Cytec contribution, which will move this up significantly as well. Very importantly, we have improved our safety performance. And the list goes on. I don't want to underestimate the importance of these nonfinancial indicators. They really do matter over the long-term, but so do the financial numbers. We'll come in and talk a bit more about REBITDA and free cash flow for sure, but I want to highlight that our net income of EUR 477 million also comes in with a CFROI that is stable, reflecting the combination of the decline in profits due to oil and gas, but also the higher impact to the operational delivery. Dividend, when we're ready, we will come back to as well.
Now turning to Page 14, and looking at the top line. What are the facts? Sales up 4%. As you've seen in the first 3 quarters, foreign exchange has been very supportive and our volume is mixed. There have been very strong progress in terms of advanced material, helping to overcome the headwinds that you're also very familiar with, both in terms of oil and gas and acetate to our markets. 
On the latter, we've seen good sequential improvements. There will be a bit more to come. So we're confident that for acetate tow, the worst is behind as. Oil and gas, it's anybody's guess. 
If we look at the segments in brief, because again, there are no more surprises here, Advanced Formulations are down in terms of sale at 7%. Volumes have dragged that down to 2%, and there is oil and gas. I'll take a small detour, maybe quickly briefly mention the impact of Chemlogics. And one thing we look at very carefully is the fact that, yes, it is adapting to a very challenging market, but it's generating cash. Chemlogics in 2015 has generated EUR 80 million of free cash flow after tax. Very important to note that.
But we will grow more. We're actually poised for growing back up to even higher levels if and when markets eventually recover. Other markets in Novecare have exhibited satisfactory performance, most notably in agro and in coating that have each posted double-digit growth.
Advanced materials. Jean-Pierre mentioned what's happened in -- with smart devices, but there's more. There is 6% volume growth in the year. 21% sales advance for the year as well. Auto, other high-end applications have contributed strongly to that performance.
Performance Chemicals. Sales up 5%. Volume is down 2%. Not a surprise, given what I said and what we've seen in terms of the impact of the destocking in acetate tow. But that has also been offset by strong performance, strong pricing, in fact, in soda ash and in peroxides. 
Functional Polymers, down 10%, largely pricing in commodity environment that we're all familiar with. And volumes largely flat, minus 1%.
EBITDA. There's a lot that I can say, but there's limited information that is really new news. I want to focus on the key factors. One, we have Advanced 9.6%. We've done that despite the headwinds that we're familiar with, supported by foreign exchange, of course. The momentum on excellence, Jean-Pierre alluded to at more than EUR 300 million again in 2015, well on track towards the higher target of EUR 800 million. Remember, we started 2 years ago with 670 million. So the machine is working well, it's delivering. And we can see it permeating in a number of different areas. Clearly, innovation was at the heart of Solvay. We can see that coming through, for example, in Specialty Polymers. 
But it's also about costs. If we look at the cross bridge, what are the fact? It cost a lot, EUR 48 million. So you ask yourself, where is the impact? But the EUR 48 million reflects the good cost investment, let's say, as we commissioned 8 new plants. That comes in the fixed costs. You will see the volumes and the profits come through in the next year or 2 in 2016 and beyond. But that cost is after the mitigation of inflation. And that is really important. 
On the corporate cost point of view, we've really done that with inflation, but also mitigated the impact of adverse foreign exchange effects. So what helps us on the bottom line hurts on the corporate cost as well. So good progress, good discipline, and that will continue. Pricing power is evident. This is -- I don't know how many quarters sequentially we've demonstrated strong sequential pricing power. It's 9, I believe -- 8, sorry. Thank you, Maria, 8 times. So we're very much on track. As we look at the totality of this, we are at 18% EBITDA margin, and that is 1 year ahead of what we indicated 2 years ago. 
Again, no news, but it's, for my mind, good to confirm that what we expected is now delivered. 
Turning to net income on Page 16. Again, little news, but I want to highlight 2 things: One is our nonrecurring costs are down against last year EUR 245 million against EUR 308  million. Within that, though, the composition clearly is different. We'll have EUR 130 million related to the Cytec acquisition. EUR 40 million of that you've seen already. We've seen the premium on the contingent hedge that we booked in Q3. We also have the very first part of the -- the initial integrated cost of Cytec. And then you have the very normal and certainly anticipated cost in terms of all the advisory professional fees on M&A in relation to Cytec.
Net financial charges are lower, but this is linked to one-off effects of the discount rate impact on environmental provisions, which is up EUR 40 million. One thing we're really pleased about is the fact that we're holding steady the tax rate. The underlying tax rate is 30%, significantly better than last year.
Now you will also notice on Page 37 of our press release, in 1 on 2 other references as well, the concept of underlying results, our underlying net income, you can see on Page 16. We are, from the beginning of the first quarter this year, moving towards underlying results. And I'll tell you a bit more about that in a moment. The intention is to facilitate the understanding. The intention is to facilitate the comparability of our performance. And that's really important where there are many moves in portfolio. And it really helps to track and trend exactly how things compare over time. And as one example, underlying net income will soon become a very helpful proxy for underlying EPS because of growth, at least. So that's signaling that. You will see a lot more of that from Q1 going forward.
Page 17. What do you see here? You've got a more expensive illustration of risk in the press release on Page 37, you fundamentally, you have Solvay standalone IFRS 2015. You have Cytec standalone. These will be different from the figures you would have seen from Cytec because they report on a U.S. GAAP basis. So clearly, to do this, we've done 3 things: aligned U.S. GAAP to IFRS; we have adapted their accounting policies to Solvay, not huge differences but absolutely made sure they're consistent; thirdly, we’re using obviously euro as the functional currency. 
There's a column here funding Cytec. This is intended to help simulate the impact of the result as if we've acquired Cytec on the January 1, 2015. You then come into an IFRS pro forma column then have adjustments, which gets us to underlying. 
To keep it simple, there 3 things I wanted to note. What did the adjustments represent? One, PPA that you're familiar with. Two, nonrecurring. And we're not changing a single thing around how it's presented. So what you've been used to continues, with the exception taking it all the way down to post-tax basis. That is new. And then finally, we're also very aware that hybrid debt is interpreted differently. And what we're doing now is we're going to look at it as an economic concepts as debt rather than equity. 
So for this purpose alone, we've taken the coupon on the hybrid debt, and rather than treat it as IFRS as a dividend, we say, ""no, it's a financial charge."" The combination of those 3 factors, nonrecurring first tax, PPA post-tax and then on the hybrid coupon, we then move towards underlying all the way down to the bottom line.
Again, this will be something that you'll see increasing from Q1 onwards with a very complete reconciliation from IFRS to underlying. 
Cytec. I'm very aware of the fact that we've acquired it on the 9th of December, and the market won't know well how well has Cytec done in the last quarter. What you have here is on the U.S. GAAP basis in U.S. dollars, excluding one-off items and corporate, the results of Cytec.
The overall message is that it is delivering very much in line with expectations. One or 2 will be parts that I will highlight, but fundamentally, it's delivering completely in line with what we were expecting when we approached the business and with what the business says to the market.
Aerospace. In-process separation, businesses have achieved significant earnings growth and have helped to offset the weaker performance in industrial materials. 
I wouldn't underestimate the achievement of the progress in in-process separation, which, as you recall, serves mining and resources significantly. It's a very challenging environment in mining. Copper went down from $2.3 to $2.05 in the fourth quarter. Aluminum from $1,600 to $1,500 barrels a tonne. Almost half of the current aluminum capacity is challenged in terms of cash breakeven costs. So challenging environment. Against that, IPS has moved forward. Its EBIT in the fourth quarter increased by 20%. Its EBIT margin has moved forward as well compared to last year from 20% to 23%. 
If I just look at the fourth quarter for the totality of Cytec, the fourth quarter sales were down 2% at $476 million. EBIT was up 7% and EBIT margin was up from 17 -- from 16% to 17% in the fourth quarter. And that gives you the full year figure that you have before you. 
In other words, there are pluses and minuses. The challenged aspect of the business is industrial materials, but this is something that is now being addressed with a very strong action to adapt the business because basically, you had a bit of a blip that was signaled early in the year by Cytec, and also had issues with ERP implementation, which is now behind us. 
But fundamentally, it's a business that's going from strength to strength. And within our hands, we're very, very confident that it will contribute at the top end of our expectations. 
I'm now going to go back to Solvay-only figures. On Page 19, there's quite a lot of information, but what are we saying? We're saying that we are investing more than in 2014. No surprise. EUR 180 million increase in our CapEx, as we've indicated. Part of it is impacted by foreign exchange. Part of it was very much expected. 
Now we've opened 8 new plants, and this is part of the reason we have a strong conviction, confidence that we're positioned for volume-driven growth in 2016 and beyond. But it's not all great news. Our big projects in Saudi has been delayed by 9 months. So we'll see the benefits of that more towards 2017 rather than 2016. That alone is a 1% impact to the earnings growth. That growth is not lost. It's just deferred a while. And I will turn it back to the dollar here. 
Now we said consistently that 2015 will be peak. Now what you see on Page 20 is our CapEx on a pro forma basis. It is EUR 109.2 million, just over EUR 1 billion. Our cash conversion on a pro forma basis is 53%. That's REBITDA, less CapEx divided by REBITDA. That figure, in terms of cash conversion, is expected to increase. Our CapEx will be contained. The mix of that CapEx will continue to be focused towards high-value, high-growth, I would say strategically coherent opportunities to very much position us. And we leash and unleash the value that's embedded within our businesses. 
But the focus is on cash. So the focus is on cash, so how are we doing this year? And we've used the word sound. What does that mean? It means okay. It doesn't mean particularly strong or weak. Why do I say that? EUR 387 million, as a matter of fact, is EUR 120 million lower than the equivalent free cash flow for continuing businesses in 2014. That doesn't look good. When you remember that last year we had some excellent progress on collecting overdue VAT balances, well overdue, and we had a more acute seasonal swing. And when we account for those 2 factors, the underlying free cash flow, if you like, is flat. Why? Because the high profits of delivery in 2015 after tax has funded the increase in CapEx. We will be doing better. And when Jean-Pierre does the outlook, you will hear us describing that as well. 
Clearly, the Cytec acquisition has an impact as well. You can see here the fact that we've paid EUR 5.1 billion to acquire the business. We've integrated EUR 0.5 billion of debt, and you can see the impact of EUR 1.5 billion capital raised. 
The net debt figure here is higher than you may be expecting. But again, in the same -- we were saying from an underlying economic basis, we were looking at hybrid coupon as interest rather than equity than dividend. We're saying the hybrid bonds we're also looking at debt for this purpose. So economic underlying net debt is EUR 6.6 billion compared to just under EUR 2 billion at the beginning of the year on the same basis. And again, you can see the EUR 2.2 billion of hybrid bonds within that.
Debt is a factor that I know has been talked about quite a bit in Solvay. What you can see here is essentially the evolution of our debt profile, and there are 3 or 4 things I want to highlight: One, we have raised capital to enable us to prefinance debt that matures in 2016. EUR 300 million from the European Investment Bank at 3.9% has already been retired in January of this year. We have the fire power to decide eventually to retire hybrid of EUR 0.5 billion at currency costs 6.375%. 
The average cost of debt in Solvay is going down -- for senior debt is going from 5.2% to 3.3%. The average duration of our debt, which is very important from our -- from the risk point of view is increasing from 3.1 years to 5.6 years. The fact that we now have much more of the U.S. profit pool has also motivated us to add U.S. bond tranche of EUR 1.6 billion. Again, from this point of view, very, very effective. 
So fundamentally what we have is a debt profile that we believe is optimized, absolutely sustainable and we're very, very pleased to continue to see the confirmation from the rating agencies that we are investment grade and we're committed to, state the obvious, you know this already probably, but we are Baa2 with a negative outlook with Moody's and a BBB- stable at S&P.
With that, Jean-Pierre?"
377837,323519878,944202,"Solvay SA, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 25, 2016",2016-02-25,"Earnings Calls","Solvay SA","Executives","Thank you very much, Karim. So we'll -- I'll try just to conclude by showing with you what are priorities for us for 20 year 2016, and how do we see the year moving. First priority, obviously, is to make the Cytec integration not only a success, but a q",1585,"Thank you very much, Karim. So we'll -- I'll try just to conclude by showing with you what are priorities for us for 20 year 2016, and how do we see the year moving. 
First priority, obviously, is to make the Cytec integration not only a success, but a quick success. So integration started very quickly on December 9. We were able to reduce the 8-quarter structure by EUR 20 million at year-end. And by the way, this is not the end of story, but it shows how focused we were on delivering results. In fact, we have completely mapped today as the cost synergies that we expect to see in the next couple of years, and this gives us the opportunity to leave you a very high level of confidence, a new objective for cost synergies alone of over EUR 100 million by the end of 2018. In reality, we want -- we expect to add EUR 100 million as a P&L impact in 2018. 
On top of that, there will be the top line synergies. We are working also very hard to turn these synergies into action plans, to understand exactly what and when. It's a little bit too early to share with you an update on these numbers. But clearly, we are very confident that we could significantly exceed the total amount of synergies, which we have presented to you when we presented the deal at the end of July 2015. 
Integration is going very well. Teams -- Cytec teams are very proactive. From a business standpoint, as I was mentioning, I think the 2 GBUs are already operating as the other Solvay's GBUs. We are now working very much on finishing up the deliveries of cost synergies associated with the former corporate activities of Cytec, working into functional and shared service integration. 
From a business standpoint, we have identified a number of opportunities, short-term cross-selling opportunities, but also opportunities to develop new technology solutions to enter into new markets. Just to mention 2 areas where we are creating today the adequate organization to deliver. One is on thermoplastic composite. We think that thermoplastic composite have significant opportunities in front of them in automotive, obviously, but also in aerospace for application where adding a product easier to handle will make sense for the large OEMs, and even the small ones, by the way. And we are seeing that with our technology leadership in composite coming from Cytec with the -- our knowledge about thermoplastic coating coming from the Solvay side, we are ideally positioned to come up with a high-technology solution. 
Another very interesting area is the foam area. We know today how to form our polymers as foams, which allow us to produce a very light product but very resistant, very resilient. We think that there are significant opportunities in aerospace, mostly for -- within the cabin application. And there is really the Cytec knowledge of the market and the Solvay technologies which could allow us to make reasonably quickly significant progress.
We are also leveraging the talent of our various teams, and again, in a very positive and very proactive mode. By the way, we've been able to bring onboard the 3 people that we have identified as being the key talent of Cytec, and this gives us a feeling that, indeed, this acquisition, in terms of strategic intent, in terms of cross synergies, in terms of growth opportunities will be a very significant milestone in the transformation of Solvay. 
But 2016 is also about growth. Contrary to what we've seen last year, we expect to be able to generate volume growth from new capacity. We have new -- 8 new site on-stream, 5 or 6 of them in Asia. The other 2 in -- 1 in Europe and 1 in the U.S. The only disappointment is the Sadara project. It's a bit of a significant disappointment for 2016 because we will be losing EUR 40 million to EUR 50 million potential REBITDA contribution. And by the way, this represent 2% of growth, so something which is feasible. But at the end of the day, no impact because we have a very specific contract supporting this projected with guaranteed returns.
So it means that once the project will start, we will be able to -- we will see the compensation of these delays coming in. 
And I didn't mention it but the delay is not our project itself. The delay is linked to the fact that the Sadara complex in which we are -- within which we are operating will likely delay its start-up by close to 9 months.
Growth will also come from innovation in various segments, advanced materials being once again a very significant provider of innovative solutions across the board. We've talked about smart devices, and we expect that for the full year, smart device will be indeed -- will offer us indeed the opportunity to bring new solution to our customers. But I could have mentioned batteries, which is going well, medical applications, which is also going well.
Advanced Formulations, we expect also to see innovative solution coming. Personal care is -- we have some very specific expectation regarding innovation project, which should come online during 2016. So volume growth, again, will be a significant element of priorities for 2016. 
By the way, I could also mention performance chemicals. We have a new bicarb plant in Thailand. We have a new hydrogen peroxide plant in China. And we expect to see some growth coming back in acetate. We think that most of the inventory adjustment is now behind us, and we are seeing, again, a pattern in which volumes are growing.
Even Functional Polymers -- when I say even, it's because we know it's really a business in which we've been struggling for quite some years, but we see today volume growth. I was visiting our Chalampé plant earlier this week, and the plant is running at full capacity. And we are clearly seeing opportunities to continue to grow and improve profitability of this. 
In this business, the top priority for 2016 is obviously cash, as we have mentioned. We recognize that we need to improve our cash conversion. We have decided in 2015 to have a significant CapEx budget, almost EUR 1.1 billion if I look at the combination of Solvay and Cytec. But the projects that we've done don't need to be done again, so we have an opportunity to refocus and make sure that we, indeed, could generate solid free cash flow in 2016. And the last priority, I mentioned it in the beginning, is portfolio upgrade. 
So regarding the outlook, usually, we don't give such a specific outlook early in the year, but we had a feeling that with all the question, uncertainties and so on, it was important to share with you how we feel today. So today, we feel confident that we will be able to grow our REBITDA by a high single-digit number versus a base which is obviously the combination of Solvay and Cytec in 2015, the EUR 2.3 billion that I mentioned at the beginning of the presentation. The growth will be back-ended, not so much because we expect the overall global economy to grow faster in the second half but because we have a couple of specific situations in the beginning of the year, mostly in Q1, which will lead to this situation of having a back-ended growth. The first one is smart devices again. The phenomena that we've seen starting in the last part of the fourth quarter will continue during Q1, until we get into the point of the cycle where new products will be ready to be manufactured before being brought to the market. That's one element. 
The second element is linked to oil and gas. We have still a strong comparable -- we still have -- oil and gas was still a strong contributor to our results in Q1 2015, so we started to see a decrease with Q2. So these 2 elements explain why Q1, in terms of comparison, will be a bit challenging, and this explains why we expect the REBITDA growth to be back-ended in 2016. 
Then we have also given -- we have also shared with you our free cash flow guidance. We expect free cash flow to exceed EUR 650 million. What's important to us is make sure that we generate the free cash flow which allows us to pay for financial charges and dividend. And we are very confident that with growth in earnings and a strong focus on CapEx, we will be able to generate an amount of free cash flow which will meet the objective that I've just mentioned. 
Obviously, this guidance takes into account the current environment. We don't expect oil and gas to recover. So far, 2016 is a year in which the current situation will prevail regarding the oil and gas market.
So with that, maybe my last comment is that we decided with the board yesterday to submit to shareholders a proposal to increase our dividend by 3.3%, EUR 3.30 a share. This reasonable growth shows that we are, indeed, confident that the company will continue to deliver growth. 
With that, I will open to questions, and we'll try to make ourselves available for 20, 25 minutes as we've been a little bit longer than usual in the first part of this call. So we are now open for questions."

So I'll take the second question, and I will leave Karim to take the first and the third one. What do we see in aerospace? Well, obviously, the situation is a bit different program by program, but let me just share with you a few general comments. We see significant growth opportunities coming from 2 programs, which are in ramp-up phase. The F-35 from Lockheed Martin. This fighter jet's production is increasing significantly during the course of 2016, and the latest numbers we've seen coming from the U.S. budget proposal that the President has sent to Congress give us confidence that, indeed, the ramp-up will be there. The second program which is ramping up very well is the LEAP engine from Safran. We are -- in both programs, we are a significant supplier of resin or composite. On the large commercial aircraft, growth is very much in line with previous expectation. We've seen some adjustments here and there, but these adjustments have very minimum impact on us. 747, for example, is a plane in which the composite content is limited. Then a number of news coming from various sides. There was news a couple of days ago of Bombardier getting meaningful orders from Air Canada, which could add to their production schedule in the next couple of years. We see weaknesses in some specific markets like helicopters, mostly linked to the oil and gas situation. But overall, in a nutshell, the development of planes with much larger composite content is clearly offsetting the fact that we are seeing some slowdown in programs with less obvious composite content. So we think aerospace will be, obviously, a contributor for growth in 2016 for Solvay."

And for the first one, to compare U.S. GAAP-based operating profit with IFRS-based figures, 2 things take into account. One, depreciation obviously is one element between operating income and EBITDA, but the other one is the treatment of pension cost accounting. In very simplistic terms, in U.S. GAAP, changes in discount rates can impact the P&L. In IFRS, it goes straight to other comprehensive income. So there's a very clear audit trail from one to the other. Those are the main reasons. It's not about exchange rates or anything else. To your second question, the sensitivities we used to disclose were essentially EUR 100 million for a $0.10 change. Now with Cytec, our best first estimate, okay, we'll refine it, I'm sure, is EUR 130 million. Half of that is conversion. Half of that is transactional. Given, as you know, we tend to hedge forward a lot of our transactional exposures, you can expect the variations to be basically spread over 2 years for any one change. I hope that gives you a good indication on the sensitivities."

I guess from memory, the management of Cytec was looking to increase CapEx by over EUR 200 million in '16 versus '15, so I'm just wondering where the lower spending is going to come from. Is that smaller pipeline? Is that actually especially related to the 777X opportunity? I think that they were very confident to get it. I don't know if you have an update on that side. And then the second question on Cytec, on the mining side. I think you mentioned good product mix. From memory, that was more already the case in the first half, and the management of Cytec was guiding towards a worse mix in the second half. Can you indicate us on what good mix actually means for that business and whether or not you get visibility on 2016 in terms of good mix or bad mix, at least for the first half? And then actually, a third question if I can sneak that in. On the HPPO delay, given the contract structure, are you getting compensation this year as a sort of take-or-pay agreement given that you're on time and your customer is not? Or how is that compensation mechanism going to work?"

So we'll get compensation over time, but it will start only when we start shipping and invoicing products. So unfortunately, for '16, it's -- we won't see the compensation, but the compensation will come as, again, the return on invested capital is guaranteed through the contract. Cytec CapEx, and again, the delay is not linked to our plant. Our plant, in fact, is ready to start up, but we don't have today the utilities, the energy and the units which could consume what we could produce. On CapEx guidance, I mean, the guidance is based on our best view today of what is necessary for our business. So yes, we have revisited some of the previous forecast from the Cytec team, but I would say it's a bit of a normal update linked to some improvements they've been able to, in terms of production output, that they've been able to deliver during the course of 2015. Maybe a bit of a more prudent approach in a couple of specific situations, but frankly speaking, no significant difference between their last guidance they've made public and what we have included in our own plan. On Solvay side, we have Solvay legacy, I should say, or historic side, we have also been a little bit more challenging on some of the projects which did not make full sense or were not fully aligned with our strategy. The vast majority of our CapEx projects, especially the ones for new capacity in 2015 within Solvay, will be focused on the Advanced Materials cluster, where we see significant opportunities. So again, it's clearly, across the board, a focus on the project which makes the most sense in terms of delivery. I would add to that that we have started a CapEx excellence project early '15, with the  objective to make sure we get the most out of every dollar we spend. And in some reasonable-sized projects, we've seen a meaningful impact of this program. So again, we are focusing very much on CapEx efficiency. On the mining business of Cytec, probably, I'm a little bit too young in this business, if I may say so, to give you total clarity on whether the mix is supportive or not. We continue to see a situation where, in both copper and aluminum, our products are making their way into our customers. Clearly, even in this challenging environment, customer needs the support of Cytec to improve the efficiency of the first stage of separation in their operation. We have a couple of innovation opportunities for specific type of mining operation in China, which could also have an impact in the later part of the year. I don't know, Karim, if you want to add anything on that."

The business, the Solvay business not the Cytec business, secured 18 new mines, new wins out of 27 that were ordered last year. That's a very strong 2/3 market share. Nine mines have been deferred, so there is a challenging market. Mines that were anticipated last year being deferred, it's anybody's guess if it's going to happen this year or 2017. What is anticipated, and then again, it was very encouraging, is there's about 100 individual mines that are slated for opening in the next 2 to 4 years. So the midterm outlook is still very, very positive. The importance of that is there's a very significant boost in demand as you fill the pipe with new mines. So the rates of new mine openings is something that's very important in an industry that hasn't seen many curtailments. The majority of the wins, as it happens, have to do with the minerals rather than the alumina aspects of the business. But like Jean-Pierre, I don't have enough visibility and depth in that to see where the greatest profitability come in."

There's much more project there, and here, I'm really talking the Specialty Polymer and Engineering Plastics. But no, we don't expect to see there a slowdown at the end of the year. We continue -- we see a situation where, in Europe and in Asia, I mean, we also have a small position in the U.S. and a small position -- big position, but overall, it's, in absolute terms, small in Latin America. But Europe and Asia, we see reasonably good prospect. I remind you that our growth is the combination of the growth of the market but also increased market share, which continues to be the situation, not increased market share versus competitors but increased market share versus competing materials. And yes, we continue to see this trend to use more and more of these polymers instead of metals in under-the-hood applications. So for us, automotive is a market which should continue to deliver, I would say, high single-digit growth. On the composite for automotive, don't expect anything meaningful soon. You know that it will take a couple of years to continue to work on some projects and, hopefully, see some signs that this is going into production. So it's -- we'll continue to serve some high-end luxury vehicle market, but for larger production vehicle, nothing which will come tomorrow, but clearly, for us, a key focus. And our teams are really organizing themselves to be able to make this possible. PEEK expansion, very well phrased. The question has been prudent.

It is on the depreciation line, but let me just be a bit more complete in my answer. And that is that when you make acquisitions, one needs to fair value the assets we acquire. We show that as a PPA adjustment for the very major acquisitions such as Cytec, in this case, and Rhodia. We didn't do it for the small ones like Chemlogics, Flux, Ryton PPS. So what we're doing here is basically take out the PPA component that would have been shown as a PPA adjustment had we considered it material in the past.

But getting up to high single-digit REBITDA growth ex Cytec, can you just give a bit more granularity around some of the building blocks of that bridge on the basis that you entered the year with Novecare on a slightly sort of weaker footing? And if I think about some of the CapEx programs, clearly, that's going to contribute. But normally, you have ramp costs associated with those kind of things.

And on the guidance, maybe just to give a bit of granularity as you were asking, maybe not as much as you would dream. On the new CapEx project, if I except Sadara, most of them are past the ramp-up phase, which means that, indeed, they will contribute, probably not all at full speed or at full capacity, but they will contribute to our growth in 2016 and from silica in Poland to H2O2 in China, through alkoxylation in North America, where the situation of the market is very tight, to vanillin in China, we are reasonably optimistic. I mean, the startup of these projects is taking place -- took place as expected, and yes, indeed, a contribution to 2016 growth will be meaningful. Then on Acetow, clearly, we are back in a situation where we are seeing volume growth. So the normalization of the situation will continue. On oil and gas, our view is that after Q1, we should be in a situation where there's a limited negative -- there's limited risk because, in fact, to be blunt, oil and -- unconventional oil and gas exploration and preparation, production activities in the U.S. have stopped, so it won't go much further down. And the rest of the business is going to be solid. Unconventional gas in the U.S. and conventional everywhere, so we continue to sell. And by the way, oil and gas business today is generating an EBITDA which is -- an EBITDA margin which is very close to the group average, so it's not an underperforming business. But it's a business which has seen huge volume loss last year, and we don't expect volume recovery in 2016. On top of that, we expect to continue to see growth linked from innovation or derived from innovation, especially in Advanced Materials. This is the case in Specialty Polymer. Smart devices for the whole year but also batteries. We see strong demand in batteries as we enter into 2016, coming mostly from electric vehicle and, even if it may sound surprising, coming from China, where the electric vehicle program is gaining speed. So overall, I would say a reasonable level of confidence that in 2016, we'll see meaningful volume growth, and this gives us confidence regarding the guidance that we've shared with you."

So thank you very much. It's time to bring this call to a close. Thank you very much. Again, we came this morning to share with you some information, which, I think, demonstrated that once again in '15, we've been able to generate a significant amount of growth on top of a number of fundamental improvement in our portfolio. 2016 is, indeed, a challenging year because we see a number of areas of volatility, especially on the commodity side of the equation. A number of question marks regarding overall growth, but a good level of confidence looking at our position, looking at our market, looking at what we've done in especially 2015 to prepare for this year. And this leads us not only to raise our dividend by 3.3%, but this leads us also to reasonably clear guidance. High single digits is really what we want to deliver in terms of REBITDA growth. Strong focus on free cash flow, EUR 650 million-plus. And yes, we understand that free cash flow generation is key in the next 2 years. And with that, I think that Cytec is, indeed, a great acquisition, a very quick integration leading to an upgrade in our fixed cost synergy objective, plus a dynamic which will allow us to create, hopefully, opportunities in terms of top line growth. All of this gives us confidence on the fact that Solvay is well positioned in its transformation. And the transformation agenda will continue to be a priority for the top management and all the Solvay team. Thank you very much and talk to you 3 months from now during our Q1 presentation."

Thanks, everyone, for participating in our Q2 call. I would like, as usual, to highlight what I think of the [indiscernible] as what I view as a strong set of results in a market which is still a little bit complex to read. And then K",1402,"Thank you very much. Thanks, everyone, for participating in our Q2 call. I would like, as usual, to highlight what I think of the [indiscernible] as what I view as a strong set of results in a market which is still a little bit complex to read. And then Karim will go a bit deeper in our financial performance.
So probably the 3 key headlines for this set the results is -- are the following: 8% REBITDA growth; solid margin, 22%, it's a record for us, even compared to profile Cytec 2015; and good cash generation. So if you look at how we achieved that, sales volume grew for the first time since Q4 2014, although I have to say a very modest growth. I should probably say more stable than growth. Broad-based volume growth in a number of segments, Advanced Materials, Performance Chemical, Functional Polymers, which overcome a decline in Advanced Formulations, which continues to be related to one specific market which is oil and gas. And clearly, I think the results are the demonstration of the strength and the breadth of our portfolio, which allow us even when we see some segments facing challenges to deliver indeed strong results.
Looking at the REBITDA, 8% growth at 652. 3 out of 4 of our operating segments are indeed showing profitability growth. So if I go through all these segments, Advanced Materials is up 6.3%. We are facing challenges, as you know in the small device market. But despite the specific challenges, we are seeing growth in automotive, healthcare, consumer goods, industrial l market. On the smart device market itself, we expect the second half of the year to be significantly stronger, linked to a product cycle. And as the composite aerospace business is concerned, we are slightly down in terms of volume, which is the consequence of the transition, which is sometimes a little bit difficult to achieve by our customers from their legacy platforms to the new ones. Some of you would listened to [indiscernible] or Boeing results know what this means. So a strong optimism looking forward as we see new programs coming in line with a significantly higher content of Solvay composite products, but we see the transition being a little bit more challenging than some people expected. 
And on top of that, specific weaknesses in business jet and helicopter. But we continued to be very optimistic linked to -- this optimism is linked to the ramp-up of some specific programs which are still in the early phase, which look like very successful program like the joint strike fighter or the lead engine which will be seated both the Airbus 320 Neo and the Boeing 737 Max.
That's in industrial composites, we've seen the trend improving. Interior business which is going into a turnaround type of situation. So in Q2, we've seen volume picking up, which are the results of the efforts of our team to go into new customer, new program with a better level of profitability. And by the way, the cost prediction part of the equation is also very significant as far as industrial composite is concerned.
Advanced Formulations, unfortunately still the same story, significantly down versus the same quarter of last year, linked to oil and gas. Rig count is 50% down versus Q2 2015, although it has stabilized since. So in Q2 -- in Q2, we've seen the rig count start to slightly increase. It is very prudent in view of the current oil price to make any prediction of what this means, but at least the degradation has stopped.
Other key markets continue to grow in this segment, although not enough to compensate for what's happening in oil and gas, but we see strong growth coming from -- from the overall market growth but also specific innovation product being put on the market on personal care, and the growth continues.
The mining environment is still challenging. We've seen some project being delayed, but our business remains resilient. We retained our leadership position and we see some slight growth in this segment.
Performance chemicals, up 20%, very good performance. So that's clearly the significant contributor, but not just with us. I mean we see all of our businesses operating well. Acetate, too, is recovering. The product side business is doing well. And again, soda ash we benefit from both volume growth, good pricing power, but also our ability to continue to improve our cost base.
Functional polymer, up 24%. Major reason this quarter is of course vinyl. Vinyl is now operating almost at capacity, has found its place in the Russian market and it's starting to contribute to our REBITDA.
Polyamide was a little bit impacted by the large maintenance turnaround, but we do every year, so this was the time we did it [indiscernible] a little bit more difficult than expected. So overall, stable performance but which means that the underlying business performance was positive.
On the cash, and Karim will comment more on this, but clearly, we have a strong focus on cash this year. And then I say this year, I expect it to continue in the following year. We focus very much on cash conversion. We have generated 100 -- we had generated EUR 174 million of free cash in Q2, which is a 27% improvement year-on-year compared to last year, as far as continuing the operation is concerned. If I look at the first semester, which is probably a better way to look at cash as there were some of them between the Q1 and Q2, over all, we come EUR 450 million higher than in the first semester of last year, so a strong performance, and clearly, strong focus on cash for the whole organization.
Portfolio, key element is the Cytec integration going very well. In terms of cost synergies, we are generating EUR 40 million in Q2. Run rate, we are almost at EUR 50 million for the yearly impact, and something that -- something which is very much in line with our upgraded objective to generate EUR 100 million, more than EUR 100 million of cost synergies due to this integration. I think that being already at EUR 50 million per year running rate, 6 months after the integration is a very good result for an asset of this size. But synergy is also -- topline synergies, our ability to continue to execute our growth strategy, just to mention a few reasons which I think demonstrates the potential of the combination. Boeing has decided to select Solvay composite material to produce part of the primary structure of the 777X, but very good. It's the first time we are rewarded the primary structure in one of the 2 big OEMs. We already are producing primary structure component for fighter jet or for business jet, but the Boeing entering into Boeing is a very important achievement. The product itself will be produced in a JV that we will set up [indiscernible], the sovereign front of the Emirates.
Another interesting element, more on the technology side, the Russian plant, the MS 21 was presented. What's interesting with his plant is that it has a very new technology to composite -- I'll, but the-- wings, so it's composite wing, but that technologies are original, it's not anymore using autoclave, it's [indiscernible] infusion, and Solvay is a provider technology and we think that besides the specific Russian project, it's a technology which could be a breakthrough in aerospace, and we are very proud to have been chosen some years ago as the partner to develop this technology. And we are continuing to see the interesting opportunities in specialty premier. Probably then I would like to mention before turning to Karim is that the debt markets, we are seeing, as imagine during the past two calls, we are seeing here a turning point in terms of batteries for our [indiscernible]. This is linked to some of the large projects that we are hearing about in the news, but this is also linked to a very important development that you're seeing in China for electric vehicles. Where the actual production is indeed increasing tremendously, trading supplies. We are one of the battery producers for the Specialty Polymers and we see a very significant opportunities looking forward.
With that, I would like to turn to Karim for a deeper look in our financials."

As usual, I'm going to refer to the slide that are on our website, and I'm going to start with Slide #10, which really looks at our sales. And as you can see, our sales in Q2 dropped by 6% to EUR 2",1038,"Thank you, Jean-Pierre. Good morning, and good afternoon. As usual, I'm going to refer to the slide that are on our website, and I'm going to start with Slide #10, which really looks at our sales. And as you can see, our sales in Q2 dropped by 6% to EUR 2.9 billion. One of the drivers come to the volumes and the pricing element but I will start with foreign exchange because the euro has appreciated against some key currencies, the dollar 1.13 in Q2 compared to 1.11 the same period last year. That's 2%. We appreciated -- or euro appreciated by 17%, 8% against the Chinese RMB, the Korean won. All of these conspired against us with an impact of nearly percent. Pricing, Jean-Pierre has already given you some color, and it really is a consequence of the deflationary environment with lower material prices, partially due to customers, particularly in businesses such as Polyamide.
There's a tiny bit of pricing pressure as well in our Advanced Formulations oil and gas business, activities although in this market, as you know, diminishes volume rather than price.
Now volumes. Jean-Pierre has alluded to the fact that they've grown modestly despite the headwinds that we are aware of the headwinds being of the oil and gas and what we're seeing on small devices. If I take that to the site and see where the growth coming from, I'm going to highlight some of the key ones. Specialty Polymers, it's seeing growth in automotive, health care, consumer goods, where Earth's automotive catalysts, Novecare excluding oil and gas, we're see good growth in home and personal care, agro and coatings and the list continues. In other words, was you can see a modest volume increase, two things I'd like to say. One, the one 1% volume growth is the first we've seen since the end of 2014, and we welcome that. And secondly, as we look at it, we see this as a very clear evidence about the strength and the breadth of the diverse portfolio that we have.
Turning to Page or Slide 11, I'd like to turn to profits. Jean-Pierre has already highlighted the key headlines where the 8% REBITDA growth, the EBITDA margin reaching a new record of 22%. Now pricing power has continued to progress albeit more modestly, but this is the 10th quarter in a row and that again demonstrates continued momentum on excellence, with also some of the tailwinds from the impact of our transactional hedging policy. But fundamentally, a very, very welcome continuation of the momentum that we've seen there for quite a while. Cost discipline is here, and it's here to stay. Our fixed costs are down over the period last year and that this despite the inflationary impact and information a loan would have reduced our profit by about EUR 35 million in this quarter. The fact that you see the cost, the fixed costs go down, also despite the additional cost from the added capacities from the new plants that we've added. pursued this is something that we're particularly pleased with and it also reflects the savings and the synergy delivery, which were totaling EUR 24 million in the quarter. In the first half, the synergy delivery on Cytec equated to EUR 24 million already, and you can see the impact of that both in our corporate expenses as well as in our composites, the advent solutions business.
Another aspect maybe to highlight on this is the fact that RusVinyl is really going from strength to strength, It is now running at close to full capacity, and we have a one-time gain in our soda ash business with the sale of something like 338 railcars that was surplus to a need and it generated again EUR 11 million that we've highlighted for clarity.
Page 13, I don't want to ignore net income because there's good progress on here as well. I recognize there's a lot of information, a lot of data on the this page. But there are 2 things I want to highlight. One, our underlying net income from our continuing businesses, so excluding the impact of the businesses we've now sold, was up 17%, and that is the result essentially of the higher REBITDA, but also an improvement in our underlying tax rate, which is 1.5% better than last year. And that is something we're very, very pleased with. Total underlying income was four percent lower because of the impact of the profits that we no longer have associated with the European chloro vinyl business. As you all know, we transferred to INOVYN in the middle of last year, and we've now sold fully have the cash in at the beginning of July.
Turning to cash. Jean-Pierre has given you the key headlines, but if we turn to Page 15, there's a couple of things I would like to highlight. Q2 showed a significant increase in our cash flows, 27% up. You remember we had a strong cash flow in Q1, so it is worth taking a step back and recognizing that the free cash flow from our continuing businesses of EUR 200 million in the first half was EUR 346 million better than last year. Now despite that, our debt is up EUR 0.4 billion. Two things I'd like to say about that. One is that increase in debt is completely in line with our expectations, and it reflects the incidence, the timing of dividend payments and all interest charges, completely in line with expectations. The other thing I'd like to mention is that in the same period in 2015 the mother debt of Solvay increased by EUR 0.8 billion. So we have the increase, that's why were particularly pleased. What I can't confirm is that the delivery you see is completely in line with our indication that the group's free cash flow for the year will exceed EUR 650 million.
Finally before I hand you back to Jean-Pierre, if you take a step back again and look at our balance sheet, our cash flow, our indebtedness, I can confirm to you that our credit metrics remain entirely consistent with the investment grade that we take significant importance to. Jean-Pierre?"

Second point, excellence program, we continue to deliver significant value creation, and already, I think, it's quite impressive to see that 3 years after launching this, we still have the pull pipe of opportunities. We are now launching exit excellence program in the former Cytec perimeter with some very significant opportunities in front of us. And indeed, we'll be in line with our overall community, the EUR 800 million target at the end of this year. This is what we would like delivered over the last three years. Speed of integration a Cytec going very well in terms of organization, and cost synergies. Clearly, the challenge now is to delivered the topline synergies and make sure that indeed in the various markets that we serve, aerospace, automotive but also mining and more broadly speaking, the market that advanced formulation is getting the combination with Cytec gives us the opportunity to go further and faster. We will have a great opportunity to share this with you when we meet at our capital markets they in London on September 29. We are planning to focus the presentations to give you the opportunity to gain some insights and what we're doing in Advanced Materials and Advanced Formulation.

Secondly, on composites, you've mentioned, right across this quarter, but I think that's been an issue for the composites industry for some time. Can you talk about -- is there any impact on mix, margin -- impacts from mix? Or does it actually not make a great deal of difference in composes? And can you talk about margins in that composites business ex synergies, please? And final question, just on Acetow, you still sound sort of pretty confident about business and volume developments and so on. I think Celanese earlier this week with adjusting that they were seeing are expecting more price pressure as they come up to renewing annual contract and so on. Are you seeing the same sort of thing? They were talking potentially be chasing volumes. I wonder if you can just give some commentary about what you're seeing in Acetow toe?"

Smart devices is a bit of an exaggeration to say that it was zero during the quarter, but indeed, lower volumes. And yes, we expect to see the pickup linked to the product, the new product coming on line, I would say with Q3, maybe there were a few others in the last days of Q2, but a very simple message is it should happen in Q3. Peak plant, we are almost at mechanical completion, which means that we are starting the ramp up -- we are starting -- we are at the start up point. So for this plant, we expect to complete the start up process sometime during the second half. I it's a not of a don't want to be more specific because it's a bit of a complex process to start up, so it's not always easy to predict but I would probably say that if things goes well, we expect the plant to be online in the beginning of the year, in the middle of the second half of the year. And then there's obviously customer approval and so on. 
On composites, the mix effect has little impact on REBITDA as long as we talked composites for aerospace. If we are looking at different types of application, then you could see some changes. But no, I think the other half of the business jet or the market situation doesn't have an impact on the mix. [indiscernible] right to say that this has been pointed in previous quarterly results. The impact is a bit different from one player to the other, and the reason is very much linked to oil and gas. Once again, oil and gas industry is a very large user of helicopter and in that situation, they are very prudent on their investment.
Acetate, too, I heard the Celanese comment. Yes, we are seeing price pressure, and we are reacting to this defending our margins and part of it is commercial activity, part of it is focusing on raw material -- access to raw material. Part of it is continuing to work on fixed costs. But yes in deed I think I'm a little bit more positive on what I've read coming from other player in this market."

And my answer will be a bit of a prudent one and I suggest you be a bit patient and wait until our capital markets they where we have the opportunity to give you more clarity on the various programs. In fact will have different situations. We have program like the joint strike fighter or the leap engine where the program is moving up with limited [indiscernible]. We are still at the initial stage where the number of planes or engine per year is still limited, but with a very impressive growth track in front of us, and we have situations which are a little bit less readable when it comes to new planes, where we see the OEMs are facing some difficulties, which is going down the ramp up. And again, I don't want to repeat what's going on in Airbus. Executives and seeing in the last few days, they are phasing to bring the industrial production available where they can meet the expectations in terms of delivery. So it's this two phenomena plus the fact that some older platform like the 747 which was in the news today are slowing down significantly and the 777 as we are seeing customers waiting -- willing to wait for the newer version. So that's created a bit of a complex situation, and indeed, great a situation where volumes are a little bit soft. But again, in our view, no reason for concern, just an adjustment in an industry which is going through a significant transition. And if you take the example of a 777, what we will have in terms of content into this new plane is several times what they have in the current version. So far, we need a bit of a patience but the transition is clearly something which we have a very significant positive impact. And shorter term, GFS and leap engine are really the 2 programs which will be a significant contributor to growth in the next quarter and years.

The drivers of that are absolutely as you can expect and we start and CapEx. What you see in the first half, you see CapEx was 15% down year-on-year. Our cash conversion was up from an average last year a 53% to 66%. So you can expect more of the same there. EBITDA clearly you can form their own views and I know you will but that will contribute to cash flow because we will maintain that discipline on cash conversion. Working capital, there's a lot of ongoing improvement. I will go into a bit more detail on it. What I can say to you is I believe we are actually speaking in a top quartile of our sector. I think there's still more we can do, so that's that discipline. And one under thing, you may underestimate the impact, but if you take note of the fact the effective tax rate was improved compared to last year by I think I quoted 1.5%, each percentage point is EUR 10 million to EUR 15 million. So just a where we are, maintaining that discipline, the intention will contribute to that organic strong cash flow. And clearly, the only other aspect to recognize is there are normal dividend and interest charges, and all of that will also be part of the normal recipe, but there should be no surprises there at all, not least because the first half of the year, you all have taken note that we did retire some debt significantly. It's quite extensive and we don't have any of that this year. So there will be benefits of that looking forward as well. This that help?"

It's true that European carmakers are a bit worried about the Brexit, although we think it will probably take another a couple of months before they have a view on what this means in terms of activity in the U.K. We've seen the growth kind of reducing a bit in the U.S., but it's not a region where we have a significant exposure. And in China, we continue to see some transfer of growth from international companies such a Nice OEM, so these are the trends that we foresee. But all of that taking into account we are probably a bit more prudent in H2 versus H1. Although I remind you that we are still in a position where we are gaining share versus other technology, other solutions, which does not make us so dependent on the underlying market trend. RusVinyl, so why do have a good performance when the plant is now running at almost full capacity? Second, we signed our position in the Russian market. Clearly, Russia is going to a lot of challenges, but something turned out to play in our favor which is the volatility of the Hubble which makes it very difficult for people to import PVC, which means that today, we have been able to put most of our products in the Russian market, and this is clearly a better solution than exporting. So overall a good level of performance. However, what we see in Q2 is probably a reasonable proxy of what you could see in remaining quarters.

Because it's already warm in the pricing power you saw in the first quarter, probably not sustainable. And then the second question, I understand you want to be prudent, but clearly, and then people are pretty cautious on the oil price as well but clearly the rig count is now materially up from the bottom up over 15%.

But again, I think we have to be careful with rig count going down 50% year-on-year. It's probably up sequentially by 2% or 3%. So yes, maybe we reached the bottom, but we are not yet at the point where we see people rushing to drill. By the way, there were some interesting statements made last week by some service companies where they are presenting their results saying that, today, the technology has evolved to a point where the number of rigs necessary to maintain production in the U.S. is probably significantly lower than it were. The good news is that chemicals are still needed in same volume. So all of that to say that I think once it picks up, I think we will see very rapidly some impact. But I'm very prudent in the question of when it will indeed pick up, so I think the current -- the oil price is still volatile. 50 is probably a good trigger point, so we are there a few months ago. We are now closer to 40, so the cushion has to be there. But I spent some time with our North American teams a few weeks ago, and I'm absolutely convinced that during these difficult times, we have increased significantly our market share. We have increased significantly our ability to bring improvement solution, competitiveness improvements addition to our customers. So yes, I think we'll be very well-positioned to benefit from it.

But let me start with pricing power. Again, you should realize that today, we are not a commodity chemical company managing prices everyday, a significant part of our business is done on a number of programs, like what we do in smart devices or aerospace. And then the ability month after month to quarter out of quarter to manage pricing power is not always exactly the same. But no, I'm quite optimistic of having the ability to continue to demonstrate this pricing power. We are in a situation where we've seen some steep increase in some energy and raw material cost, so the ability to pass them immediately to the customer is not always -- we are not always in a position to do so as quickly as we would all expect to be. But frankly speaking, I think the track record of Solvay demonstrates that we've been doing quite well in this regard, and I'm optimistic that for the full year, we'll be able to continue to demonstrate this ability. And we've been also very active on the fixed cost part of the equation. And overall even the pricing power in impact is modest, the EBITDA margin improvement, which is quite significant almost 300 basis points demonstrates that the company is very much focused on profitability. On the Boeing, this is something we can discuss on the capital markets, but your analysis is a very good one. In fact, we are strong in both cases on secondary structure. We have had a lot of activities with Boeing to develop the position in primary structure in past years, which explains why we've got this award of 777X, which means that they will be more than one supplier of composite for primary structure with Boeing. With Airbus, we want to demonstrate them our capabilities. We are already of a significant customer which we can certainly do more. I'm using my own personal network to make sure that the top management of our business understands what we can do. We see also some interesting opportunities to bring some of our specialty polymer materials. You might remember that we announced some approval of product [indiscernible] for the A350 for some applications. We think they can be much more significant opportunities here and there mostly within the cabin application. So clearly, with Airbus, we want to establish ourselves as the key strategic supplier. And the response today is good, although it takes time to have a product on an airplane in an industry which is very cautious. But clearly, one of the potential top line synergy that we've seen in the integration of Cytec into Solvay is its ability to focus in a more balanced way between North American and European players. And so far, I would say the response is good. Let's make sure that we can transform that in future sales."

Thanks, everyone, for participating in our Q2 call. I would like, as usual, to highlight what I think are the [indiscernible] in what I view as a strong set of results in a market which is still a little bit complex to read. And then",1437,"Thank you very much. Thanks, everyone, for participating in our Q2 call. I would like, as usual, to highlight what I think are the [indiscernible] in what I view as a strong set of results in a market which is still a little bit complex to read. And then Karim will go a bit deeper in our financial performance.
So probably the 3 key headlines for this set the results is -- are the following. 8% EBITDA growth. Solid margin, 22%. It's a record for us, even compared to the pro forma including Cytec 2015. And good cash generation. So if we look at how we've achieved that, sales volume grew for the first time since Q4 2014, although I have to say a very modest growth. I should probably say more stable than growth. Broad-based volume growth in a number of the segments, Advanced Materials, the whole Performance Chemical, Functional Polymers, which overcome the decline in Advanced Formulations which continues to be related to one very specific market which is oil and gas. And clearly, I think our results are the demonstration of the strength and the breadth of our portfolio, which allow us, even when we see some segments facing challenges, to deliver indeed strong results.
Looking at the EBITDA, 8% growth at EUR 652 million. 3 out of 4 of our operating segments are indeed showing profitability growth. So if I go through all these segments, Advanced Materials is up 6.3%. We are facing challenges, as you know, in the small device market. But despite the specific challenges, we are seeing growth in automotive, healthcare, consumer goods, industrial markets. On the smart device market itself, we expect the second half of the year to be significantly stronger, linked to a product cycle. 
And as so has the composite -- as far as our aerospace business is concerned, we are slightly down in terms of volume, which is the consequence of the transition, which is sometimes a little bit difficult to achieve by our customers from the legacy across platforms to the new ones. I think some of you who have listened to Airbus or Boeing results know what this means. So a strong optimism looking forward as we see new programs coming in line with a significantly higher content of Solvay composite products. But we see the transition being a little bit more challenging than some people expected.
And on top of that, specific weaknesses in business jet and helicopter. But we continue to be very optimistic, linked to the -- and this optimism is linked to the ramp-up of some specific programs which are still in the early phase, which look like very successful programs, like the Joint Strike Fighter or the LEAP engine which will be fitted on both the Airbus 320neo and the Boeing 737 MAX.
That's -- in industrial composites, we've seen the trend improving. Its really a business which is going into a turnaround type of situation. So in Q2, we've seen its volume picking up, which are the results of the efforts of our team to go into new customer, new program with a better level of profitability. And by the way, the cost prediction part of the equation is also very significant as far as industrial composite is concerned.
Advanced Formulations. Unfortunately, still the same story. Significantly down versus the same quarter of last year, linked to oil and gas. Rig count is 50% down versus Q2 2015, although it has stabilized since. So in Q2, we've seen the rig count starting to slightly increase. I will be very prudent in view of the current oil price to make any prediction of what this means, but at least the degradation has stopped.
Other key markets continue to grow in this segment, although not enough to compensate for what's happening in oil and gas. But we see a strong growth coming from the overall market growth, but also specific innovation product being put on the market on personal care, agro and coatings.
The mining environment is still challenging. We've seen some projects being delayed, but our business remains resilient. We retained our leadership position, and we see some slight growth in this segment.
Performance chemicals, up 20%, very good performance. So that clearly is a significant contributor, but not just with us. I mean, we see all of our businesses operating well. Acetate, too, is recovering. The peroxide side business is doing well. And again, in soda ash, we benefit from both volume growth, good pricing power, but also our ability to continue to improve our cost base.
Functional Polymer, up 24%. Major reason this quarter is RusVinyl. RusVinyl now is operating almost at capacity. It has found its place in the Russian market and it's starting to contribute to our REBITDA.
Polyamide was a little bit impacted by the large maintenance turnaround, but we do every 3 years so this was the time where we did it. The start-up was a little bit more difficult than expected. So overall, stable performance but which means that the underlying business performance was positive.
On the cash, and Karim will comment more on this, but clearly, we have a strong focus on cash this year. And then I say this year, I expect it to continue in the following year. We focus very much on cash conversion. We have generated EUR 174 million of free cash in Q2, which is a 27% improvement year-on-year compared to last year, as far as continuing the operation is concerned. If I look at the first semester, which is probably a better way to look at cash as there were some movement between the Q1 and Q2, over all, we come EUR 350 million higher than in the first semester of last year. So a strong performance and clearly a strong focus on cash for all the organization.
Portfolio. Key element is the Cytec integration going very well. In terms of our cost synergies, we are generating EUR 14 million in Q2. Run rate, we are almost at EUR 50 million for the yearly impact, and that's something which is very much in line with our upgraded objective to generate EUR 100 million -- more than EUR 100 million of cost synergies due to this integration. I think that being already at EUR 50 million per year running rate 6 months after the integration is a very good result for an asset of this size. 
But synergy is also on our topline synergies, our ability to continue to execute our growth strategy. Just to mention a few reasons which I think demonstrate the potential of the combination. Boeing has decided to select Solvay composite material to produce part of the primary structure of the 777X. That's very good. It's the first time we are awarded a primary structure in one of the 2 big OEMs. We are already producing primary structure components for fighter jet or for business jet. But with Boeing -- entering into Boeing is a very important achievement. The product itself will be produced in a JV that we will set up with Mubadala, the sovereign front of the Emirates.
Another interesting element, more on the technology side, the Russian plane, the MS-21 was presented. What's interesting with this plane is that it has a very new technology to composite aisle. But the wings -- so it's composite wing. But the technology is very original. It's not anymore using autoclave, it's what you call resin infusion, and Solvay is a provider of technology. And we think that besides this specific Russian project, it's a technology which could be a breakthrough in aerospace, and we are very proud to have been chosen some years ago as the partner to develop this technology. 
And we are continuing to see very interesting opportunities in Specialty Polymer. Probably the one I would like to mention before turning to Karim is that the battery market. We are seeing, as I've mentioned during the past 2 calls, we are seeing here a turning point in terms of batteries for electric vehicle. This is linked to some of the large project that we are hearing about in the news. But this is also linked to a very important development that we are seeing in China for buses and electric vehicles, where the actual production is indeed increasing tremendously.
Trading opportunities. We are a supplier of most of the battery producers with our Specialty Polymers, and we see very significant opportunities looking forward.
With that, I would like to turn to Karim for a deeper look in our financials."

One of the drivers -- I'll come to the volumes and the pricing in a moment, but I have to start with foreign exchange because the euro has depreciated against some key currencies. The dollar, $1.13 in Q2 compared to $1.11 the same period last year. That's 2%. Within reals, we appreciated -- or euro appreciated by 17%. 8% against the Chinese RMB. That's tied by the Korean won. All of these conspired against us with an impact of nearly 4%percent. 
Pricing. Jean-Pierre has already given you some color, and it really is a consequence of the deflationary environment with lower raw material prices, being partially part through to our customers, particularly in businesses such as Polyamide.
There is a tiny bit of pricing pressure as well in our Advanced Formulations oil and gas business. Activities, although in this market, as you know, diminishes volume rather than price.
Now volumes. Jean-Pierre has alluded to the fact that they're growing modestly despite the headwinds that we're all aware of. The headwinds being, obviously, oil and gas and what we're seeing on small devices. If I take that to the side and see where the growth is coming from, I'm going to highlight some of the key ones. Specialty Polymers. It's seeing growth in automotive, health care, consumer goods, rare earth's automotive catalysts. Novecare. Excluding oil and gas, we're seeing good growth there in home and personal care, agro and coatings. And the list continues. 
In other words, whilst you can see a modest volume increase, 2 things I'd like to say: one, the 1% volume growth is the first growth we've seen since the end of 2014, and we welcome that; and secondly, as we look at it, we see this as a very clear evidence of both the strength and the breadth of the diverse portfolio that we have.
Turning to Page or Slide 11, I'd like to turn to profits. Jean-Pierre has already highlighted the key headlines where the 8% EBITDA growth, the EBITDA margin reaching a new record of 22%. Now pricing power has continued to progress, albeit more modestly. But this is the 10th quarter in a row and that again demonstrates continued momentum on excellence with also some tailwinds from the impacts of our transactional hedging policy. But fundamentally, a very, very welcome continuation of the momentum that we've seen now for quite a while. 
Cost discipline is here, and it's here to stay. Our fixed costs are down over the period last year, and that is despite the inflationary impact. Inflation alone would have reduced our profits by about EUR 25 million in this quarter. The fact that you see the costs, the fixed costs go down, also despite the additional cost from the added capacities from the new plants that we have added. So this is something that we're particularly pleased with. And it also reflects the savings and the synergy delivery, which were totaling EUR 14 million in the quarter. In the first half, the synergy delivery on Cytec equated to EUR 24 million already, and you can see the impacts of that both in our corporate expenses as well as in our composites and technology solutions business.
The other aspect maybe to highlight on this is the fact that RusVinyl is really going from strength to strength. It is now running at close to full capacity. And we have a onetime gain in our soda ash business with the sale of something like 338 railcars that were surplussed to a needs, and it generated again over EUR 11 million that we've highlighted for clarity.
Page 13. I don't want to ignore net income because there's some good progress here as well. I recognize there's a lot of information, a lot of data on the this page, but there are 2 things I want to highlight. One, our underlying net income from our continuing businesses, so excluding the impacts of the businesses we've now sold, was up 17%. And that is the result essentially of the higher EBITDA but also an improvement in our underlying tax rate, which is 1.5% better than last year. And that is something we are very, very pleased with. Total underlying income was 4% lower because of the impact of the profits that we no longer have associated with the European chlorovinyl business. As you all know, we transferred to INOVYN in the middle of last year, and we've now sold fully and have the cash in at the beginning of July.
Turning to cash. Jean-Pierre has given you the key headlines, but if you turn to Page 15, there's a couple of things I would like to highlight. Q2 showed a significant increase in our cash flows, 27% up. You remember we had a strong cash flow in Q1 so it is worth taking a step back and recognizing that the free cash flow from our continuing businesses of EUR 200 million in the first half was EUR 346 million better than last year. Now despite that, our debt is up EUR 0.4 billion. Two things I'd like to say about that. One is that increase in our debt is completely in line with our expectations, and it reflects the incidence, the timing of dividend payments and all interest charges, completely in line with expectations. The other thing I'd like to mention is that in the same period in 2015, the debt of Solvay increased by EUR 0.8 billion. So we have the increase. That's why we're particularly pleased. What I can't confirm is that the delivery you see is completely in line with our indication that the group's free cash flow for the year will exceed EUR 650 million.
Finally, before I hand you back to Jean-Pierre, if you take a step back again and look at our balance sheet, our cash flow, our indebtedness, I can confirm to you that our credit metrics remain entirely consistent with the investment grade that we attach significant importance to.

So just a few comments before opening the Q&A session. As Karim has just indicated, cash generation is important for us in 2016 and in following years. Clearly, we are very well-positioned today to exceed the EUR 650 million of free cash flow that we've set as an objective. 
Second point, excellence program. They continued to deliver significant value creation. And really, I think it's quite impressive to see that 3 years after launching this, we still have the full pipe of opportunities. We are now launching excellence program in the former Cytec perimeter with some very significant opportunities in front of us. And indeed, we'll be in line with our overall community, the EUR 800 million target at the end of this year. This is what we will have delivered over the last 3 years. 
Speed of integration at Cytec going very well in terms of organization and cost synergies. Clearly, the challenge now is to deliver the top line synergies and make sure that, indeed, in the various markets that we serve, aerospace, automotive but also mining and more broadly speaking, the market that Advanced Formulation is, being the combination with Cytec, gives us the opportunity to go further and faster. 
We will have a great opportunity to share this with you when we meet at our Capital Market Day in London on September 29. We are planning to focus our presentations to give you the opportunity to gain some insights in what we are doing in Advanced Materials and Advanced Formulation. 
Again, I think you've noted it, but we have confirmed with these set of results our full year EBITDA growth guidance. We expect to grow EBITDA by a high single-digit number.
And with that, I'll turn to you for the Q&A session."

And can you just remind us exactly when the new U.S. PEEK plant will ramp up and begin to contribute to volumes please? Secondly, on composites. You've mentioned rotorcraft this quarter, but I think that's been an issue for the composites industry for some time. Can you talk about -- is there any impact on mix? Margin impact from mix? Or does it actually not make a great deal of difference in composites? And can you talk about margins in that composites business ex synergies please? And final question, just on acetate tow, you still sound sort of pretty confident about business and volume developments and so on. I think Celanese earlier this week was suggesting that they were seeing or expecting more price pressure as they come up to renewing annual contracts and so on. Are you seeing the same sort of thing? They were talking about people potentially chasing volumes. I wonder if you could just give some commentary about what you're seeing in acetate tow please?"

Smart devices is a bit of an exaggeration to say that it was 0 during the quarter, but indeed, low volumes. And yes, we expect to see the pickup linked to the product -- our new product coming on line. I would say with Q3, maybe there were a few orders in the last days of Q2. But a very simple message is that it will happen in Q3. PEEK plant. We are almost at the mechanical completion, which means that we are starting the ramp up. We are at the start-up point for this plant. We expect to complete the start-up process some time during the second half. I don't want to be more specific because it's a bit of a complex process to start up, so it's not always easy to predict. But I would probably say that if things goes well, we expect the plant to be online in the middle of the year, in the middle of the second half of the year. And then there's, obviously, customer approval and so on. On composite, the mix effect has little impact on EBITDA as long as we talk about composite for aerospace. If we are looking at different types of application, then you could see some changes. But no, I think the rotorcraft business, jet or the market situation doesn't have an impact on the mix. Rotorcraft, you're right to say that this has been pointed in previous quarterly results. The impact is a bit different from one player to the other, and the reason is very much linked to oil and gas. Once again, the oil and gas industry is a very large user of helicopter, and in that kind of situation, they are very prudent on their investment. Acetate tow, I read the Celanese comment. I was -- yes. I mean, we are seeing price pressure. And we are reacting to this, defending our margins, and part of it is commercial activity, part of it is focusing on raw material -- access to raw material, part of it is continuing to work on fixed costs. But yes, indeed, I think I'm a little bit more positive than what I've read coming from other player in this market."

And my answer will be a bit of a prudent one, and I suggest you be a bit patient and wait until our Capital Market Day where we'll have the opportunity to give you more clarity on the various programs. In fact, we have different situations. We have a program like the Joint Strike Fighter or the LEAP engine where the program is moving up with limited hiccups, if any. We are still at the initial stage where the number of planes or engine per year is still limited, but with a very impressive growth track in front of us. And we have situations which are a little bit less readable when it comes to new planes, where we see the OEMs facing some difficulties, which is going down the ramp-up. And again, I don't want to repeat what Boeing or Airbus executives were saying in the last few days. They are dealing with difficulties there, and they are finishing to bring their industrial production available where they can meet the expectations in terms of delivery. So it's these 2 phenomena plus the fact that some older platform, like the 747, which was in the news today, are slowing down significantly or the 777 as they are seeing customers waiting -- willing to wait for the newer version. So all of that's created a bit of a complex situation and indeed create a situation where volumes are a little bit soft. But again, in our view, no reason for concern, just an adjustment in an industry which is going for a significant transition. And if you take the example of a 777, what we will have in terms of content into this new plane is several times what we have in the current version. So for us, we need a bit of a patience but the transition is clearly something which will have a very significant positive impact. And shorter term, JFS and LEAP engine are really the 2 programs which will be a significant contributor to growth in the next quarter then years.

What I can say to you is, whilst I believe we are, factually speaking, in a top quartile of our sector, I think there's still more we can do. So that's that discipline. And one under thing. You may underestimate the impact, but if you take note of the fact that our effective tax rate was improved compared to last year by, I think I quoted 1.5%, each percentage point is EUR 10 million to EUR 15 million. So just staying where we are, maintaining that discipline, that intention, will contribute to that organic strong cash flow. And clearly, the only other aspect to recognize is there are normal dividend and interest charges, and all of that will also be part of the normal recipe. But there should be no surprises there at all, not least because the first half of the year, you will have taken note that we did retire some debt significantly. It's quite expensive, and we don't have any of that this year. So there will be benefit of that looking forward as well. Does that help?"

Well composite, if you compare Hexcel and us, there is just one difference, A350, where Hexcel is providing the primary structure component, and that explains the difference. The rest of the performance, having looked at their announcement, are very similar if you correct for this. On automotive, I'm not sure I'm the best guy to give you a view on automotive in H2. It's true that European carmakers are a bit worried about the Brexit, although we think it will probably take another a couple of months before they have a view on what this means in terms of activity in the U.K. We've seen the growth kind of reducing a bit in the U.S., but it's not a region where we have a significant exposure. And in China, we continue to see some transfer of growth from international companies to a Chinese OEM, so these are the trends that we foresee. But all of that taking into account, we are probably a bit more prudent in H2 versus H1. Although I remind you that we are still in a position where we are gaining share versus other technology, other solutions, which does not make us so dependent on just the underlying market trend. RusVinyl, so -- RusVinyl, yet -- I mean, why do we have a good performance? One, the plant is now running at almost full capacity. Second, we find our position in the Russian market. Clearly, Russia is going through a lot of challenges, but something turned out to play in our favor, which is the volatility of the ruble, which makes it very difficult for people to import PVC. Which means that today, we have been able to put most of our product on the Russian market, and this is clearly a better solution than exporting. So overall, a good level of performance. And probably what we've seen Q2 is probably a reasonable proxy of what you could see in remaining quarters. At least, I don't see any significant risk of seeing this number changing."

But again, I think we have to be careful with the rig count going down 50% year-on-year, it's probably up sequentially by 2% or 3%. So yes, maybe we've reached the bottom, but we are not yet at a point where we see people rushing to drill. By the way, there were some interesting statements made last week by some service companies while they were presenting their results, saying that today, the technology has evolved to a point where the number of rigs necessary to maintain production in the U.S. is probably significantly lower than it was. The good news is that chemical are still needed in same volume. So all of that to say that I think once it picks up, I think we will see, very rapidly, some impact. But I'm very prudent on the question of when it will indeed pick up. So I think the current the oil price is still volatile. $50 is probably a good trigger point. So we were there a month ago, we are now closer to $40, so a thin cushion has to be there. But I spent some time with our North American teams a few weeks ago, and I'm absolutely convinced that during these difficult time, we have increased significantly our market share. We have increased significantly our ability to bring cost-improvement solution, competitiveness-improvement addition to our customers. So yes, I think the it starts up, we'll be very well-positioned to benefit from it. But I'm not counting on it to give you my H2 guidance."

Our leadership positions, our ability to do what Jean-Pierre was talking about, which is meeting the needs of our customers and holding our own in a competitive marketplace. I have confidence there. Where we have less visibility, like everybody else, is the impact of foreign exchange going forward, the impact of energy costs and et cetera, et cetera.

Again, you should realize that today, we are not a commodity chemical company managing prices everyday. I mean, a significant part of our business is done on a number of program, like what we do in smart devices or aerospace. And then the ability, month-after-month to quarter-after-quarter, to manage pricing power is not always exactly the same. But no, I'm quite optimistic, we are being -- or our ability to continue to demonstrate this pricing power. We are in a situation where we've seen some steep increase in some energy and raw material cost, so the ability to pass them immediately to the customer is not always -- I mean, we are not always in the position to do so as quickly as we would all expect to be. But frankly speaking, I think the track record of Solvay demonstrate that we've been doing quite well in this regard, and I'm optimistic that for the full year, we'll be able to continue to demonstrate this ability. I might add that we've been also very active on the fixed cost part of the equation. And overall, even if the pricing power in impact is modest, the EBITDA margin improvement, which is quite significant, almost 300 basis points, demonstrate that the company is very much focused on profitability. On Airbus versus Boeing, I mean, it's probably something we can discuss at our Capital Markets Day, but your analysis is a very good one. In fact, we are strong in both cases on secondary structure. We have had a lot of activities with Boeing to develop a position in primary structure in past years, which explains why we've got this award of the 777X, which means that there will be more than one supplier of composite for primary structure with Boeing. With Airbus, we want to demonstrate them our capabilities. We are -- they're already a significant customer, but we can certainly do more. I'm using my own personal network to make sure that the top management of Airbus understands what we can do. We see also with Airbus some interesting opportunities to bring some of our specialty polymer materials. You might remember that we announced some approval of a product called  TegraCore for the A350 for some applications. We think that there could be much more significant opportunities here and there, mostly for within the cabin application. So clearly, with Airbus, we want to reestablish ourselves as a key strategic supplier. And the response today is good, although it takes time to have a product on an airplane in an industry which is very cautious. But clearly, one of the potential top line synergy that we're seeing with the integration of Cytec into Solvay is this ability to focus in a more balanced way between North American and European players. And so far, I would say the response is good. Let's make sure that we can transform that in future sales."

And with that, I thank you very much, once again, to have spent this end of July Friday afternoon, early afternoon, with us. Good holiday for those of you who are going on holidays. And looking forward to see you in London at the end of September. Thank you very much."

Thanks, everyone, for participating in our Q2 call. I would like, as usual, to highlight what I think are the key elements in what I view as a strong set of results in a market which is still a little bit complex to read. And then, Ka",1438,"Thank you very much. Thanks, everyone, for participating in our Q2 call. I would like, as usual, to highlight what I think are the key elements in what I view as a strong set of results in a market which is still a little bit complex to read. And then, Karim will go a bit deeper in our financial performance.
So probably the 3 key headlines for this set of results is -- are the following: 8% EBITDA growth. Solid margin, 22%. It's a record for us, even compared to the pro forma including Cytec 2015. And good cash generation. So if we look at how we've achieved that, sales volume grew for the first time since Q4 2014, although I have to say, a very modest growth. I should probably say more stable than growth. Broad-based volume growth in a number of the segments, Advanced Materials, Performance Chemical, Functional Polymers, which overcome the decline in Advanced Formulations which continues to be related to one very specific market, which is oil and gas. And clearly, I think our results are the demonstration of the strength and the breadth of our portfolio, which allow us, even when we see some segments facing challenges, to deliver, indeed, strong results.
Looking at the EBITDA, 8% growth at EUR 652 million. 3 out of 4 of our operating segments are indeed showing profitability growth. So if I go through all these segments: Advanced Materials is up 6.3%. We are facing challenges, as you know, in the small device market. But despite the specific challenges, we are seeing growth in automotive, healthcare, consumer goods, industrial markets. On the smart device market itself, we expect the second half of the year to be significantly stronger, linked to a product cycle. 
And as far as the composite for -- into our aerospace business is concerned, we are slightly down in terms of volume, which is the consequence of the transition, which is sometimes a little bit difficult to achieve by our customers, from the legacy across platforms to the new ones. I think some of you who have listened to Airbus or Boeing results know what this means. So a strong optimism looking forward as we see new programs coming in line with a significantly higher content of Solvay composite products. But we see the transition being a little bit more challenging than some people expected.
And on top of that, specific weaknesses in business jet and helicopter. But we continue to be very optimistic, linked to the -- and this optimism is linked to the ramp-up of some specific programs which are still in the early phase, which look like very successful programs like the Joint Strike Fighter or the LEAP engine, which will be fitted on both the Airbus 320neo and the Boeing 737 MAX.
That's -- in industrial composites, we've seen the trend improving. It's clearly a business which is going into a turnaround type of situation. So in Q2, we've seen its volume picking up, which are the results of the efforts of our team to go into new customer, new program with a better level of profitability. And by the way, the cost prediction part of the equation is also very significant as far as industrial composite is concerned.
Advanced Formulations. Unfortunately, still the same story. Significantly down versus the same quarter of last year, linked to oil and gas. Rig count is 50% down versus Q2 2015, although it has stabilized since. So in Q2, we've seen the rig count starting to slightly increase. I will be very prudent in view of the current oil price to make any prediction of what this means, but at least the degradation has stopped.
Other key markets continue to grow in this segment, although not enough to compensate for what's happening in oil and gas. But we see a strong growth coming from the overall market growth, but also specific innovation product being put on the market on personal care, agro and coatings.
The mining environment is still challenging. We've seen some projects being delayed, but our business remains resilient. We retained our leadership position, and we see some slight growth in this segment.
Performance Chemicals, up 20%, very good performance. So that clearly is a significant contributor, but not just soda ash. I mean, we see all of our businesses operating well. Acetate, too, is recovering. The peroxide business is doing well. And again, in soda ash, we benefit from both volume growth, good pricing power, but also our ability to continue to improve our cost base.
Functional Polymer, up 24%. Major reason this quarter is RusVinyl. RusVinyl now is operating almost at capacity. It has found its place in the Russian market, and it's starting to contribute to our REBITDA.
Polyamide was a little bit impacted by the large maintenance turnaround, but we do every 3 years, so this was the time where we did it. The start-up was a little bit more difficult than expected. So overall, stable performance but which means that the underlying business performance was positive.
On the cash, and Karim will comment more on this, but clearly, we have a strong focus on cash this year. And when I say this year, I expect it to continue in the following year. We focus very much on cash conversion. We have generated EUR 174 million of free cash in Q2, which is a 27% improvement year-on-year compared to last year, as far as continuing the operation is concerned. If I look at the first semester, which is probably a better way to look at cash, as there were some movement between the Q1 and Q2, overall, we come EUR 350 million higher than in the first semester of last year. So a strong performance and clearly a strong focus on cash for all the organization.
Portfolio. Key element is the Cytec integration going very well. In terms of cost synergies, we are generating EUR 14 million in Q2. Run rate, we are almost at EUR 50 million for the yearly impact, and that's something which is very much in line with our upgraded objective to generate EUR 100 million -- more than EUR 100 million of cost synergies due to this integration. I think that being already at EUR 50 million per year running rate 6 months after the integration is a very good result for an asset of this size. 
But synergy is also an -- topline synergies, our ability to continue to execute our growth strategy. Just to mention a few reasons which I think demonstrate the potential of the combination. Boeing has decided to select Solvay composite material to produce part of the primary structure of the 777X. That's very good. It's the first time we are awarded a primary structure in 1 of the 2 big OEMs. We are already producing primary structure components for fighter jet or for business jet. But with Boeing -- entering into Boeing is a very important achievement. The product itself will be produced in a JV, but we will set up with Mubadala via the sovereign front of the Emirates.
Another interesting element, more on the technology side, the Russian plane, the MS-21 was presented. What's interesting with this plane is that it has a very new technology. It's a composite aisle, but the -- wings -- sorry, it's a composite wing, but the technology is very original. It's not anymore using autoclave. It's what's called resin infusion, and Solvay is a provider of technology. And we think that besides this specific Russian project, it's a technology which could be a breakthrough in aerospace, and we are very proud to have been chosen some years ago as the partner to develop this technology. 
And we are continuing to see very interesting opportunities in Specialty Polymer. Probably the one I would like to mention before turning to Karim is the battery market. We are seeing -- as I've mentioned during the past 2 calls, we are seeing or hearing a real turning point in terms of batteries for electric vehicle. This is linked to some of the large project that we are hearing about in the news. But this is also linked to a very important development that we are seeing in China for buses and electric vehicles, where the actual production is indeed increasing tremendously.
Trading opportunities. We are a supplier of most of the battery producers with our Specialty Polymers, and we see a very significant opportunities looking forward.
With that, I would like to turn to Karim for a deeper look in our financials."

As usual, I'm going to refer to the slides that are on our website, and I'm going to start with Slide #10, which really looks at our sales. And as you can see, our sales in Q2 dropped by 6% to EUR",1053,"Thank you, Jean-Pierre. Good morning, and good afternoon. As usual, I'm going to refer to the slides that are on our website, and I'm going to start with Slide #10, which really looks at our sales. And as you can see, our sales in Q2 dropped by 6% to EUR 2.9 billion. What are the drivers? I'll come to the volumes and the pricing in a moment, but I have to start with foreign exchange because the euro has depreciated against some key currencies. The dollar, $1.13 in Q2 compared to $1.11 the same period last year. That's 2%. Brazilian reals, we appreciated -- or euro appreciated by 17%; 8% against the Chinese RMB. That's tied by the Korean won. All of this conspired against us with an impact of nearly 4%. 
Pricing. Jean-Pierre has already given you some color, and it really is a consequence of the deflationary environment with lower raw material prices, being partially passed through to our customers, particularly in businesses such as polyamide.
There is a tiny bit of pricing pressure as well in our Advanced Formulations oil and gas business. Activities, although in this market, as you know, diminishes volume rather than price.
Now volumes. Jean-Pierre has alluded to the fact that they're growing modestly, despite the headwinds that we're all aware of; the headwinds being, obviously, oil and gas and what we're seeing on small devices. If I take that to the side and say, ""where is the growth is coming from,"" I'm going to highlight some of the key ones: Specialty Polymers. It's seeing growth in automotive, health care, consumer goods, rare earth's automotive catalysts. Novecare. Excluding oil and gas, we're seeing good growth in home and personal care, agro and coatings. And the list continues. 
In other words, whilst you can see a modest volume increase, 2 things I'd like to say: one, the 1% volume growth is the first growth we've seen since the end of 2014, and we welcome that; and secondly, as we look at it, we see this as a very clear evidence of both the strength and the breadth of the diverse portfolio that we have.
Turning to Page or Slide 11, I'd like to turn to profits. Jean-Pierre has already highlighted the key headlines where the 8% EBITDA growth, the EBITDA margin reaching a new record of 22%. Now, pricing power has continued to progress, albeit more modestly. But this is the 10th quarter in a row, and that again demonstrates continued momentum on excellence with also some tailwinds from the impacts of our transactional hedging policy. But fundamentally, a very, very welcome continuation of the momentum that we've seen now for quite a while. 
Cost discipline is here, and it's here to stay. Our fixed costs are down over the period last year, and that is despite the inflationary impact. Inflation alone would have reduced our profits by about EUR 25 million in this quarter. The fact that you see the costs, the fixed costs go down, also despite the additional costs from the added capacities from the new plants that we have added. So this is something that we're particularly pleased with. And it also reflects the savings and the synergy delivery, which were totaling EUR 14 million in the quarter. In the first half, the synergy delivery on Cytec equated to EUR 24 million already, and you can see the impacts of that both in our corporate expenses as well as in our composites and technology solutions business.
The other aspect maybe to highlight on this is the fact that RusVinyl is really going from strength to strength. It is now running at close to full capacity. And we have a onetime gain in our soda ash business with the sale of something like 338 railcars that were surplussed to our needs, and it generated, again, over EUR 11 million that we've highlighted for clarity.
Page 13. I don't want to ignore net income because there's some good progress here as well. I recognize there's a lot of information, a lot of data on the this page, but there are 2 things I want to highlight. One, our underlying net income from our continuing businesses, so excluding the impacts of the businesses we've now sold, was up 17%. And that is the result essentially of the higher EBITDA but also an improvement in our underlying tax rate, which is 1.5% better than last year. And that is something we are very, very pleased with. Total underlying income was 4% lower because of the impact of the profits that we no longer have associated with the European chlorovinyl business. As you well know, we transferred to INOVYN in the middle of last year, and we've now sold fully and have the cash in at the beginning of July.
Turning to cash. Jean-Pierre has given you the key headlines, but if you turn to Page 15, there's a couple of things I would like to highlight. Q2 showed a significant increase in our cash flows, 27% up. You remember we had a strong cash flow in Q1, so it is worth taking a step back and recognizing that the free cash flow from our continuing businesses of EUR 200 million in the first half was EUR 346 million better than last year. Now despite that, our debt is up EUR 0.4 billion. Two things I'd like to say about that. One is that increase in our debt is completely in line with our expectations, and it reflects the incidents, the timing of dividend payments and all interest charges, completely in line with expectations. The other thing I'd like to mention is that in the same period in 2015, the debt of Solvay increased by EUR 0.8 billion. So we've halved the increase. That's why we're particularly pleased. What I can confirm is that the delivery you see is completely in line with our indication that the group's free cash flow for the year will exceed EUR 650 million.
Finally, before I hand you back to Jean-Pierre, if you take a step back again and look at our balance sheet, our cash flow, our indebtedness, I can confirm to you that our credit metrics remain entirely consistent with the investment grade that we attach significant importance to.

So just a few comments before opening the Q&A session. As Karim has just indicated, cash generation is very important for us in 2016 and in following years. Clearly, we are very well-positioned today to exceed the EUR 650 million of free cash flow that we've set as an objective. 
Second point, excellence program. They continue to deliver significant value creation. And really, I think it's quite impressive to see that 3 years after launching this, we still have the full pipe of opportunities. We are now launching excellence program in the former Cytec perimeter with some very significant opportunities in front of us. And indeed, we'll be in line with our overall committed EUR 800 million target at the end of this year. This is what we will have delivered over the last 3 years. 
Speed of integration at Cytec going very well in terms of organization and cost synergies. Clearly, the challenge now is to deliver the top line synergies and make sure that, indeed, in the various markets that we serve, aerospace, automotive but also mining and more broadly speaking, the market that Advanced Formulation is. We think the combination with Cytec gives us the opportunity to go further and faster. 
We will have a great opportunity to share this with you when we meet at our Capital Market Day in London on September 29. We are planning to focus our presentations to give you the opportunity to gain some insights in what we are doing in Advanced Materials and Advanced Formulation. 
Again, I think you've noted it, but we have confirmed with this set of results our full year EBITDA growth guidance. We expect to grow EBITDA by a high single-digit number.

And can you just remind us exactly when the new U.S. PEEK plant will ramp up and begin to contribute to volumes, please? Secondly, on composites. You've mentioned rotorcraft this quarter, but I think that's been an issue for the composites industry for some time. Can you talk about -- is there any impact on mix? Margin impact from mix? Or does it actually not make a great deal of difference in composites? And can you talk about margins in that composites business ex synergies, please? And final question, just on acetate tow, you still sound sort of pretty confident about business and volume developments and so on. I think Celanese earlier this week was suggesting that they were seeing or expecting more price pressure as they come up to renewing annual contracts and so on. Are you seeing the same sort of thing? They were talking about people potentially chasing volumes. I wonder if you could just give some commentary about what you're seeing in acetate tow, please?"

Smart devices is a bit of an exaggeration to say that it was 0 during the quarter, but indeed, low volumes. And yes, we expect to see the pickup linked to the product -- our new product coming on line, I would say with Q3. Maybe there were a few orders in the last days of Q2, but the simple message is that it will happen in Q3. PEEK plant. We are almost at mechanical completion, which means that we are starting the ramp up. We are at the start-up point for this plant. We expect to complete the start-up process some time during the second half. I don't want to be more specific because it's a bit of a complex process to start up, so it's not always easy to predict. But I would probably say that if things goes well, we expect the plant to be online in the middle of the year, in the middle of the second half of the year. And then there's, obviously, customer approval and so on. On composite, the mix effect has little impact on EBITDA as far as -- as long as we talk about composite for aerospace. If we are looking at different types of application, then you could see some changes. But no, I think the rotorcraft business, jet or the market situation doesn't have an impact on the mix. Rotorcraft, you're right to say that this has been pointed in previous quarterly results. The impact is a bit different from one player to the other, and the reason is very much linked to oil and gas. Once again, the oil and gas industry is a very large user of helicopter, and in that current situation, they are very prudent on their investment. Acetate tow, I read the Celanese comment. I was -- yes, I mean, we are seeing price pressure. And we are reacting to this, defending our margins. And part of it is commercial activity, part of it is focusing on raw material -- access to raw material, part of it is continuing to work on fixed costs. But yes, indeed, I think I'm a little bit more positive than what I've read coming from other player in this market."

And my answer will be a bit of a prudent one, and I suggest you be a bit patient and wait until our Capital Market Day, where we'll have the opportunity to give you more clarity on the various programs. In fact, we have different situations. We have a program like the Joint Strike Fighter or the LEAP engine, where the program is moving up with limited hiccups, if any. We are still at the initial stage where the number of planes or engine per year is still limited, but with a very impressive growth track in front of us. And we have situations which are a little bit less readable when it comes to new planes, where we see the OEMs facing some difficulties, which is going down the ramp-up. And again, I don't want to repeat what Boeing or Airbus executives were saying in the past few days regarding the difficulties they are facing to bring their industrial production available where they can meet the expectations in terms of delivery. So it's these 2 phenomena plus the fact that some older platform, like the 747, which was in the news today, are slowing down significantly or the 777, as they are seeing customers waiting -- willing to wait for the newer version. So all of that's created a bit of a complex situation and indeed create a situation where volumes are a little bit soft. But again, in our view, no reason for concern, just an adjustment in an industry which is going for a significant transition. And if you take the example of a 777, what we will have in terms of content into this new plane is several times what we have in the current version. So for us, we need a bit of patience, but the transition is clearly something which will have a very significant positive impact. And shorter term, JFS and LEAP engine are really the 2 programs which will be a significant contributor to growth in the next quarter, then years.

One of them is the smart device market.

The drivers of that are absolutely as you'd expect. Let we start with CapEx. What did you see in the first half? You saw that our CapEx was 15% down year-on-year. Our cash conversion was up from an average last year of 53% to 66%. So you can expect more of the same there. EBITDA, clearly, you can form your own views, and I know you will, but that will contribute to the cash flow because we will maintain that discipline on cash conversion. Working capital, there's a lot of ongoing improvement. I won't go into all the details of it. What I can say to you is, whilst I believe we are, factually speaking, in a top quartile of our sector, I think there's still more we can do. So that's about discipline. And one other thing. You may underestimate the impact, but if you take note of the fact that our effective tax rate was improved compared to last year by, I think I quoted 1.5%, each percentage point is EUR 10 million to EUR 15 million. So just staying where we are, maintaining that discipline, that attention, will contribute to that organic strong cash flow. And clearly, the only other aspect to recognize is there are normal dividend and interest charges, and all of that will also be part of the normal recipe. But there should be no surprises there at all, not least because in the first half of the year, you will have taken note that we did retire some debt that is significantly -- it's quite expensive, and we don't have any of that this year.

Well composite, if you compare Hexcel and us, there is just one difference, A350, where Hexcel is providing the primary structure component, and that explains the difference. The rest of the performance, having looked at their announcement, are very similar if you correct for this. On automotive, I'm not sure I'm the best guy to give you a view on automotive in H2. It's true that European carmakers are a bit worried about the Brexit, although we think it will probably take another a couple of months before they have a view on what this means in terms of activity in the U.K. We've seen the growth kind of reducing a bit in the U.S., but it's not a region where we have a significant exposure. And in China, we continue to see some transfer of growth from international companies to a Chinese OEM, so these are the trends that we foresee. But all of that taking into account, we are probably a bit more prudent in H2 versus H1. Although I remind you that we are still in a position where we are gaining share versus other technology, other solutions, which does not make us so dependent on just the underlying market trend. RusVinyl, so -- RusVinyl, yes -- I mean, why do we have a good performance? One, the plant is now running at almost full capacity. Second, we find our position in the Russian market. Clearly, Russia is going through a lot of challenges, but something turned out to play in our favor, which is the volatility of the ruble, which makes it very difficult for people to import PVC. Which means that today, we have been able to put most of our product on the Russian market, and this is clearly a better solution than exporting. So overall, a good level of performance. And probably what we've seen Q2 is probably a reasonable proxy of what you could see in remaining quarters. At least, I don't see any significant risk of seeing this number changing."

So yes, maybe we've reached the bottom, but we are not yet at a point where we see people rushing to drill. By the way, there were some interesting statements made last week by some service companies while they were presenting their results, saying that today, the technology has evolved to a point where the number of rigs necessary to maintain production in the U.S. is probably significantly lower than it was. The good news is that chemical are still needed in same volume. So all of that to say that I think once it picks up, I think we will see, very rapidly, some impact. But I'm very prudent on the question of when it will indeed pick up. So I think the current oil price is still volatile. $50 is probably a good trigger point. So we were there a month ago. We are now closer to $40, so a thin cushion has to be there. But I spent some time with our North American teams a few weeks ago, and I'm absolutely convinced that during these difficult time, we have increased significantly our market share. We have increased significantly our ability to bring cost-improvement solution, competitiveness-improvement solution to our customers.

Again, you should realize that today, we are not a commodity chemical company managing prices everyday. I mean, a significant part of our business is done on a number of program, like what we do in smart devices or aerospace. And then the ability, month-after-month to -- or quarter-after-quarter to manage pricing power is not always exactly the same. But no, I'm quite optimistic regarding our ability to continue to demonstrate this pricing power. We are in a situation where we've seen some steep increase in some energy and raw material cost, so the ability to pass them immediately to the customer is not always -- I mean, we are not always in the position to do so as quickly as we would all expect to be. But frankly speaking, I think the track record of Solvay demonstrate that we've been doing quite well in this regard, and I'm optimistic that for the full year, we'll be able to continue to demonstrate this ability. I might add that we've been also very active on the fixed cost part of the equation. And overall, even if the pricing power impact is modest, the EBITDA margin improvement, which is quite significant, almost 300 basis points, demonstrate that the company is very much focused on profitability. On Airbus versus Boeing, I mean, it's probably something we can discuss at our Capital Markets Day, but your analysis is a very good one. In fact, we are strong in both cases on secondary structure. We have had a lot of activities with Boeing to develop a position in primary structure in past years, which explains why we got this award of the 777X, which means that there will be more than one supplier of composite for primary structure with Boeing. With Airbus, we want to demonstrate them our capabilities. We are -- they're already a significant customer, but we can certainly do more. I'm using my own personal network to make sure that the top management of Airbus understands what we can do. We see also with Airbus some interesting opportunities to bring some of our specialty polymer materials. You might remember that we announced some approval of a product called  TegraCore for the A350 for some applications. We think that there could be much more significant opportunities here and there, mostly for within the cabin application. So clearly, with Airbus, we want to reestablish ourselves as a key strategic supplier. And the response today is good, although it takes time to have a product on an airplane in an industry which is very cautious. But clearly, one of the potential top line synergy that we're seeing with the integration of Cytec into Solvay is this ability to focus in a more balanced way between North American and European players. And so far, I would say the response is good. Let's make sure that we can transform that in future sales."

Strong focus on free cash flow. We've said it from the beginning of the year, and it's really something where we are seeing some changes. I think the cash profile this year will look very differently from what it was last year, and it's a much safer, much less back-end loaded profile. EBITDA margin at 22%, probably something which, in comparison with our peers, shows again the quality of the portfolio that we have today within Solvay. 
And regarding portfolio transformation, Cytec integration is going very well in terms of its cost synergy delivery. And indeed, in terms of top line opportunities, we are starting to see also the strength of the combination. 
We are looking forward for the opportunity to share more of this with you in our Capital Market Day, September 29.

Thanks, everyone, for participating in our Q2 call. I would like, as usual, to highlight what I think are the key elements in what I view as a strong set of results in a market which is still a little bit complex to read. And then, Ka",1439,"Thank you very much. Thanks, everyone, for participating in our Q2 call. I would like, as usual, to highlight what I think are the key elements in what I view as a strong set of results in a market which is still a little bit complex to read. And then, Karim will go a bit deeper in our financial performance.
So probably the 3 key headlines for this set of results is -- are the following: 8% EBITDA growth. Solid margin, 22%. It's a record for us, even compared to the pro forma including Cytec 2015. And good cash generation. So if we look at how we've achieved that, sales volume grew for the first time since Q4 2014, although I have to say, a very modest growth. I should probably say more stable than growth. Broad-based volume growth in a number of the segments, Advanced Materials, Performance Chemical, Functional Polymers, which overcome the decline in Advanced Formulations which continues to be related to one very specific market, which is oil and gas. And clearly, I think our results are the demonstration of the strength and the breadth of our portfolio, which allow us, even when we see some segments facing challenges, to deliver, indeed, strong results.
Looking at the EBITDA, 8% growth at EUR 652 million. 3 out of 4 of our operating segments are indeed showing profitability growth. So if I go through all these segments: Advanced Materials is up 6.3%. We are facing challenges, as you know, in the small device market. But despite the specific challenges, we are seeing growth in automotive, healthcare, consumer goods, industrial markets. On the smart device market itself, we expect the second half of the year to be significantly stronger, linked to a product cycle. 
And as far as the composite for -- into our aerospace business is concerned, we are slightly down in terms of volume, which is the consequence of the transition, which is sometimes a little bit difficult to achieve by our customers, from the legacy across platforms to the new ones. I think some of you who have listened to Airbus or Boeing results know what this means. So a strong optimism looking forward as we see new programs coming in line with a significantly higher content of Solvay composite products. But we see the transition being a little bit more challenging than some people expected.
And on top of that, specific weaknesses in business jet and helicopter. But we continue to be very optimistic, linked to the -- and this optimism is linked to the ramp-up of some specific programs which are still in the early phase, which look like very successful programs like the Joint Strike Fighter or the LEAP engine, which will be fitted on both the Airbus 320neo and the Boeing 737 MAX.
That's -- in industrial composites, we've seen the trend improving. It's clearly a business which is going into a turnaround type of situation. So in Q2, we've seen its volume picking up, which are the results of the efforts of our team to go into new customer, new program with a better level of profitability. And by the way, the cost prediction part of the equation is also very significant as far as industrial composite is concerned.
Advanced Formulations. Unfortunately, still the same story. Significantly down versus the same quarter of last year, linked to oil and gas. Rig count is 50% down versus Q2 2015, although it has stabilized since. So in Q2, we've seen the rig count starting to slightly increase. I will be very prudent in view of the current oil price to make any prediction of what this means, but at least the degradation has stopped.
Other key markets continue to grow in this segment, although not enough to compensate for what's happening in oil and gas. But we see a strong growth coming from the overall market growth, but also specific innovation product being put on the market on personal care, agro and coatings.
The mining environment is still challenging. We've seen some projects being delayed, but our business remains resilient. We retained our leadership position, and we see some slight growth in this segment.
Performance Chemicals, up 20%, very good performance. So that clearly is a significant contributor, but not just soda ash. I mean, we see all of our businesses operating well. Acetate, too, is recovering. The peroxide business is doing well. And again, in soda ash, we benefit from both volume growth, good pricing power, but also our ability to continue to improve our cost base.
Functional Polymer, up 24%. Major reason this quarter is RusVinyl. RusVinyl now is operating almost at capacity. It has found its place in the Russian market, and it's starting to contribute to our REBITDA.
Polyamide was a little bit impacted by the large maintenance turnaround, but we do every 3 years, so this was the time where we did it. The start-up was a little bit more difficult than expected. So overall, stable performance but which means that the underlying business performance was positive.
On the cash, and Karim will comment more on this, but clearly, we have a strong focus on cash this year. And when I say this year, I expect it to continue in the following year. We focus very much on cash conversion. We have generated EUR 174 million of free cash in Q2, which is a 27% improvement year-on-year compared to last year, as far as continuing the operation is concerned. If I look at the first semester, which is probably a better way to look at cash, as there were some movement between the Q1 and Q2, overall, we come EUR 350 million higher than in the first semester of last year. So a strong performance and clearly a strong focus on cash for all the organization.
Portfolio. Key element is the Cytec integration going very well. In terms of cost synergies, we are generating EUR 14 million in Q2. Run rate, we are almost at EUR 50 million for the yearly impact, and that's something which is very much in line with our upgraded objective to generate EUR 100 million -- more than EUR 100 million of cost synergies due to this integration. I think that being already at EUR 50 million per year running rate 6 months after the integration is a very good result for an asset of this size. 
But synergy is also an -- top line synergies, our ability to continue to execute our growth strategy. Just to mention a few reasons which I think demonstrate the potential of the combination. Boeing has decided to select Solvay composite material to produce part of the primary structure of the 777X. That's very good. It's the first time we are awarded a primary structure in 1 of the 2 big OEMs. We are already producing primary structure components for fighter jet or for business jet. But with Boeing -- entering into Boeing is a very important achievement. The product itself will be produced in a JV, but we will set up with Mubadala via the sovereign front of the Emirates.
Another interesting element, more on the technology side, the Russian plane, the MS-21 was presented. What's interesting with this plane is that it has a very new technology. It's a composite aisle, but the -- wings -- sorry, it's a composite wing, but the technology is very original. It's not anymore using autoclave. It's what's called resin infusion, and Solvay is a provider of technology. And we think that besides this specific Russian project, it's a technology which could be a breakthrough in aerospace, and we are very proud to have been chosen some years ago as the partner to develop this technology. 
And we are continuing to see very interesting opportunities in Specialty Polymer. Probably the one I would like to mention before turning to Karim is the battery market. We are seeing -- as I've mentioned during the past 2 calls, we are seeing or hearing a real turning point in terms of batteries for electric vehicle. This is linked to some of the large project that we are hearing about in the news. But this is also linked to a very important development that we are seeing in China for buses and electric vehicles, where the actual production is indeed increasing tremendously.
Trading opportunities. We are a supplier of most of the battery producers with our Specialty Polymers, and we see a very significant opportunities looking forward.
With that, I would like to turn to Karim for a deeper look in our financials."

As usual, I'm going to refer to the slides that are on our website, and I'm going to start with Slide #10, which really looks at our sales. And as you can see, our sales in Q2 dropped by 6% to EUR",1053,"Thank you, Jean-Pierre. Good morning, and good afternoon. As usual, I'm going to refer to the slides that are on our website, and I'm going to start with Slide #10, which really looks at our sales. And as you can see, our sales in Q2 dropped by 6% to EUR 2.9 billion. What are the drivers? I'll come to the volumes and the pricing in a moment, but I have to start with foreign exchange because the euro has depreciated against some key currencies. The dollar, $1.13 in Q2 compared to $1.11 the same period last year. That's 2%. Brazilian reals, we appreciated -- or euro appreciated by 17%; 8% against the Chinese RMB. That's tied by the Korean won. All of this conspired against us with an impact of nearly 4%. 
Pricing. Jean-Pierre has already given you some color, and it really is a consequence of the deflationary environment with lower raw material prices, being partially passed through to our customers, particularly in businesses such as polyamide.
There is a tiny bit of pricing pressure as well in our Advanced Formulations oil and gas business. Activities, although in this market, as you know, diminishes volume rather than price.
Now volumes. Jean-Pierre has alluded to the fact that they're growing modestly, despite the headwinds that we're all aware of; the headwinds being, obviously, oil and gas and what we're seeing on small devices. If I take that to the side and say, ""where is the growth is coming from,"" I'm going to highlight some of the key ones: Specialty Polymers. It's seeing growth in automotive, health care, consumer goods, rare earth's automotive catalysts. Novecare. Excluding oil and gas, we're seeing good growth in home and personal care, agro and coatings. And the list continues. 
In other words, whilst you can see a modest volume increase, 2 things I'd like to say: one, the 1% volume growth is the first growth we've seen since the end of 2014, and we welcome that; and secondly, as we look at it, we see this as a very clear evidence of both the strength and the breadth of the diverse portfolio that we have.
Turning to Page or Slide 11, I'd like to turn to profits. Jean-Pierre has already highlighted the key headlines where the 8% EBITDA growth, the EBITDA margin reaching a new record of 22%. Now, pricing power has continued to progress, albeit more modestly. But this is the 10th quarter in a row, and that again demonstrates continued momentum on excellence with also some tailwinds from the impacts of our transactional hedging policy. But fundamentally, a very, very welcome continuation of the momentum that we've seen now for quite a while. 
Cost discipline is here, and it's here to stay. Our fixed costs are down over the period last year, and that is despite the inflationary impact. Inflation alone would have reduced our profits by about EUR 25 million in this quarter. The fact that you see the costs, the fixed costs go down, also despite the additional costs from the added capacities from the new plants that we have added. So this is something that we're particularly pleased with. And it also reflects the savings and the synergy delivery, which were totaling EUR 14 million in the quarter. In the first half, the synergy delivery on Cytec equated to EUR 24 million already, and you can see the impacts of that both in our corporate expenses as well as in our composites and technology solutions business.
The other aspect maybe to highlight on this is the fact that RusVinyl is really going from strength to strength. It is now running at close to full capacity. And we have a onetime gain in our soda ash business with the sale of something like 338 railcars that were surplussed to our needs, and it generated, again, over EUR 11 million that we've highlighted for clarity.
Page 13. I don't want to ignore net income because there's some good progress here as well. I recognize there's a lot of information, a lot of data on the this page, but there are 2 things I want to highlight. One, our underlying net income from our continuing businesses, so excluding the impacts of the businesses we've now sold, was up 17%. And that is the result essentially of the higher EBITDA but also an improvement in our underlying tax rate, which is 1.5% better than last year. And that is something we are very, very pleased with. Total underlying income was 4% lower because of the impact of the profits that we no longer have associated with the European chlorovinyl business. As you well know, we transferred to INOVYN in the middle of last year, and we've now sold fully and have the cash in at the beginning of July.
Turning to cash. Jean-Pierre has given you the key headlines, but if you turn to Page 15, there's a couple of things I would like to highlight. Q2 showed a significant increase in our cash flows, 27% up. You remember we had a strong cash flow in Q1, so it is worth taking a step back and recognizing that the free cash flow from our continuing businesses of EUR 200 million in the first half was EUR 346 million better than last year. Now despite that, our debt is up EUR 0.4 billion. Two things I'd like to say about that. One is that increase in our debt is completely in line with our expectations, and it reflects the incidents, the timing of dividend payments and all interest charges, completely in line with expectations. The other thing I'd like to mention is that in the same period in 2015, the debt of Solvay increased by EUR 0.8 billion. So we've halved the increase. That's why we're particularly pleased. What I can confirm is that the delivery you see is completely in line with our indication that the group's free cash flow for the year will exceed EUR 650 million.
Finally, before I hand you back to Jean-Pierre, if you take a step back again and look at our balance sheet, our cash flow, our indebtedness, I can confirm to you that our credit metrics remain entirely consistent with the investment grade that we attach significant importance to.

Second point, excellence program. They continue to deliver significant value creation. And really, I think it's quite impressive to see that 3 years after launching this, we still have the full pipe of opportunities. We are now launching excellence program in the former Cytec perimeter with some very significant opportunities in front of us. And indeed, we'll be in line with our overall committed EUR 800 million target at the end of this year. This is what we will have delivered over the last 3 years. 
Speed of integration at Cytec going very well in terms of organization and cost synergies. Clearly, the challenge now is to deliver the top line synergies and make sure that, indeed, in the various markets that we serve, aerospace, automotive but also mining and more broadly speaking, the market that Advanced Formulation is. We think the combination with Cytec gives us the opportunity to go further and faster. 
We will have a great opportunity to share this with you when we meet at our Capital Market Day in London on September 29. We are planning to focus our presentations to give you the opportunity to gain some insights in what we are doing in Advanced Materials and Advanced Formulation.

Smart devices is a bit of an exaggeration to say that it was 0 during the quarter, but indeed, low volumes. And yes, we expect to see the pickup linked to the product -- our new product coming on line, I would say with Q3. Maybe there were a few orders in the last days of Q2, but the simple message is that it will happen in Q3. PEEK plant. We are almost at mechanical completion, which means that we are starting the ramp up. We are at the start-up point for this plant. We expect to complete the start-up process some time during the second half. I don't want to be more specific because it's a bit of a complex process to start up, so it's not always easy to predict. But I would probably say that if things goes well, we expect the plant to be online in the middle of the year, in the middle of the second half of the year. And then there's, obviously, customer approval and so on. On composite, the mix effect has little impact on EBITDA as far as -- as long as we talk about composite for aerospace. If we are looking at different types of application, then you could see some changes. But no, I think the rotorcraft business, jet or the market situation doesn't have an impact on the mix. Rotorcraft, you're right to say that this has been pointed in previous quarterly results. The impact is a bit different from one player to the other, and the reason is very much linked to oil and gas. Once again, the oil and gas industry is a very large user of helicopter, and in that current situation, they are very prudent on their investment. Acetate tow, I read the Celanese comment. I was -- yes, I mean, we are seeing price pressure. And we are reacting to this, defending our margins. And part of it is commercial activity, part of it is focusing on raw material -- access to raw material, part of it is continuing to work on fixed costs. But yes, indeed, I think I'm a little bit more positive than what I've read coming from other player in this market."

And my answer will be a bit of a prudent one, and I suggest you be a bit patient and wait until our Capital Market Day, where we'll have the opportunity to give you more clarity on the various programs. In fact, we have different situations. We have a program like the Joint Strike Fighter or the LEAP engine, where the program is moving up with limited hiccups, if any. We are still at the initial stage where the number of planes or engine per year is still limited, but with a very impressive growth track in front of us. And we have situations which are a little bit less readable when it comes to new planes, where we see the OEMs facing some difficulties, which is going down the ramp-up. And again, I don't want to repeat what Boeing or Airbus executives were saying in the past few days regarding the difficulties they are facing to bring their industrial production available where they can meet the expectations in terms of delivery. So it's these 2 phenomena plus the fact that some older platform, like the 747, which was in the news today, are slowing down significantly or the 777, as they are seeing customers waiting -- willing to wait for the newer version. So all of that's created a bit of a complex situation and indeed create a situation where volumes are a little bit soft. But again, in our view, no reason for concern, just an adjustment in an industry which is going for a significant transition. And if you take the example of a 777, what we will have in terms of content into this new plane is several times what we have in the current version. So for us, we need a bit of patience, but the transition is clearly something which will have a very significant positive impact. And shorter term, JFS and LEAP engine are really the 2 programs which will be a significant contributor to growth in the next quarter, then years.

The drivers of that are absolutely as you'd expect. Let we start with CapEx. What did you see in the first half? You saw that our CapEx was 15% down year-on-year. Our cash conversion was up from an average last year of 53% to 66%. So you can expect more of the same there. EBITDA, clearly, you can form your own views, and I know you will, but that will contribute to the cash flow because we will maintain that discipline on cash conversion. Working capital, there's a lot of ongoing improvement. I won't go into all the details of it. What I can say to you is, whilst I believe we are, factually speaking, in a top quartile of our sector, I think there's still more we can do. So that's about discipline. And one other thing. You may underestimate the impact, but if you take note of the fact that our effective tax rate was improved compared to last year by, I think I quoted 1.5%, each percentage point is EUR 10 million to EUR 15 million. So just staying where we are, maintaining that discipline, that attention, will contribute to that organic strong cash flow. And clearly, the only other aspect to recognize is there are normal dividend and interest charges, and all of that will also be part of the normal recipe. But there should be no surprises there at all, not least because in the first half of the year, you will have taken note that we did retire some debt that is significantly -- it's quite expensive, and we don't have any of that this year.

The rest of the performance, having looked at their announcement, are very similar if you correct for this. On automotive, I'm not sure I'm the best guy to give you a view on automotive in H2. It's true that European carmakers are a bit worried about the Brexit, although we think it will probably take another a couple of months before they have a view on what this means in terms of activity in the U.K. We've seen the growth kind of reducing a bit in the U.S., but it's not a region where we have a significant exposure. And in China, we continue to see some transfer of growth from international companies to a Chinese OEM, so these are the trends that we foresee. But all of that taking into account, we are probably a bit more prudent in H2 versus H1. Although I remind you that we are still in a position where we are gaining share versus other technology, other solutions, which does not make us so dependent on just the underlying market trend. RusVinyl, so -- RusVinyl, yes -- I mean, why do we have a good performance? One, the plant is now running at almost full capacity. Second, we find our position in the Russian market. Clearly, Russia is going through a lot of challenges, but something turned out to play in our favor, which is the volatility of the ruble, which makes it very difficult for people to import PVC. Which means that today, we have been able to put most of our product on the Russian market, and this is clearly a better solution than exporting. So overall, a good level of performance. And probably what we've seen Q2 is probably a reasonable proxy of what you could see in remaining quarters. At least, I don't see any significant risk of seeing this number changing."

You gave us a number in the first quarter; you didn't in the second quarter. But from the commentary, am I right in assuming it was the bulk of the pricing power? And if so, how will you see the pricing power develop on the second half? Because you'd already warned that the pricing power that we saw in the first quarter, probably not sustainable. And then the second question, and I understand the want to be prudent, but clearly -- and then people are pretty cautious on the oil price as well, but clearly, the rig count is now materially up from the bottom, up over 15%. Just wondering if a recovery did continue, when would you expect to see that sort of thing reflect in your volumes? Or is the focus on cost going to delay that effect?"

But again, I think we have to be careful with the rig count going down 50% year-on-year; it's probably up sequentially by 2% or 3%. So yes, maybe we've reached the bottom, but we are not yet at a point where we see people rushing to drill. By the way, there were some interesting statements made last week by some service companies while they were presenting their results, saying that today, the technology has evolved to a point where the number of rigs necessary to maintain production in the U.S. is probably significantly lower than it was. The good news is that chemical are still needed in same volume. So all of that to say that I think once it picks up, I think we will see, very rapidly, some impact. But I'm very prudent on the question of when it will indeed pick up. So I think the current oil price is still volatile. $50 is probably a good trigger point. So we were there a month ago. We are now closer to $40, so a thin cushion has to be there. But I spent some time with our North American teams a few weeks ago, and I'm absolutely convinced that during these difficult time, we have increased significantly our market share. We have increased significantly our ability to bring cost-improvement solution, competitiveness-improvement solution to our customers. So yes, I think the day it starts up, we'll be very well-positioned to benefit from it. But I'm not counting on it to give you my H2 guidance."

Our leadership positions, our ability to do what Jean-Pierre was talking about, which is meeting the needs of our customers and holding our own in a competitive marketplace. I have confidence there. Where I have less visibility, like everybody else, is the impact of foreign exchange going forward, the impact of energy costs and et cetera, et cetera. So what I would say to you is the future is uncertain, clearly, but history tells us, the last 10 quarters sequentially, we have managed to deliver it.

Again, you should realize that today, we are not a commodity chemical company managing prices everyday. I mean, a significant part of our business is done on a number of program, like what we do in smart devices or aerospace. And then the ability, month-after-month to -- or quarter-after-quarter to manage pricing power is not always exactly the same. But no, I'm quite optimistic regarding our ability to continue to demonstrate this pricing power. We are in a situation where we've seen some steep increase in some energy and raw material cost, so the ability to pass them immediately to the customer is not always -- I mean, we are not always in the position to do so as quickly as we would all expect to be. But frankly speaking, I think the track record of Solvay demonstrate that we've been doing quite well in this regard, and I'm optimistic that for the full year, we'll be able to continue to demonstrate this ability. I might add that we've been also very active on the fixed cost part of the equation. And overall, even if the pricing power impact is modest, the EBITDA margin improvement, which is quite significant, almost 300 basis points, demonstrate that the company is very much focused on profitability. On Airbus versus Boeing, I mean, it's probably something we can discuss at our Capital Markets Day, but your analysis is a very good one. In fact, we are strong in both cases on secondary structure. We have had a lot of activities with Boeing to develop a position in primary structure in past years, which explains why we got this award of the 777X, which means that there will be more than one supplier of composite for primary structure with Boeing. With Airbus, we want to demonstrate them our capabilities. We are -- they're already a significant customer, but we can certainly do more. I'm using my own personal network to make sure that the top management of Airbus understands what we can do. We see also with Airbus some interesting opportunities to bring some of our specialty polymer materials. You might remember that we announced some approval of a product called  TegraCore for the A350 for some applications. We think that there could be much more significant opportunities here and there, mostly for within the cabin application. So clearly, with Airbus, we want to reestablish ourselves as a key strategic supplier. And the response today is good, although it takes time to have a product on an airplane in an industry which is very cautious. But clearly, one of the potential top line synergy that we're seeing with the integration of Cytec into Solvay is this ability to focus in a more balanced way between North American and European players. And so far, I would say the response is good. Let's make sure that we can transform that in future sales."

I hope that we were able to share with you what we were the key elements of these results.

Strong focus on free cash flow. We've said it from the beginning of the year, and it's really something where we are seeing some changes. I think the cash profile this year will look very differently from what it was last year, and it's a much safer, much less back-end loaded profile. EBITDA margin at 22%, probably something which, in comparison with our peers, shows again the quality of the portfolio that we have today within Solvay.

As usual, I will cover in a few minutes what I think are the key highlights regarding our performance and then turn to Karim and come back with a conclusion. We'll try to make it as effective as possible, to leave as much time as possible for question. 
So we think that we've been able to produce once again a solid set of results despite the fact that some of our markets are seeing some headwinds, as you all know. I think we are very much delivering as planned and [ph] very much within the framework of what we've covered during our Capital Market Day some weeks ago. 
6% EBITDA growth. A record margin of 23%, which looks reasonably strong in comparison with the overall players in the chemical space. This is due to our ongoing success of our excellence program. We are [indiscernible] the company continuing to focus very much on identifying and putting in place action plans leading for improvement. Pricing power, it's the 11th consecutive quarter in which we've been able to achieve a positive balance between the impact of our selling prices and the impact of our raw material and energy costs. I think it's something which clearly show the strength of our market position, and the fact that our teams, even in an inflationary or deflationary environment, are indeed focusing on pricing power, and this adds a strong contribution to our margins. 
Focused also on synergies delivery, EUR 21 million in Q3. This is linked to the Cytec integration. EUR 45 million year-to-date, so very much in line with what we shared at the Capital Market Day, and one of the reason why we are confident that we will exit [ph] significantly the amount of synergies that we have announced when we've announced the transaction back in July 2015.
Good cash generation, we had set [ph] of about pretty high for 2016 as far as cash generation is concerned, EUR 280 million of free cash flow in Q3, a significant improvement versus last year. And cumulated, indeed, a very good performance, very much in line with the full year guidance. And we are looking forward, we think that we are indeed well positioned to deliver double-digit EBITDA growth in the fourth quarter, leading to a 7% to 8% EBITDA growth for the whole year.
If we look at various markets, probably little surprises, but let me just cover with you some of what we've been seeing. Some headwinds, first one, on smart device. So the market is up sequentially significantly. This is linked to new product launches, but not at the level that we've seen last year. What we are seeing in this market is a change of behavior in our customers, which used to show a situation where people were building up very significant inventories ahead of a launch of a new product. What we are seeing today is a much more regular production rate. Overall, I think it will -- I don't expect to see significant differences, but it's true that the sequence is a bit different. We don't have this big bump in Q3, but we expect to see continuing strength in this segment for the next quarters.
Specialty Polymer was able to deliver significant growth in overall [ph] market, which means that, overall, this business was significantly up. Health care; consumer goods are doing very well; automotive market; and once again, battery, which is turning into a very significant growth driver for our Advanced Material business.
Composite. We've seen growth in new aircraft, but not yet offsetting the decline in legacy civil aircraft. This is the challenging transition that our customer are facing from the A320, Boeing 737 to the new version, neo and MAX. We are also seeing some decline in the 777 as customers are waiting for the newer planes, the 777X. So midterm, good news for us because these new planes have much more composite content than the previous version. But again, a transition which is probably a little bit more difficult than some people were expecting. And we are continuing to see the start-up and, hopefully, the beginning of a significant success story, both on the LEAP engine and the F-35, the U.S. jet fighter, but we are just at the beginning of a significant ramp-up in production schedules.
Oil and gas remains weak, although the situation is a little bit different. If you look at it sequentially or if you look at it compared to the same quarter of last year, we are significantly below Q3 2015 level, but we are seeing the market strengthening from one quarter to the next. The rig count in North America is increasing. We see more and more activities on the ground, and this gives us confidence that we have seen the worst in this market and that we should expect a slow recovery looking forward.
Other markets in our formulation business are indeed growing, although compared to the same quarter, the oil and gas impact is significant.
Mining remains resilient with a very good performance, and we've seen a modest growth overall, but at a very [indiscernible] performance in our phosphorous and phosphine business. Good demand for soda ash. Double-digit growth in bicarbonate, mostly linked to the fact that our new plant in Thailand is now operating at a higher rate. And the other businesses, peroxide, Acetow, stable; pretty much showing some improvement. Against this changing backdrop, we've delivered earning growth, and Karim will share the key highlights in a minute.
Just maybe a couple of more words to highlight the fact that we are continuing to work on profitable [ph] transformation, probably not much specific news that we can share with you at this point of time. But clearly, improving the quality of our portfolio is higher on my agenda and it's a subject on which our teams are continuing to work very actively.
In terms of new capacity start-ups, our hydrogen peroxide capacity in China is now operational within the conditions that we were expecting. I was just in Korea last week to inaugurate a new highly disposable silica plant, very, very nice plant, probably state-of-the-art, and it will soon become a benchmark for us. But we are in the part of the process where our customers are approving our products. It will take some months to benefit from the new capacity that this plant will bring.
In Germany, we have also expanded production for the LEAP engine, this is composite. There are 2 we need to have customer approval, and it will take some months before the plant is indeed able to deliver on production product for our customers.
And regarding the very large H2O2 [ph] plant in Sadara. The Sadara project is completed in terms of construction and mechanical completion, so now this is -- we are starting to see the beginning of a start-up of this very, very large complex, and we expect to see the benefit of our operation there in 2017.
Well, in a nutshell, I guess, we are really delivering according to the strategy that we've shared with you during our Capital Market Day. And I would like to turn to Karim to give you a bit more color on these results."

As usual, the numbers I'm going to discuss are on an underlying basis, and I am going to refer to certain slides that are available on our websites. 
And let me start with the top line. If you turn to Slide 9 and look at our sales. Jean-Pierre has given you the context, and I just like to summarize the key points. 
Volumes are down 3%, that is a fact. You are aware, Jean-Pierre has highlighted the impact of smart devices, oil and gas, and also the aerospace, this transition that we're experiencing in several large commercial transport. That's on the weighing side. On the plus side, which doesn't do enough to compensate, we're seeing growth in a number of markets. Automotive, where we've seen good demand. Polyamide [ph] used in lithium ion batteries, catalysts for emission controls, agro, home and personal care, industrial, health care. So strong growth as well in many other end markets, but not enough to overcome the headwinds that Jean-Pierre alluded to.
Prices are down 3%, not a surprise. As you know well, that in a deflationary environment, we do have a pulse [ph] with several key customers says, and we see that, in particular, in Polyamide, in Coatis as well as some aspects in oil and gas as well.
Now if we turn to the EBITDA, and I'll give a bit more color as well on Page 10. 
The key headlines, [indiscernible] with record margin, 6% up. What has driven it? Let me start with Advanced Materials. Specialty Polymers saw a double-digit growth in health care and consumer goods and in batteries for auto, but as I said before, that hasn't been enough to offset the very significant sales decline in smart devices. Remember, this was against last year's record sales. And all we need to do is to look at some of the key players in the market to see what they're selling [ph] as well, so that shouldn't be a surprise. But that has had quite a significant impact. Composites has delivered sales growth of composite materials into the new aircraft, but that growth has not been at the level to offset the decline in the legacy widebody civil aircraft.
To give you examples. Generally, to note that the aerospace supply chain tends to anticipate announcement by manufacturers well before they're publicly announced. We've seen a continued decline in the widebody civil aircraft, the Boeing 747-8, the 777, the A380, A330. That hasn't compensated for the growth in the single-aisle, the A320, the 737, with the growth in the LEAP engine or the ramp-up in the Joint Strike Fighter. So we are in a period of transition. One thing I'd like to highlight is we are maintaining our leading position. There has been no share loss in Solvay's position. And that is important. And we are positioned to respond to our customers' needs as ramp-up rates pick up.
Advanced Formulations are down 12%. I'm very pleased that we managed to maintain our EBITDA margins stable at 18%. Oil and gas, you won't be surprised. It's pleasing to see the rig count in North America go up from a low point of about 480 in May to nearly just over 680 at the end of October, but that hasn't yet translated into a marked increase in demand. What I would say, though, as against last year, that has weighed on our results and it masks high single-digits growth in agro, HPC and in other industrial end markets.
Mining, as Jean-Pierre has highlighted, the sales growth in phosphorus and phosphine chemistries. The underlying business is stable, it is resilient.
Turning to performance chemicals, what do we see? We see margin expansion to 29%, with EBITDA up 4%. Bicarbonate did perform well, and one of the factors there absolutely is the ramp-up of the new plant in Thailand. It's good to see that the investments we're making are beginning to contribute to our bottom line.
Operational excellence is another factor that has really contributed to the improvement there. As it has in Functional Polymers, that has seen a 25% EBITDA improvement and a margin expansion to 17%. Corporate costs have reduced significantly. And what does that reflect? It reflects synergies, excellence and some phasing where we've essentially deferred and delayed some of the programs to next year. To make it easy, to give you an indication, the annual future run rate based on our current portfolio is of the order of EUR 220 million a year, 2-2-0, and that represents about 15% less than the equivalent run rate in 2015. And that's where the synergies and the excellent really kicks in. 
How has that profit generation converted into cash? So if you turn to Page 14, you'll see that we have improved our cash conversion to 66% so far this year, so strong performance, and that has also translated with working capital discipline to strong cash flow that you can see highlighted on Page 15. 
So what are the key points? One, as Jean-Pierre mentioned, EUR 280 million represents the cash flow we generated this year, that's EUR 25 million higher than last year. That doesn't really tell you the full story. If you look at it on a cumulative basis, you will note 2 things: cumulative cash flow of EUR 464 million, which is EUR 318 million [ph] higher than the same period last year. That is the performance that has given us the conviction, the confidence that we can absolutely up our minimum target from EUR 650 million to more than EUR 700 million this year.
As a result of that strong cash flow, if you turn to page or Slide 15, our net debt, our net debt has fallen by EUR 0.5 billion in the quarter. Part of it comes from the strong cash flow. The other part, as you know, is the proceeds from the accelerated exit on INOVYN. So in short, strong performance, strong profit growth, very strong cash conversion, and we now see the impact and the benefits of that in our indebtedness.
Now just one other comment before I hand you back to Jean-Pierre, I would like to remind you that certain key non-financial indicators are really worth taking into account when one assesses performance and real sustainable value creation. Looking forward, we will, as appropriate, include and discuss such indicators with you when we publish future results as well.
And I turn you back to Jean-Pierre for a few remarks before we move on to the Q&A."

So I think, overall, we've delivered good results in a challenging market environment. I think this illustrates the diversity and the quality of our portfolio. And the fact that, indeed, our teams have been focusing very much on excellent initiative and cost synergies and delivery. We expect the momentum to continue into Q4. We estimate that we'll be able to generate double-digit EBITDA growth in Q4. We expect this is based on additional synergies coming from the integration of Cytec, the continuation of our excellence program and new capacity addition that supports our volume growth.
Combined with what we've achieved in the first 9 months of the year, our expectation is to generate, overall, 7% to 8% EBITDA growth for the full year 2016, which is within the range of our prior guidance. And once again, no reason to make any further comment on the midterm objective that we've shared with you in September. Obviously, we are very confident that we'll be able to deliver on these objectives.

Regarding the LEAP engine to date, so it's still at the very beginning of its production, so I would say it's not material when I look at the cluster. And U.S. PEEK plant is just starting the qualification batches, so don't expect any meaningful contribution from this plant before 2017."

Secondly, on Performance Chemicals, just from the divisional perspective in total, what was the source of the the negative pricing in the third quarter, down 4%? That sort of seem to certainly surprised me. And then finally, in Functional Polymers, I guess a 2-part question, are the electricity outages at Vinythai, were they a one-off effect or are they an ongoing issue? And the step-up in margin that we saw in Functional Polymers, is that partly a mix effect relating to Vinythai or is it something -- is it just the balance of pricing and input costs in Polyamide?"

Regarding composite, we have a bit of a complex equation with a number of moving parts. So first, in terms of large commercial aircraft, single aisle, we are seeing that movement from the A320 to the neo version, same thing with Boeing, and we are hearing some comments from our customers that they are facing some challenges, which explain that the ramp-up is probably a little bit slower than expected, one. But it's happening. I mean, the production rate should soon be back to where -- the production rate of the newer [ph] planes should soon be back where our customers expected them to be. Larger aircraft, the transition will happen with the launch of the 777X. You'll remember that we have signed an agreement with Boeing to be a supplier, not just of secondary structure, but also part of the primary structure. The plane is supposed to fly in 2019, and production will start then. We have new programs starting up, LEAP and the F-35. It's a very multi-decade program. We are just at the beginning of the allies [ph], and we expect to see significant increase in production rate in the next few years. So taking all of that in consideration, I would say that we expect the inflection point to be somewhere during the later part of 2017, although again it's probably a little bit premature to give a too precise of an indication. But in the first part of 2017, we expect to continue to see some -- the phenomena that I've just mentioned continuing to apply. On top of that... sorry, on top of that, you have to take into account also the other, the non-aerospace composite. There, we've done a bit of clean-up in the business. There were a lot of actions taken by the team to improve our profitability, to bring new customers in, and this clearly will play a positive role in 2017."

Pensions, quite a few things. You also asked for a view on discount rates, which obviously I can't give. Let me start with the sensitivity. On Page 31 in the slide deck, you will see the sensitivity of 50 basis points on the balance sheet, which gives you EUR 376 million. In this quarter, we've already seen a ramp-up in our balance sheet of EUR 0.2 billion because of discount rates again. So you can formulate your own expectations and do what if. What you also are correct in saying is, depending what you assume, you can anticipate, I'd say, a modest P&L, actually, even lesser extent, cash impacts at current lower discount rates, I anticipate both [indiscernible] EUR 10 million to EUR 20 million more than we've had historically.

This is true with the internal combustion engine technologies. This is even more true with the development, which I would say quite fast development of electric or hybrid vehicles. On the first part, internal combustion engine, are continuing to see the development in the advanced polymer in many chemical parts around the engine or within the engine compartment. And within some tailwinds, so overall, a satisfactory position. And for us, the amount of product we can put on an electric vehicle is significantly higher, as we've presented during the Capital Market Day, than what we do on commission engine. So the fact that electric vehicles are becoming a reality and we expect this year a significant increase and next year should continue on the same trend. This clearly opens up opportunities for us in automotive and battery.

On your first question, well, I have to be modest, we are a bit new to the aerospace segments, so I think we've been surprised a little bit by both, but we're not the only one, even guys who have been there for quite some time understand that we are facing a bit of a new situation where there is a significant number of challenges from old airplanes into new ones, from older engine designs into new ones, and all of this create some uncertainties short-term. I think midterm, all of this goes into the right direction which is increasing very significantly the use of composites. But it's true that at this point of time, we see the OEMs are working very hard to make sure that we put in place the production capabilities for the new planes. And at the same time, especially for widebodies, continued to sell the the existing ones. I'm thinking of a transition between 777 and 777X. So we are learning the specifics of this new segment, and again, no big changes in our midterm view, but yes, short-term, a bit more disruption than what were, but we were on probably expecting some months ago. And on the headlines, Karim?"

And as soon as we have some news, we'd be delighted to share it with you. On silica pressure on prices, yes, but it's a business where we have long-term contract, so the pressure comes when we renegotiate contract. But then, it's a discussion on the prices, volumes, supply chain set-up, which could be a good way to create values between us and our customers. So overall, I think it's a business where we have the ability to defend our margins medium-term. For that, we need to continue to innovate. There are a new sets of regulation coming regarding vehicle emissions in 2020 in Europe, which will call for more effective tires, more fuel-efficient tires. And this is pushing our customers to look for new formulation which could allow them to achieve that, so that's an important subject for us in the next couple of years. And we are also working very hard to improve our cost competitive position on silica. I was mentioning that the new Korean silica unit is probably about to set a new benchmark in terms of costs because we've put the best technologies we have on these new plant, and this will be a great opportunity to make progress on the other plants. So overall, confident in our ability to continue to defend our margin in this business and to go, but a lot of work to do to make sure that we can do so. On pricing power?"

It's very difficult to predict exactly what is going to happen, partly because there are quite a few variables, as you know, that are completely outside of our immediate control: what competitors do, the foreign exchange is, commodity prices.

And you've seen that for 11 quarters sequentially, we've been creating positive pricing power. So I can confirm that we intend to deploy every lever that we can and to be effective in the marketplace, but let's see what time brings. One thing I would highlight as well is as we're really toward this market specialty portfolio, you can really see the quality of hat pricing power and the EBITDA margin, the 2 go hand in hand, so over time, we're trying to expect more of the same, particularly the commodity feature of the portfolio diminishes in importance."

And thank you very much for having participated in this call. I think, overall, we have demonstrated that the quality of our portfolio and the diversity that we have and the exposure to diverse segments allow us to deliver despite the fact that we are feeling some headwinds in some markets. Some of these headwinds are probably likely to reduce in the next months. Smart devices, oil and gas are probably going back to a more normal situation, which is good. But be assured that we'll continue to focus very much on all the self-help action plans that we have been putting in place in past years. And this covers both excellence initiatives, which continued to be a very strong driver of the improved performance from the company, but also, the integration of Cytec, once again, a very significant synergy delivery up until Q3 and for the full year, very much in line with our increased objective of EUR 150 million of total synergies by 2018. Cash, indeed, is an important objective for the full year. We have delivered already for the first 9 months a sizable amount of free cash flow, and we have slightly upgraded our full year guidance to at least EUR 700 million of free cash flow.
So with that, I would once again like to thank you, and we'll talk again on February..."

I'm here in Brussels with Karim Hajjar and Kimberly, who is joining us for the first time. Welcome, Kimberly. As usual, I will cover in a few minutes what I think are the key highlights regarding our performance and then turn to Karim and come back with a conclusion. We'll try to make it as effective as possible, to leave as much time as possible for question. 
So we think that we've been able to produce once again a solid set of results despite the fact that some of our markets are seeing some headwinds, as you all know. I think we are very much delivering as planned and in the -- very much within the framework of what we've covered during our Capital Market Day some weeks ago. 
6% EBITDA growth. A record margin of 23%, which looks reasonably strong in comparison with the overall players in the chemical space. This is due to our ongoing success of our excellence program. We are, throughout the company, continuing to focus very much on identifying and putting in place action plans leading for improvement. Pricing power, it's the 11th consecutive quarter in which we've been able to achieve a positive balance between the impact of our selling prices and the impact of our raw material and energy costs. I think it's something which clearly show the strength of our market position, and the fact that our teams, even in an inflationary or deflationary environment, are indeed focusing on pricing power, and this adds a strong contribution to our margins. 
Focused also on synergies delivery, EUR 21 million in Q3. This is linked to the Cytec integration. EUR 45 million year-to-date, so very much in line with what we shared at the Capital Market Day, and one of the reason why we are confident that we will exceed significantly the amount of synergies that we have announced when we've announced the transaction back in July 2015.
Good cash generation, we had set of about pretty high for 2016 as far as cash generation is concerned, EUR 280 million of free cash flow in Q3, a significant improvement versus last year. And cumulated, indeed, a very good performance, very much in line with the full year guidance. And we are looking forward, we think that we are indeed well positioned to deliver double-digit EBITDA growth in the fourth quarter, leading to a 7% to 8% EBITDA growth for the whole year.
If we look at various markets, probably little surprises, but let me just cover with you some of what we've been seeing. Some headwinds, first one, on smart device. So the market is up sequentially significantly. This is linked to new product launches, but not at the level that we've seen last year. What we are seeing in this market is a change of behavior in our customers, which used to show a situation where people were building up very significant inventories ahead of a launch of a new product. What we are seeing today is a much more regular production rate. Overall, I think it will -- I don't expect to see significant differences, but it's true that the sequence is a bit different. We don't have this big bump in Q3, but we expect to see continuing strength in this segment for the next quarters.
Specialty Polymer was able to deliver significant growth in other markets, which means that, overall, this business was significantly up. Health care; consumer goods are doing very well; automotive market; and once again, battery, which is turning into a very significant growth driver for our Advanced Material business.
Composite. We've seen growth in new aircraft, but not yet offsetting the decline in legacy civil aircraft. This is the challenging transition that our customer are facing from the A320, Boeing 737 to the new version, neo and MAX. We are also seeing some decline in the 777 as customers are waiting for the newer planes, the 777X. So midterm, good news for us because these new planes have much more composite content than the previous version. But again, a transition which is probably a little bit more difficult than some people were expecting. And we are continuing to see the start-up and, hopefully, the beginning of a significant success story, both on the LEAP engine and the F-35, the U.S. jet fighter, but we are just at the beginning of a significant ramp-up in production schedules.
Oil and gas remains weak, although the situation is a little bit different. If you look at it sequentially or if you look at it compared to the same quarter of last year, we are significantly below Q3 2015 level, but we are seeing the market strengthening from one quarter to the next. The rig count in North America is increasing. We see more and more activities on the ground, and this gives us confidence that we have seen the worst in this market and that we should expect a slow recovery looking forward.
Other markets in our formulation business are indeed growing, although compared to the same quarter, the oil and gas impact is significant.
Mining remains resilient with a very good performance, and we've seen a modest growth overall, but had a very high level of performance in our phosphorous and phosphine business. Good demand for soda ash. Double-digit growth in bicarbonate, mostly linked to the fact that our new plant in Thailand is now operating at a higher rate. And the other businesses, peroxide, Acetow, stable; pretty much showing some improvement. Against this changing backdrop, we've delivered earning growth, and Karim will share the key highlights in a minute.
Just maybe a couple of more words to highlight the fact that we are continuing to work on profitable transformation, probably not much specific news that we can share with you at this point of time. But clearly, improving the quality of our portfolio is higher on my agenda and it's a subject on which our teams are continuing to work very actively.
In terms of new capacity start-ups, our hydrogen peroxide capacity in China is now operational within the conditions that we were expecting. I was just in Korea last week to inaugurate a new highly disposable silica plant, very, very nice plant, probably state-of-the-art, and it will soon become a benchmark for us. But we are in the part of the process where our customers are approving our products. It will take some months to benefit from the new capacity that this plant will bring.
In Germany, we have also expanded production for the LEAP engine, this is composite. There are 2 we need to have customer approval, and it will take some months before the plant is indeed able to deliver on production product for our customers.
And regarding the very large H2O2 plant in Sadara. The Sadara project is completed in terms of construction and mechanical completion, so now this is -- we are starting to see the beginning of a start-up of this very, very large complex, and we expect to see the benefit of our operation there in 2017.
Well, in a nutshell, I guess, we are really delivering according to the strategy that we've shared with you during our Capital Market Day. And I would like to turn to Karim to give you a bit more color on these results."

If you turn to Slide 9 and look at our sal",1096,"Jean-Pierre, thank you. 
As usual, the numbers I'm going to discuss are on an underlying basis, and I am going to refer to certain slides that are available on our websites. 
And let me start with the top line. If you turn to Slide 9 and look at our sales. Jean-Pierre has given you the context, and I just like to summarize the key points. 
Volumes are down 3%, that is a fact. You are aware, Jean-Pierre has highlighted the impact of smart devices, oil and gas, and also the aerospace, this transition that we're experiencing in several large commercial transport. That's on the weighing side. On the plus side, which doesn't do enough to compensate, we're seeing growth in a number of markets. Automotive, where we've seen good demand for our products that are used in lithium ion batteries, catalysts for emission controls, agro, home and personal care, industrial, health care. So strong growth as well in many other end markets, but not enough to overcome the headwinds that Jean-Pierre alluded to.
Prices are down 3%, not a surprise. As you know well, that in a deflationary environment, we do have a pause with several key customers says, and we see that, in particular, in Polyamide, in Coatis as well as some aspects in oil and gas as well.
Now if we turn to the EBITDA, and I'll give a bit more color as well on Page 10. 
The key headlines, you're familiar with, record margins, 6% up. What has driven it? Let me start with Advanced Materials. Specialty Polymers saw a double-digit growth in health care and consumer goods and in batteries for auto, but as I said before, that hasn't been enough to offset the very significant sales decline in smart devices. Remember, this was against last year's record sales. And all we need to do is to look at some of the key players in the market to see what they're saying as well, so that shouldn't be a surprise. But that has had quite a significant impact. Composites has delivered sales growth of composite materials into the new aircraft, but that growth has not been at the level to offset the decline in the legacy widebody civil aircraft.
To give you examples. Generally, to note that the aerospace supply chain tends to anticipate announcement by manufacturers well before they're publicly announced. We've seen a continued decline in the widebody civil aircraft, the Boeing 747-8, the 777, the A380, A330. That hasn't compensated for the growth in the single-aisle, the A320, the 737, with the growth in the LEAP engine or the ramp-up in the Joint Strike Fighter. So we are in a period of transition. One thing I'd like to highlight is we are maintaining our leading position. There has been no share loss in Solvay's position. And that is important. And we are positioned to respond to our customers' needs as ramp-up rates pick up.
Advanced Formulations are down 12%. I'm very pleased that we managed to maintain our EBITDA margins stable at 18%. Oil and gas, you won't be surprised. It's pleasing to see the rig count in North America go up from a low point of about 480 in May to nearly just over 680 at the end of October, but that hasn't yet translated into a marked increase in demand. What I would say, though, as against last year, that has weighed on our results and it masks high single-digits growth in agro, HPC and in other industrial end markets.
Mining, as Jean-Pierre has highlighted, the sales growth in phosphorus and phosphine chemistries. The underlying business is stable, it is resilient.
Turning to performance chemicals, what do we see? We see margin expansion to 29%, with EBITDA up 4%. Bicarbonate did perform well, and one of the factors there absolutely is the ramp-up of the new plant in Thailand. It's good to see that the investments we're making are beginning to contribute to our bottom line.
Operational excellence is another factor that has really contributed to the improvement there. As it has in Functional Polymers, that has seen a 25% EBITDA improvement and a margin expansion to 17%. Corporate costs have reduced significantly. And what does that reflect? It reflects synergies, excellence and some phasing where we've essentially deferred and delayed some of the programs to next year. To make it easy, to give you an indication, the annual future run rate based on our current portfolio is of the order of EUR 220 million a year, 2-2-0, and that represents about 15% less than the equivalent run rate in 2015. And that's where the synergies and the excellent really kicks in. 
How has that profit generation converted into cash? So if you turn to Page 14, you'll see that we have improved our cash conversion to 66% so far this year, so strong performance, and that has also translated with working capital discipline to strong cash flow that you can see highlighted on Page 15. 
So what are the key points? One, as Jean-Pierre mentioned, EUR 280 million represents the cash flow we generated this year, that's EUR 25 million higher than last year. That doesn't really tell you the full story. If you look at it on a cumulative basis, you will note 2 things: cumulative cash flow of EUR 464 million, which is EUR 318 million [ph] higher than the same period last year. That is the performance that has given us the conviction, the confidence that we can absolutely up our minimum target from EUR 650 million to more than EUR 700 million this year.
As a result of that strong cash flow, if you turn to page or Slide 15, our net debt, our net debt has fallen by EUR 0.5 billion in the quarter. Part of it comes from the strong cash flow. The other part, as you know, is the proceeds from the accelerated exit on INOVYN. So in short, strong performance, strong profit growth, very strong cash conversion, and we now see the impact and the benefits of that in our indebtedness.
Now just one other comment before I hand you back to Jean-Pierre, I would like to remind you that certain key non-financial indicators are really worth taking into account when one assesses performance and real sustainable value creation. Looking forward, we will, as appropriate, include and discuss such indicators with you when we publish future results as well.
And I turn you back to Jean-Pierre for a few remarks before we move on to the Q&A."

Regarding the LEAP engine to date, so it's still at the very beginning of its production, so I would say it's not material when I look at the cluster.

That sort of seem to certainly surprised me. And then finally, in Functional Polymers, I guess a 2-part question, are the electricity outages at Vinythai, were they a one-off effect or are they an ongoing issue?

Regarding composite, we have a bit of a complex equation with a number of moving parts. So first, in terms of large commercial aircraft, single aisle, we are seeing that movement from the A320 to the neo version, same thing with Boeing, and we are hearing some comments from our customers that they are facing some challenges, which explain that the ramp-up is probably a little bit slower than expected, one. But it's happening. I mean, the production rate should soon be back to where -- the production rate of the newer planes should soon be back where our customers expected them to be. Larger aircraft, the transition will happen with the launch of the 777X. You'll remember that we have signed an agreement with Boeing to be a supplier, not just of secondary structure, but also part of the primary structure. The plane is supposed to fly in 2019, and production will start then. We have new programs starting up, LEAP and the F-35. It's a very multi-decade program. We are just at the beginning of the alliance [ph], and we expect to see significant increase in production rate in the next few years. So taking all of that in consideration, I would say that we expect the inflection point to be somewhere during the later part of 2017, although again it's probably a little bit premature to give a too precise of an indication. But in the first part of 2017, we expect to continue to see some -- the phenomena that I've just mentioned continuing to apply. On top of that... sorry, on top of that, you have to take into account also the other, the non-aerospace composite. There, we've done a bit of clean-up in the business. There were a lot of actions taken by the team to improve our profitability, to bring new customers in, and this clearly will play a positive role in 2017."

The underlying tax rate is really the figure to watch for, and you see it at 28%. What we indicated a year ago was low to mid-30s. In September, at the Capital Markets Day, we indicated around 30%. This, to our mind, is very much in line with what we're expecting. When you look at reported tax rate [indiscernible] you get some distortion sometimes because of exceptional movements, portfolio impacts, et cetera. So I encourage you to focus on the underlying. And if I look at our benchmarks, companies we're compared to, we see 22% to 29%. So to my mind, we're absolutely in the right zone and we absolutely are responding to our responsibilities. Pensions, quite a few things. You also asked for a view on discount rates, which obviously I can't give. Let me start with the sensitivity. On Page 31 in the slide deck, you will see the sensitivity of 50 basis points on the balance sheet, which gives you EUR 370 million. In this quarter, we've already seen a ramp-up in our balance sheet of EUR 0.2 billion because of discount rates again. So you can formulate your own expectations and do what if. While you also are correct in saying as depending on what you assume, you can anticipate, I'd say, a modest P&L, and to an even lesser extent, cash impacts at current lower discount rates, I anticipate both to be of the order of EUR 10 million to EUR 20 million more than we've had historically. In other words, well within the tolerance of our forecast and very much part of our expectations that we integrated when we talked to you guys in the Capital Markets Day in September."

And then final question, are you seeing any slowdown in activity in the automotive-related sectors at this stage or is it a market that still is going strong?

This is true with the internal combustion engine technologies. This is even more true with the development, which I would say, the quite fast development of electric or hybrid vehicles. On the first part, internal combustion engine, are continuing to see the development in the use of advanced polymer in many chemical parts around the engine or within the engine compartment. And this gives us some tailwinds, so overall, a satisfactory position. And for us, the amount of product we can put on an electric vehicle is significantly higher, as we've presented during the Capital Market Day, than what we do on noncommercial [ph] engines. So the fact that electric vehicles are becoming a reality and we expect this year a very significant increase and next year should continue on the same trend. This clearly opens up opportunities for us in automotive and battery. And battery for automotive is likely to be the next big growth driver for our Advanced Material and especially Specialty Polymer business. On your first question, well, I have to be modest, we are a bit new to the aerospace segments, so I think we've been surprised a little bit by both, but we are not the only one. Even guys who have been there for quite some time understand that we are facing a bit of a new situation where there's a very significant number of changes from older planes into new ones, from older engine designs into new ones. And all of this creates some uncertainties short term. I think midterm, all of this goes in the right direction, which is increasing very significantly the use of composite. But it's true that at this point of time, we see the OEMs are working very hard to make sure that they put in place the production capabilities for the new planes. And at the same time, especially for widebodies, continue to sell the existing ones. I'm thinking of a transition between 777 and 777X. So we are learning the specifics of this new segment, and again, no big changes in our midterm view, but yes, short-term, a bit more disruption than what were probably expecting some months ago.

But then, it's a discussion on the prices, volumes, supply chain set-up, which could be a good way to create values between us and our customers. So overall, I think it's a business where we have the ability to defend our margins medium term. For that, we need to continue to innovate. There are a new sets of regulation coming regarding vehicle emissions in 2020 in Europe, which will call for more effective tires, more fuel-efficient tires. And this is pushing our customers to look for new formulation which could allow them to achieve that, so that's an important subject for us in the next couple of years. And we are also working very hard to improve our cost-competitive position on silica. I was mentioning that the new Korean silica unit is probably about to set a new benchmark in terms of costs because we've put the best technologies we have on this new plant, and this will be a great opportunity to make progress on the other plants.

It's very difficult to predict exactly what's going to happen, partly because there are quite a few variables, as you know, that are completely outside of our immediate control: what competitors do; I mean, so foreign exchanges; commodity prices. But here's what I can say: there are a number of levers we can influence: operational excellence, pricing, being really effective with our customers in the marketplace. And you've seen that for 11 quarters sequentially, we've been creating positive pricing power. So I can confirm that we intend to deploy every lever that we can and to be effective in the marketplace, but let's see what time brings. One thing I would highlight as well is as we really evolve towards this multispecialty portfolio, you can really see the quality of that pricing power and the EBITDA margin, the 2 go hand in hand.

But again, nothing which sounds like the seasonality that you would see in other more commodity-type market. But again, key driver for Q4 in terms of seasonality is the fact that a number of plants are being shut down during the last couple of weeks, and that the supply chain in a lot of industries is going to a low point at the end of December. So this is probably the most important event. On Silica, don't forget that there is a specific event which is the impact of the Venezuelan devaluation. We have, unfortunately, a plant in Venezuela, which might not be the best country to operate today. And this has an impact of EUR 5 million.

If you follow the rig count in the U.S., you've some increases in the past months, regular increases, in fact, in the past months. We've seen significantly more activities on the ground, but people focusing on relatively low-cost formulation when it comes to their fracking fluids, so it's something which creates significant opportunities for friction reducers, significant opportunities for the Chemplex business. These 2 businesses are coming from the Chemlogic acquisition, because at Chemplex, we are preparing the formulation for our customers. Pressure is certainly on guar, as guar is a rather expensive component, which allows to make high quality fracturing fluid. But in the current context, people are really focusing on costs. I think we would need to see a higher oil price to see people ready to spend more on fracking. But yes, the activity is increasing, and this is good news. We have a feeling that the work is behind us. Now we are pragmatic and reasonable when it comes to recovery. I'm not telling you that we are back to the 2014 numbers. I'm just telling you that we are starting to see a bit of an improvement. Functional polymer, we are reasonably optimistic that we should be able to maintain the margin.

But be assured that we'll continue to focus very much on all the self-help action plans that we've been putting in place in past years.

I'm here in Brussels with Karim Hajjar and Kimberly, who is joining us for the first time. Welcome, Kimberly. As usual, I will cover in a few minutes what I think are the key highlights regarding our performance and then turn to Karim and come back with a conclusion. We'll try to make it as effective as possible, to leave as much time as possible for question. 
So we think that we've been able to produce once again a solid set of results despite the fact that some of our markets are seeing some headwinds, as you all know. I think we are very much delivering as planned and in the -- very much within the framework of what we've covered during our Capital Market Day some weeks ago. 
6% EBITDA growth. A record margin of 23%, which looks reasonably strong in comparison with the other players in the chemical space. This is due to our ongoing success of our excellence program. We are, throughout the company, continuing to focus very much on identifying and putting in place action plans leading for improvement. Pricing power, it's the 11th consecutive quarter in which we've been able to achieve a positive balance between the impact of our selling prices and the impact of our raw material and energy costs. I think it's something which clearly show the strength of our market position, and the fact that our teams, even in an inflationary or deflationary environment, are indeed focusing on pricing power, and this adds a strong contribution to our margins. 
Focus also on synergies delivery, EUR 21 million in Q3. This is linked to the Cytec integration. EUR 45 million year-to-date, so very much in line with what we shared at the Capital Market Day, and one of the reason why we are confident that we will exceed, significantly, the amount of synergies that we have announced when we've announced the transaction back in July 2015.
Good cash generation, we had set the bar pretty high for 2016 as far as cash generation is concerned. EUR 280 million of free cash flow in Q3, a significant improvement versus last year. And cumulated, indeed, a very good performance, very much in line with the full year guidance. And we are looking forward, we think that we are indeed well positioned to deliver double-digit EBITDA growth in the fourth quarter, leading to a 7% to 8% EBITDA growth for the whole year.
If we look at various markets, probably little surprises, but let me just cover with you some of what we've been seeing. Some headwinds, first one, on smart device. So the market is up sequentially, significantly. This is linked to new product launches, but not at the level that we've seen last year. What we are seeing in this market is a change of behavior in our customers. We used to see a situation where people were building up very significant inventories ahead of a launch of a new product. What we are seeing today is a much more regular production rate. Overall, I think it will -- I don't expect to see significant differences, but it's true that the sequence is a bit different. We don't have this big bump in Q3, but we expect to see continuing strength in this segment for the next quarters.
Specialty Polymer was able to deliver significant growth in other markets, which means that, overall, this business was significantly up. Health care, consumer goods are doing very well. Automotive market and, once again, battery, which is turning into a very significant growth driver for our Advanced Material business.
Composite. We've seen growth in new aircraft, but not yet offsetting the decline in legacy civil aircraft. This is the challenging transition that our customer are facing from the A320, Boeing 737 to the new version, neo and MAX. We are also seeing some decline in the 777 as customers are waiting for the new planes, the 777X. So midterm, good news for us because these new planes have much more composite content than the previous version. But again, a transition which is probably a little bit more difficult than some people were expecting. And we are continuing to see the start-up and, hopefully, the beginning of a significant success story, both on the LEAP engine and the F-35, the U.S. jet fighter. But we are just at the beginning of a significant ramp-up in production schedules.
Oil and gas remains weak, although the situation is a little bit different. If you look at it sequentially or if you look at it compared to the same quarter of last year, we are significantly below Q3 2015 level, but we are seeing the market strengthening from one quarter to the next. The rig count in North America is increasing. We see more and more activities on the ground, and this gives us confidence that we have seen the worst in this market and that we should expect a slow recovery looking forward.
Other markets in our formulation business are indeed growing, although compared to the same quarter, the oil and gas impact is significant.
Mining remains resilient with a very good performance, and we've seen a modest growth overall, but at a very high level of performance in our phosphorous and phosphine business. Good demand for soda ash. Double-digit growth in bicarbonate, mostly linked to the fact that our new plant in Thailand is now operating at a high rate. And the other businesses, peroxide, Acetow, stable; Polyamide showing some improvement. Against this changing backdrop, we've delivered earning growth, and Karim will share the key highlights in a minute.
Just maybe a couple of more words to highlight the fact that we are continuing to work on profitable transformation, probably not much specific news that we can share with you at this point of time. But clearly, improving the quality of our portfolio is very high on my agenda, and it's a subject on which our teams are continuing to work very actively.
In terms of new capacity start-ups, our hydrogen peroxide capacity in China is now operational within the conditions that we were expecting. I was just in Korea last week to inaugurate a new Highly Dispersible Silica plant, very, very nice plant, probably state-of-the-art, and it will soon become a benchmark for us. But we are in the part of the process where our customers are approving our products. It will take some months to benefit from the new capacity that this plant will bring.
In Germany, we have also expanded production for the LEAP engine, this is composite. There are 2 we need to have customer approval, and it will take some months before the plant is indeed able to deliver production product for our customers.
And regarding the very large H2O2 plant in Sadara. The Sadara project is completed in terms of construction and mechanical completion. So now this is -- we are starting to see the beginning of a start-up of this very, very large complex, and we expect to see the benefit of our operation there in 2017.
Well, in a nutshell, I guess, we are really delivering according to the strategy that we've shared with you during our Capital Market Day. And I would like to turn to Karim to give you a bit more color on these results."

As usual, the numbers I'm going to discuss are on an underlying basis, and I am going to refer to certain slides that are available on our website. And let me start with the top line. If you turn to Slide 9 and look at our sale",1094,"Jean-Pierre, thank you. 
As usual, the numbers I'm going to discuss are on an underlying basis, and I am going to refer to certain slides that are available on our website. 
And let me start with the top line. If you turn to Slide 9 and look at our sales. Jean-Pierre has given you the context, and I'd just like to summarize the key points. 
Volumes are down 3%, that is a fact. You are aware, Jean-Pierre has highlighted the impact of smart devices, oil and gas, and also the aerospace, this transition that we're experiencing in several large commercial transports. That's on the weighing side. On the plus side, which doesn't do enough to compensate, we're seeing growth in a number of markets. Automotive, where we've seen good demand for our products that are used in lithium ion batteries, catalysts for emission controls, agro, home and personal care, industrial, health care. So strong growth as well in many other end markets, but not enough to overcome the headwinds that Jean-Pierre alluded to.
Prices are down 3%, not a surprise. As you know well, that in a deflationary environment, we do have a pause with certain key customers, and we see that, in particular, in Polyamide, in Coatis as well in some aspects in oil and gas as well.
Now if we turn to the EBITDA, and I'll give a bit more color as well on Page 10. 
The key headlines, you're familiar with, record margins, 6% up. What has driven it? Let me start with Advanced Materials. Specialty Polymers saw double-digit growth in health care and consumer goods and in batteries for auto, but as I said before, that hasn't been enough to offset the very significant sales decline in smart devices. Remember, this was against last year's record sales. And all we need to do is to look at some of the key players in the market to see what they're saying as well, so that shouldn't be a surprise. But that has had quite a significant impact. Composites has delivered sales growth of composite materials into the new aircraft, but that growth has not been at the level to offset the declines in the legacy widebody civil aircraft.
To give you examples. Generally, to note that the aerospace supply chain tends to anticipate announcement by manufacturers well before they're publicly announced. We've seen a continued decline in the widebody civil aircraft, the Boeing 747-8, the 777, the A380, even the A330. That hasn't compensated for the growth in the single-aisle, the A320, the 737, or the growth in the LEAP engine or the ramp-up in the Joint Strike Fighter. So we are in a period of transition. One thing I'd like to highlight is we are maintaining our leading position. There has been no share loss in Solvay's positions. And that is important. And we are positioned to respond to our customers' needs as ramp-up rates pick up.
Advanced Formulations are down 12%. Very pleased that we managed to maintain our EBITDA margin stable at 18%. Oil and gas, you won't be surprised. It's pleasing to see the rig count in North America go up from a low point of about 480 in May to nearly just over 680 at the end of October, but that hasn't yet translated into marked increase in demand. What I would say, though, as against last year, that has weighed on our results and it masks high single-digits growth in agro, HPC and in other industrial end markets.
Mining, Jean-Pierre has highlighted the sales growth in phosphorus and phosphine chemistries. The underlying business is stable, it is resilient.
Turning to Performance Chemicals, what do we see? We see margin expansion to 29%, with EBITDA up 4%. Bicarbonate did perform well, and one of the factors there absolutely is the ramp-up of the new plant in Thailand. It's good to see that the investments we're making are beginning to contribute to our bottom line.
Operational excellence is another factor that has really contributed to the improvement there. As it has in Functional Polymers, that has seen a 25% EBITDA improvement and a margin expansion to 17%. Corporate costs have reduced significantly. And what does that reflect? It reflects synergies, excellence and some phasing where we've essentially deferred and delayed some of the programs to next year. To make it easy, to give you an indication, the annual future run rate based on our current portfolio is of the order of EUR 220 million a year, 2-2-0, and that represents about 15% less than the equivalent run rate in 2015. And that's where the synergies and the excellent really kicks in. 
How has that profit generation converted into cash? So if you turn to Page 14, you'll see that we have improved our cash conversion to 66% so far this year. So strong performance, and that has also translated with working capital discipline to strong cash flow that you can see highlighted on Page 15. 
So what are the key points? One, as Jean-Pierre mentioned, EUR 280 million represents the cash flow we generated this year, which is EUR 25 million higher than last year. That doesn't really tell you the full story. If you look at it on a cumulative basis, you will note 2 things: cumulative cash flow, EUR 464 million, which is EUR 318 million [ph] higher than the same period last year. That is the performance that has given us the conviction, the confidence that we can absolutely bump our minimum target from EUR 650 million to more than EUR 700 million this year.
As a result of that strong cash flow, if you turn to page -- or Slide 15, our net debt. Our net debt has fallen by EUR 0.5 billion in the quarter. Part of it comes from the strong cash flow. The other part, as you know, is the proceeds from the accelerated exit on INOVYN. So in short, strong performance, strong profit growth, very strong cash conversion, and we now see the impact and the benefits of that in our indebtedness.
Now just one other comment before I hand you back to Jean-Pierre, I would like to remind you that certain key non-financial indicators are really worth taking to account when one assesses performance and real sustainable value creation. Looking forward, we will, as appropriate, include and discuss such indicators with you when we publish future results as well.
And I turn you back to Jean-Pierre for a few remarks before we move on to the Q&A."

And specifically, how much contribution was there in the third quarter from the LEAP engine, from the new U.S. PEEK plant? And how do you see that evolving through 2017? And the second question, if I may, fixed costs reduction jumped in the third quarter to EUR 38 million according to your EBITDA bridge. How should I think about with -- is that -- how does that split across the divisions? Or is that all in the other division? And is this the synergies of the EUR 50 million of synergies targeted for 2016 from Cytec coming through, how much of that EUR 38 million is from that target synergies?"

And U.S. PEEK plant is just starting the qualification batches, so don't expect any meaningful contribution from this plant before 2017."

Regarding composite, we have a bit of a complex equation with a number of moving parts. So first, in terms of large commercial aircraft, single aisle, we are seeing the movement from the A320 to the neo version, same thing with Boeing. And we are hearing some comments from our customers that they are facing some challenges, which explain that the ramp-up is probably a little bit slower than expected, one. But it's happening. I mean, the production rate should soon be back to where -- the production rate of the newer planes should soon be back where our customers expected them to be. Larger aircraft, the transition will happen with the launch of the 777X. You'll remember that we have signed an agreement with Boeing to be a supplier, not just of secondary structure, but also part of the primary structure. The plane is supposed to fly in 2019, and production will start then. We have new programs starting up, LEAP and the F-35. It's a very multi-decade program. They are just at the beginning of their life, and we expect to see significant increase in production rate in the next few years. So taking all of that in consideration, I would say that we expect the inflection point to be somewhere during the later part of 2017, although again it's probably a little bit premature to give too precise of an indication. But in the first part of 2017, we expect to continue to see some -- the phenomena that I've just mentioned continuing to apply. On top of that...sorry, on top of that, you have to take into account also the other, the non-aerospace composite. There, we've done a bit of clean-up in the business. There were a lot of actions taken by the team to improve profitability, to bring new customers in. And this clearly will play a positive role in 2017."

The underlying tax rate is really the figure to watch for, and you see it at 28%. What we indicated a year ago was low to mid-30s. In September, at the Capital Markets Day, we indicated around 30%. This, to our mind, is very much in line with what we're expecting. When you look at reported tax rate of ours [ph] you get some distortion sometimes because of exceptional movements, portfolio impacts, et cetera. So I encourage you to focus on the underlying. And if I look at our benchmarks, our companies we're compared to, we see 22% to 29%. So to my mind, we're absolutely in the right zone, and we absolutely are responding to our responsibilities. Pensions, quite a few things. You also asked for a view on discount rates, which obviously I can't give. Let me start with the sensitivity. On Page 31 in the slide deck, you will see the sensitivity of 50 basis points on the balance sheet, which gives you current EUR 370 million. In this quarter, we've already seen a ramp-up in our balance sheet of EUR 0.2 billion because of discount rates again. So you can formulate your own expectations and do what if. What you also are correct in saying is, depending on what you assume, you can anticipate, I'd say, a modest P&L, and to an even lesser extent, cash impact. At current lower discount rates, I anticipate both to be of the order of EUR 10 million to EUR 20 million more than we've had historically. In other words, well within the tolerance of our forecast and very much part of our expectations that we integrated when we talked to you guys in the Capital Markets Day in September."

This is true with the internal combustion engine technologies. This is even more true with the development, which I would say, the quite fast development of electric or hybrid vehicles. On the first part, internal combustion engine, we are continuing to see the development in the use of advanced polymer in many chemical parts around the engine or within the engine compartment. And this gives us some tailwinds, so overall, a satisfactory position. And for us, the amount of product we can put on an electric vehicle is significantly higher, as we've presented during the Capital Market Day, than what we do on internal combustion engine. So the fact that electric vehicles are becoming a reality, and we expect this year a very significant increase and next year should continue on the same trend. This clearly opens up opportunities for us in automotive and battery. And battery for automotive is likely to be the next big growth driver for our Advanced Material and especially Specialty Polymer business. On your first question, well, I have to be modest, we are a bit new to the aerospace segment. So I think we've been surprised a little bit by both, but we are not the only one. Even guys who have been there for quite some time understand that we are facing a bit of a new situation where there's a very significant number of changes from older planes into new ones, from older engine designs into new ones. And all of this creates some uncertainties short term. I think midterm, all of this goes in the right direction, which is increasing very significantly the use of composite. But it's true that at this point of time, we see the OEMs are working very hard to make sure that they put in place the production capabilities for the new planes. And at the same time, especially for widebodies, continue to sell the existing ones. I'm thinking of a transition between 777 and 777X. So we are learning the specifics of this new segment, and again, no big changes in our midterm view, but yes, short-term, a bit more disruption than what we were probably expecting some months ago.

There are new sets of regulation coming regarding vehicle emissions in 2020 in Europe, which will call for more effective tires, more fuel-efficient tires. And this is pushing our customers to look for new formulation which could allow them to achieve that, so that's an important subject for us in the next couple of years. And we are also working very hard to improve our cost-competitive position on silica.

It's very difficult to predict exactly what's going to happen, partly because there are quite a few variables, as you know, that are completely outside of our immediate control: what competitors do, what happens to foreign exchanges, commodity prices. But here's what I can say, there are a number of levers we can influence: operational excellence, pricing, being really effective with our customers in the marketplace. And you've seen that for 11 quarters sequentially, we've been creating positive pricing power. So I can confirm that we intend to deploy every lever that we can and to be effective in the marketplace, but let's see what time brings. One thing I would highlight as well is as we really evolve towards this multispecialty portfolio, you can really see the quality of that pricing power and the EBITDA margin, the 2 go hand in hand. So over time, I think you can expect more of the same, particularly as the commodity feature of the portfolio diminishes in importance."

And for us, prices before volumes has always been the key direction that we give to our commercial teams. And I think the fact that we've been able, for the past 11 quarter, to show a positive price-versus-cost difference surely demonstrate the fact that, indeed, our teams are very focused on making sure that we sell our product at the right price. And then you have all the other levers and components that Karim has just mentioned. But from a cultural standpoint, what has happened within Solvay is really a strong focus on value and making sure that, indeed, we put price as a key objective for our commercial teams."

That is how we will deliver the double-digit growth this year. So far as corporate costs going forward and the phasing element, the best indication I can give you is EUR 10 million to EUR 20 million is probably the extent of the phasing, but there is a multitude of activities and programs. To keep it short, every key function in Solvay has its excellent program, its road map and we're looking to become more effective and lower costs.

But again, nothing which sounds like the seasonality that you would see in other more commodity-type market. But again, key driver for Q4 in terms of seasonality is the fact that a number of plants are being shut down during the last couple of weeks, and that the supply chain in a lot of industries is going to a low point at the end of December. So this is probably the most important event. On Silica, don't forget that there is a specific event which is the impact of the Venezuelan devaluation. We have, unfortunately, a plant in Venezuela, which might not be the best country to operate today. And this has an impact of EUR 5 million.

I'm here in Brussels with Karim Hajjar and Kimberly, who is joining us for the first time. Welcome, Kimberly. As usual, I will cover in a few minutes what I think are the key highlights regarding our performance and then turn to Karim and come back with a conclusion. We'll try to make it as effective as possible, to leave as much time as possible for question. 
So we think that we've been able to produce once again a solid set of results despite the fact that some of our markets are seeing some headwinds, as you all know. I think we are very much delivering as planned and in the -- very much within the framework of what we've covered during our Capital Market Day some weeks ago. 
6% EBITDA growth. A record margin of 23%, which looks reasonably strong in comparison with the other players in the chemical space. This is due to our ongoing success of our excellence program. We are, throughout the company, continuing to focus very much on identifying and putting in place action plans leading for improvement. Pricing power, it's the 11th consecutive quarter in which we've been able to achieve a positive balance between the impact of our selling prices and the impact of our raw material and energy costs. I think it's something which clearly show the strength of our market position, and the fact that our teams, even in an inflationary or deflationary environment, are indeed focusing on pricing power, and this adds a strong contribution to our margins. 
Focus also on synergies delivery, EUR 21 million in Q3. This is linked to the Cytec integration. EUR 45 million year-to-date, so very much in line with what we shared at the Capital Market Day, and one of the reason why we are confident that we will exceed, significantly, the amount of synergies that we have announced when we've announced the transaction back in July 2015.
Good cash generation, we had set the bar pretty high for 2016 as far as cash generation is concerned. EUR 280 million of free cash flow in Q3, a significant improvement versus last year. And cumulated, indeed, a very good performance, very much in line with the full year guidance. And we are looking forward, we think that we are indeed well positioned to deliver double-digit EBITDA growth in the fourth quarter, leading to a 7% to 8% EBITDA growth for the whole year.
If we look at various markets, probably little surprises, but let me just cover with you some of what we've been seeing. Some headwinds, first one, on smart device. So the market is up sequentially, significantly. This is linked to new product launches, but not at the level that we've seen last year. What we are seeing in this market is a change of behavior in our customers. We used to see a situation where people were building up very significant inventories ahead of a launch of a new product. What we are seeing today is a much more regular production rate. Overall, I think it will -- I don't expect to see significant differences, but it's true that the sequence is a bit different. We don't have this big bump in Q3, but we expect to see continuing strength in this segment for the next quarters.
Specialty Polymer was able to deliver significant growth in other markets, which means that, overall, this business was significantly up. Health care, consumer goods are doing very well. Automotive market and, once again, battery, which is turning into a very significant growth driver for our Advanced Material business.
Composite. We've seen growth in new aircraft, but not yet offsetting the decline in legacy civil aircraft. This is the challenging transition that our customer are facing from the A320, Boeing 737 to the new version, neo and MAX. We are also seeing some decline in the 777 as customers are waiting for the new planes, the 777X. So midterm, good news for us because these new planes have much more composite content than the previous version. But again, a transition which is probably a little bit more difficult than some people were expecting. And we are continuing to see the start-up and, hopefully, the beginning of a significant success story, both on the LEAP engine and the F-35, the U.S. jet fighter. But we are just at the beginning of a significant ramp-up in production schedules.
Oil and gas remains weak, although the situation is a little bit different. If you look at it sequentially or if you look at it compared to the same quarter of last year, we are significantly below Q3 2015 level, but we are seeing the market strengthening from one quarter to the next. The rig count in North America is increasing. We see more and more activities on the ground, and this gives us confidence that we have seen the worst in this market and that we should expect a slow recovery looking forward.
Other markets in our formulation business are indeed growing, although compared to the same quarter, the oil and gas impact is significant.
Mining remains resilient with a very good performance, and we've seen a modest growth overall, but at a very high level of performance in our phosphorous and phosphine business. Good demand for soda ash. Double-digit growth in bicarbonate, mostly linked to the fact that our new plant in Thailand is now operating at a high rate. And the other businesses, peroxide, Acetow, stable; Polyamide showing some improvement. Against this changing backdrop, we've delivered earning growth, and Karim will share the key highlights in a minute.
Just maybe a couple of more words to highlight the fact that we are continuing to work on profitable transformation, probably not much specific news that we can share with you at this point of time. But clearly, improving the quality of our portfolio is very high on my agenda, and it's a subject on which our teams are continuing to work very actively.
In terms of new capacity start-ups, our hydrogen peroxide capacity in China is now operational within the conditions that we were expecting. I was just in Korea last week to inaugurate a new Highly Dispersible Silica plant, very, very nice plant, probably state-of-the-art, and it will soon become a benchmark for us. But we are in the part of the process where our customers are approving our products. It will take some months to benefit from the new capacity that this plant will bring.
In Germany, we have also expanded production for the LEAP engine, this is composite. There are 2 we need to have customer approval, and it will take some months before the plant is indeed able to deliver production product for our customers.
And regarding the very large H2O2 plant in Sadara. The Sadara project is completed in terms of construction and mechanical completion. So now this is -- we are starting to see the beginning of a start-up of this very, very large complex, and we expect to see the benefit of our operation there in 2017.
Well, in a nutshell, I guess, we are really delivering according to the strategy that we've shared with you during our Capital Market Day. And I would like to turn to Karim to give you a bit more color on these results."

As usual, the numbers I'm going to discuss are on an underlying basis, and I am going to refer to certain slides that are available on our website. And let me start with the top line. If you turn to Slide 9 and look at our sale",1094,"Jean-Pierre, thank you. 
As usual, the numbers I'm going to discuss are on an underlying basis, and I am going to refer to certain slides that are available on our website. 
And let me start with the top line. If you turn to Slide 9 and look at our sales. Jean-Pierre has given you the context, and I'd just like to summarize the key points. 
Volumes are down 3%, that is a fact. You are aware, Jean-Pierre has highlighted the impact of smart devices, oil and gas, and also the aerospace, this transition that we're experiencing in several large commercial transports. That's on the weighing side. On the plus side, which doesn't do enough to compensate, we're seeing growth in a number of markets. Automotive, where we've seen good demand for our products that are used in lithium ion batteries, catalysts for emission controls, agro, home and personal care, industrial, health care. So strong growth as well in many other end markets, but not enough to overcome the headwinds that Jean-Pierre alluded to.
Prices are down 3%, not a surprise. As you know well, that in a deflationary environment, we do have a pause with certain key customers, and we see that, in particular, in Polyamide, in Coatis as well in some aspects in oil and gas as well.
Now if we turn to the EBITDA, and I'll give a bit more color as well on Page 10. 
The key headlines, you're familiar with, record margins, 6% up. What has driven it? Let me start with Advanced Materials. Specialty Polymers saw double-digit growth in health care and consumer goods and in batteries for auto, but as I said before, that hasn't been enough to offset the very significant sales decline in smart devices. Remember, this was against last year's record sales. And all we need to do is to look at some of the key players in the market to see what they're saying as well, so that shouldn't be a surprise. But that has had quite a significant impact. Composites has delivered sales growth of composite materials into the new aircraft, but that growth has not been at the level to offset the declines in the legacy widebody civil aircraft.
To give you examples. Generally, to note that the aerospace supply chain tends to anticipate announcement by manufacturers well before they're publicly announced. We've seen a continued decline in the widebody civil aircraft, the Boeing 747-8, the 777, the A380, even the A330. That hasn't compensated for the growth in the single-aisle, the A320, the 737, or the growth in the LEAP engine or the ramp-up in the Joint Strike Fighter. So we are in a period of transition. One thing I'd like to highlight is we are maintaining our leading position. There has been no share loss in Solvay's positions. And that is important. And we are positioned to respond to our customers' needs as ramp-up rates pick up.
Advanced Formulations are down 12%. Very pleased that we managed to maintain our EBITDA margin stable at 18%. Oil and gas, you won't be surprised. It's pleasing to see the rig count in North America go up from a low point of about 480 in May to nearly just over 680 at the end of October, but that hasn't yet translated into marked increase in demand. What I would say, though, as against last year, that has weighed on our results and it masks high single-digits growth in agro, HPC and in other industrial end markets.
Mining, Jean-Pierre has highlighted the sales growth in phosphorus and phosphine chemistries. The underlying business is stable, it is resilient.
Turning to Performance Chemicals, what do we see? We see margin expansion to 29%, with EBITDA up 4%. Bicarbonate did perform well, and one of the factors there absolutely is the ramp-up of the new plant in Thailand. It's good to see that the investments we're making are beginning to contribute to our bottom line.
Operational excellence is another factor that has really contributed to the improvement there. As it has in Functional Polymers, that has seen a 25% EBITDA improvement and a margin expansion to 17%. Corporate costs have reduced significantly. And what does that reflect? It reflects synergies, excellence and some phasing where we've essentially deferred and delayed some of the programs to next year. To make it easy, to give you an indication, the annual future run rate based on our current portfolio is of the order of EUR 220 million a year, 2-2-0, and that represents about 15% less than the equivalent run rate in 2015. And that's where the synergies and the excellent really kicks in. 
How has that profit generation converted into cash? So if you turn to Page 14, you'll see that we have improved our cash conversion to 66% so far this year. So strong performance, and that has also translated with working capital discipline to strong cash flow that you can see highlighted on Page 15. 
So what are the key points? One, as Jean-Pierre mentioned, EUR 280 million represents the cash flow we generated this year, which is EUR 25 million higher than last year. That doesn't really tell you the full story. If you look at it on a cumulative basis, you will note 2 things: cumulative cash flow, EUR 464 million, which is EUR 318 million [ph] higher than the same period last year. That is the performance that has given us the conviction, the confidence that we can absolutely bump our minimum target from EUR 650 million to more than EUR 700 million this year.
As a result of that strong cash flow, if you turn to page -- or Slide 15, our net debt. Our net debt has fallen by EUR 0.5 billion in the quarter. Part of it comes from the strong cash flow. The other part, as you know, is the proceeds from the accelerated exit on INOVYN. So in short, strong performance, strong profit growth, very strong cash conversion, and we now see the impact and the benefits of that in our indebtedness.
Now just one other comment before I hand you back to Jean-Pierre, I would like to remind you that certain key non-financial indicators are really worth taking to account when one assesses performance and real sustainable value creation. Looking forward, we will, as appropriate, include and discuss such indicators with you when we publish future results as well.
And I turn you back to Jean-Pierre for a few remarks before we move on to the Q&A."

So I think, overall, we've delivered good results in a challenging market environment. I think this illustrates the diversity and the quality of our portfolio. And the fact that, indeed, our teams have been focusing very much on excellence initiative and cost and synergies and delivery. We expect the momentum to continue into Q4. We estimate that we'll be able to generate double-digit EBITDA growth in Q4. We expect this is based on additional synergies coming from integration of Cytec, the continuation of our excellence program and new capacity addition that supports our volume growth.
Combined with what we've achieved in the first 9 months of the year, our expectation is to generate, overall, 7% to 8% EBITDA growth for the full year 2016, which is within the range of our prior guidance. And once again, no reason to make any further comment on the midterm objective that we've shared with you in September. Obviously, we are very confident that we'll be able to deliver on these objectives.

Regarding the LEAP engine to date, so it's still at the very beginning of its production, so I would say it's not material when I look at the cluster. And U.S. PEEK plant is just starting the qualification batches, so don't expect any meaningful contribution from this plant before 2017."

Secondly, on Performance Chemicals, just from the divisional perspective in total, what was the source of the negative pricing in the third quarter, down 4%? That sort of seemed to -- certainly surprised me. And then finally, in Functional Polymers, I guess a 2-part question, are the electricity outages at Vinythai, were they a one-off effect or are they an ongoing issue? And the step-up in margin that we saw in Functional Polymers, is that partly a mix effect relating to Vinythai or is it something -- is it just the balance of pricing and input costs in Polyamide?"

Regarding composite, we have a bit of a complex equation with a number of moving parts. So first, in terms of large commercial aircraft, single aisle, we are seeing the movement from the A320 to the neo version, same thing with Boeing. And we are hearing some comments from our customers that they are facing some challenges, which explain that the ramp-up is probably a little bit slower than expected, one. But it's happening. I mean, the production rate should soon be back to where -- the production rate of the newer planes should soon be back where our customers expected them to be. Larger aircraft, the transition will happen with the launch of the 777X. You'll remember that we have signed an agreement with Boeing to be a supplier, not just of secondary structure, but also part of the primary structure. The plane is supposed to fly in 2019, and production will start then. We have new programs starting up, LEAP and the F-35. It's a very multi-decade program. They are just at the beginning of their life, and we expect to see significant increase in production rate in the next few years. So taking all of that in consideration, I would say that we expect the inflection point to be somewhere during the later part of 2017, although again it's probably a little bit premature to give too precise of an indication. But in the first part of 2017, we expect to continue to see some -- the phenomena that I've just mentioned continuing to apply. On top of that...sorry, on top of that, you have to take into account also the other, the non-aerospace composite. There, we've done a bit of clean-up in the business. There were a lot of actions taken by the team to improve profitability, to bring new customers in. And this clearly will play a positive role in 2017."

The underlying tax rate is really the figure to watch for, and you see it at 28%. What we indicated a year ago was low to mid-30s. In September, at the Capital Markets Day, we indicated around 30%. This, to our mind, is very much in line with what we're expecting. When you look at reported tax rate of ours [ph] you get some distortion sometimes because of exceptional movements, portfolio impacts, et cetera. So I encourage you to focus on the underlying. And if I look at our benchmarks, our companies we're compared to, we see 22% to 29%. So to my mind, we're absolutely in the right zone, and we absolutely are responding to our responsibilities. Pensions, quite a few things. You also asked for a view on discount rates, which obviously I can't give. Let me start with the sensitivity. On Page 31 in the slide deck, you will see the sensitivity of 50 basis points on the balance sheet, which gives you current EUR 370 million. In this quarter, we've already seen a ramp-up in our balance sheet of EUR 0.2 billion because of discount rates again. So you can formulate your own expectations and do what if. What you also are correct in saying is, depending on what you assume, you can anticipate, I'd say, a modest P&L, and to an even lesser extent, cash impact. At current lower discount rates, I anticipate both to be of the order of EUR 10 million to EUR 20 million more than we've had historically. In other words, well within the tolerance of our forecast and very much part of our expectations that we integrated when we talked to you guys in the Capital Markets Day in September."

And just thinking about it from a modeling perspective, the negative 14 number that you posted in Q3, is that the sort of run rate we should expect until you hit the easier comps in the back half of next year, and we get back to growth? That's the first question. Second question would be around Acetow, a simple one. Are the margins in Acetow still above the average for Performance Chems? And then final question, are you seeing any slowdown in activity in the automotive-related sectors at this stage? Or is it a market that still is going strong? It's just we've seen 1 or 2 more, I guess -- well, concerning developments in automotive in terms of production schedules and so on recently, and I'm just wondering if anyone has seen that in their business yet."

This is true with the internal combustion engine technologies. This is even more true with the development, which I would say, the quite fast development of electric or hybrid vehicles. On the first part, internal combustion engine, we are continuing to see the development in the use of advanced polymer in many chemical parts around the engine or within the engine compartment. And this gives us some tailwinds, so overall, a satisfactory position. And for us, the amount of product we can put on an electric vehicle is significantly higher, as we've presented during the Capital Market Day, than what we do on internal combustion engine. So the fact that electric vehicles are becoming a reality, and we expect this year a very significant increase and next year should continue on the same trend. This clearly opens up opportunities for us in automotive and battery. And battery for automotive is likely to be the next big growth driver for our Advanced Material and especially Specialty Polymer business. On your first question, well, I have to be modest, we are a bit new to the aerospace segment. So I think we've been surprised a little bit by both, but we are not the only one. Even guys who have been there for quite some time understand that we are facing a bit of a new situation where there's a very significant number of changes from older planes into new ones, from older engine designs into new ones. And all of this creates some uncertainties short term. I think midterm, all of this goes in the right direction, which is increasing very significantly the use of composite. But it's true that at this point of time, we see the OEMs are working very hard to make sure that they put in place the production capabilities for the new planes. And at the same time, especially for widebodies, continue to sell the existing ones. I'm thinking of a transition between 777 and 777X. So we are learning the specifics of this new segment, and again, no big changes in our midterm view, but yes, short-term, a bit more disruption than what we were probably expecting some months ago. Acetow, Karim?"

On silica pressure on prices, yes, but it's a business where we have long-term contract, so the pressure comes when we renegotiate contract. But then, it's a discussion on the prices, volumes, supply chain set-up, which could be a good way to create values between us and our customers. So overall, I think it's a business where we have the ability to defend our margins medium term. For that, we need to continue to innovate. There are new sets of regulation coming regarding vehicle emissions in 2020 in Europe, which will call for more effective tires, more fuel-efficient tires. And this is pushing our customers to look for new formulation which could allow them to achieve that, so that's an important subject for us in the next couple of years. And we are also working very hard to improve our cost-competitive position on silica. I was mentioning that the new Korean silica unit is probably about to set a new benchmark in terms of costs because we've put the best technologies we have on this new plant. And this will be a great opportunity to make progress on the other plants. So overall, confident in our ability to continue to defend our margin in this business and to grow, but a lot of work to do to make sure that we can do so. Yes, Karim, on pricing power."

It's very difficult to predict exactly what's going to happen, partly because there are quite a few variables, as you know, that are completely outside of our immediate control: what competitors do, what happens to foreign exchanges, commodity prices. But here's what I can say, there are a number of levers we can influence: operational excellence, pricing, being really effective with our customers in the marketplace. And you've seen that for 11 quarters sequentially, we've been creating positive pricing power. So I can confirm that we intend to deploy every lever that we can and to be effective in the marketplace, but let's see what time brings. One thing I would highlight as well is as we really evolve towards this multispecialty portfolio, you can really see the quality of that pricing power and the EBITDA margin, the 2 go hand in hand. So over time, I think you can expect more of the same, particularly as the commodity feature of the portfolio diminishes in importance."

We've -- I've just said in my introduction, that we're expecting double-digit growth, which means that, indeed, compared to last year, we see a profile which is a bit different, allowing us to achieve a 7% to 8% EBITDA growth for the full year. But this dynamic, I would say, is pretty good on smart devices, pretty good in auto. And again, I would have -- from the top of my mind, I would have difficulties to name a business where we would see a negative trend from Q3 to Q4, but again, Q4 tends to be 2 weeks shorter than the other quarters."

And thank you very much for having participated in this call. I think, overall, we have demonstrated that the quality of our portfolio and the diversity that we have and the exposure to diverse segments allow us to deliver despite the fact that we are feeling some headwinds in some markets. Some of these headwinds are probably likely to reduce in the next months. Smart devices, oil and gas are probably going back to a more normal situation, which is good. But be assured that we'll continue to focus very much on all the self-help action plans that we've been putting in place in past years. And this covers both excellence initiatives, which continue to be a very strong driver of improved performance for the company. But also the integration of Cytec, once again, a very significant synergy delivery up until Q3 and for the full year, very much in line with our increased objective of EUR 150 million of total synergies by 2018. Cash, indeed, is an important objective for the full year. We have delivered already for the first 9 months a sizable amount of free cash flow, and we have slightly upgraded our full year guidance to at least EUR 700 million of free cash flow.
So with that, I would once again like to thank you, and we'll talk again on February..."
