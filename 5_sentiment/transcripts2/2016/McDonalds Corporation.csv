We begin 2016 in a much better place than we were 12 months ago. Today, we're more aligned in the system, franchising cash flows and our major markets are improving, and we have a strong commitment to executing our turnaround plan. 
Our midterm priorities are clear. Our turnaround plan is the first step to fortifying the fundamentals of our business and restarting growth. This is grounded in running great restaurants, driving option growth, creating brand excitement and enhancing financial value. These actions ultimately position us to strengthen and grow as a more competitive and more modern business. We'll build on this foundation as we position McDonald's for long-term growth that will drive shareholder value in 2016 and beyond. 
Different markets are in different stages of turnaround. The U.S., our largest market, is currently in a trajectory change pace. While we are pleased with the recent positive momentum in the U.S., it will take at least 6 more months of positive comparable sales and guest count growth to progress through the sustained and prolonged growth basis of our turnaround. 
I'm confident in the actions we are taking and the traction is beginning to take hold. Most importantly, customers are noticing a difference. Our customer feedback systems are showing improvements in many important aspects of the customer visit, including food quality, order accuracy, speed and friendliness. In many ways, 2015 was a year of 2 halves. The first half of the year, our performance fell short of expectations. As I stepped into my role, my priority was to objectively assess our business, diagnose our opportunities and develop a leaner organizational structure. The second half of the year was about execution. The newer branding structure that went into effect on July 1 sharpened our focus, drove great accountability and removed distractions and bureaucracy to speed up decisions and increased our ability to move winning tactics quickly across markets. 
As markets adjusted on how we think and operate, we began to get traction, ending the year on an upwards trajectory. Comparable sales were up 5% for the full quarter or 1.5% for the full year. Operating income is up 16% for the quarter, and earnings per share increased 26%, both in constant currencies. Various current and prior items outside our normal operations impacted earnings comparisons. Kevin will share more details. 
Excluding these items, earnings per share would have been up 10% for the quarter in constant currencies. Now let's turn to segment performance. The U.S. remains fundamental to our turnaround given a significant contribution to consolidated results. U.S. comparable sales increased 5.7% of the fourth quarter, marking the best quarter in nearly 4 years. For the full year, comparable sales grew 50 basis points, an encouraging change in trends after 2 years of declines. 
While we've seen recent improvements in comparable guest counts, they remain negative for the full year. We need to do even more to increasing the frequency of visits of our more loyal customers and win back customers we've lost. Strong partnership with franchisees as we execute our business building initiatives has resulted in growth in restaurant level cash flows for both the quarter and the year. This is just one more indication of the progress we are making. 
Our formula for success in the U.S. is consistent with many other markets, our focus on operational excellence, coupled with relevant menu news, all supported by strong alignment with franchisees. The foundational steps we took to enhance many of quality, simplify restaurant operations and offer even more convenience to customers led to a bar full shift in momentum in the third quarter. All Day Breakfast sales on this momentum in the fourth quarter exceeding internal expectations during the launch base. It's driving incremental business. 
Many customers who otherwise would have gone elsewhere are coming to McDonald's to enjoy some of their favorite breakfast items, like our Egg McMuffin and hashbrowns at lunch and throughout the rest of the day. At the same time, existing customers are adding breakfast entr√©es to their regular orders, boosting sales at average check. In addition to benefits in top and bottom-line growth, All Day Breakfast positions us to regain market share we're given up in recent years. In fact, since the launch of All Day Breakfast, we've experienced positive weekly comparable sales gaps relative to our QSR some competitors. And ended the quarter with a positive GAAP of 2.9%. 
Another priority in the U.S. is establishment of a consistent national value offering. We began testing Pick 2 earlier this month. This value offer gives customers the flick's ability to bundle their choice of 2 items at a compelling price point. While still early, the offer appears to be resonating with customers. We'll continue to listen and apply what we're learning as we roll toward a more permanent national platform later this year to complement the ongoing regional efforts. 
I'd also be remissed if I didn't mention that the U.S. and several other large markets also benefited from mild weather in the quarter. Let's now turn to the international lead segment, which continues to operate from a position of strength. 
Fourth quarter comparable sales increased 4.2% and comparable sales were up 3.4% for the year. Strong fourth quarter comparable sales mark the U.K.'s 39th consecutive quarter of growth as the market outperformed by the competition and the wider retail sector. Performance was driven by a number of customer-oriented offers. Successful promotions featuring premium products, like the new Big Flavour Wraps and the Chicken Legend, drove growth in average check. A strong focus on our core menu items continue to elevate customer perceptions around quality. And steady progress towards our Experience of the Future continues. About 1/4 of the U.K.'s restaurants are being converted and plans are in place to do more throughout 2016. These restaurants offer more than in-store service platforms,  such as kiosks, digital merchandising and customized order pickup place. We recently tested table service. And based on customers favorable reaction, we plan to roll it out across nearly all converted restaurants in 2016. 
Australia also delivered a strong quarter of comparable sales despite lapping its best quarter in 2014. The market wide deployment of Experience of the Future is driving incremental visits. And customers are enjoying conveniences such as Table service and take advantage of the opportunity to customize it here and traced to satisfy individual taste. Australia continues to fuel future growth by capitalizing on wins in other markets. Most recently, it's taken a chapter out of the U.S. playbook, testing All Day Breakfast in 300 restaurants and plan to go national later this quarter. 
Australia's ability to quickly scale the successful initiative from the U.S. highlights one of the many ways our new segment operating structure is creating a more nimble look on us. In Canada, balanced growth across all day parts drove another quarter of strong comparable sales. Engaging marketing complain including monopoly, festive food events in the successful free coffee promotion resonated strongly with customers. At the same time, the market continues to make progress towards its version of Experience of The Future. More than 175 restaurants will be converted with a significant number of additional conversions planned in 2016. 
In Germany and France, full quarter comparable sales were relatively flat. Germany's successful Monopoly promotion featuring premium products, along with a focus on add-on items, help drive average check in a highly competitive environment. Value remains a critical priority in Germany. 
In the coming weeks, we'll launch an integrated value strategy across our menu to strengthen our appeal to value conscious consumers. In France, the macro environment remains challenging. We formally reaching market recorded its fifth consecutive year of decline. On top of the lagging economy and dampened consumer purchasing power, the November terrorist attack negatively impacted the entire eating out industry. We have seen this in Paris and in other cities throughout Europe. 
Despite these headwinds, our brand remains strong in France. Successful Monopoly promotion, along with the introduction of new premium products are increasing average check. At the same time, we're giving customers more options across lower tiers of our menu. The new items added to our petiire line and the extension of into other proteins, including fish. 
We are working to become even more accessible to customers as we continue to open new restaurants, including 5 new airport sites that are part of a deal we recently closed with airport Paris. Turning to the high-growth segment, fourth quarter comparable sales increased 3% and the comparable sales were up 1.8% for the year. China's fourth quarter comparable sales increased 4%. Successful execution of key initiatives around value, convenience and breakfast are driving market share increases in a flat by year environment. 
Despite recent external challenges, we remain confident in the potential of this important market and in the strategies we have in place to expand the brand even further. In fact, we plan to open more than 250 restaurants in China in 2016, the highest of any of our markets. 
In Russia, strong comparable sales in the fourth quarter reflected ongoing recovery of brand trust. Our results may be volatile going forward, giving continuing macroeconomic uncertainties and decreased consumer purchasing power. One additional market I'd like to highlight is Japan, where comparable sales increased 1.6% in the fourth quarter. Results were partly driven by comparisons to last year's supplier issue. Even so, this marketed Japan's best performance in nearly 4 years. Same diligently executings revitalization plan as we work to strengthen the brand's appeal to the customers. 
Our consolidated performance reflects the meaningful progress we've made to return critical markets to sustainable revenue and income growth. Although some of our larger markets face challenging headwinds as enter 2016, we expect continued positive top line momentum across all segments. We are focused on what we can control and committed to elevating every aspect for the customer experience. This is about running great restaurants, and our entire system is rallying around this essential imperative everyday. The steps we've taken have driven notable improvements in many larger markets, but there's more work to be done. 
2016 will be about continuing to execute our turnaround plans. We'll concentrate on fortifying the fundamentals of our business so we deliver what people want and expect from McDonald's today while establishing the foundation for future growth. 
Thanks, everyone. And now, I'll turn it over to Kevin."

As Steve mentioned, the strategic actions we took in 2015 were critical to restoring momentum in our business, ensuring our path forward. Fourth quarter played a key role in both areas.

As Steve mentioned, the strategic actions we took in 2015 were critical to restoring momentum in our business, ensuring our path forward. Fourth quarter played a key role in both areas. Today, I'd like to discuss the drivers of our fourth quarter results, review our outlook for 2016 and provide an update on progress we've made on financial decisions announced in November. Let's start with a look at fourth quarter results. 
As Steve indicated, we delivered solid comparable sales and operating income growth for the quarter. The increase in fourth quarter operating income reflects the benefit up positive comparable sales across all segments, a testament to the early impact of our turnaround efforts. Fourth quarter results also reflected various current and prior year items outside of our normal operations. 
Relative to the prior year, these items included comparison against results which were negatively impacted by the China supplier issue and an increase in our tax reserves. In the current year, these items included a gain of $135 million from the sale of a U.S. restaurant property and asset impairment charges of about $70 million, in conjunction with our global refranchising efforts. 
Excluding the impact of these current and prior-year items, fourth quarter earnings per share would have increased $0.13 or 10% in constant currency. Top line performance continues to have the biggest impact on our margins and it's one of the best indicators of the strength of our underlying business. With more than 80% of our global restaurants franchised, the largest driver of operating income continues to be our franchise margins, which totaled $1.9 billion, a 9% increase in constant currencies for the quarter. The franchise margin percent increased 50 basis points to 82%, driven primarily by the solid comparable sales in the U.S. and International Lead Market. 
Global company operated margin dollars increased to 8% in constant currencies to $612 million for the quarter, while the company operated margin percent increased 80 basis points to 15.2%. Comparison against challenging prior year results in the high-growth and foundational segments accounted for the majority of the margin improvement for the quarter. Partly offsetting these margin gains were high gear incremental labor cost in the U.S., reflecting the ongoing impact from our decision earlier in the year to increase crew wages and benefits. 
These costs, along with minimum wage increases mandated by several states during the year, negatively impacted fourth quarter U.S. margins by about 350 basis points, consistent with our expectations. Solid comparable sales growth and favorable commodity costs helped minimize the impact of this labor pressure. For the quarter, U.S. commodity costs decreased about 1%, primarily due to lower beef costs. Looking ahead, U.S. company operated margins for the first half of 2016 will continue to be impacted by labor pressures of a similar magnitude in both first and second quarters. 
To offset some of this inflationary pressure, our U.S. fourth quarter pricing year-over-year was up over 2%, placing our 4-year pricing below food-away-from-home inflation of around 2.5%. 2016 food-away-from-home inflation is projected to be between 2.5% and 3.5%. Commodity costs for the international lead segment were up about 1% in the quarter. While price increases vary by market, year-over-year increases for these markets average 1% to 3%. 
Looking ahead to full year 2016, commodity costs for the international lead segment are expected to be relatively flat while U.S. commodities are expected to decline 1% to 2%. G&A for the fourth quarter totaled $675 million, up 7% in constant currencies, due to higher incentive based compensation versus the prior year. Excluding incentive based compensation, G&A for the quarter decreased as expected. 
For the full year 2016, G&A is expected to decrease about 1% to 2% in constant currencies. We expect G&A increases in the second and third quarters due to our worldwide convention in April and the summer Olympics in August. Foreign currencies negatively impacted fourth quarter EPS by $0.11 and the full year by $0.50. At current exchange rates, there will be less pressure in 2016 with an expected negative impact and first quarter of $0.04 to $0.06 and full year of $0.18 to $0.20. As always, please take this as directional guidance only because rates will change as we move throughout the year. 
Now I'd like to provide an update on the progress we've made in 2015 and our financial decisions announced in November around G&A, refranchising and our capital structure. Starting with our G&A expense. In November, we disclosed our net annual G&As savings target of $500 million from our G&A base of $2.6 billion at the beginning of 2015. This target excludes the impact of foreign currency changes. We expect to realize $150 million in savings by the end of 2016 with about half of these savings already achieved in 2015. We anticipate completing the vast majority of the remaining $350 million in savings by the end of 2017. 
Evolving our ownership strategy is also a fundamental component of our turnaround efforts and the catalyst for our decision to re-franchise about 4,000 restaurants by the end of 2018. While our refranchising target implies approximately 1,000 restaurants per year, we expect variability around this average with any given year as we work to balance the necessary time needed to select the best franchisees with our desire to execute our refranchising plan in an expedient manner. 
During 2015, we refranchised about 470 restaurants, and we're currently making progress toward completing the sale of 2 international markets to develop our licensees that will include the refranchising of over 400 restaurants. As part of our evaluation of ownership strategies around the world, we have been reviewing our ownership levels in all markets. In conjunction with these efforts, we are exploring the sale of a portion of our ownership at McDonald's Japan. If you identify a strategic investor who could help advance Japan's turnaround efforts and unlock our growth potential with a view of enhancing value for all stakeholders. We're in the early stages of the process and taking a thoughtful approach. We have an experienced and talented management team and a strong group of franchisees, all of whom are committed to enhancing our brand and supporting our turnaround in Japan with the Japanese consumer in mind. 
Right now, we are focused on exploring the viability of finding the appropriate strategic investor. We are confident that whatever may transpire with our ownership, McDonald's Corporation and McDonald's Japan will continue to have a franchisor-franchisee relationship intended to promote McDonald's brand and business in Japan. 
We remain confident that our McDonald's Japan business for the long term and their commitment to revitalizing the brand in Japan. In connection with executing against our refranchising and G&A targets, during 2016, we may incur incremental strategic charges associated with asset disposition and restructuring. 
In November, we also committed to optimizing our capital structure. One month later, we added $6 billion of debt to our balance sheet with an average tenure of over 15 years and an average coupon of 3.8%. We will likely have further debt additions during 2016 as we expect to return a total of about $30 billion to shareholders for the 3-year period ending 2016. For the 2 years ended 2015, we returned $15.8 billion dollars to shareholders, leaving about $14 billion in combined dividends and share repurchases to be completed in 2016. And collectively, our refranchising efforts, G&A management and capital structure optimization will contribute to our goal of enhancing long-term financial value for our system and our shareholders. 
In addition to moving forward on these financial decisions, we are maintaining a balanced and measured approach of investing in our business to drive future growth. For 2016, we expect capital expenditures of approximately $2 billion, split fairly evenly between opening about 1,000 new restaurants and reinvesting in existing restaurants. The majority of our new store capital is earmarked for the international lead and high-growth markets, while roughly half of our reinvestment capital will be devoted to U.S. restaurants. 
As we begin the new year, we're encouraged by our wisher results. However, our financial performance in the coming year is not likely to be linear. As you move through 2016, we expect some variability in our quarterly results due to uneven prior year comparisons and some headwinds that exist, including macroeconomic issues in some of our high-growth markets and challenging guest counts in the U.S., Germany and France. 
Generating sustained positive guest traffic in these markets and around the world remains a top priority for 2016. We also anticipate limited pricing power in several of our markets as a relatively benign commodity outlook and low inflation could impact our ability to increase menu board prices. 
In closing, we begin 2016 in a stronger position, positive top and bottom line momentum across all segments and greater alignment with franchisees around our near-term fast forward. We are committed to executing our turnaround plan, which starts with the diligent execution of operating great restaurants on a daily basis. At the same time, we remain confident in our ability to execute against our financial decisions and evolve to a leaner, more heavily franchised business that generates long-term value for our shareholders. 
Thanks. Now I'll turn it over to Chris to begin our Q&A."

We entered the quarter with good momentum in our business. Clearly, that was accelerated through the fourth quarter. And as we've said, all-day breakfast was a primary driver of that, but not the sole driver. So it exceeded our launch expectations. The period of which exceeded our launch expectations was also a little longer than we expected, but we would expect it to sell done. But that's why we're working on a number of initiatives in the business to follow that up. This is not a -- we don't want this to be a single initiative turnaround plan so the continued investment in food quality, the development of this value platform. And as we continue to reinvest in the fabric of our restaurants, we're confident the in-store experience will continue to improve. The operation improvements we're seeing is going to drive around old bureaucracy in particular. We see it's paying dividends. Early days after launching a number of initiatives around people, we begin to see our star turnover decrease quite notably as well, which we believe helps us deliver a better data experience. So there's a number of dimensions to it. All Day Breakfast is understandably a more of the headline grabber. It will settle down a little from its launch phase. But we believe that building these other platforms of growth on top of that will keep us competitive in the market place and making share."

What we're actually delivering now is really just the start. So we really, really launched the app here in the U.S. at the end of the third quarter last year. But within 3 months, we had over 7 million downloads, which I think just starts to signal the magnitude that we can go to as we develop office and functionality way beyond the basic. At the moment, it's largely offer based and we are seeing of those downloads being activated by customers and redeeming the offers in the restaurants. So we believe it's driving behavior. We hope to follow consumers behavior easy so we can read kind of the face. But certainly, as we build the capability of the app, we think it's going to get is increasing compelling and the growth engine. I would say that first time here at McDonald's, we have built in a trading increase, a sale an incremental sales expectation based on our digital platform. It's a little modest in 2016, but we see it actually contributed to the business growth and being a platform that will deliver for many years to come as with and understand our consumer behavior and be more rewarding to them. With regards to the second prieve, Experience of The Future, we have around 5 markets up and running, as you say, we're at about 130 restaurants. We're certainly looking to expand, not necessarily those markets, but into new markets at our largest scale. And the U.S. will again pick some lead regions. This is where the regional strength of the U.S. really comes to the full. We got 23 regions here in the U.S. We'll be picking 2 or 3 of those to really look to accelerate their version here in the U.S. Experience of The Future through '16 and into '17, but they will be adapting slightly different approach from those 3 regions so we actually learn the markets here were truly resonates with customers, with the business results are and the future potential. So -- and also, given on the structure now, we're learning so rapidly from the way that the Australians have built their business kind of building theirs, U.K., France in particular theirs, that we are rich in inside, which is helping each other make smart decisions and shorter timelines. We'll certainly share more. At the moment the majority of the growth revolving to the U.S. performance through '16 is through continuing to deliver against the basics of our turnaround plan."

I don't want to give specifics on the respective drivers but the piece that I want to make sure we don't use is we were building the momentum heading into the quarter and heading into the launch of All Day Breakfast. And I won't necessarily do a full launch list of the work the team had done. But certainly around the fundamentals of delivering a better, high quality food experience day in and day out. And you heard me talk about the Devils in the detail always around sourcing of the funds in seeing of the beef. And when you align that with investing in the types of quality investments that customers care about, such as when was the antibiotic move we made in the poultry supply chain or the announcements that we, in our journey to cage-free eggs. That's just crazy part. Customers knows that you care about the same things that they care about, and they just respond with their business. All Day Breakfast was clearly the primary driver of the quarter. We knew it would be. We focus the restaurants both operationally, marketing and merchandising on that. As I'd say, through the launch phase, it helped contribute materially to the quarter, absolutely no doubt. We hit peaks. We exceeded the sales contribution that we had projected. And as I say, it lasted longer through the quarter than a typical launch period does. But inevitably, it settled down as we introduce other initiatives in the restaurants through '16. The weather was notable, but not material, I just noted it was appropriate and transparent to reference it because it didn't give us a positive contribution, not just in the U.S. but in many of our major markets around the world. That did provide a helpful tailwinds that I thought would be fair to recognize interest would acknowledge. In terms of the drive-through in particular, certainly, the streamlined menu boards have made life easier for our customers and made life easier for our managers the restaurants. So that experience has simplified and helped speed things up. Alongside the greatest barrier to the overall service experience in the drive-through, we have identified these with Barak receipt, so the teams, the operational teams, we'll be working really hard on initiative, again, I won't go into detail. We couldn't ask our talent. It's just the way that we, the ordering experience with customer, where we just confirmed twice over capture the order right and that we're presenting exactly the right order to the customers before they drive off. And we're finding that has noticeably improved our which in turn improves speed and clearly, customer satisfaction. So we got plenty more to do. We're working through and continued to challenge the menu and if there's further signification areas to them but some litigation goes way beyond that. It they've been through packaging for most implementing where we can help the restaurant teams by working load off of them so that they could focus on the fundamentals of what they want, just serving customers."

So in terms of customer satisfaction, obviously, we got a number of different ways that we can monitor customer satisfaction. And we have 1 or 2 different systems around the world. It's not a consistent measure as we speak. But we move and transition to a new customer satisfaction measure here, which  we  call the voice of its actually by gathering multiple number of customer feedbacks compared to where we were previously. So I didn't explain that very well. We are having a lot more opportunity than we have ever done is what I'm saying is. Certainly, we're seeing although satisfaction improving both in drive-thru and in-store. And we're certainly seeing order accuracy in drive-thru. We're around -- national satisfaction on speed are improving. Our speed times having trip as much as satisfaction has done so we want to work operationally to physically speed up sort of these experience. At the same time, customers are reporting a greater satisfaction with the speed, which is very encouraging. So it's a good expense working to them. In terms on the premiums, yes, absolutely. As you gather momentum and you start to get these growth drivers that they are up on each other commitment you can raise her head and look a little further out in the way that you plan and develop the business. So on the premium side, and by the way, each market doesn't have to work wing in isolation. So we have a number of initiatives around the world, whether it's great in Australia, a new premium range of signature in burgers the U.K., a similar version of that within France, for example. And we have this sophisticated, well executed rollout across of those market, all of which are hell-bent to inform us of where we head with the Experience of The Future. What we do know is customization is important. We don't know quite how much customization customers truly wish. They like a little bit visibility, but don't overcome the dated. So we're working on that, for example. We're working on the matter in which customers can order our premium burger so if from the traditional just through the drive-through or at the front counter, and that's where soft chaos. And potentially service comes into play. But again, we're getting a really good read on progress in some of the other mature, lead market, and that's certainly have been shaped our inform the thinking here in the U.S. So more to come, I'll be using the time to work and developing that platform.

So at the moment, the initial momentum we're seeing typically around the world is coming from QSR. Some of that is recovery share we've lost as well. So that's certainly hardening for us. I would say potentially, one slight difference from that is around All Day Breakfast, which where we're capturing customers, we really wanted to a different occasion now show. And so that is new to us at Mcdonalds. I think the customers read the incremental business and incremental business are getting are probably broader IEO segment.

And that is we look at a whole bunch of factors to influence our pricing. That includes food inflation, GDP growth, our internal cost inflation, et cetera. Similar to how the U.S. would do it. So for 2015, we said that the U.S. increased their prices a little over 2% compared to food-away-from-home inflation of around 2.5% and that for 2016, food-away-from-home inflation is expected to be 2.5% to 3.5%. So we would continue to think about pricing in a similar way as we've been and keep an eye on that food-away-from-home inflation, as well as food at home inflation, just to make sure that we're not getting out of whack with that. Related to the G&A, the way we look at it is received, I'd say, a little more than half of that $150 million dollars in 2015, which means that we go into 2016 with our base or run rate of those savings built in. We'll look at 2016 similarly. So while we may not get all of those actual savings realigned in 2016, we'll have it out of our base by the end of 2016 so that as we go into 2017, we're going in with a base that's $150 million less than where we started the $2.6 billion.

One is, clearly, the downloads, then you want the registration numbers, then you want to see the activity. So we have 7 million downloads, which gives the access like lasting impression locator, nutritional information and the rest. As they saw the share, their information, they get confident with us. Clearly, they will such a register and we can then communicate, they notify us and their local restaurant or their preferred restaurant, then we can start to localize the offers to them and then we started to see the behavior. We are seeing higher registration rates of an industry norm from those downloads and we also then tracking effectively frequency of usage. We're trying to encourage that with things like loyalty play, such as by with McCaffrey's have any size and you get 1 free. So it's a fairly basic layout to play just to get you all familiar with using it and acting using it and keeping on their phones, basically. The reason we have built a sales built into '16 is because we have seen the incremental business. We've seen the incremental average check of redemptions. So when people redeem an offer, we're actually seeing higher average check than we had expected to see. So we can see it as an incremental business driver. Plus, we got other initiatives that will both scale the number of customers and usage, but also enhance the overall experience well, which will encourage people to return to the app more often and clearly returning to McDonald's more often. We have really -- we have it week by week, month by month is how we of that ourselves on whether we're hitting those projections.

Getting the value platform right will be important to us. That's why we're taking a very serious look at it and learning from it before we then going to a national and permanent launch base, but we feel good about at the moment. You expect to see is also focus more on our core menu. We are very proud of the menu. And we believe there is -- these are iconic and real popular assets that we believe that we can probably do a better job with and bring to life and we'll continue to invest in the ingredients and the food quality and pricing around that. And expect to see that to create fun around the brand, you will also expect us to return to 1 or 2 promotional mechanics we have. We've got opportunities throughout the year to just bring in some variety and fun around promotional activity, shorter-term promotional activity just to help provide that balance across the many. So I think and then with the digital platform laboring on top of that, we believe we're building these, building a platform that will continue to grow through '16, but would also take us into '17 and beyond. As we've developed and better articulate here in the U.S. our Experience The Future, that is something we know the systemic sets about, we know it's creating a lot of momentum elsewhere around the world, and getting that right and the business model right and actually getting the right elements of that for the customer here in the U.S. is going to be important for us. So excited about what we're going to learn in '16 because we believe that's going to contribute to '17 and beyond. And so the long-term strategy, I guess, what we would to see is we've had 2 quarters of growth in this turnaround. So we would certainly be looking to sustain another quarter or 2 before we ourselves start to moving the turnaround plan into a longer-term growth plan. What I can tell you said we have a small and senior team looking at developing with that growth plan looks like, the elements of it, the brand positioning of it than the vision behind it. But it's a small team that's working discreetly on it. Because at the moment, the entire credit organization globally is focused on turnaround. Whether they are made in the second quarter or sometime in the third quarter, I would say by around the middle of the year, when we get confident that it's the right time to transition from turnaround into growth, we'll share that internally and soon operate externally."

And so we look at food inflation in total because we need to make sure that kind of home is the competitor and people can be leaving us, if you will, a fuel they were cheap home. We have to look at cost both food and the bar to determine pricing. And they also comes into play what of our competitors are doing, the demographics of where we are. So there's a lot of things that can go into determining pricing. I don't know if I picked one or another by a labor of food be, high cost, if you will. Just one point I would add to that Jeff, as well as while Stewart clearly build an assumption into our plans because that's how we set our plans, we don't make a single pricing decision. Remake decisions across the year. So you can always gauge the consumer, our consumer confidence, where our cost are going and where the competitive environment is and do our best, clearly, to make the right decisions. So we have multiple opportunities across the year to reassess and make sure that we are surging seizing the opportunity without getting too far."

And we're really's focusing on what we can control. And we have noticed and we have a history of being successful in many, many countries around the world through strong economic times, as well as challenging economic times, as long as we do the right thing by the customers. So overall, we are confident heading into this year. We made plans in detail in our largest 9 or 10 markets, and I'm confident in we will deliver the growth to a level that we are satisfied and we're challenging ourselves hard on it. But I also want to be that. In France, in a moment, for example, each time decreased 5 years in a row. So if you are going to grow the business, you really have to take it significant amount of share in a declining market for that to translate a top line growth. And to do that, you have out of your longer-term strategy building ever done. I think reality a strike force this to be a little cautious about but if I take that at the collective across the us, across the lake markets, kind of high-growth markets. We are building plans, and certainly, on a consolidated basis with expectations of growing. So I should one of from the markets even start of this year, volatility just creates a scrap year environment and a little bit of nervous, whetter it's. And some time in Citi and across customer so we need to be mindful, sensitive to that. China is a good example we're the can of volatility in the marketplace just great a little bit of exciting that's why we want to enforce our in that market running our core business as well as in common for units as you saw growth. And so we're mindful, we stay close, but we remain quietly confident."

I don't want to give specifics on the respective drivers but the piece that I want to make sure we don't lose is that we were building momentum heading into the quarter and heading into the launch of All Day Breakfast. And I won't necessarily do a full laundry list of the work the team had done. But certainly around the fundamentals of delivering a better, high quality food experience day in, day out. And you heard me talk about the devil's in the detail always around toasting of the buns and searing of the beef. And when you align that with investing in the types of quality investments that customers care about, such as when was the antibiotics move we made in the poultry supply chain or the announcement that we on our journey of going to cage-free eggs and that's just creates a buzz [ph]. And customers know that you care about the same things that they care about, then they just respond with their business. All Day Breakfast was clearly the primary driver of the quarter. We knew it would be. We focused the restaurants both operationally, marketing and merchandising on that. As I say, through the launch phase, it helped contribute materially to the quarter, absolutely no doubt. We hit peaks. We exceeded the sales contribution that we had projected. And as I say, it lasted longer through the quarter than a typical launch period does. But inevitably, it'll settle down as we introduce other initiatives in the restaurants through '16. The weather was notable but not material, but I just thought it was appropriate and transparent to reference it because it did give us a positive contribution, not just in the U.S. but in many of our major markets around the world. That did provide a helpful tailwind that I thought would be fair to recognize and just acknowledge. In terms of the drive-thru in particular, certainly, the streamlined menu boards have made life easier for our customers and made life easier for our managers and crew in the restaurants. So that experience has simplified and helped speed things up. Alongside the greatest barrier to the overall service experience in the drive-thru, we have identified is order accuracy. So the teams, the operational teams, have been working really hard on initiative -- again, I won't go into detail. We could have Ask, Ask, Tell. It's just the way that we -- the ordering experience of the customer where we can just confirm twice over that we captured the order right and that we're presenting exactly the right order to the customers before they drive off. And we're finding that has noticeably improved order accuracy which in turn improves speed and clearly, customer satisfaction. So we got plenty more to do. We're working through and continue to challenge the menu and if there's further simplification areas there, but simplification goes way beyond that. It has been through packaging, through merchandising, through marketing where we can help the restaurant teams by taking workload off of them so that they can focus on the fundamentals of what they want, which is serving customers."

So in terms of customer satisfaction, obviously, we got a number of different ways that we can monitor customer satisfaction. And we have 1 or 2 different systems around the world, so it's not a consistent measure as we speak. But we moved and transitioned to a new customer satisfaction measure here, which we call the voice which is actually we're gathering multiple number of customer feedbacks compared to where we were previously, so I going to explain that very well. We're gathering a lot more consumer feedback than we ever have done is a better way of saying it. Certainly, we're seeing overall satisfaction improving both in drive-thru and in-store. And we're certainly seeing order accuracy in the drive-thru. We're around -- national satisfaction on speed is improving. Our speed times haven't improved as much as satisfaction has done, so we want to work operationally to physically speed up the service experience. But at the same time, customers are reporting a greater satisfaction with the speed, which is very encouraging. So it means the overall experience is working for them. In terms on the premium side, yes, absolutely. As you gather momentum and you start to get these growth drivers that you can layer upon each other, it  means you can raise your head and look a little further out in the way that you plan and develop the business. So on the premium side, and by the way, each market doesn't have to work in isolation. So we have a number of initiatives around the world, whether it's Create Your Taste in Australia, a new premium range of signature burgers in the U.K., a similar version of that within France, for example. And we have these sophisticated, well-executed rollouts across those market, all of which is helping to inform us of where we head with Experience of the Future. What we do know is customization is important. We don't know quite how much customization customers truly wish. They like a little bit of flexibility but they don't need to overcomplicate it. So we're working on that, for example. We're working on the manner in which customers can order those premium burgers away from the traditional just through the drive-thru or at the front counter, and that's where self-order kiosks and potentially in table service comes into play. But again, we're getting a really good read on progress in some of our other mature lead markets. And that's certainly helping shape and inform the thinking here in the U.S. So more to come. Are we using the time to work on developing that platform? Absolutely, yes, we are."

I would say potentially, one slight difference from that is around All Day Breakfast, which -- where we were capturing customers where really what is a different occasion now. So -- and that is new to us at Mcdonald's. I think the customers were the incremental business and incremental business we're getting are probably from the broader IEO segment.

And that is we look at a whole bunch of factors to influence our pricing. That includes food inflation, GDP growth, our internal cost inflation, et cetera similar to how the U.S. would do it. So for 2015, we said that the U.S. increased their prices a little over 2% compared to food-away-from-home inflation of around 2.5% and that for 2016, food-away-from-home inflation is expected to be 2.5% to 3.5%. So we would continue to think about pricing in a similar way as we've been and keep an eye on that food-away-from-home inflation as well as food-at-home inflation, just to make sure that we're not getting out of whack with that. Related to the G&A, the way we look at it is we saved, I'll say, a little more than half of that $150 million dollars in 2015, which means that we go into 2016 with our base or run rate of those savings built in. We'll look at 2016 similarly. So while we may not get all of those actual savings realized in 2016, we'll have it out of our base by the end of 2016 so that as we go into 2017, we're going in with a base that's $150 million less than where we started at the $2.6 billion.

Okay, okay, someone is explaining here, right. So 2 parts to that question. So there are a number of metrics that we will follow through and we follow closely on a weekly basis, daily and weekly basis on that. One is, clearly, the downloads, then you want the registration numbers, then you want to see the activity. So we have 7 million downloads, which gives people access to things like restaurant locator, nutritional information and the rest. As they start to share their information and get confident with us, clearly then they will start to register and we can then communicate -- if they notify us of their local restaurant or their preferred restaurant, then we can start to localize the offers to them and then we start to see the behavior. We're seeing higher registration rates than industry norm from those downloads, and we're also then tracking effectively frequency of usage. And we're trying to encourage that with things like loyalty play, such as buy any 5 McCaf√©s of any size and you get 1 free. So it's a fairly basic loyalty play just to get you all familiar with using it and actively using it and they're keeping it on their phones, basically. The reason we have built -- a sales built into '16 is because we have seen the incremental business. We've seen the incremental average check of redemptions. So when people redeem an offer, we're actually seeing higher average check than we had expected to see. So we can see it as an incremental business driver. Plus, we got other initiatives that will both scale the number of customers and usage but also enhance the overall experience as well, which will encourage people to return to the app more often and clearly hopefully return to McDonald's more often. So we have it really -- we have it week by week and month by month as a build, and we'll be able to clearly update ourselves on whether we're hitting those projections. But it will be a helpful contributor to sales in '16 and will help guide us around the world beyond that to actually derive that return on the investment we're making in this digital strategy as a whole."

And then the All Day Breakfast is a further growth opportunity, which we're going to continue to work hard through '16. Getting the value platform right will be important to us. That's why we're taking a very serious look at it and learning from it before we then go into a national and permanent launch phase, but we feel good about where we're at, at the moment. You can expect to see us also focus more on our core menu. We're very proud of the menu, and we believe there is -- these are iconic and real popular assets that we believe that we can probably do a better job with and bring to life and we'll continue to invest in the ingredients and the food quality and create some fun around that. You can expect to see that. To create fun around the brand, you will also expect us to return to 1 or 2 of the promotional mechanics we have. We've got opportunities throughout the year to just bring in some variety and fun around promotional activity, shorter-term promotional activity just to help provide that balance across the menu. So I think -- and then with the digital platform layering on top of that, we believe we're building these -- building a platform that will continue to grow through '16 but will also take us into '17 and beyond. As we developed and better articulate here in the U.S. our Experience of the Future, that is something we know the system is excited about. We know it's creating a lot of energy and momentum elsewhere around the world, and getting that right and the business model right and actually getting the right elements of that for the customer here in the U.S. is going to be important to us. And we're excited about what we're going to learn in '16 because we believe that's going to contribute to '17 and beyond. In terms of the long-term strategy, I guess what we would want to see is we've had 2 quarters of growth in this turnaround. So we would certainly be looking to see another quarter or 2 before we ourselves start to move from the turnaround plan into a longer-term growth plan. What I can tell you is that we have a small and senior team looking at developing with that growth plan looks like, the elements of it, the brand positioning of it and the vision behind it. But it's a small team that's working discreetly on it because at the moment, the entire organization globally is focused on the turnaround. So whether it's later in the second quarter or sometime into the third quarter, I would say by around the middle of the year, when we get confident that it's the right time to transition from turnaround into growth, we'll share that internally and soon after, externally."

I mention that we'll have some pressure first and second quarter in 2016 as we kind of round out the additional labor costs that we have from the decision we made to increase wages for our restaurant crew. But with benign commodity cost, relatively reasonable inflation and, hopefully, some pricing capability, it will come down to what kind of comps we're able to achieve to determine whether we can grow margins. I think what fourth quarter should have shown everyone is even with those labor pressures when we have good comps, again, depending on where commodities are, we're able to offset a lot of those pressures. So it really does come down to continuing the growth comps."

In terms of the market share data, then, we would take across the  pretty much the 14-week period, that our growth would be at 5.7% in the QSR sandwich segment. Ex-McDonald's would be 2.8% giving us the differential of 2.9%. So overall growth in the market, we were outperforming that clearly. In terms of around the world, yes, I mean we want to be careful that we don't sound too anxious and create concern around the headwinds and what have you because so much of our ability to grow is in our own hands. And we're really focusing on what we can control. And we have noticed and we have a history of being successful in many, many countries around the world through strong economic times as well as challenging economic times as long as we do the right thing by the customers. So overall, we are confident heading into this year. We've been through the plans in detail of our largest 9 or 10 markets, and I'm confident they will deliver the growth to a level that we are satisfied and we're challenging ourselves hard on it. But I also want to be pragmatic. In France, in the moment, for example, it's tough. IEOs decreased for 5 years in a row. So if you're going to grow the business, you really have to take a significant amount of share in a declining market for that to translate into a top line growth. And to do that, you don't want to throw yourself out of your longer-term strategy and the brand building they've done. So I think there are some realities that it's right for us just to be a little cautious about. But if I take a look at the collective across the U.S., across the lead markets and the high-growth markets, we are building plans, and certainly, on a consolidated basis, with an expectation of growing. But as you all know from the markets, even the start of this year, volatility just creates a scrap year environment and a little bit of nervousness, whether it's across investor community and sometimes in certain markets across customer. So we need to be mindful and sensitive to that. China is a good example where that kind of volatility in the marketplace just create a little bit of anxiety. But that's why we want to reinforce our confidence in that market and growing our core business as well as incremental units and new store growth. So we're mindful, we stay close, but we remain quietly confident."

And we have a strong commitment to executing ou",1742,"Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. We begin 2016 in a much better place than we were 12 months ago. Today, we're more aligned to system, franchising cash flows and our major markets are improving. And we have a strong commitment to executing our turnaround plan.
Our near term priorities are clear. Our turnaround plan is the first step to fortifying the fundamentals of our business and restarting growth. This is grounded in running great restaurants, driving option growth, creating brand excitement and enhancing financial value. These actions ultimately position us to strengthen and grow as a more competitive and more modern business. We'll build on this foundation as we position McDonald's for long-term growth that will drive shareholder value in 2016 and beyond. 
Different markets are in different stages of turnaround. The U.S., our largest market, is currently in a trajectory change phase. While we are pleased with the recent positive momentum in the U.S., it will take at least 6 more months of positive comparable sales and guest count growth to progress through the sustained and prolonged growth phases of our turnaround.
I'm confident in the actions we are taking, and the traction is beginning to take hold. Most importantly, customers are noticing a difference. 
Our customer feedback systems are showing improvements in many important aspects of the customer visit, including food quality, order accuracy, speed and friendliness. 
In many ways, 2015 was a year of 2 halves. The first half of the year, our performance fell short of expectations. As I stepped into my role, my priority was to objectively assess our business, diagnose our opportunities and develop a leaner organizational structure. The second half of the year was about execution. The new operating structure that went into effect on July 1 sharpened our focus, drove great accountability and removed distractions and bureaucracy to speed up decisions and increased our ability to move winning tactics quickly across markets. 
As markets adjusted to how we think and operate, we began to get traction, ending the year on an upwards trajectory. Comparable sales were up 5% for the fourth quarter or 1.5% for the full year. Operating income is up 16% for the quarter, and earnings per share increased 26%, both in constant currencies. Various current and prior items outside our normal operations impacted earnings comparisons.  Kevin will share more details. 
Excluding these items, earnings per share would have been up 10% for the quarter in constant currencies. 
Now let's turn to segment performance. The U.S. remains fundamental to our turnaround, given its significant contribution to consolidated results. U.S. comparable sales increased 5.7% of the full quarter, marking the best quarter in nearly 4 years. For the full year, comparable sales grew 50 basis points, an encouraging change in trends after 2 years of declines.
While we've seen recent improvements in comparable guest counts, they remained negative for the full year. We need to do even more to increase the frequency of visits of more loyal customers and win back customers we've lost. Strong partnership with franchisees, as we execute our business building initiatives, has resulted in growth in restaurant level cash flows for both the quarter and the year. This is just one more indication of the progress we are making.
Our formula for success in the U.S. is consistent with many other markets. Our focus on operational excellence, coupled with relevant menu news, all supported by strong alignment with franchisees. The foundational steps we took to enhance menu quality simplified restaurant operations and offered even more convenience to customers, led to a palpable shift in momentum in the third quarter All Day Breakfast sales on this momentum in the fourth quarter exceeding internal expectations during the launch base. It's driving incremental business.
Many customers who otherwise would have gone elsewhere are coming to McDonald's to enjoy some of their favorite breakfast items, like our Egg McMuffin and hash browns at lunch and throughout the rest of the day. 
At the same time, existing customers are adding breakfast entr√©es to their regular orders, boosting sales and average check. In addition to benefits in top and bottom line growth, All Day Breakfast positions us to regain market share we've given up in recent years. In fact, since the launch of All Day Breakfast, we've experienced positive weekly comparable sales gaps relative to our QSR sandwich competitors, and we ended the quarter with a positive GAAP of 2.9%.
Another priority in the U.S. is the establishment of a consistent national value offering. We began testing Pick 2 earlier this month. This value offer gives customers the flexibility to bundle their choice of 2 items at a compelling price point. While still early, the offer appears to be resonating with customers. We'll continue to listen and apply what we're learning as we roll towards a more permanent national platform later this year to complement the ongoing regional efforts.
I'd also be remissed if I didn't mention that the U.S. and several other large markets also benefited from mild weather in the quarter. 
Let's now turn to the International Lead segment, which continues to operate from a position of strength.
Fourth quarter comparable sales increased 4.2% and comparable sales were up 3.4% for the year. Strong fourth quarter comparable sales mark the U.K.'s 39th consecutive quarter of growth as the market outperformed by the competition and the wider retail sector. Performance was driven by a number of customer-oriented offers. Successful promotions featuring premium products, like the new Big Flavour Wraps and the Chicken Legend, drove growth in average check. A strong focus on our core menu items continue to elevate customer perceptions around quality, and steady progress towards our Experience of the Future continues. About 1/4 of the U.K.'s restaurants are being converted and plans are in place to do more throughout 2016. These restaurants offer modern in-store service platforms, such as self-order kiosks, digital merchandising and customized order pickup place. We recently tested table service. And based on customers favorable reaction, we plan to roll it out across nearly all converted restaurants in 2016.
Australia also delivered a strong quarter of comparable sales, despite lapping its best quarter in 2014. The market wide deployment of Experience of the Future is driving incremental visits. Customers are enjoying conveniences, such as self-order kiosk and table service and taking advantage of the opportunity to customize their own [indiscernible] to satisfy individual tastes. Australia continues to fuel future growth by capitalizing on wins in other markets. Most recently, it's taken a chapter out of the U.S. playbook, testing All Day Breakfast in 300 restaurants and plans to go national later this quarter. 
Australia's ability to quickly scale this successful initiative from the U.S. highlights one of the many ways our new segment operating structure is creating a more nimble McDonald's. 
In Canada, balanced growth across All Day parts drove another quarter of strong comparable sales. Engaging marketing campaign, including Monopoly, festive food events and the successful free coffee promotion resonated strongly with customers. At the same time, the market continues to make progress towards its version of Experience of The Future. More than 175 restaurants to be converted with a significant number of additional conversions planned in 2016. 
In Germany and France, full quarter comparable sales were relatively flat. Germany's successful Monopoly promotion featuring premium products, along with a focus on add-on items, help drive average check in a highly competitive environment. Value remains a critical priority in Germany.
In the coming weeks, we'll launch an integrated value strategy across our menu to strengthen our appeal to value conscious consumers. In France, the macro environment remains challenging, and formally eating out market recorded its fifth consecutive year of decline. On top of the lagging economy and dampened consumer purchasing power, the November terrorist attack negatively impacted the entire eating out industry. We have seen this in Paris and in other cities throughout Europe.
Despite these headwinds, our brand remained strong in France. Successful Monopoly promotion, along with the introduction of new premium products, are increasing average check. At the same time, we're giving customers more options across lower tiers of our menu; the new items added to our P'tit Plaisir line and the extension of McFirst into other proteins, including fish.
We are working to become even more accessible to customers as we continue to open new restaurants, including 5 new airport sites that are part of a deal we recently closed with A√©roports de Paris.
Turning to the high-growth segment. Fourth quarter comparable sales increased 3%, and the comparable sales were up 1.8% for the year. China's fourth quarter comparable sales increased 4%. Successful execution of key initiatives around value, convenience and breakfast are driving market share increases in a flat IEO environment. 
Despite recent external challenges, we remain confident in the potential of this important market and in the strategies we have in place to expand the brand even further. In fact, we plan to open more than 250 restaurants in China in 2016, the highest of any of our markets.
In Russia, strong comparable sales in the fourth quarter reflected ongoing recovery of brand trust. However, results may be volatile going forward, given continuing macroeconomic uncertainties and decreased consumer purchasing power. 
One additional market I'd like to highlight is Japan, where comparable sales increased 1.6% in the fourth quarter. Results were partly driven by comparisons to last year's supplier issue. Even so, this marks Japan's best quarterly performance in nearly 4 years. Same is diligently executing its revitalization plan as I work to strengthen the brand's appeal to the customers. 
Our consolidated performance reflects the meaningful progress we've made to return critical markets to sustainable revenue and income growth. Although some of our larger markets face challenging headwinds as we enter 2016, we expect continued positive top line momentum across all segments. We're focused on what we can control and committed to elevating every aspect for the customer experience. This is about running great restaurants, and our entire system is rallying around this essential imperative every day. The steps we've taken have driven notable improvements in many larger markets, but there's more work to be done.
2016 will be about continuing to execute our turnaround plans. We'll concentrate on fortifying the fundamentals of our business, so we deliver what people want and expect from McDonald's today, while establishing the foundation for future growth. 
Thanks, everyone. And now, I'll turn it over to Kevin."
139488,322027229,920554,"McDonald's Corp., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 25, 2016",2016-01-25,"Earnings Calls","McDonald's Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Steve, and hello, everyone. As Steve mentioned, the strategic actions we took in 2015 were critical to restoring momentum in our business, ensuring our path forward. Fourth quarter played a key role in both areas. Today, I'd like to discuss the dr",1539,"Thanks, Steve, and hello, everyone. As Steve mentioned, the strategic actions we took in 2015 were critical to restoring momentum in our business, ensuring our path forward. Fourth quarter played a key role in both areas. Today, I'd like to discuss the drivers of our fourth quarter results, review our outlook for 2016 and provide an update on progress we've made on financial decisions announced in November. 
Let's start with a look at fourth quarter results. 
As Steve indicated, we delivered solid comparable sales and operating income growth for the quarter. The increase in fourth quarter operating income reflects the benefit up positive comparable sales across all segments, a testament to the early impact of our turnaround efforts. Fourth quarter results also reflected various current and prior year items outside of our normal operations. 
Relative to the prior year, these items included comparison against results, which were negatively impacted by the China supplier issue and an increase in our tax reserves. In the current year, these items included a gain of $135 million from the sale of a U.S. restaurant property and asset impairment charges of about $70 million, in conjunction with our global refranchising efforts.
Excluding the impact of these current and prior year items, fourth quarter earnings per share would have increased $0.13 or 10% in constant currencies. Top line performance continues to have the biggest impact on our margins, and it's one of the best indicators of the strength of our underlying business. With more than 80% of our global restaurants franchised, the largest driver of operating income continues to be our franchised margins, which totaled $1.9 billion, a 9% increase in constant currencies for the quarter. The franchised margin percent increased 50 basis points to 82%, driven primarily by the solid comparable sales in the U.S. and International Lead Market.
Global company operated margin dollars increased to 8% in constant currencies to $612 million for the quarter, while the company operated margin percent increased 80 basis points to 15.2%. Comparison against challenging prior year results in the high-growth and foundational segments accounted for the majority of the margin improvement for the quarter. Partly offsetting these margin gains were higher incremental labor costs in the U.S., reflecting the ongoing impact from our decision earlier in the year to increase crew wages and benefits. These costs, along with minimum wage increases mandated by several states during the year, negatively impacted fourth quarter U.S. margins by about 350 basis points, consistent with our expectations.
Solid comparable sales growth and favorable commodity costs helped minimize the impact of this labor pressure. For the quarter, U.S. commodity costs decreased about 1%, primarily due to lower beef cost. Looking ahead, U.S. company operated margins for the first half of 2016 will continue to be impacted by labor pressures of a similar magnitude in both first and second quarters.
To offset some of this inflationary pressure, our U.S. fourth quarter pricing year-over-year was up over 2%, placing our full year pricing below food-away-from-home inflation of around 2.5%. 2016 food-away-from-home inflation is projected to be between 2.5% and 3.5%. Commodity costs for the International Lead segment were up about 1% in the quarter. While price increases vary by market, year-over-year increases for these markets averaged 1% to 3%.
Looking ahead to full year 2016, commodity costs for the International Lead segment are expected to be relatively flat, while U.S. commodities are expected to decline 1% to 2%. G&A for the fourth quarter totaled $675 million, up 7% in constant currencies, due to higher incentive based compensation versus the prior year. Excluding incentive based compensation, G&A for the quarter decreased as expected.
For the full year 2016, G&A is expected to decrease about 1% to 2% in constant currencies. We expect G&A increases in the second and third quarters due to our worldwide convention in April and the Summer Olympics in August. Foreign currencies negatively impacted fourth quarter EPS by $0.11 and the full year by $0.50. At current exchange rates, there will be less pressure in 2016 with an expected negative impact on first quarter of $0.04 to $0.06 and full year of $0.18 to $0.20. As always, please take this as directional guidance only because rates will change as we move throughout the year. 
Now I'd like to provide an update on the progress we've made in 2015 and our financial decisions announced in November around G&A, refranchising and our capital structure.
Starting with our G&A spend. In November, we disclosed our net annual G&As savings target of $500 million from our G&A base of $2.6 billion at the beginning of 2015. This target excludes the impact of foreign currency changes. We expect to realize $150 million in savings by the end of 2016, with about half of these savings already achieved in 2015. We anticipate completing the vast majority of the remaining $350 million in savings by the end of 2017. 
Evolving our ownership strategy is also a fundamental component of our turnaround efforts and the catalyst for our decision to refranchise about 4,000 restaurants by the end of 2018. While our refranchising target implies approximately 1,000 restaurants per year, we expect variability around this average within a given year, as we work to balance the necessary time needed to select the best franchisees with our desire to execute our refranchising plan in an expedient manner.
During 2015, we refranchised about 470 restaurants, and we're currently making progress toward completing the sale of 2 international markets to developmental licensees that will include the refranchising of over 400 restaurants. As part of our evaluation of ownership strategies around the world, we have been reviewing our ownership levels in all markets. In conjunction with this effort, we're exploring the sale of a portion of our ownership at McDonald's Japan, if we identify a strategic investor who could help advance Japan's turnaround efforts and unlock our growth potential with a view of enhancing value for all stakeholders. 
We're in the early stages of the process and taking a thoughtful approach. We have an experienced and talented management team and a strong group of franchisees, all of whom are committed to enhancing our brand and supporting our turnaround in Japan with the Japanese consumer in mind.
Right now, we're focused on exploring the viability of finding the appropriate strategic investor. We are confident that whatever may transpire with our ownership, McDonald's Corporation and McDonald's Japan will continue to have a franchisor-franchisee relationship intended to promote McDonald's brand and business in Japan. 
We remain confident of the McDonald's Japan business for the long term and their commitment to revitalizing the brand in Japan. In connection with executing against our refranchising and G&A targets, during 2016, we may incur incremental strategic charges associated with asset dispositions and restructuring.
In November, we also committed to optimizing our capital structure. One month later, we added $6 billion of debt to our balance sheet, with an average tenure of over 15 years and an average coupon of 3.8%. We will likely have further debt additions during 2016, as we expect to return a total of about $30 billion to shareholders for the 3-year period ending 2016. 
For the 2 years ended 2015, we returned $15.8 billion dollars to shareholders, leaving about $14 billion in combined dividends and share repurchases to be completed in 2016. and Collectively, our refranchising efforts, G&A management and capital structure optimization will contribute to our goal of enhancing long-term financial value for our system and our shareholders. 
In addition to moving forward on these financial decisions, we are maintaining a balanced and measured approach of investing in our business to drive future growth. For 2016, we expect capital expenditures of approximately $2 billion, split fairly evenly between opening about 1,000 new restaurants and reinvesting in existing restaurants. The majority of our new store capital is earmarked for the International Lead and high-growth markets, while roughly half of our reinvestment capital will be devoted to U.S. restaurants. 
As we begin the New Year, we're encouraged by our recent results. However, our financial performance in the coming year is not likely to be linear. As we move through 2016, we expect some variability in our quarterly results, due to uneven prior year comparisons and some headwinds that exist, including macroeconomic issues in some of our high-growth markets and challenging guest counts in the U.S., Germany and France. 
Generating sustained positive guest traffic in these markets and around the world remains a top priority for 2016. We also anticipate limited pricing power in several of our markets, as a relatively benign commodity outlook and low inflation could impact our ability to increase menu board prices. 
In closing, we begin 2016 in a stronger position, positive top and bottom line momentum across all segments and greater alignment with franchisees around our near-term fast forward. We are committed to executing our turnaround plan, which starts with the diligent execution of operating great restaurants on a daily basis. At the same time, we remain confident in our ability to execute against our financial decisions and evolve to a leaner, more heavily franchised business that generates long-term value for our shareholders. 
Thanks. Now I'll turn it over to Chris to begin our Q&A."

We entered the quarter with good momentum in our business. Clearly, that was accelerated through the fourth quarter. And as we've said, All Day Breakfast was a primary driver of that, but not the sole driver. So it exceeded our launch expectations. The period of  time for which it exceeded our launch expectations was also a little longer than we had projected, but we do expect it to settle down. But that's why we're working on the number of other initiatives in the business to follow that up. So this is not a -- we don't want us to be a single initiative turnaround plan, so the continued investment in food quality, the development of this value platform. And as we continue to reinvest in the fabric of our restaurants, we're confident the in-store experience will continue to improve. The operation improvements we're seeing through the drive-through around old  bureaucracy in particular, we see it's paying dividends. Early days after launching a number of initiatives around people, we begin to see our star turnover decrease quite notably as well, which we believe helps us deliver a better data experience. So there's a number of dimensions to it. All Day Breakfast is understandably a more of the headline grabber. It will settle down a little from its launch phase. But we believe that building these other platforms of growth on top of that will keep us competitive in the market place in taking share."

So on the app, it's still early days for us, but -- I mean, for us, it's -- what we can offer in the future is exciting. What we're actually delivering now is really just the start. So we only really launched the app here in the U.S. at the end of the third quarter last year. But within 3 months, we had over 7 million downloads, which I think just starts to signal the magnitude that we can build to as we develop office and functionality way beyond the basic. At the moment, it's largely offer-based. and we're seeing those downloads being activated by customers and redeeming the offers in the restaurants. So we believe it's driving behavior. We hope to follow consumers behavior easy because we can read the kind of the data from it. But certainly, as we build the capability of the app, we think it's going to increase the compelling and the growth engine. I would say that for the first time here at McDonald's, we have built in a trading increase, a sale -- an incremental sales expectation based on our digital platform. It's a little modest in 2016, but we see it actually contributing to the business growth and being a platform that's going to deliver for many years to come as we can kind of understand our consumer behavior and be more rewarding to them. With regards to the second piece, Experience of The Future, we have around 5 markets up and running, as you say, we're at about 130 restaurants. We're certainly looking to expand, not necessarily those markets, but into new markets at our largest scale. And the U.S. will, again, pick some lease regions. I mean, this is where the regional strength of the U.S. really comes to the full. We got 23 regions here in the U.S. We'll be picking 2 or 3 of those to really look to accelerate their version here in the U.S. of the Experience of The Future through '16 and into '17. But they will be adapting a slightly different approach from those 3 regions, so we actually learn in the market here what truly resonates with customers, what the business results are and the future potential. So -- and also, given our new structure now, we're learning so rapidly from the way that Australians have built their business, Canada building theirs, U.K., France in particular theirs, that we are rich in inside, which is helping each other make smart decisions in shorter timelines. So we'll certainly share more, but at the moment, the majority of our growth we're building to the U.S. performance through '16 is through continuing to deliver against the basics of our turnaround plan."

I don't want to give specifics on the respective drivers but the piece that I want to make sure we don't lose is that we were building momentum heading into the quarter and heading into the launch of All Day Breakfast. And I won't necessarily do a full laundry list of the work the team had done. But certainly around the fundamentals of delivering a better, high quality food experience day in, day out. And you heard me talk about the devil's in the detail always around toasting of the buns and searing of the beef. And when you align that with investing in the types of quality investments that customers care about, such as when was the antibiotics move we made in the poultry supply chain or the announcement that we on our journey of going to cage-free eggs and that's just creates a buzz [ph]. And customers know that you care about the same things that they care about, then they just respond with their business. All Day Breakfast was clearly the primary driver of the quarter. We knew it would be. We focused the restaurants both operationally, marketing and merchandising on that. As I say, through the launch phase, it helped contribute materially to the quarter, absolutely no doubt. We hit peaks. We exceeded the sales contribution that we had projected. And as I say, it lasted longer through the quarter than a typical launch period does. But inevitably, it'll settle down as we introduce other initiatives in the restaurants through '16. The weather was notable but not material, but I just thought it was appropriate and transparent to reference it because it did give us a positive contribution, not just in the U.S. but in many of our major markets around the world. That did provide a helpful tailwind that I thought would be fair to recognize and just acknowledge. In terms of the drive-thru in particular, certainly, the streamlined menu boards have made life easier for our customers and made life easier for our managers and crew in the restaurants. So that experience has simplified and helped speed things up. Alongside the greatest barrier to the overall service experience in the drive-thru, we have identified is order accuracy. So the teams, the operational teams, have been working really hard on initiative -- again, I won't go into detail. We could have Ask, Ask, Tell. It's just the way that we -- the ordering experience of the customer where we can just confirm twice over that we captured the order right and that we're presenting exactly the right order to the customers before they drive off. And we're finding that has noticeably improved order accuracy which in turn improves speed and clearly, customer satisfaction. So we got plenty more to do. We're working through and continue to challenge the menu and if there's further simplification areas there, but simplification goes way beyond that. It has been through packaging, through merchandising, through marketing where we can help the restaurant teams by taking workload off of them so that they can focus on the fundamentals of what they want, which is serving customers."

So in terms of customer satisfaction, obviously, we got a number of different ways that we can monitor customer satisfaction. And we have 1 or 2 different systems around the world, so it's not a consistent measure as we speak. But we moved and transitioned to a new customer satisfaction measure here, which we call the voice which is actually we're gathering multiple number of customer feedbacks compared to where we were previously, so I going to explain that very well. We're gathering a lot more consumer feedback than we ever have done is a better way of saying it. Certainly, we're seeing overall satisfaction improving both in drive-thru and in-store. And we're certainly seeing order accuracy in the drive-thru. We're around -- national satisfaction on speed is improving. Our speed times haven't improved as much as satisfaction has done, so we want to work operationally to physically speed up the service experience. But at the same time, customers are reporting a greater satisfaction with the speed, which is very encouraging. So it means the overall experience is working for them. In terms on the premium side, yes, absolutely. As you gather momentum and you start to get these growth drivers that you can layer upon each other, it  means you can raise your head and look a little further out in the way that you plan and develop the business. So on the premium side, and by the way, each market doesn't have to work in isolation. So we have a number of initiatives around the world, whether it's Create Your Taste in Australia, a new premium range of signature burgers in the U.K., a similar version of that within France, for example. And we have these sophisticated, well-executed rollouts across those market, all of which is helping to inform us of where we head with Experience of the Future. What we do know is customization is important. We don't know quite how much customization customers truly wish. They like a little bit of flexibility but they don't need to overcomplicate it. So we're working on that, for example. We're working on the manner in which customers can order those premium burgers away from the traditional just through the drive-thru or at the front counter, and that's where self-order kiosks and potentially in table service comes into play. But again, we're getting a really good read on progress in some of our other mature lead markets. And that's certainly helping shape and inform the thinking here in the U.S. So more to come. Are we using the time to work on developing that platform? Absolutely, yes, we are."

And that is we look at a whole bunch of factors to influence our pricing. That includes food inflation, GDP growth, our internal cost inflation, et cetera similar to how the U.S. would do it. So for 2015, we said that the U.S. increased their prices a little over 2% compared to food-away-from-home inflation of around 2.5% and that for 2016, food-away-from-home inflation is expected to be 2.5% to 3.5%.

Related to the G&A, the way we look at it is we saved, I'll say, a little more than half of that $150 million dollars in 2015, which means that we go into 2016 with our base or run rate of those savings built in. We'll look at 2016 similarly. So while we may not get all of those actual savings realized in 2016, we'll have it out of our base by the end of 2016 so that as we go into 2017, we're going in with a base that's $150 million less than where we started at the $2.6 billion. And that's a net number. So that includes the Olympics convention, all the additional costs in there also."

Okay, okay, someone is explaining here, right. So 2 parts to that question. So there are a number of metrics that we will follow through and we follow closely on a weekly basis, daily and weekly basis on that. One is, clearly, the downloads, then you want the registration numbers, then you want to see the activity. So we have 7 million downloads, which gives people access to things like restaurant locator, nutritional information and the rest. As they start to share their information and get confident with us, clearly then they will start to register and we can then communicate -- if they notify us of their local restaurant or their preferred restaurant, then we can start to localize the offers to them and then we start to see the behavior. We're seeing higher registration rates than industry norm from those downloads, and we're also then tracking effectively frequency of usage. And we're trying to encourage that with things like loyalty play, such as buy any 5 McCaf√©s of any size and you get 1 free. So it's a fairly basic loyalty play just to get you all familiar with using it and actively using it and they're keeping it on their phones, basically. The reason we have built -- a sales built into '16 is because we have seen the incremental business. We've seen the incremental average check of redemptions. So when people redeem an offer, we're actually seeing higher average check than we had expected to see. So we can see it as an incremental business driver. Plus, we got other initiatives that will both scale the number of customers and usage but also enhance the overall experience as well, which will encourage people to return to the app more often and clearly hopefully return to McDonald's more often. So we have it really -- we have it week by week and month by month as a build, and we'll be able to clearly update ourselves on whether we're hitting those projections. But it will be a helpful contributor to sales in '16 and will help guide us around the world beyond that to actually derive that return on the investment we're making in this digital strategy as a whole."

And then the All Day Breakfast is a further growth opportunity, which we're going to continue to work hard through '16. Getting the value platform right will be important to us. That's why we're taking a very serious look at it and learning from it before we then go into a national and permanent launch phase, but we feel good about where we're at, at the moment. You can expect to see us also focus more on our core menu. We're very proud of the menu, and we believe there is -- these are iconic and real popular assets that we believe that we can probably do a better job with and bring to life and we'll continue to invest in the ingredients and the food quality and create some fun around that. You can expect to see that. To create fun around the brand, you will also expect us to return to 1 or 2 of the promotional mechanics we have. We've got opportunities throughout the year to just bring in some variety and fun around promotional activity, shorter-term promotional activity just to help provide that balance across the menu. So I think -- and then with the digital platform layering on top of that, we believe we're building these -- building a platform that will continue to grow through '16 but will also take us into '17 and beyond. As we developed and better articulate here in the U.S. our Experience of the Future, that is something we know the system is excited about. We know it's creating a lot of energy and momentum elsewhere around the world, and getting that right and the business model right and actually getting the right elements of that for the customer here in the U.S. is going to be important to us. And we're excited about what we're going to learn in '16 because we believe that's going to contribute to '17 and beyond. In terms of the long-term strategy, I guess what we would want to see is we've had 2 quarters of growth in this turnaround. So we would certainly be looking to see another quarter or 2 before we ourselves start to move from the turnaround plan into a longer-term growth plan. What I can tell you is that we have a small and senior team looking at developing with that growth plan looks like, the elements of it, the brand positioning of it and the vision behind it. But it's a small team that's working discreetly on it because at the moment, the entire organization globally is focused on the turnaround. So whether it's later in the second quarter or sometime into the third quarter, I would say by around the middle of the year, when we get confident that it's the right time to transition from turnaround into growth, we'll share that internally and soon after, externally."

In terms of around the world, yes, I mean we want to be careful that we don't sound too anxious and create concern around the headwinds and what have you because so much of our ability to grow is in our own hands. And we're really focusing on what we can control. And we have noticed and we have a history of being successful in many, many countries around the world through strong economic times as well as challenging economic times as long as we do the right thing by the customers. So overall, we are confident heading into this year. We've been through the plans in detail of our largest 9 or 10 markets, and I'm confident they will deliver the growth to a level that we are satisfied and we're challenging ourselves hard on it. But I also want to be pragmatic. In France, in the moment, for example, it's tough. IEOs decreased for 5 years in a row. So if you're going to grow the business, you really have to take a significant amount of share in a declining market for that to translate into a top line growth. And to do that, you don't want to throw yourself out of your longer-term strategy and the brand building they've done. So I think there are some realities that it's right for us just to be a little cautious about. But if I take a look at the collective across the U.S., across the lead markets and the high-growth markets, we are building plans, and certainly, on a consolidated basis, with an expectation of growing. But as you all know from the markets, even the start of this year, volatility just creates a scrap year environment and a little bit of nervousness, whether it's across investor community and sometimes in certain markets across customer. So we need to be mindful and sensitive to that. China is a good example where that kind of volatility in the marketplace just create a little bit of anxiety. But that's why we want to reinforce our confidence in that market and growing our core business as well as incremental units and new store growth. So we're mindful, we stay close, but we remain quietly confident."

We begin 2016 in a much better place than we were 12 months ago.

We begin 2016 in a much better place than we were 12 months ago. Today, we're more aligned as a system, franchisee cash flows in our major markets are improving and we have a strong commitment to executing our turnaround plan.
Our near term priorities are clear. Our turnaround plan is the first step to fortifying the fundamentals of our business and restarting growth. It's grounded in running great restaurants, driving operating growth, creating brand excitement and enhancing financial value. These actions ultimately position us to strengthen and grow as a more competitive and more modern business. We'll build on this foundation as we position McDonald's for long-term growth that will drive shareholder value in 2016 and beyond. 
Different markets are in different stages of turnaround. The U.S., our largest market, is currently in a trajectory change phase. While we are pleased with the recent positive momentum in the U.S., it will take at least 6 more months of positive comparable sales and guest count growth to progress through the sustained and prolonged growth phases of our turnaround.
I'm confident in the actions we are taking, and the traction is beginning to take hold. Most importantly, customers are noticing a difference. 
Our customer feedback systems are showing improvements in many important aspects of the customer visit, including food quality, order accuracy, speed and friendliness. 
In many ways, 2015 was a year of 2 halves. The first half of the year, our performance fell short of expectations. As I stepped into my role, my priority was to objectively assess our business, diagnose our opportunities and develop a leaner organizational structure. The second half of the year was about execution. The new operating structure that went into effect on July 1 sharpened our focus, drove great accountability and removed distractions and bureaucracy to speed up decisions and increased our ability to move winning tactics quickly across markets. 
As markets adjusted to how they think and operate, we began to get traction, ending the year on an upwards trajectory. Comparable sales were up 5% for the fourth quarter and 1.5% for the full year. Operating income is up 16% for the quarter, and earnings per share increased 26%, both in constant currencies. Various current and prior year items outside our normal operations impacted earnings comparisons. Kevin will share more details. 
Excluding these items, earnings per share would have been up 10% for the quarter in constant currencies. 
Now let's turn to segment performance. The U.S. remains fundamental to our turnaround, given its significant contribution to consolidated results. U.S. comparable sales increased 5.7% of the full quarter, marking the best quarter in nearly 4 years. For the full year, comparable sales grew 50 basis points, an encouraging change in trends after 2 years of declines.
While we've seen recent improvements in comparable guest counts, they remained negative for the full year. We need to do even more to increase the frequency of visits from our loyal customers and win back customers we've lost. Strong partnership with franchisees, as we execute our business building initiatives, has resulted in growth in restaurant level cash flows for both the quarter and the year. This is just one more indication of the progress we are making.
Our formula for success in the U.S. is consistent with many other markets. Our focus on operational excellence, coupled with relevant menu news, all supported by strong alignment with franchisees. The foundational steps we took to enhance menu quality, simplify restaurant operations and offer even more convenience to customers, led to a palpable shift in momentum in the third quarter. 
All Day Breakfast builds on this momentum in the fourth quarter, exceeding internal expectations during the launch phase. It's driving incremental business. Many customers who otherwise would have gone elsewhere are coming to McDonald's to enjoy some of their favorite breakfast items, like our Egg McMuffin and hash browns at lunch and throughout the rest of the day. 
At the same time, existing customers are adding breakfast entr√©es to their regular orders, boosting sales and average check. In addition to benefits in top and bottom line growth, All Day Breakfast positions us to regain market share we've given up in recent years. In fact, since the launch of All Day Breakfast, we've experienced positive weekly comparable sales gaps relative to our QSR sandwich competitors, and we ended the quarter with a positive gap of 2.9%.
Another priority in the U.S. is the establishment of a consistent national value offering. We began testing Pick 2 earlier this month. This value offer gives customers the flexibility to bundle their choice of 2 items at a compelling price point. While still early, the offer appears to be resonating with customers. We'll continue to listen and apply what we're learning as we work towards a more permanent national platform later this year to complement the ongoing regional efforts.
I'd also be remiss if I didn't mention that the U.S. and several other large markets also benefited from mild weather in the quarter. 
Let's now turn to the International Lead segment, which continues to operate from a position of strength.
Fourth quarter comparable sales increased 4.2% and comparable sales were up 3.4% for the year. Strong fourth quarter comparable sales mark the U.K.'s 39th consecutive quarter of growth as the market outperformed both the competition and the wider retail sector. Performance was driven by a number of customer-oriented offers. Successful promotions featuring premium products, like the new Big Flavour Wraps and the Chicken Legend, drove growth in average check. A strong focus on our core menu items continue to elevate customer perceptions around quality, and steady progress towards our Experience of the Future continues. About 1/4 of the U.K.'s restaurants are being converted and plans are in place to do more throughout 2016. These restaurants offer modern in-store service platforms, such as self-order kiosks, digital merchandising and customized order pickup points. We recently tested table service. And based on customers' favorable reaction, we plan to roll it out across nearly all converted restaurants in 2016.
Australia also delivered a strong quarter of comparable sales, despite lapping its best quarter in 2014. The market wide deployment of Experience of the Future is driving incremental visits. Customers are enjoying conveniences, such as self-order kiosks and table service and taking advantage of the opportunity to customize their entr√©es to satisfy individual tastes. Australia continues to fuel future growth by capitalizing on wins in other markets. Most recently, it's taken a chapter out of the U.S. playbook, testing All Day Breakfast in 300 restaurants. It plans to go national later this quarter. 
Australia's ability to quickly scale this successful initiative from the U.S. highlights one of the many ways our new segment operating structure is creating a more nimble McDonald's. 
In Canada, balanced growth across All Day parts drove another quarter of strong comparable sales. Engaging marketing campaigns, including Monopoly, festive food events and the successful free coffee promotion resonated strongly with customers. At the same time, the market continues to make progress towards its version of Experience of The Future. More than 175 restaurants are being converted with a significant number of additional conversions planned in 2016. 
In Germany and France, fourth quarter comparable sales were relatively flat. Germany's successful Monopoly promotion featuring premium products, along with a focus on add-on items, help drive average check in a highly competitive environment. Value remains a critical priority in Germany.
In the coming weeks, we'll launch an integrated value strategy across our menu to strengthen our appeal to value-conscious consumers. In France, the macro environment remains challenging, the informally eating-out market recorded its fifth consecutive year of decline. On top of the lagging economy and dampened consumer purchasing power, the November terrorist attack negatively impacted the entire eating-out industry. We have seen this in Paris and in other cities throughout Europe.
Despite these headwinds, our brand remained strong in France. Successful Monopoly promotion, along with the introduction of new premium products, are increasing average check. At the same time, we're giving customers more options across lower tiers of our menu; the new items added to our P'tit Plaisir line and the extension of McFirst into other proteins, including fish.
We are working to become even more accessible to customers as we continue to open new restaurants, including 5 new airport sites that are part of a deal we recently closed with A√©roports de Paris.
Turning to the high-growth segment. Fourth quarter comparable sales increased 3%, and the comparable sales were up 1.8% for the year. China's fourth quarter comparable sales increased 4%. Successful execution of key initiatives around value, convenience and breakfast are driving market share increases in a flat IEO environment. 
Despite recent external challenges, we remain confident in the potential of this important market and in the strategies we have in place to expand the brand even further. In fact, we plan to open more than 250 restaurants in China in 2016, the highest of any of our markets.
In Russia, strong comparable sales in the fourth quarter reflected ongoing recovery of brand trust. However, results may be volatile moving forward, given continuing macroeconomic uncertainties and decreased consumer purchasing power. 
One additional market I'd like to highlight is Japan, where comparable sales increased 1.6% in the fourth quarter. Results were partly driven by comparisons to last year's supplier issue. Even so, this marks Japan's best quarterly performance in nearly 4 years. Same [ph] is diligently executing its revitalization plan as they work to strengthen the brand's appeal to customers. 
Our consolidated performance reflects the meaningful progress we've made to return critical markets to sustainable revenue and income growth. Although some of our larger markets face challenging headwinds as we enter 2016, we expect continued positive top line momentum across all segments. We're focused on what we can control and committed to elevating every aspect for the customer experience. This is about running great restaurants, and our entire system is rallying around this essential imperative every day. The steps we've taken have driven notable improvements in many larger markets, but there's more work to be done.
2016 will be about continuing to execute our turnaround plans. We'll concentrate on fortifying the fundamentals of our business, so we deliver what people want and expect from McDonald's today, while establishing the foundation for future growth. 
Thanks, everyone. And now, I'll turn it over to Kevin."
139488,322027229,920605,"McDonald's Corp., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 25, 2016",2016-01-25,"Earnings Calls","McDonald's Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Steve, and hello, everyone.

Today, I'd like to discuss the",1536,"Thanks, Steve, and hello, everyone. As Steve mentioned, the strategic actions we took in 2015 were critical to restoring momentum in our business and charting our path forward. Fourth quarter played a key role in both areas. Today, I'd like to discuss the drivers of our fourth quarter results, review our outlook for 2016 and provide an update on progress we've made on financial decisions announced in November. 
Let's start with a look at fourth quarter results. 
As Steve indicated, we delivered solid comparable sales and operating income growth for the quarter. The increase in fourth quarter operating income reflects the benefit of positive comparable sales across all segments, a testament to the early impact of our turnaround efforts. Fourth quarter results also reflected various current and prior year items outside of our normal operations. 
Relative to the prior year, these items included comparison against results, which were negatively impacted by the China supplier issue and an increase in our tax reserves. In the current year, these items included a gain of $135 million from the sale of a U.S. restaurant property and asset impairment charges of about $70 million, in conjunction with our global refranchising efforts.
Excluding the impact of these current and prior year items, fourth quarter earnings per share would have increased $0.13 or 10% in constant currencies. Top line performance continues to have the biggest impact on our margins, and it's one of the best indicators of the strength of our underlying business. With more than 80% of our global restaurants franchised, the largest driver of operating income continues to be our franchise margins, which totaled $1.9 billion, a 9% increase in constant currencies for the quarter. The franchise margin percent increased 50 basis points to 82%, driven primarily by the solid comparable sales in the U.S. and International Lead Markets.
Global company operated margin dollars increased 8% in constant currencies to $612 million for the quarter, while the company operated margin percent increased 80 basis points to 15.2%. Comparison against challenging prior year results in the high-growth and foundational segments accounted for the majority of the margin improvement for the quarter. Partly offsetting these margin gains were higher incremental labor costs in the U.S., reflecting the ongoing impact from our decision earlier in the year to increase crew wages and benefits. These costs, along with minimum wage increases mandated by several states during the year, negatively impacted fourth quarter U.S. margins by about 350 basis points, consistent with our expectations.
Solid comparable sales growth and favorable commodity costs helped minimize the impact of this labor pressure. For the quarter, U.S. commodity costs decreased about 1%, primarily due to lower beef costs. Looking ahead, U.S. company operated margins for the first half of 2016 will continue to be impacted by labor pressures of a similar magnitude in both first and second quarters.
To offset some of this inflationary pressure, our U.S. fourth quarter pricing year-over-year was up over 2%, placing our full-year pricing below food-away-from-home inflation of around 2.5%. 2016 food-away-from-home inflation is projected to be between 2.5% and 3.5%. Commodity costs for the International Lead segment were up about 1% in the quarter. While price increases vary by market, year-over-year increases for these markets averaged 1% to 3%.
Looking ahead to full year 2016, commodity costs for the International Lead segment are expected to be relatively flat, while U.S. commodities are expected to decline 1% to 2%. G&A for the fourth quarter totaled $675 million, up 7% in constant currencies, due to higher incentive-based compensation versus the prior year. Excluding incentive-based compensation, G&A for the quarter decreased as expected.
For the full year of 2016, G&A is expected to decrease about 1% to 2% in constant currencies. We expect G&A increases in the second and third quarters due to our worldwide convention in April and the Summer Olympics in August. 
Foreign currencies negatively impacted fourth quarter EPS by $0.11 and the full year by $0.50. At current exchange rates, there would be less pressure in 2016 with an expected negative impact on first quarter of $0.04 to $0.06 and full year of $0.18 to $0.20. As always, please take this as directional guidance only because rates will change as we move throughout the year. 
Now I'd like to provide an update on the progress we've made in 2015 and our financial decisions announced in November around G&A, refranchising and our capital structure.
Starting with our G&A spend. In November, we disclosed our net annual G&A savings target of $500 million from our G&A base of $2.6 billion at the beginning of 2015. This target excludes the impact of foreign currency changes. We expect to realize $150 million in savings by the end of 2016, with about half of these savings already achieved in 2015. We anticipate completing the vast majority of the remaining $350 million in savings by the end of 2017. 
Evolving our ownership strategy is also a fundamental component of our turnaround efforts and the catalyst for our decision to refranchise about 4,000 restaurants by the end of 2018. While our refranchising target implies approximately 1,000 restaurants per year, we expect variability around this average within a given year, as we work to balance the necessary time needed to select the best franchisees with our desire to execute our refranchising plans in an expedient manner.
During 2015, we refranchised about 470 restaurants, and we're currently making progress toward completing the sale of 2 international markets to developmental licensees that will include the refranchising of over 400 restaurants. 
As part of our evaluation of ownership strategies around the world, we have been reviewing our ownership levels in all markets. In conjunction with this effort, we're exploring the sale of a portion of our ownership in McDonald's Japan, if we identify a strategic investor who could help advance Japan's turnaround efforts and unlock our growth potential with a view of enhancing value for all stakeholders. 
We're in the early stages of the process and taking a thoughtful approach. We have an experienced and talented management team and a strong group of franchisees, all of whom are committed to enhancing our brand and supporting our turnaround in Japan with the Japanese consumer in mind.
Right now, we're focused on exploring the viability of finding the appropriate strategic investor. We are confident that whatever may transpire with our ownership, McDonald's Corporation and McDonald's Japan will continue to have a franchisor-franchisee relationship intended to promote McDonald's brand and business in Japan. We remain confident of the McDonald's Japan business for the long term and their commitment to revitalizing the brand in Japan.
In connection with executing against our refranchising and G&A targets, during 2016, we may incur incremental strategic charges associated with asset dispositions and restructuring.
In November, we also committed to optimizing our capital structure. One month later, we added $6 billion of debt to our balance sheet, with an average tenor of over 15 years and an average coupon of 3.8%. We will likely have further debt additions during 2016, as we expect to return a total of about $30 billion to shareholders for the 3-year period ending 2016. 
For the 2 years ended 2015, we returned $15.8 billion dollars to shareholders, leaving about $14 billion in combined dividends and share repurchases to be completed in 2016. Collectively, our refranchising efforts, G&A management and capital structure optimization will contribute to our goal of enhancing long-term financial value for our system and our shareholders. 
In addition to moving forward on these financial decisions, we are maintaining a balanced and measured approach of investing in our business to drive future growth. For 2016, we expect capital expenditures of approximately $2 billion, split fairly evenly between opening about 1,000 new restaurants and reinvesting in existing restaurants. The majority of our new store capital is earmarked for the International Lead and high-growth markets, while roughly half of our reinvestment capital will be devoted to U.S. restaurants. 
As we begin the New Year, we're encouraged by our recent results. However, our financial performance in the coming year is not likely to be linear. As we move through 2016, we expect some variability in our quarterly results, due to uneven prior year comparisons and some headwinds that exist, including macroeconomic issues in some of our high-growth markets and challenging guest counts in the U.S., Germany and France. 
Generating sustained positive guest traffic in these markets and around the world remains a top priority for 2016. We also anticipate limited pricing power in several of our markets, as a relatively benign commodity outlook and low inflation could impact our ability to increase menu board prices. 
In closing, we begin 2016 in a stronger position, positive top and bottom line momentum across all segments and greater alignment with franchisees around our near-term path forward. We are committed to executing our turnaround plan, which starts with the diligent execution of operating great restaurants on a daily basis. At the same time, we remain confident in our ability to execute against our financial decisions and evolve to a leaner, more heavily franchised business that generates long-term value for our shareholders. 
Thanks. Now I'll turn it over to Chris to begin our Q&A."

Yes, so we launched on the 4th of January, we know that around 25% of our customers are value-conscious and that value -- a number of price points, but certainly, at the entry level. And we'd like the construct of McPick 2. It's very early days. There's not a great deal of trading information that we can particularly share right now. But we know that the choice and the flexibility that we offer with 2 items at that compelling price point is attractive. As you say, others have chosen a different price point to go in and bundle more items into it. We think that choosing 2 out of the 4 items we have in that menu gives that, that right balance between -- it's simple, it's easy for the customer. It gives them the choice and the flexibility. And through the course of a handful of weeks, we'll certainly read the consumer response to it, we'll analyze the business results for it and continue to work on developing the right value platform for us on an ongoing basis. The lead item on it is the double cheeseburger that sold well, but also the mozzarella sticks are going down really, really well and it's a great add-on item. So there's an incremental profit driver, if you like, both within the McPick 2, but also as an add-on item on its own."

We entered the quarter with good momentum in our business. Clearly, that was accelerated through the fourth quarter. And as we've said, All Day Breakfast was a primary driver of that, but not the sole driver. So it exceeded our launch expectations. The period of time for which it exceeded our launch expectations was also a little longer than we had projected, but we do expect it to settle down. But that's why we're working on the number of other initiatives in the business to follow that up. So this is not a -- we don't want us to be a single initiative turnaround plan, so the continued investment in food quality, the development of this value platform. And as we continue to reinvest in the fabric of our restaurants, we're confident the in-store experience will continue to improve. The operation improvements we're seeing through the drive-through around order accuracy in particular, we see as paying dividends. Early days after launching a number of initiatives around people, we're beginning to see our staff turnover decrease quite notably as well, which we believe helps us deliver a better data experience. So there's a number of dimensions to it. All Day Breakfast is understandably a more of a headline grabber. It will settle down a little from its launch phase. But we believe that building these other platforms of growth on top of that will keep us competitive in the market place in taking share."

So we only really launched the app here in the U.S. at the end of the third quarter last year. But within 3 months, we've had over 7 million downloads, which I think just starts to signal the magnitude that we can build to as we develop offers and functionality way beyond the basic. At the moment, it's largely offer-based. And we're seeing those downloads being activated by customers and redeeming the offers in the restaurants. So we believe it's driving behavior. We hope to follow consumers' behavior easier because we can read the kind of the data from it. But certainly, as we build the capability of the app, we think it's going to get increasingly compelling and be a growth engine. I would say that for the first time here at McDonald's, we have built in a trading increase, a sale -- an incremental sales expectation based on our digital platform. It's a little modest in 2016, but we see it actually contributing to the business growth and being a platform that's going to deliver for many years to come as we can kind of understand our consumer behavior and be more rewarding to them. With regards to the second piece, the Experience of the Future, we have around 5 markets up and running, as you say, with about 130 restaurants. We're certainly looking to expand, not necessarily those markets, but into new markets at a largest scale. And the U.S. will, again, pick some lead regions. I mean, this is where the regional strength of the U.S. really comes to the fore. We've got 23 regions here in the U.S. We'll be picking 2 or 3 of those to really look to accelerate their version here in the U.S. of the Experience of the Future through '16 and into '17. But they will be adapting a slightly different approach in those 3 regions, so we can actually learn in the market here what truly resonates with customers, what the business results are and the future potential. So -- and also, given our new structure now, we're learning so rapidly from the way that the Australians have built their business, Canada building theirs, U.K., France, in particular, theirs, that we are rich in insight, which is helping each other make smarter decisions and shorten the timelines. So we'll certainly share more, but at the moment, the majority of our growth that we're building into the U.S. performance through '16 is through continuing to deliver against the basics of our turnaround plan."

We're not going to give specifics on the respective drivers, but the piece that I want to make sure we don't lose is that we were building momentum heading into the quarter and heading into the launch of All Day Breakfast. And I won't necessarily do a full laundry list of the work the team had done. But certainly around the fundamentals of delivering a better, high quality food experience day in, day out. And you've heard me talk about the devil's in the detail always around toasting of the buns and searing of the beef. And when you align that with investing in the types of quality investments that customers care about, such as whether it was the antibiotics move we made in the poultry supply chain or the announcement that we are on our journey of going to cage-free eggs. That just creates a buzz. And when customers know that you care about the same things that they care about, then they just respond with their business. All Day Breakfast was clearly the primary driver of the quarter. We knew it would be. We focused the restaurants both operationally, marketing and merchandising on that. As I say, through the launch phase, it helped contribute materially to the quarter, absolutely no doubt. We hit peaks. We exceeded the sales contribution that we had projected. And as I say, it lasted longer through the quarter than a typical launch period does. But inevitably, it'll settle down as we introduce other initiatives into restaurants through '16. The weather was noticeable, but not material, but I just thought it was appropriate and transparent to reference it because it did give us a positive contribution, not just in the U.S. but in many of our major markets around the world. That did provide a helpful tailwind that I thought would be fair to recognize and just acknowledge. In terms of the drive-thru in particular, certainly, the streamlined menu boards have made life easier for our customers and made life easier for our managers and crew in the restaurants. So that experience has simplified and helped speed things up. Alongside the greatest barrier to the overall service experience in the drive-thru, we have identified is order accuracy. So the teams, the operational teams, have been working really hard on initiative -- again, I won't go into detail. We call it Ask, Ask, Tell. It's just the way that we -- the ordering experience of the customer where we can just confirm twice over that we captured the order right and that we're presenting exactly the right order to the customers before they drive off. And we're finding that has noticeably improved order accuracy which in turn improves speed and, clearly, customer satisfaction. So we got plenty more to do. We will be working through and continue to challenge the menu and if there's further simplification areas there, but simplification goes way beyond that. It has been through packaging, through merchandising, through marketing where we can help the restaurant teams by taking workload off of them so that they can focus on the fundamentals of what they want, which is serving customers."

You were just touching on some of that. So if you had any numbers on customer satisfaction today or in future quarters, I think that will be really helpful for people to get their head around, the sustainability of the churn that may be starting with All Day Breakfast trial and bringing back those lapsed users. On the premium platform innovation front, do you feel like you're using this window perhaps being created by All Day Breakfast to give yourself a taste of testing that is greater and in the sense that you're building that pipeline for '17 and beyond? And if so, how is that looking and what's giving you confidence there?"

So in terms of customer satisfaction, obviously, we've got a number of different ways that we can monitor customer satisfaction. And we have 1 or 2 different systems around the world, so it's not a consistent measure as we speak. But we've moved and transitioned to a new customer satisfaction measure here, which we call the voice which is actually -- we're gathering a multiple number of customer feedbacks compared to where we were previously, so I going to explain that very well. We're gathering a lot more consumer feedback than we ever have done is a better way of saying it. Certainly, we're seeing overall satisfaction improving both in drive-thru and in-store. And we're certainly seeing order accuracy in the drive-thru. We're around -- national satisfaction on speed is improving. Our speed times haven't improved as much as satisfaction has done, so we want to work operationally to physically speed-up the service experience. But at the same time, customers are reporting a greater satisfaction with the speed, which is very encouraging. So it means the overall experience is working for them. In terms on the premium side, yes, absolutely. As you gather momentum and you start to get these growth drivers that you can layer upon each other, it means you can raise your head and look a little further out in the way that you plan and develop the business. So on the premium side, and by the way, each market doesn't have to work in isolation. So we have a number of initiatives around the world, whether it's Create Your Taste in Australia, a new premium range of signature burgers in the U.K., a similar version of that within France, for example. And we have these sophisticated, well-executed rollouts across those markets, all of which is helping to inform us of where we head with Experience of the Future. What we do know is customization is important. We don't know quite how much customization customers truly wish. They like a little bit of flexibility, but they don't want you to overcomplicate it. So we're working on that, for example. We're working on the manner in which customers can order those premium burgers away from the traditional just through the drive-thru or at the front counter, and that's where self-order kiosks and potentially in-table service comes into play. But again, we're getting a really good read on progress in some of our other mature and lead markets. And that's certainly helping shape and inform the thinking here in the U.S. So more to come. Are we using the time to work on developing that platform? Absolutely, yes, we are."

So at the moment, the initial momentum we're seeing typically around the world is coming from QSR. Some of that is recovering share we've lost as well, so that's certainly heartening for us. I would say, potentially, one slight difference from that is around All Day Breakfast, which -- where we are capturing customers with really what is a different occasion now. So -- and that is new to us at McDonald's. I think the customers -- where the incremental business and incremental visits we're getting are probably from the broader IEO segment. But typically, our focus on the -- this initial state of the turnaround is around winning near-in market share and recovering what we've lost and getting into a period of outperformance."

And then just to clarify. In the SG&A, if you take it down 1% to 2% from '15 levels, it's not going to match the $150 million in your savings, it's more like $50 million.

And that is we look at a whole bunch of factors to influence our pricing. That includes food inflation, GDP growth, our internal cost inflation, et cetera, similar to how the U.S. would do it. So for 2015, we said that the U.S. increased their prices a little over 2% compared to food-away-from-home inflation of around 2.5% and that for 2016, food-away-from-home inflation is expected to be 2.5% to 3.5%. So we would continue to think about pricing in a similar way as we've been and keep an eye on that food-away-from-home inflation as well as food-at-home inflation, just to make sure that we're not getting out of whack with that. Related to the G&A, the way we look at it is we saved, I'll say, a little more than half of that $150 million dollars in 2015, which means that we go into 2016 with our base or run rate of those savings built in. We'll look at 2016 similarly. So while we may not get all of those actual savings realized in 2016, we'll have it out of our base by the end of 2016 so that as we go into 2017, we're going in with a base that's $150 million less than where we started at the $2.6 billion. And that's a net number. So that includes the Olympics convention, all the additional costs in there also."

Okay, okay, someone has explained it here, right. So 2 parts to that question. So there are a number of metrics that we will follow through and we follow closely on a weekly basis, daily and weekly basis on the app. One is, clearly, the downloads, then you want the registration numbers, and then you want to see the activity. So we have 7 million downloads, which gives people access to things like restaurant locator, nutritional information and the rest. As they start to share their information and get confident with us, clearly then they will start to register and we can then communicate -- if they notify us of their local restaurant or their preferred restaurant, then we can start to localize the offers to them and then we start to see the behavior. We're seeing higher registration rates than industry norm from those downloads, and we're also then tracking effectively frequency of usage. And we're trying to encourage that with things like loyalty play, such as buy any 5 McCaf√©s of any size and you get 1 free. So it's a fairly basic loyalty play just to get you all familiar with using it and actively using it and they're keeping it on their phones, basically. The reason we have built -- a sales built into '16 is because we have seen the incremental business. We've seen the incremental average check of redemptions. So when people redeem an offer, we're actually seeing higher average check than we had expected to see. So we can see it as an incremental business driver. Plus, we got other initiatives that will both scale the number of customers and usage but also enhance the overall experience as well, which will encourage people to return to the app more often and clearly, hopefully return to McDonald's more often. So we have it really -- we have it week-by-week and month-by-month as a build, and we'll be able to clearly update ourselves on whether we're hitting those projections. But it will be a helpful contributor to sales in '16 and will help guide us around the world beyond that to actually derive that return on the investment we're making in this digital strategy as a whole."

And then the All Day Breakfast is a further growth opportunity, which we're going to continue to work hard through '16. Getting the value platform right will be important to us. That's why we're taking a very serious look at it and learning from it before we then go into a national and permanent launch phase, but we feel good about where we're at, at the moment. You can expect to see us also focus more on our core menu. We're very proud of the menu, and we believe there is -- these are iconic and real popular assets that we believe that we can probably do a better job with and bring to life and we'll continue to invest in the ingredients and the food quality and create some fun around that. You can expect to see that. To create fun around the brand, you will also expect us to return to 1 or 2 of the promotional mechanics we have. We've got opportunities throughout the year to just bring in some variety and some fun around promotional activity, shorter-term promotional activity just to help provide that balance across the menu. So I think -- and then with the digital platform layering on top of that, we believe we're building these -- building a platform that will continue to grow through '16, but will also take us into '17 and beyond. As we develop and better articulate here in the U.S. our Experience of the Future, that is something we know the system is excited about. We know it's creating a lot of energy and momentum elsewhere around the world, and getting that right and the business model right and actually getting the right elements of that for the customer here in the U.S. is going to be important to us. And we're excited about what we're going to learn in '16 because we believe that's going to contribute to '17 and beyond. In terms of the long-term strategy, I guess what we would want to see is we've had 2 quarters of growth in this turnaround. So we would certainly be looking to see another quarter or 2 before we ourselves start to move from the turnaround plan into a longer-term growth plan. What I can tell you is that we have a small and senior team looking at developing what that growth plan looks like, the elements of it, the brand positioning of it and the vision behind it. But it's a small team that's working discreetly on it because at the moment, the entire organization globally is focused on the turnaround. So whether it's later in the second quarter or sometime into the third quarter, I would say by around the middle of the year, when we get confident that it's the right time to transition from turnaround into growth, we'll share that internally and soon after, externally."

But I also want to be pragmatic. In France, in the moment, for example, it's tough. IEO has decreased for 5 years in a row. So if you're going to grow the business, you really have to take a significant amount of share in a declining market for that to translate into a top line growth. And to do that, you don't want to throw yourself out of your longer-term strategy and the brand building they've done. So I think there are some realities that it's right for us just to be a little cautious about. But if I take a look at the collective across the U.S., across the lead markets and the high-growth markets, we are building plans, and certainly, on a consolidated basis, with an expectation of growing. But as you all know from the markets, even the start of this year, volatility just creates a scrappier environment and a little bit of nervousness, whether it's across investor community and sometimes in certain markets across customers. So we need to be mindful and sensitive to that. China is a good example where that kind of volatility in the marketplace just create a little bit of anxiety. But that's why we want to reinforce our confidence in that market in growing our core business as well as incremental units and new store growth. So we're mindful, we stay close, but we remain quietly confident."

We've began 2016 in a manner consistent with how we ended 2015, as a more focused, aligned system with positive momentum in every business segments. I'm pleased to report that this momentum continued through first quarter 2016 with meaningful gains in both top and bottom line performance. 
Global comparable sales increased 6.2% and earnings per share grew 26% in constant currencies, excluding the impact of the comparison against prior year strategic charges. The momentum we are experiencing is broad-based. All business segments are contributing to our growth. The actions we are taking are driving multiple change for our customers and giving them more reasons to visit McDonald's. This is reflected, not only in our financial performance, but also in the recent market share growth we're seeing across most of our major markets. 
Most of our first quarter comparable sales performance benefited from tailwinds that will not necessarily recur in future quarters, such as leap day, strong sales recovery in Japan and milder weather across the winter. Our underlying operating performance is solid and consistent with our expectations when we developed our 2016 plans. This success is driven in large part by our singular focus on executing the turnaround plan. Grounded bulk at the heart of everything we do, we're committed to running great restaurants and elevating all aspects of the McDonald's experience. 
Our biannual convention last week came at an opportune time. Nearly 14,000 Owner/Operators, suppliers and employees around the world gathered to galvanize around our biggest business opportunities: Our food, our people, the customer experience and our brand. It was energizing to see everyone motivated to adds and united around the opportunities we are seizing, as we strive to be recognize as a model progressive burger company by our customers. 
When we aligned behind fewer, bigger priorities, we activate our size and scale of opportunities like no other company in our industry. Let's turn now to segment performance and the specific initiatives underway across our major markets. 
Beginning with the U.S. Comparable sales for the quarter increased 5.4%. All Day Breakfast continues to provide customers with new reasons to visit McDonald's to enjoy their favorite breakfast food and beverages in the morning and lunch and throughout the day. In addition, All Day Breakfast feels a price gap on the menu, and customers responding by trading up or adding All Day Breakfast items to their orders. Whilst we're no longer in the launch phase, this platform remains a significant contributor to top line results, and we're already looking at ways to extend it in the future in response to customer's feedback. 
U.S. is also taking steps to fortify its appeal to value conscious customers. The no 2 platform provides customers with more choices at compelling price points and it gives us at the flexibility of both national and local levels. We tested 2 versions of the platform in the first quarter 2 for $2 in January and McPick 2 for $2 or $5 in March. The offerings were designed to target different customers, and both resonated move well.
Beyond All Day Breakfast and value, we're pursuing additional opportunity with fewer momentum. This includes further enhancements of our core menu items to improve quality perceptions of our food, sustaining our heightened focus on operations especially not drive-thrus to improve accuracy and speed of service, and additional opportunity to simplify our menu and the overall restaurant expense for our customers and crew. 
Customers in the U.S. are noticing a difference. We experienced a 6% improvement in our overall customer satisfaction scores compared to the first quarter of last year, and we are gaining share relative to the QSR sandwich segment with a positive comparable sales GAAP of 140 basis points for the quarter.
Let's turn now to the International Lead segments. First quarter comparable sales grew 5.2% with the top 5 markets delivering positive comparable sales in the quarter, though Germany was relatively flat. The U.K, Australia and Canada continued their strong track record of positive comparable sales performance. In fact, first quarter marked the U.K.'s 40th consecutive quarter of growth. 
These markets share similar characteristics that underlie their success. This included the execution of customer-centric brands spanning multiple initiatives such as menu, value, marketing and promotions; service enhancements as they make meaningful progress towards experience the future; and strong alignment with air franchisees. 
The success we're having is evident, not only in our financial results, but also in the market share gains we're experiencing in these highly competitive markets. Our market leadership teams are engaging more frequent than ever to share ideas, discuss common opportunities and ultimately develop holistic brands to fuel momentum into the future. 
France continues to outperform the branded IEO market despite challenging macroeconomic conditions, including rising unemployment rates and ongoing public safety concerns. Value remains a priority. And the relaunch of the Look First platform in March, combined with additional value options, including new proteins and product lines, help strengthen our value proposition. 
We complemented these efforts to successful limited-time offers at a premium end, including the premium, the new chicken fillet and the new America winter food events to enhance our relevancy and build our customers in this important market. Guest counts remained negative in Germany. In an effort to strengthen our appeal to price conscious consumers, we launched a new pricing structure in February. $5 to offer the right value equation across the entire menu. And their share is always aligned with expectations, they were not sufficient to stem overall guest count declines.
In the high-growth segments, first quarter comparable sales increased 3.6%, as China and Russia continue to recover from prior year challenges. China delivered strong comparable sales growth to 7.2%. The market also made significant gains in market share despite persistently challenging macroeconomic conditions. Performance was driven by successful execution of multiple initiatives including new product like chicken snacks, alongside growth across of the delivery, value and breakfast platforms.
Solid comparable sales performance in Russia reflects ongoing recovery brand trust. However, we expect macroeconomic uncertainties and decreasing consumer pricing power to remain headwinds through the rest of 2016. I'd be remiss if I didn't call out Japan, where comparable sales increased 27% due in part to recovery from the prior year impact of the 2014 supplier issue, the successful marketing promotions, like the name it burger, along with strong market reflects the success the market is having as it execute its revitalization plan and regain brand trust. 
I am pleased with the progress we've made in the 13 months since I became CEO. We are making improvements at our customers in notion to serve hotter, fresher food with improved overall service experience. We're overturning many of our critical markets to growth in terms of sales, guest counts and market share. And we're increasing our profitability, both for the company and our franchisees, who's customer is approaching all-time highs in many of our major markets. 
We've taken bold, decisive actions that are delivering sustainable benefits. Our decision last year to close underperforming restaurants in several market, including China, have directly contributed to improve financial performance. In addition, the improvements we made to our compensation and benefits package for our employees in U.S. company operated restaurants, along with expanding Archways to Opportunity, our program which is now providing tuition assistance to more than 5,000 eligible employees at both company operated and franchised restaurants, have resulted in lower crew turnover and higher customer satisfaction scores.
At the same time, we are applying forensic analytics across our last pics of our business, both from an external and internal viewpoint, to identify and pursue opportunities for longer-term growth. This includes innovation in markets around the world. [indiscernible] with menu, we're innovating to address customer changing demands at every price tier. This includes work being done at the premium end of the menu, such as of the new signature collection, which was piloted in the U.K. in the first quarter; as well as enhancements to our value offer, like the new McPick 2 platform in the U.S. 
Also, innovating around service to go. As we roll out self-order kiosks, table service and the mobile app, we're providing customers with more choice of flexibility as we make progress to all McDonald's experience in the future. We're evaluating opportunities to enhance the experience for our restaurant employees, too. For example, the U.S. and the U.K. are working together to develop a new teaching approach for shift managers. This new training module extends beyond call operations education into leadership competencies to help shift managers learn how to coach and motivate crew to deliver a better customer experience. 
As we learn from local market innovations, we are tapping into the power of our new segment operating structure to more quickly share knowledge and scale the most successful ideas across the markets. The rollout of All Day Breakfast in Australia in the first quarter was a testament to our ability to move winning ways quickly between markets. 
We're also continuing to pursue opportunities to grow the business through new restaurant openings. In fact, last month, opened our first restaurant in Kazakhstan, our 120th market. We received an overwhelming amount of enthusiasm supporting the local community. At the end of the first that, we sold over 2,000 Big Mac. I'm confident the actions we are taking, our turnaround plan is working. And for this reason, the plan remain operating work for at least 2 more quarters. Later this year, we will evolve to a longer-term strategic plan to further sustain our momentum.
In closing, I'm encouraged with the progress we have made and energized by the opportunities ahead. Across our entire system, we are more in line than ever on running great restaurants each and every day while providing our customers with what's most important to them, all fresh food, friendly service and a contemporary restaurant experience at the value of McDonald's. The actions we've taken are working. Customers are noticing a difference and are choosing McDonald's more often. 
As we look to the future, we will continue to execute against our turnaround plan in the near term while we begin to layer foundation for generating sustainable, profitable growth over the long term. 
Thanks, everyone. And now I'll turn it over to Kevin."

As Steve mentioned, our business turnaround is taking hold. The positive momentum and solid improvement in our underlying business performance over the last 3 quarters serve as proof points of our progress. Today, I'd l",1280,"Thanks, Steve, and hello, everyone. As Steve mentioned, our business turnaround is taking hold. The positive momentum and solid improvement in our underlying business performance over the last 3 quarters serve as proof points of our progress. Today, I'd like to review the major components of our first quarter operating results, provide a few updates on our outlook for 2016 and discuss recent developments related to our financial strategies. Let's start with a high-level look at first quarter performance.
Results for the quarter benefited from stronger operating performance with global operating income up nearly $400 million or 28%, 33% in constant currencies. The most significant contributions came from sales driven growth in franchise margins led by the U.S. and the International Lead markets and the sales recovery in Japan that Steve mentioned, which contributed to higher other operating income. These items accounted for almost $200 million or about half of our operating income growth for the quarter. The other half of our growth was driven by comparison against the $195 million in strategic charges taken last year related to our restructuring and refranchising initiatives. Growth in global company operated margins also contributed to quarterly results with margins up 110 basis points. The high growth markets, in particular, China, led the margin improvement. 
In the U.S, while company operating margins declined 110 basis points for the quarter, solid comparable sales growth and favorable commodity costs helped offset most of the impact from our prior year decision to increase crew wages and benefits effective July 1, 2015. Second quarter of 2016 will be the last quarter the U.S. company operated margins will be negatively impacted by these wage comparisons. 
Similar to the past 3 quarters, we expect existing labor pressures to negatively impact U.S. company operated margins by 350 to 400 basis points in second quarter. While we're on the topic of company operated margins, I'd like to provide updates on a few of the key margin inputs, including menu pricing and commodity cost. In the U.S, first quarter pricing year-over-year was up over 3% compared with food-away-from-home inflation of around 2.7%. We continue to keep a close eye in food-away-from-home inflation, which is projected to be between 2.5% and 3.5% for the full year. For the international lead segment, while price increases vary by market, year-over-year increases for these markets average 2% to 3%.
From a global pricing standpoint, we're planning for more limited pricing power in those markets that are experiencing low inflation to ensure that we maintain our focus on growing guest counts. Moving to commodity cost. In the U.S., commodity cost were down 3% during the first quarter and are expected to decline 3.5% to 4.5% for the year. 
For the International Lead segment, commodity costs were relatively flat for the quarter and are expected to remain relatively flat for the year. Turning now to foreign currencies. More recently, the U.S. dollar has weakened against most of the world's other major foreign currencies. At current rates, currency translation is expected to be less of a headwind than full year results and is now estimated to negatively impact second quarter by $0.02 to $0.04 and full year by $0.05 to $0.07. 
As always, please take this as directional guidance only because rates will change as we move throughout the year. Next, I'd like to provide updates on our refranchising, cash returned to shareholders and G&A targets. 
Last year, we committed to strategically evaluate the following ownership structures with the goal of becoming around 95% franchised over the long term. In the past 5 quarters, we've refranchised about 700 restaurants, including over 200 in the first quarter this year. The large majority of these were sold through existing conventional franchisees. 
As part of the forensic review of our ownership structures and strategic allocation of resources around the world, during the first quarter, we also initiated new refranchising activities in several markets in Asia and Europe. 
In Asia, we announced plans to further unlock growth potential with emphasis on 3 markets in our High Growth segments: China, Korea and Hong Kong. These markets collectively operate almost 2,900 restaurants, of which about 70% are company owned. Given the relatively higher restaurant expansion and franchising potential in these markets, our intent is to identify strategic partners with skills and expertise that will enhance our competitive advantages and bring additional capital resources to further invest in and grow the business. We remain optimistic about the future of our McDonald's brand in Asia with plan to add at least 1,500 restaurants across China, Hong Kong and Korea over the next 5 years.
In Europe, we are working to identify strategic partner in the Nordic markets, which include about 460 restaurants, the vast majority of which are operated by independent franchisees. We believe opportunities exist in the Nordic region and that a sale to a local partner can result in an optimal structure for both McDonald's and the future success of these markets. 
Due to the unique nature and size of many of these markets and the importance of finding the right partners, it's important to keep in mind that these transactions may take 12 to 18 months to complete. At the end of 2015, we also started to lay groundwork to complete the final year of our 3-year $30 billion cash returned to shareholder target. In February, we initiated a $2.7 billion accelerated share repurchase program in conjunction with this target. This program was a significant component of the $3.7 billion in shares we purchased during the quarter. 
Our ability to pursue a more aggressive share repurchase pace through during the first quarter was supported by the financing completed in December last year. Looking ahead, we expect further debt additions in the coming months as we opportunistically take advantage of favorable interest rates while retaining our strong investment-grade credit rating. From a G&A standpoint, we remain on track to achieve our net annual G&A savings target of $500 million, the vast majority of which is expected to be realized by the end of 2017.
Over the course of the last year, we brought greater discipline and focus to the business, and we've made meaningful and tangible progress against our turnaround plans. Although we have come a long way, there is still a lot of work to be done to achieve the goals that we've established. 
As we move through 2016, we are keenly focused on maintaining the positive momentum we've created. This momentum is a direct result of our renewed focus on our customers and running great restaurants. We will stay the course and complete the critical steps of our turnaround to position the business for success as we chart our strategic long-term path forward. 
We are mindful of both the opportunities and challenges ahead. Overall, we continue to expect variability in quarterly results due to uneven prior year comparisons and some headwinds that exist, including macroeconomic issues in certain key markets. 
In addition, we recognize that opportunities still exist to further strengthen and generate strong guest traffic in some of our key markets around the world. 
In closing, the financial results achieved are a testament to the collective efforts of our franchisees, suppliers and employees to reset our business. We are on our way toward becoming a modern and progressive burger company. Like Steve, I was energized by our worldwide convention last week, as I saw firsthand the tremendous focus, discipline and passion of our unique system. I am confident that we can continue to deliver on the progress that we've already made to enhance long-term shareholder value in 2016 and beyond. 
Thanks. Now I'll turn it over to Chris to begin our Q&A."

I mean, we clearly came out the traps hard with All Day Breakfast. It exceeded our expectations through the launch phase and then continue to more a settled rate. Frankly, it's still exceeding our expectations through the settled stages well. So we're incredibly encouraged. And frankly, maintaining that positive GAAP is important to me. The absolute magnitude quarter-to-quarter I'm less concerned about, as long as were taking share and customers are turning now our doors throughout than others, then I'm confident that we're delivering the right plans. In terms of stickiness, someone give me a great degree of confidence in the way that the U.S. and, the operator of build the plans. It's the successes not being based on tax 6. We're establishing foundations of growth. And if I will just to give you 4 of them currently in play and clearly, we're going to be working on more, the operational improvement. Honestly, I would celebrate that as much as All Day Breakfast. We are focusing on getting the basic driver in the restaurant and have seen a really focus and are delivering well, and customers are telling us that. So I really don't want to -- I can't emphasize enough how important it is to get the nuts and bolts right for the 20-odd million customers every day. 
The investment -- the U.S. team operators and company have made through food and food quality is being recognized by customers. So whether it's an announcement move to K 3X or remove a little antibody with the human health and poultry supply chain, whether it's the attention to detail on the Quarter Pounder beef patty and toasting of buns, the quality -- of the investment in the quality is getting recognized base customers. That's valuable. That's long-term as well. And then you've got All Day Breakfast, which has been clearly a very strong catalyst for momentum, which is wonderful. We're in that situation now where we're challenging ourselves into how much more can we do. Customers are asking us for more. We are looking at that very carefully to see where that platform, but not only sustaining, but actually grow. And then, as we spoke about through this quarter, we have struggled to find the right value platform over the last year or 2. We believe through the McPick 2 platform as a whole, we have the flexibility at both national and local level such that we can offer compelling value at different price points, different times a year and maybe site different parts of the country depending on consumer set and we believe that can be a platform that continue to offer growth opportunity to drive customers in. That's what we got in play now. And clearly, there are other things that we're looking at around new product development and also around investing in our restaurants and what we're calling experience the future. Now I won't carry on because I want to get more some all questions. But the point is I really trying to reiterate our these our platforms of growth, which gives me confidence in the stickiness of our momentum, and we have no plans to [indiscernible] show you."

I mean, part of what we have worked hard across this last year in order to firm up our plans moving forward, some of the big strategic plans, is with our new structure now, we have much better visibility into our top 14, 15 markets. And frankly, there is not a common philosophy of cost on this because every market is in a different position. So if we are to make the strategic chases we have in China and Asia, for example, are up into the Scandinavian markets that's because we have got very frantic, and we think that's in a long-term best interest of the markets, of our long-term growth and that ownership model. Your question more to the U.S. I'm sensing is more in the U.S. really have achieved 5 to 7. We -- the pace -- the philosophy critical to us is never losing that entrepreneurial spirit and the Owner/Operators being engaged in their local communities. Now that can be done at a 50 restaurant level. That can be done on a 5 restaurant levels and that can be done in 1 restaurant level. So to us, the importance is having the right partnership to be operated with the right mindset. Could we see consolidation? We could do a little. Does that give us a stronger operators and a stronger balance sheet and their ability to invest in scale? It could do. Go at the same time, we're also introducing new franchisees of the system because they come in with new ideas and new energy and keep this fresh. We also see it through the nation ratio programs we have where sons or daughters existing franchises want to enter the business, and that brings us new ideas and a fresh energy. So the underlying philosophy remains the same. The execution market-by-market, I believe, we've got much more -- much deeper meaningful folks that than we can address this market to market I think will serve us well into the long-term."

So I guess people who are looking for deal. And that is important. And particularly important in certain times of year. So coming out of the Christmas period and it's been a high spend period, $1 here, $1 there matches to consumers through January in particular, for example. So that deal -- so the value conscious consumer at that particular time at a national level resonated well. If you look at a $2 for $5, for example, it's a different cost structure. You're looking at people who may be going in, maybe there's 2 people going in and they say a constructive meal around that deal until they're getting value that way. So slightly different customer group. It could be the same customer may care for both, but it could be a different group as well. And part of what we're learning is at what level do we want to deploy this? At a national level and use of that national marketing muscle? How much we will alone flexibly at the regional level because we've got these ridge energized reasons 23 of them around the U.S. and they want to bring them to life. But maybe the menu mix in that deal could be different in the Southwest of the country then it'd be the Northeast. And I think that flexibility knowing consumer group know your competitive growth don't want that value price is allows us to unleash some of the power of our regional marketing muscle. So you'll see us dial-up and I'll national and local. But the one thing you will always see that will always be valued at McDonald's."

Nothing structurally has changed in our business to change that on a long-term basis. A little inflation wouldn't inherit from a pricing standpoint.

So part of that has driven by or a lot of that was driven by last year",386,"Yes, thanks, Matt. Regarding the G&A. So let me first talk about first quarter, which was up just compared to last year basically because of higher incentive compensation on last year. So part of that has driven by or a lot of that was driven by last year's lack of incentive comp, if you will, in the first quarter as much as this year's incentive comp that's in there. Looking forward both the 2016 and beyond, a couple of things. We achieved about $75 million of our total savings in 2015 and built within that 1% to 2% guidance is another about $75 million in 2016. Now there are 2 swing factors, if you will, that could impact the actual reported G&A this year. And I'm talking it on a constant currency basis. So obviously, currency also impacts it. But when we think about the targets, we exclude currency. So the actual numbers you'll see reported may be different because of currency impact. But ignoring that, the other 2 swing factors, if you will, are 1 incentive comp, where if you think about 2014, we had very little, if you will, incentive comp as a company. 2015, we got back to a more normal. So you can get a big swing from 1 year to the next on incentive comp. But all of that is driven by business performance. So we'll only have the incentive comp, obviously, if we're driving business performance. But that could swing things, plus or minus, that 1 to 2, down 1 to 2 guidance. The other swing is the timing of some of these large refranchising transactions. When we do our plans at the beginning of the year, we're effectively estimating when those will occur and they become very complex as we get into these transactions. And so to exactly pinpoint the timing of when those occur becomes really difficult. So it's possible that something that we made thought was going to happen at the end of 2016 could potentially slip through the beginning of 2017. And that may impact the timing of some of our G&A savings. But other than that, we're on track for the 500. We're still completely confident in the 500 by the end of '17. And if it just a timing issue between 2016 and '17."

So in terms of anything on the negative side, it was difficult to find much last week, to be honest. And that's not always been the case.

We began 2016 in a manner consistent with how we ended 2015, as a more focused, aligned system with positive momentum in every business segment. I'm pleased to report that this momentum continued through first quarter 2016, with meaningful gains in both top and bottom line performance. 
Global comparable sales increased 6.2% and earnings per share grew 26% in constant currencies, excluding the impact of the comparison against prior year strategic charges. The momentum we are experiencing is broad-based. All business segments are contributing to our growth. The actions we are taking are driving noticeable change for our customers and giving them more reasons to visit McDonald's. This is reflected not only in our financial performance, but also in the recent market share growth we're seeing across most of our major markets. 
Also, our first quarter comparable sales performance benefited from tailwinds that will not necessarily recur in future quarters, such as leap day, strong sales recovery in Japan and milder weather across the winter. Our underlying operating performance is solid and consistent with our expectations when we developed our 2016 plans. This success is driven in large part by our singular focus on executing the turnaround plan, grounded in putting customers back at the heart of everything we do, we're committed to running great restaurants and elevating all aspects of the McDonald's experience. 
Our biannual convention last week came at an opportune time. Nearly 14,000 owner/operators, suppliers and employees around the world gathered to galvanize around our biggest business opportunities: Our food, our people, the customer experience and our brand. It was energizing to see everyone motivated to act and united around the opportunities we are seizing, as we strive to be recognized as a modern progressive burger company by our customers. 
When we align behind fewer, bigger priorities, we activate our size and scale advantages like no other company in our industry. 
Let's turn now to segment performance and the specific initiatives underway across our major markets. 
Beginning with the U.S., comparable sales for the quarter increased 5.4%. All Day Breakfast continues to provide customers with new reasons to visit McDonald's to enjoy their favorite breakfast food and beverages in the morning and lunch and throughout the day. In addition, All Day Breakfast fills a price gap on the menu, and customers responding by trading up or adding All Day Breakfast items to their orders. Whilst we're no longer in the launch phase, this platform remains a significant contributor to top line results, and we're already looking at ways to extend it in the future in response to customers' feedback. 
U.S. is also taking steps to fortify its appeal to value-conscious customers. The McPick 2 platform provides customers with more choices at compelling price points and it gives us added flexibility at both national and local levels. We tested 2 versions of the platform in the first quarter, McPick 2 for $2 in January, and McPick 2 for $5 in March. The offerings were designed to target different customers, and both resonated well.
Beyond All Day Breakfast and value, we're pursuing additional opportunities for pure momentum. This includes further enhancements of our core menu items to improve quality perceptions of our food, sustaining our heightened focus on operations, especially in our drive-thrus to improve accuracy and speed of service, and additional opportunity to simplify our menu and the overall restaurant experience for our customers and crew. 
Customers in the U.S. are noticing a difference. We experienced a 6% improvement in our overall customer satisfaction scores compared to the first quarter of last year, and we are gaining share relative to the QSR sandwich segment with a positive comparable sales GAAP of 140 basis points for the quarter.
Let's turn now to the International Lead segment. First quarter comparable sales grew 5.2%, with the top 5 markets delivering positive comparable sales for the quarter, though Germany was relatively flat. The U.K., Australia and Canada continued their strong track records of positive comparable sales performance. In fact, first quarter marked the U.K.'s 40th consecutive quarter of growth. 
These markets share similar characteristics that underlie their success. This include the execution of customer-centric plans spanning multiple initiatives such as menu, value, marketing and promotions, service enhancements as they make meaningful progress towards experience the future, and strong alignment with their franchisees. 
The success we're having is evident not only in our financial results, but also in the market share gains we're experiencing in these highly competitive markets. Our market leadership teams are engaging more frequently than ever to share ideas, discuss common opportunities and ultimately develop holistic brands to fuel momentum into the future. 
France continues to outperform the branded IEO market, despite challenging macroeconomic conditions, including rising unemployment rates and ongoing public safety concerns. Value remains a priority. And the relaunch of the Look First platform in March, combined with additional value options, including new proteins and product lines, help strengthen our value proposition. 
We complemented these efforts with successful limited-time offers at the premium end, including the brand Premium with a new chicken fillet, and the new America winter food events to enhance our relevancy and appeal to customers in this important market. 
Guest counts remained negative in Germany. In an effort to strengthen our appeal to price-conscious consumers, we launched a new pricing structure in February. our goal is to offer the right value equation across the entire menu. And this sure, as always, were in line with expectations, but it was not sufficient to stem overall guest count declines.
In the High Growth segment, first quarter comparable sales increased 3.6%, as China and Russia continue to recover from prior year challenges. China delivered strong comparable sales growth to 7.2%. The market also made significant gains in market share, despite persistently challenging macroeconomic conditions. Performance was driven by successful execution of multiple initiatives, including new product like chicken snacks, alongside growth across the delivery, value and breakfast platforms.
Solid comparable sales performance in Russia reflects ongoing recovery of brand trust. However, we expect macroeconomic uncertainties and decreasing consumer purchasing power to remain headwinds through the rest of 2016. Now I'd be remiss if I didn't call out Japan, where comparable sales increased 27%, due in part to recovery from the prior year impact of the 2014 supplier issue, the successful marketing promotions, like the name it burger, along with strong value offers reflect the success the market is having as it executes its revitalization plan and regains brand trust. 
I am pleased with the progress we've made in the 13 months since I became CEO. We are making improvements, that our customers are noticing, to serve hotter, fresher food with improved overall service experience. We're overturning many of our critical markets to growth in terms of sales, guest counts and market share. And we're increasing profitability, both for the company and our franchisees, whose cash flow is approaching all-time highs in many of our major markets. 
We've taken bold, decisive actions that are delivering sustainable benefits. Our decision last year to close underperforming restaurants in several market, including China, have directly contributed to improve financial performance. In addition, the improvements we made to our compensation and benefits package for our employees in U.S. company-operated restaurants, along with expanding Archways to Opportunity, our program which is now providing tuition assistance to more than 5,000 eligible employees at both company-operated and franchised restaurants, have resulted in lower crew turnover and higher customer satisfaction scores.
At the same time, we are applying forensic analytics across all aspects of our business, both from an external and internal viewpoint, to identify and pursue opportunities for longer-term growth. This includes innovation in markets around the world. For example, with menu, we're innovating to address customers' changing demands at every price tier. This includes work being done at the premium end of the menu, such as the new Signature Collection, which was piloted in the U.K. in the first quarter, as well as enhancements to our value offer, like the new McPick 2 platform in the U.S. Also, innovating around service. As we roll out self-order kiosks, table service and the mobile app, we're providing customers with more choice of flexibility as we make progress toward McDonald's experience in the future. 
We're evaluating opportunities to enhance the experience for restaurant employees, too. For example, the U.S. and the U.K. are working together to develop a new teaching approach for shift managers. This new training module extends beyond core operations education into leadership competencies to help shift managers learn how to coach and motivate crew to deliver a better customer experience. 
As we learn from local market innovations, we are tapping into the power of our new segment operating structure to more quickly share knowledge and scale the most successful ideas across markets. The rollout of All Day Breakfast in Australia in the first quarter was a testament to our ability to move winning plays quickly between markets. 
We're also continuing to pursue opportunities to grow the business through new restaurant openings. In fact, last month, we opened our first restaurant in Kazakhstan, our 120th market. We received an overwhelming amount of enthusiasm and support from the local community. At the end of the first day, we had sold over 2,000 Big Macs. 
I'm confident in the actions we are taking, our turnaround plan is working. And for this reason, the plan were we'll remain operating work for at least 2 more quarters. Later this year, we will evolve to a longer-term strategic plan to further sustain our momentum.
In closing, I'm encouraged by the progress we have made and energized by the opportunities ahead. Across our entire system, we are more in line than ever, running great restaurants each and every day while providing our customers with what's most important to them, all fresh food, fast, friendly service and a contemporary restaurant experience at the value of McDonald's. The actions we've taken are working. Customers are noticing a difference and are choosing McDonald's more often. 
As we look to the future, we will continue to execute against our turnaround plan in the near term while we begin to layer a foundation for generating sustainable, profitable growth over the long term. 
Thanks, everyone. And now, I'll turn it over to Kevin."

As Steve mentioned, our business turnaround is taking hold. The positive momentum and solid improvement in our underlying business performance over the last 3 quarters serve as proof points of our progress. Today, I'd l",1268,"Thanks, Steve, and hello, everyone. As Steve mentioned, our business turnaround is taking hold. The positive momentum and solid improvement in our underlying business performance over the last 3 quarters serve as proof points of our progress. Today, I'd like to review the major components of our first quarter operating results, provide a few updates on our outlook for 2016 and discuss recent developments related to our financial strategies. Let's start with a high-level look at first quarter performance.
Results for the quarter benefited from stronger operating performance with global operating income up nearly $400 million or 28%, 33% in constant currencies. The most significant contributions came from sales-driven growth in franchise margins led by the U.S. and the International Lead markets and the sales recovery in Japan that Steve mentioned, which contributed to higher other operating income. These items accounted for almost $200 million or about half of our operating income growth for the quarter. The other half of our growth was driven by comparison against $195 million in strategic charges taken last year related to our restructuring and refranchising initiatives. Growth in global company-operated margins also contributed to quarterly results with margins up 110 basis points. The high growth markets, in particular, China, led the margin improvement. 
In the U.S., While company-operated margins declined 110 basis points for the quarter, solid comparable sales growth and favorable commodity costs helped offset most of the impact from our prior year decision to increase crew wages and benefits effective July 1, 2015. Second quarter of 2016 will be the last quarter the U.S. company-operated margins will be negatively impacted by these wage comparisons. 
Similar to the past 3 quarters, we expect existing labor pressures to negatively impact U.S. company-operated margins by 350 to 400 basis points in second quarter. While we're on the topic of company-operated margins, I'd like to provide updates on a few of the key margin inputs, including menu pricing and commodity cost. In the U.S., first quarter pricing year-over-year was up over 3% compared with food-away-from-home inflation of around 2.7%. We continue to keep a close eye in food-away-from-home inflation, which is projected to be between 2.5% and 3.5% for the full year. For the International Lead segment, while price increases vary by market, year-over-year increases for these markets averaged 2% to 3%.
From a global pricing standpoint, we're planning for a more limited pricing power in those markets that are experiencing low inflation to ensure that we maintain our focus on growing guest counts. Moving to commodity cost. In the U.S., commodity cost were down 3% during the first quarter and are expected to decline 3.5% to 4.5% for the year. 
For the International Lead segment, commodity costs were relatively flat for the quarter and are expected to remain relatively flat for the year. Turning now to foreign currencies. More recently, the U.S. dollar has weakened against most of the world's other major foreign currencies. At current rates, currency translation is expected to be less of a headwind on full year results and is now estimated to negatively impact second quarter by $0.02 to $0.04 and full year by $0.05 to $0.07. 
As always, please take this as directional guidance only because rates will change as we move throughout the year. 
Next, I'd like to provide updates on our refranchising, cash returned to shareholders and G&A targets. 
Last year, we committed to strategically evaluating ownership structures, with the goal of becoming around 95% franchised over the long term. In the past 5 quarters, we've refranchised about 700 restaurants, including over 200 in the first quarter this year. The large majority of these were sold to existing conventional franchisees. 
As part of the forensic review of our ownership structures and strategic allocation of resources around the world, during the first quarter, we also initiated new refranchising activities in several markets in Asia and Europe. 
In Asia, we announced plans to further unlock growth potential, with emphasis on 3 markets in our High Growth segments: China, Korea and Hong Kong. These markets collectively operate almost 2,900 restaurants, of which about 70% are company-owned. Given the relatively higher restaurant expansion and franchising potential in these markets, our intent is to identify strategic partners with skills and expertise that will enhance our competitive advantages and bring additional capital resources to further invest in and grow the business. We remain optimistic about the future of our McDonald's brand in Asia, with plans to add at least 1,500 restaurants across China, Hong Kong and Korea over the next 5 years.
In Europe, we're working to identify a strategic partner in the Nordic markets, which include about 460 restaurants, the vast majority of which are operated by independent franchisees. We believe opportunities exist in the Nordic region and that a sale to a local partner can result in an optimal structure for both McDonald's and the future success of these markets. 
Due to the unique nature and size of many of these markets and the importance of finding the right partners, it's important to keep in mind that these transactions may take 12 to 18 months to complete. At the end of 2015, we also started to lay groundwork to complete the final year of our 3-year $30 billion cash returned to shareholders target. In February, we initiated a $2.7 billion accelerated share repurchase program in conjunction with this target. This program was a significant component of the $3.7 billion in shares repurchased during the quarter. 
Our ability to pursue a more aggressive share repurchase pace during the first quarter was supported by the financing completed in December last year. Looking ahead, we expect further debt additions in the coming months as we opportunistically take advantage of favorable interest rates while maintaining our strong investment-grade credit rating. From a G&A standpoint, we remain on track to achieve our net annual G&A savings target of $500 million, the vast majority of which is expected to be realized by the end of 2017.
Over the course of the last year, we brought greater discipline and focus to the business, and we've made meaningful and tangible progress against our turnaround plans. Although we have come a long way, there is still a lot of work to be done to achieve the goals that we've established. 
As we move through 2016, we are keenly focused on maintaining the positive momentum we've created. This momentum is a direct result of our renewed focus on our customers and running great restaurants. We will stay the course and complete the critical steps of our turnaround to position the business for success as we chart our strategic long-term path forward. 
We are mindful of both the opportunities and challenges ahead. Overall, we continue to expect variability in quarterly results due to uneven prior year comparisons and some headwinds that exist, including macroeconomic issues in certain key markets. 
In addition, we recognize that opportunities still exist to further strengthen and generate strong guest traffic in some of our key markets around the world. 
In closing, the financial results achieved are a testament of the collective efforts of our franchisees, suppliers and employees to reset our business. We are on our way toward becoming a modern and progressive burger company. Like Steve, I was energized by our worldwide convention last week, as I saw firsthand the tremendous focus, discipline and passion of our unique system.

And it's still an amazing trend. But is the difference between the 2 quarters just really the fact that you got a bit more initial strength that came with launching All Day Breakfast and now this outperformance gap you're seeing is a little bit more of a reasonable expectation that we should have going forward? And the quick follow-up to that is, as we look past this first quarter and into the future, do you think that the stickiness that comes with regaining momentum with your customer base is enough or do you really feel the need that you had to take on much more dramatic operational risk like the All Day Breakfast that can pay off pretty big going forward?"

I mean, we clearly came out the traps hard with All Day Breakfast. It exceeded our expectations during the launch phase and then continue to a more settled rate. Frankly, it's still exceeding our expectations through that -- through settled stage as well. So we're incredibly encouraged. Frankly, maintaining that positive gap is important to me. The absolute magnitude quarter-to-quarter, I'm less concerned about, as long as we're taking share and customers are turning in our doors rather than others, then I'm confident that we're delivering the right plans. In terms of stickiness, it gives me a great degree of confidence in the way that the U.S. team, the operator leadership and our own leadership team have built the plans is the success is not being based on taxes. We're establishing foundations of growth. And if I -- well, just to give you, 4 of them currently in play, and clearly, we're going to be working on more. The operational improvement, honestly, I would celebrate that as much as All Day Breakfast. We are focusing on getting the basic driver in the restaurant and the team are really focused and they're delivering well, and customers are telling us that. So I really don't want to -- I can't emphasize enough how important it is to get the nuts and bolts right for the 20-odd-million customers every day. The investment -- the U.S. team operators and company have made through food and food quality is being recognized by customers. So whether it's an announcement from moving to cage-free eggs or removal of antibodies harmful to human health in the poultry supply chain, whether it's the attention to detail on the Quarter Pounder beef patty and toasting of buns, the quality -- the investment in the quality is getting recognized by our customers. And that's valuable. That's long-term as well. Then, you've got All Day Breakfast, which has been clearly a very strong catalyst for momentum, which is wonderful. We're in that situation now where we're challenging ourselves into how much more can we do. Customers are asking us for more. We are looking at that very carefully to see whether that's a platform, but not only is sustaining, but can actually grow. And then, as we spoke about through this quarter, we have struggled to find the right value platform over the last year or 2. We believe through the McPick 2 platform as a whole, we have the flexibility at both national and local level such that we can offer a compelling value at different price points, different times a year and maybe start different offers in different parts of the country, depending on the consumer set, we believe that could be a platform that continue to offer growth opportunity and drive customers in. That's what we got in play now. And clearly, there are other things that we're looking at around new product development and also around investing in our restaurants and what we're calling the experience of the future. Now I won't carry on because I want to get through some more questions. But the pointers I'm really trying to iterate is these are platforms of growth, which give me confidence in the stickiness of our momentum, and we have no plans to ease out, I can assure you."

I mean, part of what we have worked hard across this last year in order to firm up our plans moving forward, some of the big strategic plans is with our new structure now, we have much better visibility into our top 14, 15 markets. And frankly, there is not a common philosophy across those because every market is in a different position. So if we're to make the strategic choices we have in China and Asia, for example, or up into the Scandinavian markets, that's because we have got very forensic, and we think that's in the long-term best interest of the markets, of our long-term growth and that ownership model. Your question more to the U.S., I'm sensing is more to the U.S. where we have attributed being 5 to 7. We -- the pace -- the philosophy that's critical to us is never losing that entrepreneurial spirit and the Owner/Operators being engaged in their local communities. Now that can be done at a 50 restaurant level. That can be done in a 5 restaurant levels, that can be done in a 1 restaurant level. So to us, the importance is having the right partnership, to be operated with the right mindset. Could we see consolidation? We could do a little. Does that give us fewer, stronger operators and a stronger balance sheets and their ability to invest and scale? It could do. But at the same time, we're also introducing new franchisees to the system because they come in with new ideas and new energy and keep this fresh. We also see it through the next-generation programs we have where sons or daughters of existing franchisees want to enter the business, and that brings us new ideas and a fresh energy. So the underlying philosophy remains the same. The execution market-by-market, I believe, we've got much more -- much deeper, meaningful thought to it that we can address this market by market, I think, it serves us -- it will serve us well into the long-term."

So I guess, people who are looking for a deal. And that is important. And particularly important at certain times of a year. So if you're coming out of the Christmas period and it's been a high spend period, $1 here and $1 there matches to consumers through January in particular, for example. So that deal for the value-conscious consumer at that particular time at a national level resonated well. If you look at a 2 for $5, for example, it's a different cost structure. You're looking at people who may be going in, maybe there's 2 people going in and they self-construct a meal around that deal until they're getting value that way. So slightly different customer group. It could be the same customer may care for both, but it could be a different group as well. And part of what we're learning is at what level do we want to deploy this, at a national level and use that national marketing muscle? And how much we will allow the flexibly at the regional level because we've got these reenergized reasons, 23 of them around the U.S. and they want to bring it to life. But maybe the menu mix in that deal could be different in the Southwest of the country than it would be in the Northeast. And I think that flexibility knowing a consumer group, knowing your competitive growth, knowing what that value price is allows us to unleash some of the power of our regional marketing muscle. So you will see us dial it up and down, national and local. But the one thing you will always see, there will always be valued at McDonald's."

So -- but the first point to check is, is our value platform right. We're working on that, for example, in Germany, I acknowledged that. We haven't quite got it right yet. So we'll continue to firm that up.

So operational improvement in the U.S., I mean, it is so multifaceted that I could take hours, I'd love to because I just love what they're doing. So simply put, we've made the experience easier for customers and easier for crew and easier to get right. So they have a particular focus having identified the core frustration for customers versus accuracy to the drive-thru, which then impacts service times. So they put a number of initiatives in place such as simplified menu boards, new crew training procedures, as we've described, is Ask, Ask, Tell, just another way that we help ensure we get the accuracy right through the whole customer experience, from ordering, through pay, through collect. But we're into the real details. We're into the font size on the printers, the receipts. Actually, it's easier to spot the special request, for example, all the special orders. So I can't even tell you how detailed the team has got to help our restaurant teams get it right more often. And ultimately, the beneficiaries, which is the customer on this, and they are playing it back to all the customer metrics we have, whether it's through mystery shoppers, through our own operational grading standards. We are seeing these effects take place. And honestly, that is the primary driver of customer satisfaction, getting it right, hot, fresh food, friendly service. In terms of high growth, yes, so I tend to call out China and Russia just to -- because the scale and the potential of those markets. But we had great performance out of Netherlands. Great performance out of Hong Kong. Great performance out of Poland. Great performance out of Korea through the quarter, and these aren't one-offs. So I appreciate the question because it gives us a chance to demonstrate how broad the momentum in this business is. And it's not limited just to the high growth markets. I mean, if I just look at Western Europe as a whole, growing strongly. Central Europe, growing strongly. Middle East, strong growth for the Middle East. Latin America, there's turbulence [indiscernible] in that overall strong growth. Asia, Australasia, as well as North America, and calling out Canada, as well as the U.S. So we are seeing a very -- a lot of strong momentum. Is it perfect? No. Are there markets we still have work to do? Absolutely yes, and we're never satisfied. But part of the confidence we have that the turnaround is taking hold is because of the broad-based growth we're experiencing."

As we build out our plans for further sustained growth, clearly, we want to see that trend continue. I'm not sure there's much more to say on that. I mean, it's early stages. But I'll tell you what, we go it back and some. So there is 2-year growth across each of the months across the first quarter, which I feel good about. And that is one of the measures we look at. So we don't -- so the complacency doesn't set in. We have a restless energy here. We just got going. And a lot of the theme around the biannual convention last week was around accelerating with momentum and not just sitting tight with the momentum. So that's how we're galvanizing ourselves, it's how we're challenging ourselves. And these platforms that the U.S. has introduced, I'm confident we'll maintain that stickiness. But we want to layer further platforms on top of that, which is exactly the ingredients of success through that kind of '03, '04 through to 2010, 2011 period, was we were layering platforms of growth on top of each that are complementary and customer-driven. And we have no plans to let up, that's for sure."

Regarding the G&A, so let me first talk about first quarter, which was up just compared to last year basically because of higher incentive compensation than last year. So part of that is driven by -- or a lot of that is driven by last year's lack of incentive comp, if you will, in the first quarter as much as this year's incentive comp that's in there. Looking forward, both to 2016 and beyond, a couple of things, we achieved about $75 million of our total savings in 2015 and built within that 1% to 2% guidance is another about $75 million in 2016. Now there are 2 swing factors, if you will, that could impact the actual reported G&A this year. And I'm talking on a constant currency basis, so obviously, currency also impacts it. But when we think about the targets, we exclude currency. So the actual numbers you'll see reported may be different because of currency impact. But ignoring that, the other 2 swing factors, if you will, are 1, incentive comp, where if you think about 2014, we had very little, if you will, incentive comp as a company. 2015, we got back to a more normal. So you can get a big swing from 1 year to the next on incentive comp, but all of that is driven by business performance. So we'll only have the incentive comp, obviously, if we're driving business performance. But that could swing things, plus or minus, that 1% to 2% -- down 1% to 2% guidance. The other swing is the timing of some of these large refranchising transactions. When we do our plans at the beginning of the year, we're effectively estimating when those will occur and they become very complex as we get into these transactions. And so to exactly pinpoint the timing of when those occur becomes really difficult. So it's possible that something that we may have thought was going to happen at the end of 2016 could potentially slip to the beginning of 2017. And that may impact the timing of some of our G&A savings. But other than that, we're on track for the $500 million. We're still completely confident in the $500 million by the end of '17. And it becomes just a timing issue between 2016 and '17."

But I would say that the conversation around value at a regional level and account level is where to dial up 2 to $5, where to dial up the 2 for $2, what time of year and be complementary with whatever else is going on. So for example, if you can collect the Monopoly tokens on certain items, then reinforcing that further value just drives further trial of the Monopoly promotion for example. So it's complementary.

So there's things we still need to work through and that's why we're having these test markets and test regions to further explore and learn. But at the moment, the enthusiasm is great, and we're just trying to keep people focused in channels and making sure that we are helping them build their businesses for long-term profitably, as well as our own. So in terms of anything on the negative side, it was difficult to find much last week, to be honest. And that's not always been the case. I'm not going to assume it will always be the case in the future.

We began 2016 in a manner consistent with how we ended 2015, as a more focused, aligned system with positive momentum in every business segment. I'm pleased to report that this momentum continued through first quarter 2016, with meaningful gains in both top and bottom line performance. 
Global comparable sales increased 6.2% and earnings per share grew 26% in constant currencies, excluding the impact of the comparison against prior year strategic charges. The momentum we are experiencing is broad-based. All business segments are contributing to our growth. The actions we are taking are driving noticeable change for our customers and giving them more reasons to visit McDonald's. This is reflected not only in our financial performance, but also in the recent market share growth we're seeing across most of our major markets. 
First, our first quarter comparable sales performance benefited from tailwinds that will not necessarily recur in future quarters, such as leap day, strong sales recovery in Japan and milder weather across the winter. Our underlying operating performance is solid and consistent with our expectations when we developed our 2016 plans. This success is driven in large part by our singular focus on executing the turnaround plan, grounded in putting customers back at the heart of everything we do, we're committed to running great restaurants and elevating all aspects of the McDonald's experience. 
Our biennial convention last week came at an opportune time. Nearly 14,000 owner/operators, suppliers and employees from around the world gathered to galvanize around our biggest business opportunities: Our food, our people, the customer experience and our brand. It was energizing to see everyone motivated to act and united around the opportunities we are seizing, as we strive to be recognized as a modern progressive burger company by our customers. 
When we align behind fewer, bigger priorities, we activate our size and scale advantages like no other company in our industry. 
Let's turn now to segment performance and the specific initiatives underway across our major markets. 
Beginning with the U.S., comparable sales for the quarter increased 5.4%. All Day Breakfast continues to provide customers with new reasons to visit McDonald's to enjoy their favorite breakfast food and beverages in the morning and lunch and throughout the day. In addition, All Day Breakfast fills a price gap on the menu, and customers responding by trading up or adding All Day Breakfast items to their orders. Whilst we're no longer in the launch phase, this platform remains a significant contributor to top line results, and we're already looking at ways to extend it in the future in response to customers' feedback. 
U.S. is also taking steps to fortify its appeal to value-conscious customers. The McPick 2 platform provides customers with more choices at compelling price points and it gives us added flexibility at both national and local levels. We tested 2 versions of the platform in the first quarter, McPick 2 for $2 in January, and McPick 2 for $5 in March. The offerings were designed to target different customers, and both resonated well.
Beyond All Day Breakfast and value, we are pursuing additional opportunities for pure momentum. This includes further enhancements of our core menu items to improve quality perceptions of our food, sustaining our heightened focus on operations, especially in our drive-thrus to improve accuracy and speed of service, and additional opportunity to simplify our menu and the overall restaurant experience for our customers and crew. 
Customers in the U.S. are noticing a difference. We experienced a 6% improvement in our overall customer satisfaction scores compared to the first quarter of last year, and we are gaining share relative to the QSR sandwich segment with a positive comparable sales gap of 140 basis points for the quarter.
Let's turn now to the International Lead segment. First quarter comparable sales grew 5.2%, with the top 5 markets delivering positive comparable sales for the quarter, though Germany was relatively flat. The U.K., Australia and Canada continued their strong track records of positive comparable sales performance. In fact, first quarter marked the U.K.'s 40th consecutive quarter of growth. 
These markets share similar characteristics that underlie their success. This include the execution of customer-centric plans spanning multiple initiatives such as menu, value, marketing and promotions, service enhancements as they make meaningful progress towards experience the future, and strong alignment with their franchisees. 
The success we're having is evident not only in our financial results, but also in the market share gains we're experiencing in these highly competitive markets. Our market leadership teams are engaging more frequently than ever to share ideas, discuss common opportunities and ultimately develop holistic brands to fuel momentum into the future. 
France continues to outperform the branded IEO market, despite challenging macroeconomic conditions, including rising unemployment rates and ongoing public safety concerns. Value remains a priority. And the relaunch of the Look First platform in March, combined with additional value options, including new proteins and product lines, help strengthen our value proposition. 
We complemented these efforts with successful limited-time offers at the premium end, including Le Grand Premium with a new chicken fillet, and the new America winter food events to enhance our relevancy and appeal to customers in this important market. 
Guest counts remained negative in Germany. In an effort to strengthen our appeal to price-conscious consumers, we launched a new pricing structure in February. Our goal is to offer the right value equation across the entire menu. And this sure, as always, were in line with expectations, but it was not sufficient to stem overall guest count declines.
In the High Growth segment, first quarter comparable sales increased 3.6%, as China and Russia continue to recover from prior year challenges. China delivered strong comparable sales growth of 7.2%. The market also made significant gains in market share, despite persistently challenging macroeconomic conditions. Performance was driven by successful execution of multiple initiatives, including new product like chicken snacks, alongside growth across the delivery, value and breakfast platforms.
Solid comparable sales performance in Russia reflects ongoing recovery of brand trust. However, we expect macroeconomic uncertainties and decreasing consumer purchasing power to remain headwinds through the rest of 2016. Now I'd be remiss if I didn't call out Japan, where comparable sales increased 27%, due in part to recovery from the prior year impact of the 2014 supplier issue, the successful marketing promotions, like the name it burger, along with strong value offers reflect the success the market is having as it executes its revitalization plan and regains brand trust. 
I am pleased with the progress we've made in the 13 months since I became CEO. We are making improvements that our customers are noticing to serve hotter, fresher food with improved overall service experience. We are returning many of our critical markets to growth in terms of sales, guest counts and market share. And we're increasing profitability, both for the company and our franchisees, whose cash flow is approaching all-time highs in many of our major markets. 
We've taken bold, decisive actions that are delivering sustainable benefits. Our decision last year to close underperforming restaurants in several market, including China, have directly contributed to improve financial performance. In addition, the improvements we made to our compensation and benefits package for our employees in U.S. company-operated restaurants, along with expanding Archways to Opportunity, our program which is now providing tuition assistance to more than 5,000 eligible employees at both company-operated and franchised restaurants, have resulted in lower crew turnover and higher customer satisfaction scores.
At the same time, we are applying forensic analytics across all aspects of our business, both from an external and internal viewpoint, to identify and pursue opportunities for longer-term growth. This includes innovation in markets around the world. For example, with menu, we're innovating to address customers' changing demands at every price tier. This includes work being done at the premium end of the menu, such as the new Signature Collection, which was piloted in the U.K. in the first quarter, as well as enhancements to our value offer, like the new McPick 2 platform in the U.S. Also, innovating around service. As we roll out self-order kiosks, table service and the mobile app, we're providing customers with more choice of flexibility as we make progress toward McDonald's experience in the future. 
We're evaluating opportunities to enhance the experience for restaurant employees, too. For example, the U.S. and the U.K. are working together to develop a new teaching approach for shift managers. This new training module extends beyond core operations education into leadership competencies to help shift managers learn how to coach and motivate crew to deliver a better customer experience. 
As we learn from local market innovations, we are tapping into the power of our new segment operating structure to more quickly share knowledge and scale the most successful ideas across markets. The rollout of All Day Breakfast in Australia in the first quarter was a testament to our ability to move winning plays quickly between markets. 
We're also continuing to pursue opportunities to grow the business through new restaurant openings. In fact, last month, we opened our first restaurant in Kazakhstan, our 120th market. We received an overwhelming amount of enthusiasm and support from the local community. At the end of the first day, we had sold over 2,000 Big Macs. 
I'm confident in the actions we are taking, our turnaround plan is working. And for this reason, the plan were we'll remain operating work for at least 2 more quarters. Later this year, we will evolve to a longer-term strategic plan to further sustain our momentum.
In closing, I'm encouraged by the progress we have made and energized by the opportunities ahead. Across our entire system, we are more in line than ever, running great restaurants each and every day while providing our customers with what's most important to them, all fresh food, fast, friendly service and a contemporary restaurant experience at the value of McDonald's. The actions we've taken are working. Customers are noticing a difference and are choosing McDonald's more often. 
As we look to the future, we will continue to execute against our turnaround plan in the near term while we begin to lay a foundation for generating sustainable, profitable growth over the long term. 
Thanks, everyone. And now, I'll turn it over to Kevin."

As Steve mentioned, our business turnaround is taking hold. The positive momentum and solid improvement in our underlying business performance over the last 3 quarters serve as proof points of our progress. Today, I'd l",1267,"Thanks, Steve, and hello, everyone. As Steve mentioned, our business turnaround is taking hold. The positive momentum and solid improvement in our underlying business performance over the last 3 quarters serve as proof points of our progress. Today, I'd like to review the major components of our first quarter operating results, provide a few updates on our outlook for 2016 and discuss recent developments related to our financial strategies. Let's start with a high-level look at first quarter performance.
Results for the quarter benefited from stronger operating performance with global operating income up nearly $400 million or 28%, 33% in constant currencies. The most significant contributions came from sales-driven growth in franchise margins led by the U.S. and the International Lead markets and the sales recovery in Japan that Steve mentioned, which contributed to higher other operating income. These items accounted for almost $200 million or about half of our operating income growth for the quarter. The other half of our growth was driven by comparison against $195 million in strategic charges taken last year related to our restructuring and refranchising initiatives. Growth in global company-operated margins also contributed to quarterly results with margins up 110 basis points. The high growth markets, in particular, China, led the margin improvement. 
In the U.S., While company-operated margins declined 110 basis points for the quarter, solid comparable sales growth and favorable commodity costs helped offset most of the impact from our prior year decision to increase crew wages and benefits effective July 1, 2015. Second quarter of 2016 will be the last quarter the U.S. company-operated margins will be negatively impacted by these wage comparisons. 
Similar to the past 3 quarters, we expect existing labor pressures to negatively impact U.S. company-operated margins by 350 to 400 basis points in second quarter. While we're on the topic of company-operated margins, I'd like to provide updates on a few of the key margin inputs, including menu pricing and commodity cost. In the U.S., first quarter pricing year-over-year was up over 3% compared with food-away-from-home inflation of around 2.7%. We continue to keep a close eye in food-away-from-home inflation, which is projected to be between 2.5% and 3.5% for the full year. For the International Lead segment, while price increases vary by market, year-over-year increases for these markets averaged 2% to 3%.
From a global pricing standpoint, we're planning for more limited pricing power in those markets that are experiencing low inflation to ensure that we maintain our focus on growing guest counts. Moving to commodity cost. In the U.S., commodity costs were down 3% during the first quarter and are expected to decline 3.5% to 4.5% for the year. 
For the International Lead segment, commodity costs were relatively flat for the quarter and are expected to remain relatively flat for the year. 
Turning now to foreign currencies. More recently, the U.S. dollar has weakened against most of the world's other major foreign currencies. At current rates, currency translation is expected to be less of a headwind on full year results and is now estimated to negatively impact second quarter by $0.02 to $0.04 and full year by $0.05 to $0.07. 
As always, please take this as directional guidance only because rates will change as we move throughout the year. 
Next, I'd like to provide updates on our refranchising, cash returned to shareholders and G&A targets. 
Last year, we committed to strategically evaluating ownership structures, with the goal of becoming around 95% franchised over the long term. In the past 5 quarters, we've refranchised about 700 restaurants, including over 200 in the first quarter this year. The large majority of these were sold to existing conventional franchisees. 
As part of the forensic review of our ownership structures and strategic allocation of resources around the world, during the first quarter, we also initiated new refranchising activities in several markets in Asia and Europe. 
In Asia, we announced plans to further unlock growth potential, with emphasis on 3 markets in our High Growth segments: China, Korea and Hong Kong. These markets collectively operate almost 2,900 restaurants, of which about 70% are company-owned. Given the relatively higher restaurant expansion and franchising potential in these markets, our intent is to identify strategic partners with skills and expertise that will enhance our competitive advantages and bring additional capital resources to further invest in and grow the business. We remain optimistic about the future of our McDonald's brand in Asia, with plans to add at least 1,500 restaurants across China, Hong Kong and Korea over the next 5 years.
In Europe, we're working to identify a strategic partner in the Nordic markets, which include about 460 restaurants, the vast majority of which are operated by independent franchisees. We believe opportunities exist in the Nordic region and that a sale to a local partner can result in an optimal structure for both McDonald's and the future success of these markets. 
Due to the unique nature and size of many of these markets and the importance of finding the right partners, it's important to keep in mind that these transactions may take 12 to 18 months to complete. At the end of 2015, we also started to lay groundwork to complete the final year of our 3-year $30 billion cash returned to shareholders target. In February, we initiated a $2.7 billion accelerated share repurchase program in conjunction with this target. This program was a significant component of the $3.7 billion in shares repurchased during the quarter. 
Our ability to pursue a more aggressive share repurchase pace during the first quarter was supported by the financing completed in December last year. Looking ahead, we expect further debt additions in the coming months as we opportunistically take advantage of favorable interest rates while maintaining our strong investment-grade credit rating. From a G&A standpoint, we remain on track to achieve our net annual G&A savings target of $500 million, the vast majority of which is expected to be realized by the end of 2017.
Over the course of the last year, we brought greater discipline and focus to the business, and we've made meaningful and tangible progress against our turnaround plans. Although we have come a long way, there is still a lot of work to be done to achieve the goals that we've established. 
As we move through 2016, we are keenly focused on maintaining the positive momentum we've created. This momentum is a direct result of our renewed focus on our customers and running great restaurants. We will stay the course and complete the critical steps of our turnaround to position the business for success as we chart our strategic long-term path forward. 
We are mindful of both the opportunities and challenges ahead. Overall, we continue to expect variability in quarterly results due to uneven prior year comparisons and some headwinds that exist, including macroeconomic issues in certain key markets. 
In addition, we recognize that opportunities still exist to further strengthen and generate strong guest traffic in some of our key markets around the world. 
In closing, the financial results achieved are a testament of the collective efforts of our franchisees, suppliers and employees to reset our business. We are on our way toward becoming a modern and progressive burger company. Like Steve, I was energized by our worldwide convention last week, as I saw firsthand the tremendous focus, discipline and passion of our unique system. I'm confident that we can continue to deliver on the progress that we've already made to enhance long-term shareholder value in 2016 and beyond. 
Thanks. Now I'll turn it over to Chris to begin our Q&A."

You've obviously done an extraordinary job reigniting the sales growth. Your gap against the industry in the fourth quarter was close to 300 basis points, and it was about half that this quarter. And it's still an amazing trend. But is the difference between the 2 quarters just really the fact that you got a bit more initial strength that came with launching All Day Breakfast and now this outperformance gap you're seeing is a little bit more of a reasonable expectation that we should have going forward? 
And the quick follow-up to that is, as we look past this first quarter and into the future, do you think that the stickiness that comes with regaining momentum with your customer base is enough or do you really feel the need that you had to take on much more dramatic operational risk like the All Day Breakfast that can pay off pretty big going forward?"

I mean, we clearly came out of the traps hard with All Day Breakfast. It exceeded our expectations during the launch phase and then to a more settled rate. Frankly, it's still exceeding our expectations through that -- through settled stage as well. So we're incredibly encouraged. Frankly, maintaining that positive gap is important to me. The absolute magnitude quarter-to-quarter, I'm less concerned about, as long as we're taking share and customers are turning in our doors rather than others, then I'm confident that we're delivering the right plans. 
In terms of stickiness, something that gives me a great degree of confidence in the way that the U.S. team, the operator leadership and our own leadership team have built the plans is the success is not being based on tactics. We're establishing foundations of growth. And if I -- well, just to give you, 4 of them currently in play, and clearly, we're going to be working on more. The operational improvement, honestly, I would celebrate that as much as All Day Breakfast. We are focusing on getting the basic right in the restaurant and the team are really focused and they're delivering well, and customers are telling us that. So I really don't want to -- I can't emphasize enough how important it is to get the nuts and bolts right for the 20-odd-million customers every day. The investment that the U.S. team operators and company have made through food and food quality is being recognized by customers. So whether it's an announcement from moving to cage-free eggs or removal of antibiotics harmful to human health in the poultry supply chain, whether it's the attention to detail on the Quarter Pounder beef patty and toasting of buns, the quality -- the investment in the quality is getting recognized by our customers. And that's valuable. That's long-term as well. Then, you've got All Day Breakfast, which has been clearly a very strong catalyst for momentum, which is wonderful. We're in that nice situation now where we're challenging ourselves into how much more can we do. Customers are asking us for more. We are looking at that very carefully to see whether that's a platform, but not only is sustaining, but can actually grow. And then, as we spoke about through this quarter, we have struggled to find the right value platform over the last year or 2. We believe through the McPick 2 platform as a whole, we have the flexibility at both national and local level such that we can offer a compelling value at different price points, different times a year and maybe slightly different offers in different parts of the country, depending on the consumer set, we believe that could be a platform that continue to offer growth opportunity and drive customers in. That's what we got in play now. And clearly, there are other things that we're looking at around new product development and also around investing in our restaurants and what we're calling the experience of the future. Now I won't carry on because I want to get through some more questions. But the point I'm really trying to iterate is these are platforms of growth, which give me confidence in the stickiness of our momentum, and we have no plans to ease up, I can assure you."

I mean, part of what we have worked hard across this last year in order to firm up our plans moving forward, some of the big strategic plans is with our new structure now, we have much better visibility into our top 14, 15 markets. And frankly, there is not a common philosophy across those because every market is in a different position. So if we're to make the strategic choices we have in China and Asia, for example, or up into the Scandinavian markets, that's because we have got very forensic, and we think that's in the long-term best interest of the markets, of our long-term growth and that ownership model. 
Your question more to the U.S., I'm sensing is more to the U.S. where we have typically been 5 to 7. We -- the piece -- the philosophy that's critical to us is never losing that entrepreneurial spirit and the Owner/Operators being engaged in their local communities. Now that can be done at a 50 restaurant level. That can be done in a 5 restaurant levels, that can be done in a 1 restaurant level. So to us, the importance is having the right partnership, to be operated with the right mindset. Could we see consolidation? We could do a little. Does that give us fewer, stronger operators and stronger balance sheets and their ability to invest and scale? It could do. But at the same time, we're also introducing new franchisees to the system because they come in with new ideas and new energy and keep us fresh. We also see it through the next-generation programs we have where sons or daughters of existing franchisees want to enter the business, and that brings us new ideas and a fresh energy. So the underlying philosophy remains the same. The execution market-by-market, I believe, we've got much more -- much deeper, meaningful thought to it that we can address this market by market, I think, it serves us -- it will serve us well into the long-term."

So I guess, when I say there were different customer groups, when you're looking kind at a McPick 2 for $2, you are typically addressing the value-conscious, the most value-conscious customers. So I guess, people who are looking for a deal. And that is important. And particularly important at certain times of a year. So if you're coming out of the Christmas period and it's been a high spend period, $1 here and $1 there matches to consumers through January in particular, for example. So that deal for the value-conscious consumer at that particular time at a national level resonated well. If you look at a 2 for $5, for example, it's a different construct. You're looking at people who may be going in, maybe there's 2 people going in and they start to construct a meal around that deal and feel they're getting value that way. So slightly different customer group. It could be the same customer may care for both, but there could be a different group as well. And part of what we're learning is at what level do we want to deploy this, at a national level and use that national marketing muscle? And how much we will allow the flexibly at the regional level because we've got these reenergized regions, 23 of them around the U.S. and they want to bring it to life. But maybe the menu mix in that deal could be different in the Southwest of the country than it would be in the Northeast. And I think that flexibility, knowing your consumer group, knowing your competitive growth, knowing what that value price is allows us to unleash some of the power of our regional marketing muscle. So you will see us dial it up and down, national and local. But the one thing you will always see, there will always be value at McDonald's."

In terms of the more -- the comment regarding guest count in key markets around the world, we have, around the world, we have strong value platforms in many of our major markets. So this is not a price-driven guest count discussion. This is around what can we do to enhance the experience such that customers enjoy sufficiently, they just come back more often or we attract lapsed customers back or new customers to the business. So -- but the first point to check is, is our value platform right. We're working on that, for example, in Germany, I acknowledged that. We haven't quite got it right yet. So we'll continue to firm that up. In many of our other markets, our desire to grow guest count, which is the ultimate strength of or signal of strength of the business, is more around enhancing the broader experience. So as I say, this is not price but this is how can we make the visit to McDonald's more convenient, more fun, more engaging such that when you come to make those decisions, a way you got to eat, more people just turn our way than anywhere else. So it's a much more holistic desire. But ultimately, guest counts is the lifeline of our business, and I'd like to see greater strength there, but I'm very happy with the trends we're seeing."

As I mentioned in the second quarter this year, we'll lap the -- well, beginning of third quarter, we'll begin to lap the additional labor costs related to crew wages and benefit. So that will help from a comparison standpoint. But historically, we've always said that in a normal inflationary environment, we need about a 2% to 3% comp to maintain margins. Nothing structurally has changed in our business to change that on a long-term basis. A little inflation wouldn't hurt from a pricing standpoint. So we have to be careful with commodity costs where they are. But I think we feel pretty good about margins going forward as long as we can maintain our growth in comparable sales there."

So I think, now, we're almost 12 -- well, we're more 9 months into the cycle. After 12 months, I think, we'll see a nice step up in company-operated margins. And do take a look at International Lead markets as well. Again, strong performance as they go through. First of all, top line growth does -- it's the primary driver. As they go through their refranchising plans as well, you'll see continued strength in the operating margin there as well.

So operational improvement in the U.S., I mean, it is so multifaceted that I could take hours, I'd love to because I just love what they're doing. So simply put, we've made the experience easier for customers and easier for crew and easier to get right. So they have a particular focus having identified the core frustration for customers was accuracy for the drive-thru, which then impacts service times. So they put a number of initiatives in place such as simplified menu boards, new crew training procedures, as we've described, is Ask, Ask, Tell, just another way that we help ensure we get the accuracy right through the whole customer experience, from ordering, through pay, through collect. But we're into the real details. We're into the font size on the printers, the receipts such that it's easier to spot the special request, for example, all the special orders. So I can't even tell you how detailed the team has got to help our restaurant teams get it right more often. And ultimately, the beneficiary is the customer on this, and they are playing it back to all the customer metrics we have, whether it's through mystery shoppers, through our own operational grading standards. We are seeing these effects take place. And honestly, that is the primary driver of customer satisfaction, getting it right, hot, fresh food, friendly service. 
In terms of high growth, yes, so I tend to call out China and Russia just to -- because the scale and the potential of those markets. But we had great performance out of Netherlands. Great performance out of Hong Kong. Great performance out of Poland. Great performance out of Korea through the quarter, and these aren't one-offs. So I appreciate the question because it gives us a chance to demonstrate how broad the momentum in this business is. And it's not limited just to the high growth markets. I mean, if I just look at Western Europe as a whole, growing strongly. Central Europe, growing strongly. Middle East, strong growth for the Middle East. Latin America, there's turbulence as there often is and have overall strong growth. Asia, Australasia, as well as North America, and calling out Canada, as well as the U.S. So we are seeing a very -- a lot of strong momentum. Is it perfect? No. Are there markets we still have work to do? Absolutely yes, and we're never satisfied.

So we don't -- so the complacency doesn't set in. We have a restless energy here. We've just got going. And a lot of the theme around the biannual convention last week was around accelerating with momentum and not just sitting tight with the momentum. So that's how we're galvanizing ourselves, it's how we're challenging ourselves. And these platforms that the U.S. has introduced, I'm confident we'll maintain that stickiness. But we want to layer further platforms on top of that, which is exactly the ingredients of success through that kind of '03, '04 through to 2010, 2011 period, was we were layering platforms of growth on top of each that are complementary and customer-driven.

Regarding the G&A, so let me first talk about first quarter, which was up just compared to last year basically because of higher incentive compensation than last year. So part of that is driven by -- or a lot of that is driven by last year's lack of incentive comp, if you will, in the first quarter as much as this year's incentive comp that's in there. Looking forward, both to 2016 and beyond, a couple of things, we achieved about $75 million of our total savings in 2015 and built within that 1% to 2% guidance is another about $75 million in 2016. Now there are 2 swing factors, if you will, that could impact the actual reported G&A this year. And I'm talking on a constant currency basis, so obviously, currency also impacts it. But when we think about the targets, we exclude currency. So the actual numbers you'll see reported may be different because of currency impact. But ignoring that, the other 2 swing factors, if you will, are 1, incentive comp, where if you think about 2014, we had very little, if you will, incentive comp as a company. 2015, we got back to a more normal. So you can get a big swing from 1 year to the next on incentive comp, but all of that is driven by business performance. So we'll only have the incentive comp, obviously, if we're driving business performance. But that could swing things, plus or minus, that 1% to 2% -- down 1% to 2% guidance. 
The other swing is the timing of some of these large refranchising transactions. When we do our plans at the beginning of the year, we're effectively estimating when those will occur and they become very complex as we get into these transactions. And so to exactly pinpoint the timing of when those occur becomes really difficult. So it's possible that something that we may have thought was going to happen at the end of 2016 could potentially slip to the beginning of 2017. And that may impact the timing of some of our G&A savings. But other than that, we're on track for the $500 million. We're still completely confident in the $500 million by the end of '17. And it becomes just a timing issue between 2016 and '17."

But I would say that the conversation around value at a regional level and a co-op level is where to dial up 2 to $5, where to dial up the 2 for $2, what time of year and be complementary with whatever else is going on. So for example, if you can collect the Monopoly tokens on certain items, then reinforcing that further value just drives further trial of the Monopoly promotion for example. So it's complementary.

Customers are noticing a difference and they're coming to McDonald's more often. This is reflected in our first quarter financial results and in the market share gains we're experiencing in many markets around the world. We know there's still more work to do, and that's why we remain committed to executing our turnaround plans for at least 2 more quarters. I am encouraged by the progress we've made, and I'm excited about our longer-term opportunities to strengthen our business and reassert McDonald's leadership position around the world. Thanks to all of you, and have a great day."

Midway through 2016, I'm encouraged by the progress we've made in turning around our business and the way we've challenged legacy thinking, actively greater urgency and shared successes more quickly across markets. These actions underlie the positive momentum that continued in second quarter, marking 4 consecutive quarters of positive comparable sales growth across all segments. Franchisee cash flows at all-time highs in many markets. 
More specifically, global comparable sales increased 3.1% for the quarter. Operating income was up 3% in constant currencies and earnings per share was up 1% in constant currencies. Excluding the impact of the current and prior year strategic charges, earnings per share for the quarter was up 13% in constant currencies. 
As we entered 2016, we expected quarterly results to be variable throughout the year. Our top line performance in second quarter, while positive, reflects further growth due in part to changing conditions in several countries. 
I'm encouraged that we continue to win relative to our QSR competitors in key markets around the world. In the U.S, our comparable sales gap versus the QSR sandwich segment was consistently positive and average 130 basis points for the quarter despite softer industry growth. Our balanced focus in All Day Breakfast, value and relevant promotions, including Monopoly, contributed to top line performance. 
In Australia, Canada and the U.K., we are gaining significant market share within the IEO segments and in particular, relative to our traditional QSR competitors. Our formula for success in these markets is consistent. Commitments on running great restaurants, coupled with initiatives that create customer excitement across our menu, promotion and value offers, all supported by strong alignment with franchisees.
Early last year, we put the customer back in the center of everything we're doing what. That mindset ignited our turnaround and continues to guide our decision-making, as evidenced by the enhancements we are making to the All Day Breakfast menu in the U.S, the leadership moves we made around sustainability, and the significant progress we're making to create a more modern customer experience as part of the Experience of the Future.
Over the past few quarters, we've heard from customers looking for more choices in the All Day Breakfast menu, both with muffin sandwiches on the  menu after biscuits, those with biscuits sandwich on the menu offer muffins. We listened, work for operational challenges, and this fall, will begin offering biscuits, McMuffins, and McGriddles all day in all U.S. restaurants. 
Under the broader third quality umbrella, we continue to take a leadership style of sustainability as it's the right for our business, society and the world at large. In Canada, we are breaking ground in the beef industry with our recently concluded sustainable beef pilots, part of our work with ranches and larger producers around the globe to measure and track sustainable beef from farm to pork.
Sustainability matters to our customers and it matters to us. At the same time, Experience of the Future is quickly coming to life in key markets around the world. For example, in Canada, over half of our restaurants have been fully converted. U.K. is almost 40% and France is at nearly 25% with table service in about 80% of restaurants. This marks significant progress from where we were just 3 months ago.
Customers are noticing the steps we're taking to build a better McDonald's. Most recent customer satisfaction scores reflect improvements in 7 of our 9 largest markets. In the U.S, we are seeing further evidence of improved brand perceptions according to our recent report that measures consumer perceptions across 1,400 brands. McDonald's ranks fourth most all improved brand across all brands measured and the most improved within QSR.
We're taking smart risks to address what matters most to customers. We're also being smarter about our structure and resources, are prioritizing our activities to deliver the greatest impact. This in turn is putting more restaurants in the hands of dedicated franchisees, getting us closer to the customer and communities we serve, and unleashes more entrepreneurial spirit, risk-taking and innovation across the system, ultimately, accelerating growth.
At the same time, we are further streamlining how we operate. We're in the midst of rightsizing our organization, taking a critical look on how we can reduce layers to be more agile in our decision-making. We also recently announced the relocation of our corporate headquarters. Our new location will support greater collaboration and innovation, help us better attract and retain talent and move us toward a more modern progressive culture with the added benefit of reducing costs.
These are all important steps forward in our journey to building a better McDonald's. With that context, let's now turn the performance highlights in our major markets. Beginning with the U.S, comparable sales with second quarter increased 1.8%. Pulse modestly positive, this growth was almost stronger in the last few quarters. This is due in part to the recent softening of the IEO industry that should experience minimal growth for the trailing 12-month period ending in May for 20, 40 [ph] basis points. 
The all-day breakfast continue to contribute to top line momentum to draw new customers into our restaurants and create additional reasons for existing customers to visit more often. This is also delivering bottom line growth with restaurant level cash flows up for the third consecutive quarter. 
Franchisees are excited about our platform and the future growth potential. And the next phase of all-day breakfasts, which I mentioned earlier, was voted in with an overwhelming approval rating exceeding 99%. 
With blue, we continue to enhance quality perceptions around our core menu and we've been more vocal about the improvements we've made. Just last week, we launched our brand campaign called, the simpler, the better, which highlights the progress we've made in the areas that matter most to our customers. And we'll have an even more news to share in the coming weeks.
Value remains a top priority in the U.S. Franchisees have embraced the McPick 2 value platform at both the national and local levels. They tap in our flexibility this platform provides in terms of products and price points to enhance our appeal to a broader population of value seeking customers, which is increasingly important, given softer IEO industry trends.
Although the progress we've made in the U.S. is encouraging, our most significant opportunity continues to be bringing customers internal restaurants more often. As such, we are actively exploring new ways to increase the frequency of visits of our loyal customers and win back customers we've lost. Let's now turn to the International Lead segment. 
Second quarter comparable sales increased 2.6% with 4 of the top 5 markets delivering positive comparable sales for the quarter. France was the exception with results were relatively flat. The recent Brexit both has created some uncertainty in the U.K. and across our Europe, our business remains strong, and we are confident in our ability to manage through the change. Having operated in these markets are over 40 years, we are accustomed to dealing with external challenges. I believe we are well positioned to seek out the opportunities it provides to build upon the strength of our U.K. business.
In fact, the U.K. market's long track record of success continued into second quarter. Compelling promotions, limited time offers, such as the relaunch of big flavor apps and positive performance from Experience of the Future restaurants, drove growth in both average check and guest counts, with guest count volume breaking all-time monthly highs in April and May. 
In Canada, our continued focus on lunch, along with the successful marketing campaigns and positive performance from their Experience of the Future Restaurants, drove solid sales and guest count momentum into the second quarter.
Performance of all-day breakfasts in Australia is mirroring the success in the U.S, driving incremental sales by providing customers with even more reasons to visit McDonald's. In addition, we continue to fuel growth in more established platforms, like Experience of the Future and McCaf√©. We're introducing new customizable flavors ingredients, supported by engaging marketing and promotional campaigns to create energy and excitement for our customers.
Sales were slightly positive in Germany for the second quarter. With the heavy concentration of price conscious situations, value remains a critical priority. The new your pricing structure we've rolled out in February continues to perform in line with expectations. And McPick 2 for EUR 5, which we launched in May, resonated well with customers. 
However, these initiatives weren't enough to mitigate ongoing guest count and market share declines. Macro can the challenges persist in France. We're enhancing our appeal to customers by offering more compelling options at lower tiers of our menu. We're also pursuing growth opportunity at the premium end through engaging promotions limited-time offers, including the recent New York street food events, which successfully drove sales of premium burgers and wraps. 
In the High Growth segment, second quarter comparable sales were up 1.6%, driven by positive performance in China and Russia. Despite the challenging environment, including aggressive discounting by competitors, China's comparable sales were up 2.1% for the quarter. We continue to gain significant market share in IEO and more specifically from Chinese QSRs whilst understating meaningful cost savings initiatives to enhance profitability in its important market.
In an effort to give customers more reason to choose McDonald's, we've introduced appealing new products, like the chicken snack sharing box. In addition, we're expanding our delivery business by tapping into growing digital channels, as well as other vendors to offer added convenience to Chinese customers. 
In Russia, comparable sales remained positive, driven in part by successful promotions that showcase compelling, affordable menu options across multiple dayparts and product categories. Results may be volatile moving forward given continuing macroeconomic uncertainties and lower consumer purchasing power.
I'm encouraged by our continued progress. We're creating a better McDonald's, one the customers will recognize as modern and progressive and a true global leader. Once we've come on way, we recognize there is much more to do. That's why we remain committed to executing our turnaround plan through the end of the year. 
For now, we remain focused on continuing to and within the QSR segment as we give customers more reasons to choose McDonald's. At the same time, we are taking steps to build upon the progress we've made as we chart our long-term strategical path forward within the broader $1.2 trillion Informal Eating Out market. I am confident McDonald's will generate long-term value for both our system and our shareholders. 
Thanks. I'll now turn it over to Kevin."
139488,372629879,1012050,"McDonald's Corp., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 26, 2016",2016-07-26,"Earnings Calls","McDonald's Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. As follow up to Steve's remark, I'd like to cover the key performance drivers for the quarter, provide an update on our outlook for the second half of 2016 and outline the recent progress we've made against our f",1442,"Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. As follow up to Steve's remark, I'd like to cover the key performance drivers for the quarter, provide an update on our outlook for the second half of 2016 and outline the recent progress we've made against our financial initiatives. Starting with the performance drivers for the quarter.
For the quarter as a whole, we're pleased with our efforts to effectively manage restaurant profitability, particularly in light of the industry trends and economic factors that we've experienced in certain markets. 
With more than 80% of our global restaurants franchised, the largest driver of operating income continues to be our franchise margins. For the quarter, growth in global franchise margins was led by the U.S. in the International Lead markets. Franchise margins totaled $1.9 billion, a 6% increase in constant currencies, and contributed about $100 million to our global operating income growth for the quarter. 
Growth in global company-operated margins also contributed to quarterly results, as margins rose 150 basis points with China leading the overall improvement. In the U.S, company-operated margins increased by 30 basis points for the quarter, as positive comparable sales and favorable commodity cost more than offset the investment we made last July to raise crew wages and enhance benefits for our restaurant employees. Given the magnitude of this investment, improvement in second quarter margins is a noteworthy achievement for our U.S. business. Moving on to G&A.
Our second quarter expense have increased 2% in constant currencies, due to higher incentive-based compensation as our a result of our you take performance as well as costs associated with our biannual owner operator convention in April. Excluding these items, G&A would have decreased. Looking ahead, third quarter G&A levels will remain elevated to to our sponsorship of the summer Olympic Games in Rio next month. Taken together, the cost of our worldwide convention and the Olympics are expected to total about $25 million or roughly 1% of our G&A in 2016.
For the full year 2016, we continue to expect G&A, in constant currencies to be 1% to 2% below prior year spending levels, excluding changes in incentive-based compensation and any impact from changes in timing of certain refranchising transactions. 
Global operating income for the quarter totaled more than $1.8 billion, up 3% in constant currencies, reflecting roughly $230 million in strategic charges recorded during the quarter. These charges were comprised of a noncash impairment related to our ongoing refranchising in Asia and Europe and G&A initiatives, as well as the decision to relocate our corporate offices.
Diluted earnings per share for the quarter declined $0.01, which included $0.20 related to the strategic charges and $0.02 in negative foreign currency impact. As a reminder, in second quarter 2015, we have strategic charges of $0.04 per share related to restructuring. Excluding the impact of the current and prior year restructuring charges, earnings per share for second quarter 2016 were up 13% in constant currencies.
Turning next to menu pricing and commodity costs. In the U.S., commodity cost declined 4.5% during the second quarter. Looking to the second half of the year, we expect commodity cost to remain favorable, maintaining our outlook for the segment's full year basket of goods to be down 3.5% to 4.5%. Commodity cost for the International Lead segment were down about 1% for the second quarter and are expected to remain relatively flat during the second half of this year. Where possible, we source products in local currency to minimize cost fluctuations and our suppliers also hedged a portion of foreign currency exposure. So at least in the near term, we don't expect Brexit to significantly impact U.K. commodity prices.
While we are benefiting from favorable commodity cost around the world, we are facing rising labor costs in many of our markets. As a result, we are carefully balancing price increases with a focus on maintaining our strong value proposition, which remains a key pillar of McDonald's brand to drive guest counts. 
In the U.S., second quarter pricing year-over-year was up about 3% compared with food-away-from-home inflation of 2.6%. Given the widening gap between food-at-home and food-away-from-home inflation in the U.S, we continue to track both of these metrics very closely. As it stands, food-at-home is projected to increase modestly from relatively flat to up about 1% for the full year, while food-away-from-home inflation is projected to increase between 2.5% and 3.5%.
For the International Lead segment, while price increases vary by market, year-over-year increases for these markets average 1.5% to 2%. Next, I'd like to provide an update on the impact of Brexit on our global foreign currency outlook. As I mentioned, we don't expect Brexit to have a significant impact on our near-term commodity prices in the UK. And as Steve noted earlier, we also haven't seen a significant change in consumer demand in the U.K. since the vote.
While the long-term impact of Brexit is uncertain, in the near-term the most significant impact on our business will be currency translation. We view our geographic diversification as a key competitive strength. For a perspective, the U.K. represents about 10% of consolidated operating income and the euro collectively represents about 25%. Given recent currency fluctuations, foreign currency translation is now expected to have a more significant impact on our reported results than previously estimated. Based on current exchange rates, we project foreign currency translation to negatively impact our earnings per share by $0.02 to $0.04 in the third quarter and $0.09 to $0.11 for the full year. As always, please take our currency guidance as directional only because rates will change as we move throughout the year.
Beyond the currency impact, we continue to expect variability in quarterly results due to increased volatility in the evolving global economic and geopolitical landscape, as well as uneven prior year comparisons. It was just over 1 year ago, beginning with the announcement of our turnaround plan in May 2015, that we began reshaping our business, from our organizational structure and restaurant ownership mix to our capital structure and the strategic location of our resources are on the world. We've taken decisive actions to pursue each of these opportunities, and we continue to make meaningful progress. 
In the past 6 quarters, we refranchises about 850 restaurants, including over 160 in the second quarter. The large majority of restaurants refranchised to date were sold to existing conventional franchisees. 
Overall, our global refranchising efforts are moving along as expected, and we're pleased with the progress we've made to date. It's important to keep in mind that due to the unique nature and scope of the refranchising activity underway, the more complex, larger refranchising transactions do take time. We remain committed to our refranchising strategy and demand effect that we will be realized by more thing to our more heavily franchised system from McDonald's globally.
From a G&A standpoint, we remain on track to achieve our net annual savings target of $500 million by 2018 with the vast majority of the savings expected to be realized by the end of 2017. As Steve noted, we are in the midst of transforming our organization. We expect to share more detail on the roles that our organizational restructuring is playing in reaching our G&A coal as part of our third quarter earnings update.
Relative to our capital structure, 2016 represents the final year of our 3-year $30 billion cash return to shareholders targets. During the second quarter, we repurchased $3.4 billion of stock, bringing our year-to-date share repurchases to $7.1 billion or 57 million shares. In May, we completed a $2.7 billion accelerated share repurchase program and also entered into a new $2.6 billion program, which accounted for a significant portion of the share repurchase activity completed during second quarter.
Through June 2016, our cumulative cash return under our 3-year target stands at $24.4 billion, and we are on track to complete the remaining amount during the back half of this year. 
We've delivered positive results over the last 4 quarters, not just from improving efficiency and working to reduce cost, but most importantly, from top line growth, as we made strides improving the customer experience. These results reinforce my confidence that we're focused on the right things. We're also making good progress in all of the actions we outlined last year. We are actively refranchising restaurants, building stronger G&A discipline and returning more cash to shareholders. The strategic changes we are making and the actions we've taken over the course of the last year are positioning us to optimize our business operations and deliver sustained, profitable growth. 
Thanks. Now I'll turn it over to Chris to begin our Q&A."

On the industry, your outperformance in the industry this quarter is very similar to last quarter, which suggests the entire industry saw huge deceleration around 350 basis points. So what do you believe sitting in your seat looking at the United States, what are the 2 largest drivers of the softening in the IEO trend? And do see it continuing into the rest of the year? And secondly, on your own business, when you look at lapping All Day Breakfast in the fourth quarter, how are you thinking about the ability to sustain positive trends here as you lap it? Is it extending the All Day Breakfast menu enough? Or are there more initiatives required in your mind?"

And therefore, we are very mindful of our competitive position, the competitive gap. So it's important to us that we maintain that competitive advantage and foot for market share. No, we're not immune from what's happening in the outside world at all, but nor we're letting that deflect our focus on what really matters to us and our customers. I think the general sense is there's a couple of things at play. I mean, first of all, there is a widening gap between food-away-from-home and food-at-home, where the commodity decreases are being passed through by the grocers where the food-at-home is -- there's value to be found is there, whereas inching others if there's a price inflation environment. So that's a small part of it. I think, generally, there's just a broader level of uncertainty in consumer's minds at the moment, both trying to gauge the -- their financial security going forward, whether through elections or through global events, people are slightly mindful of an unsettled world. When people are uncertain, when families are uncertain, caution starts prevail and they start to hold back on spend. And for a business like us, I mean, clearly, we generate a lot of our own business directly. But also we do benefit from people moving around, going to the malls, driving around, going on vacation. and if people are waiting and there's been a cross-border categories, that will have a little bit of a flow through to us as well. So we are mindful of it. It just means we got to be closer to our customers than ever and adapt to make sure that we're building compelling brands in the short term, as well as for the long. In terms of sustaining trends. Well, clearly, we plan to grow our business. But at the same time, we're not trying to do that on a quarter-to-quarter-to-quarter basis. Yes, we are mindful to short term, but we have our eye line on the long term. And we believe we've got the number of the right drivers in place to give us sustained, long-term growth here in the U.S. 
Our value platform is here, we continue to learn. So from a McPick 2 for 5 for example, we have our second national campaign in May, and we learn more about it in terms of the items we can have within the on how we position that, all the way through to some of the early markets, where we're testing out the Experience the Future in the U.S. where we're remaking a significant, an exciting rollout program in Florida and certainly, in New York as well, which we believe there is also a very where we are singles were in our other major markets provided very exciting opportunity for across of the next few years in the U.S. as well. So mindful the short term, we're going to fight for share it also we don't want to lose the strategic direction that we believe is right for long-term."

Yes -- so if I speak to U.S. specific, I mean, a reference earlier the you got just like on brand perceptions, and we've made really encouraging progress. And I believe that's because as well as trying to drive the business in the immediate term, we've also made the investments and the commitments around food for quality, sustainability, the employment proposition, where not only to be move pay for our Alipay stuff, but also a far broader, enhanced ranger benefit including trading and education opportunities for them. And with a brand like McDonald's, I think you do communicate. So the better you move on every single consumer touch points, then in the broader Halo in the range starts to improve. So we're encouraged. We've got plenty of plans to maintain our momentum but it's nice to sit in and recognized by consumers. Part of that is what comes out running better restaurants. And we've maintained a 6% year-on-year improvement in overall customer satisfaction. When I look into the detail there, we've made the progress on the areas that the team had intended to make a progress. So we've spoken the past about and attention to order accuracy, particularly in the drive-thru or actually has improved. The quality of the food perception has improved. Friendliness improved. All by the order of about 6%, including speed of service as well. So I believe that day-to-day customer experience also enhances the brand and also just drives out immediate satisfaction. 
In terms of going forward, what's important? I'd say a couple of things. I mean, clearly, continuing the journey we are around food and food quality, both investing in the ingredients, the recipes and the items in the restaurants, as well as the perception that are explaining what's in our food, where it comes from an -- so that's where we had the simpler, the better company source of focus. The big meaningful moves we made, and I believe signals in the direction of travel for us going forward. And as I said, I'm not just going to disclose anything about it, but there will be more news to come as we know is going to be powerful in the customer agenda and very, very strong for the brand as well. The other element that I'm excited to introduce that we will be introducing increasingly in the U.S. because we've seen it work elsewhere in our major, mature markets, is rolling out the Experience of the Future. It's a fundamentally different Experience for the company and lot of that does involve technology as well as service expenses will. So how can we take out the -- any of the interactions that customers have with experience McDonald's, whether they're coming to the dining area are going through the drive-thru? How can we take out then and value-added processes in just make a smoother, more enjoyable and the Acer expense for customers? So the injection of self order chaos, the development of the, of our mobile apps quarter so they can order in ahead and just check in when you get into the restaurant. It takes out many of those human interactions where complications can arise. It just makes a smoother experience with customers.

You saw in second quarter of this year, we were able to actually grow margins 30 basis points in the U.S. with the 1.8% comp sales, which we were certainly pleased about. As you know long-term, margins are a top line gain for us. We need to grow comps in order to maintain and improve margins. But what we were able to do this quarter was effectively manage the restaurant profitability as well. So while commodity costs were more for both this quarter, our management of what we call, controllable costs both on the food side and the labor side was better this quarter than prior quarters. And so we're pleased that we're doing a better job of managing, running the restaurant, but also managing the profitability of the restaurants. Going forward, we've always said that we need about a 2% to 3% comp in air normal inflationary environment that probably hasn't changed much and there's certainly isn't anything structural that would prevent us from getting back to kind of where we were on high margins in the U.S."

Speed of service has predominantly improved largely because we've got the accuracy element of service far better. So we enhance of the training and some of the operational procedures through the drive-thru and you may have heard me talk about our program we called as cost tell, which is a way really ensuring we took -- both took and then delivered the right order day in company out to our customers. Once you get your accuracy right, then the whole drive-thru lane just operates fast, smoother. You also made significant changes to the merchandising of the drive-thru with more tailored and focused merchandising menu boards. But you again just made it easier for customers to order and identify the products they want, but also easier for our teams to take and get right. So I think that a lot of work has gone on. The real devil in the detail down to the font size on the order receipts to make sure our teams reflect and the order's can gather to write items. But also, there's a lot of work we're doing in the future, where we believe we can also enhance service, speed and accuracy and get technology to do so some of that heaven lifting for us. So whether it's voice recognition in the drive-thru speaker all the way through to ordering at by even of the Internet or the app. Now we have elements of this going on around the world. Not sure if you're going to blow them all together here in one market, but we were going to take those learnings and see how the customer response to some of the capabilities we're introducing. And clearly, if the response is strong, we can bring that in. And that will help again further enhance speed of service. 
But all the way to, we have markets where we have curbside collection for our orders. So if you actually order that ahead via the Internet, you can actually just go with current side. And therefore, when you think about it, you got one side to our customer, who is ordering and collecting and paying, that's also one. That's also one fewer cargo into the drive-thrus, of existing drive-thrus laying months. So we look at this in a number of different directions. To others making the day-to-day operation improvement the change hasn't so far. But also we're looking at innovation in the future. To try and keep it smoother and easier for customers and just easy for our teams to get right."

Yes, absolutely. We recognize that. That doesn't come as a surprise to us. What we want to do is work hard to still have a compelling everyday value proposition on our restaurants. And that can take the form of many things. So we've gone with the McPick 2 platform. And again, just to step back and remind why we believe this is strong it's because it's got it over what customers tell us is more important to them, which is choice and flexibility. And not locked in the mid-of certain price points nor are we locked into a certain selection of bottled items. So we believe in that choice of flexibility is right for our customers and gives us the flexibility and new use as we return to these programs across of that year. Sometimes there have been a national level. If it's not national, it will be locally reinforced in the marketing windows in between. 
So we're continuing to learn. We've only been national with McPick 2 for 5 twice now. And again, the local co-ops have been work on there are very variations of particularly the McPick 2 for 2 or our other value price point. So we're continuing to into evolve that. But as invention session tried off? Yes, there is. We knew that. We plan for that, we still believe we have an everyday value proposition. 
And again, it's not just McPick 2. I mean, there's local promotional activity in the co-ops on an ongoing basis whether it's $1 drink promotion, for example, all the way through to the office we're now offering through the global mobile app. We've had 12 million downloads at that, we've got 8 million registered users on the app. And clearly, the operators in the vacancy card in there are driving over the interaction. In terms of quarter 4, clearly, we know the -- if you like the quirky cycles we're on, we believe the enhancement to all day breakfast will help reinforce the baseline momentum, as is running better restaurant, as thus reinforcing the value. That team is certainly, work with other activity's. There's nothing in particular to share today. But I would say that we are playing the long game here. So we got going to manage the business. We're mindful of the quarters but we're not going to manage it by quarter. We believe were getting the right fundamental foundations of platforms in place to reinforced the long-term success and profitability of McDonald's. And we have consciously expanded our business plans and our activity away from just a product and price lead program, which we had been somewhat drawn to in the past.

So looks like your guidance points to franchise restaurant ownership moving to, I think it's almost 95% by the end of '18. I think you started roughly 83% today. You've seen dramatic margin expansion in the past following some of these aggressively refranchising efforts going back and looking at. The model looks like in '07 and '08, you did see some really, really impressive margin expansion. Again, I think after you developmentally licensed and refranchised more than a couple thousand restaurants. So with that, President, what operating income margin level and again, I realized you're not going to give me a specific number, even a tight range, but when you guys move to a 95% franchise mix, how different do you think the operating margin of McDonald's will look in '18 as compared to what it looks like today?"

Effectively, we're swapping company operated margin dollars for franchised margin dollars and certainly, then spending less G&A and capital to generate those franchise margin dollars. So as you state, that was settled accretive to operating margin back historically when we've done that. We would expect similar that we would also be able to improve operating margins going forward based on the activity. as you indicate, we're certainly, not going to throw in a number out there. But generally, one of the main reasons we're doing that is because of the stability of both the cash flows and the operating performance going forward. So we've got a stable revenue stream that will collect any predictable model that allows us to manage the business pretty effectively. Certainly, on a free cash flow basis, you should expect that it will be accretive because as I said, were generating more income, our cash flow and not spending as much capital."

And there will likely be further franchising like that. In countries certainly, in certain parts of Asia and Europe, where either it's a bit more volatile from a economic and political standpoint and/or a partner can help us accelerate growth and grow faster than maybe where we're going to put in capital right now go those situations you will likely see as using that development license model that we view successfully for many years and a lot of the countries. All of the transaction that we have planned right now, we're taking into consideration when we came out with that $500 million of G&A reduction. So the $500 million contemplated all of the transactions that we have, kind of in our plans at this point. So none of those activities will in and of themselves, drive further G&A reduction. That doesn't mean that we're not going to continue to look for efficiencies and one of the business in a disciplined manner, but you shouldn't expect that because we completed a refranchising transaction or anything along those lines that, that would trigger automatically a further or additional G&A cut in addition to the $500 million."

Midway through 2016, I'm encouraged by the progress we've made in turning around our business and the way we've challenged legacy thinking, actively greater urgency and shared successes more quickly across markets. These actions underlie the positive momentum that continued in second quarter, marking 4 consecutive quarters of positive comparable sales growth across all segments and franchisee cash flows at all-time highs in many markets. 
More specifically, global comparable sales increased 3.1% for the quarter. Operating income was up 3% in constant currencies and earnings per share was up 1% in constant currencies. Excluding the impact of the current and prior year strategic charges, earnings per share for the quarter was up 13% in constant currencies. 
As we entered 2016, we expected quarterly results to be variable throughout the year. Our top line performance in second quarter, while positive, reflects further slower due in part to changing conditions in several countries. 
I'm encouraged that we continue to win relative to our QSR competitors in key markets around the world. In the U.S, our comparable sales gap versus the QSR sandwich segment was consistently positive and average 130 basis points for the quarter despite softer industry growth. Our balanced focus in All Day Breakfast, value and relevant promotions, including Monopoly, contributed to top line performance. 
In Australia, Canada and the U.K., we are gaining significant market share within the IEO segments and, in particular, relative to our traditional QSR competitors. Our formula for success in these markets is consistent. Commitments on running great restaurants, coupled with initiatives that create customer excitement across our menu, promotion and value offers, all supported by strong alignment with franchisees.
Early last year, we put the customer back at the center of everything we're doing what. That mindset ignited our turnaround and continues to guide our decision-making, as evidenced by the enhancements we are making to the All Day Breakfast menu in the U.S., the leadership moves we've made around sustainability and the significant progress we're making to create a more modern customer experience as part of the Experience of the Future.
Over the past few quarters, we've heard from customers looking for more choices in the All Day Breakfast menu, both with muffin sandwiches on the  menu offer biscuits. Those with biscuits sandwich on the menu offer muffins. We listened, work for operational challenges, and this fall, we'll begin offering muffins, biscuits and McGriddles all day in all U.S. restaurants. 
Under the broader food quality umbrella, we continue to take a leadership stance of sustainability as it is the right thing to do for our business, society and the world at large. 
In Canada, we are breaking ground in the beef industry with our recently concluded sustainable beef pilots, part of our work with ranches and larger producers around the globe to measure and track sustainable beef from farm to fork.
Sustainability matters to our customers, and it matters to us. At the same time Experience of the Future is quickly coming to life in key markets around the world. For example, in Canada, over half of our restaurants have been fully converted. U.K. is almost 40%, and France is at nearly 25% with table service in about 80% of restaurants. This marks significant progress from where we were just 3 months ago.
The customers are noticing the steps we're taking to build a better McDonald's. The most recent customer satisfaction scores reflect improvements in 7 of our 9 largest markets. In the U.S., we are seeing further evidence of improved brand perceptions according to our recent YouGov report that measures consumer perceptions across 1,400 brands. McDonald's ranks fourth most improved brand across all brands measured and the most improved within QSR.
We're taking smart risks to address what matters most to customers. We also are being smarter about our structure and resources and prioritizing our activities to deliver the greatest impact. This includes putting more restaurants in the hands of dedicated franchisees, getting us closer to the customers and communities we serve, and unleashes more entrepreneurial spirit, risk-taking and innovation across the system, ultimately accelerating growth.
At the same time, we are further streamlining how we operate. We're in the midst of rightsizing our organization, taking a critical look on how we can reduce layers to be more agile in our decision-making. We also recently announced the relocation of our corporate headquarters. Our new location will support greater collaboration and innovation, help us better attract and retain talent and move us toward a more modern progressive culture with the added benefit of reducing costs. These are all important steps forward in our journey to building a better McDonald's. 
With that context, let's now turn the performance highlights in our major markets. Beginning with the U.S., comparable sales with second quarter increased 1.8%. Whilst modestly positive, this growth was not as strong as the last 2 quarters. This is due in part to the recent softening of the IEO industry that should experience minimal growth for the trailing 12-month period ending in May with only 40 basis points. 
The All Day Breakfast platform continues to contribute to top line momentum to draw new customers into our restaurants and create additional reasons for existing customers to visit more often. This is also delivering bottom line growth with restaurant level cash flows up for the third consecutive quarter. 
Franchisees are excited about our platform and in the future growth potential. And the phase of All Day Breakfast, which I mentioned earlier, was voted in with an overwhelming approval rating exceeding 99%. 
With food, we continue to enhance quality perceptions around our core menu, and we've been more vocal about the improvements we've made. Just last week, we launched our new brand campaign called, ""The simpler, the better,"" which highlights the progress we've made in the areas that matter most to our customers. And we'll have even more news to share in the coming weeks.
Value remains a top priority in the U.S. Franchisees have embraced the McPick 2 value platform at both the national and local levels. We tapped in the flexibility this platform provides in terms of products and price points to enhance our appeal to a broader population of value-seeking customers, which is increasingly important given softer IEO industry trends.
Although the progress we've made in the U.S. is encouraging, our most significant opportunity continues to be bringing customers internal restaurants more often. As such, we are actively exploring new ways of increasing the frequency of visits from our loyal customers and win back customers we've lost.
Let's now turn to the International Lead segment. Second quarter comparable sales increased 2.6% with 4 of the top 5 markets delivering positive comparable sales for the quarter. France was the exception with results that were relatively flat. 
Whilst the recent Brexit vote has created uncertainty in the U.K. and across Europe, our business remains strong, and we are confident in our ability to manage through the change. Having operated in these markets for over 40 years, we are accustomed to dealing with external challenges. I believe we are well positioned to seek out the opportunities it provides to build upon the strength of our U.K. business.
In fact, the U.K. market's long track record of success continued into second quarter. Compelling promotions, limited time offers such as the relaunch of Big Flavour Wraps and positive performance from Experience of the Future restaurants drove growth in both average check and guest counts, with guest count volume breaking all-time monthly highs in April and May. 
In Canada, our continued focus on lunch, along with successful marketing campaigns and positive performance from their Experience of the Future Restaurants, drove solid sales and guest count momentum into the second quarter.
Performance of All Day Breakfast in Australia is mirroring the success in the U.S., driving incremental sales by providing customers with even more reasons to visit McDonald's. 
In addition, we continue to fuel growth in more established platforms, like Experience of the Future and McCaf√©. We're introducing new customizable flavors ingredients, supported by engaging marketing and promotional campaigns to create energy and excitement for our customers.
Sales were slightly positive in Germany for the second quarter. With the heavy concentration of price-conscious customers, value remains a critical priority. The new pricing structure we rolled out in February continues to perform in line with expectations. And McPick 2 for EUR 5, which we launched in May, resonated well with customers. 
However, these initiatives weren't enough to mitigate ongoing guest count and market share declines. Macroeconomic challenges persist in France. We're enhancing our appeal to customers by offering more compelling options at lower tiers of our menu. We're also pursuing growth opportunity at the premium end through engaging promotions limited-time offers, including the recent New York Street Food event, which successfully drove sales of premium burgers and wraps. 
In the High Growth segment, second quarter comparable sales were up 1.6%, driven by positive performance in China and Russia. Despite the challenging environment, including aggressive discounting by competitors, China's comparable sales were up 2.1% for the quarter. We continue to gain significant market share in IEO and more specifically from Chinese QSRs whilst understating meaningful cost savings initiatives to enhance profitability in this important market.
In an effort to give customers more reason to choose McDonald's, we've introduced appealing new products, like the chicken snack sharing box. In addition, we're expanding our delivery business by tapping into growing digital channels, as well as other vendors, to offer added convenience to Chinese customers. 
In Russia, comparable sales remained positive, driven in part by successful promotions that showcase compelling, affordable menu options across multiple day parts and product categories. Results may be volatile moving forward given continuing macroeconomic uncertainties and lower consumer purchasing power.
I'm encouraged by our continued progress. We're creating a better McDonald's, one that customers will recognize as modern and progressive and a true global leader. Whilst we've come a long way, we recognize there is much more to do. That's why we remain committed to executing our turnaround plan through the end of the year. 
For now, we remain focused on continuing to win within the QSR segment as we give customers more reasons to choose McDonald's. At the same time, we are taking steps to build upon the progress we've made as we chart our long-term strategical path forward within the broader $1.2 trillion informal eating-out market. I am confident McDonald's will generate long-term value for both our system and our shareholders. 
Thanks. I'll now turn it over to Kevin."
139488,372629879,1012421,"McDonald's Corp., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 26, 2016",2016-07-26,"Earnings Calls","McDonald's Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. As a follow-up to Steve's remarks, I'd like to cover the key performance drivers for the quarter, provide an update on our outlook for the second half of 2016 and outline the recent progress we have made against",1445,"Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. As a follow-up to Steve's remarks, I'd like to cover the key performance drivers for the quarter, provide an update on our outlook for the second half of 2016 and outline the recent progress we have made against our financial initiatives. 
Starting with the performance drivers for the quarter. For the quarter as a whole, we're pleased with our efforts to effectively manage restaurant profitability, particularly in light of the industry trends and economic factors that we've experienced in certain markets. 
With more than 80% of our global restaurants franchised, the largest driver of operating income continues to be our franchise margins. For the quarter, growth in global franchise margins was led by the U.S. in the International Lead markets. Franchise margins totaled $1.9 billion, a 6% increase in constant currencies, and contributed about $100 million to our global operating income growth for the quarter. 
Growth in global company-operated margins also contributed to quarterly results as margins rose 150 basis points, with China leading the overall improvement. 
In the U.S., company-operated margins increased by 30 basis points for the quarter as positive comparable sales and favorable commodity costs more than offset the investment we made last July to raise crew wages and enhance benefits for our restaurant employees. Given the magnitude of this investment, the improvement in second-quarter margins is a noteworthy achievement for our U.S. business. 
Moving on to G&A. Our second quarter expenses increased 2% in constant currencies due to higher incentive-based compensation as our a result of our year-to-date performance as well as costs associated with our biannual Owner/Operator Convention in April. Excluding these items, G&A would have decreased. 
Looking ahead, third quarter G&A levels will remain elevated due to our sponsorship of the summer Olympic Games in Rio next month. Taken together, the cost of our worldwide convention and the Olympics are expected to total about $25 million or roughly 1% of our G&A in 2016.
For the full year 2016, we continue to expect G&A in constant currencies to be 1% to 2% below prior year spending levels, excluding changes in incentive-based compensation and any impact from changes in timing of certain refranchising transactions. 
Global operating income for the quarter totaled more than $1.8 billion, up 3% in constant currencies, reflecting roughly $230 million in strategic charges recorded during the quarter. These charges were comprised of noncash impairment related to our ongoing refranchising in Asia and Europe and G&A initiatives as well as the decision to relocate our corporate offices.
Diluted earnings per share for the quarter declined $0.01, which included $0.20 related to the strategic charges and $0.02 in negative foreign currency impact. 
As a reminder, in second quarter 2015, we have strategic charges of $0.04 per share related to restructuring. Excluding the impact of the current and prior year restructuring charges, earnings per share for second quarter 2016 were up 13% in constant currencies.
Turning next to menu pricing and commodity costs. In the U.S., commodity costs declined 4.5% during the second quarter. Looking to the second half of the year, we expect commodity costs to remain favorable, maintaining our outlook for the segment's full year basket of goods to be down 3.5% to 4.5%. Commodity costs for the International Lead segment were down about 1% for the second quarter and are expected to remain relatively flat during the second half of this year. Where possible, we source products in local currency to minimize cost fluctuations, and our suppliers also hedged a portion of foreign currency exposure. So at least in the near term, we don't expect Brexit to significantly impact U.K. commodity prices.
While we are benefiting from favorable commodity cost around the world, we are facing rising labor costs in many of our markets. As a result, we are carefully balancing price increases with a focus on maintaining our strong value proposition, which remains a key pillar of McDonald's brand to drive guest counts. 
In the U.S., second quarter pricing year-over-year was up about 3% compared with ""food away from home"" inflation of 2.6%. Given the widening gap between food-at-home and ""food away from home"" inflation in the U.S., we continue to track both of these metrics very closely. As it stands, food at home is projected to increase modestly from relatively flat to up about 1% for the full year, while ""food away from home"" inflation is projected to increase between 2.5% and 3.5%.
For the International Lead segment, while price increases vary by market, year-over-year increases for these markets average 1.5% to 2%. Next, I'd like to provide an update on the impact of Brexit and our global foreign currency outlook. As I mentioned, we don't expect Brexit to have a significant impact on our near-term commodity prices in the U.K. And as Steve noted earlier, we also haven't seen a significant change in consumer demand in the U.K. since the vote.
While the long-term impact of Brexit is uncertain, in the near-term, the most significant impact on our business will be currency translation. We view our geographic diversification as a key competitive strength. For a perspective, the U.K. represents about 10% of consolidated operating income, and the eurozone collectively represents about 25%. Given recent currency fluctuations, foreign currency translation is now expected to have a more significant impact on our reported results than previously estimated. Based on current exchange rates, we project foreign currency translation to negatively impact our earnings per share by $0.02 to $0.04 in the third quarter and $0.09 to $0.11 for the full year. As always, please take our currency guidance as directional only because rates will change as we move throughout the year.
Beyond the currency impact, we continue to expect variability in quarterly results due to increased volatility in the evolving global economic and geopolitical landscape, as well as uneven prior year comparisons. 
It was just over a year ago, beginning with the announcement of our turnaround plan in May 2015, that we began reshaping our business from our organizational structure and restaurant ownership mix to our capital structure and the strategic allocation of our resources around the world. We've taken decisive actions to pursue each of these opportunities, and we continue to make meaningful progress. 
In the past 6 quarters, we refranchised about 850 restaurants, including over 160 in the second quarter. The large majority of restaurants refranchised to date were sold to existing conventional franchisees. 
Overall, our global refranchising efforts are moving along as expected, and we're pleased with the progress we've made to date. It's important to keep in mind that due to the unique nature and scope of the refranchising activity underway, the more complex, larger refranchising transactions do take time. We remain committed to our refranchising strategy and the benefit that will be realized by moving to a more heavily franchised system from McDonald's globally.
From a G&A standpoint, we remain on track to achieve our net annual savings target of $500 million by 2018, with the vast majority of the savings expected to be realized by the end of 2017. As Steve noted, we are in the midst of transforming our organization. We expect to share more detail on the roles that our organizational restructuring is playing in reaching our G&A goal as part of our third quarter earnings update.
Relative to our capital structure, 2016 represents the final year of our 3-year $30 billion cash return to shareholders target. During the second quarter, we repurchased $3.4 billion of stock, bringing our year-to-date share repurchases to $7.1 billion or 57 million shares. 
In May, we completed a $2.7 billion accelerated share repurchase program and also entered into a new $2.6 billion program, which accounted for a significant portion of the share repurchase activity completed during second quarter.
Through June 2016, the cumulative cash return under our 3-year target stands at $24.4 billion, and we are on track to complete the remaining amount during the back half of this year. 
We've delivered positive results over the last 4 quarters, not just from improving efficiency and working to reduce costs, but most importantly, from top line growth as we've made strides improving the customer experience. These results reinforce my confidence that we're focused on the right things. We're also making good progress in all of the actions we outlined last year. We're actively refranchising restaurants, building stronger G&A discipline and returning more cash to shareholders.

On the industry, your outperformance against the industry this quarter is very similar to last quarter, which suggests the entire industry saw a huge deceleration around 350 basis points. So what do you believe, sitting in your seat, looking at the United States, what are the 2 largest drivers of the softening in the IEO trend? And do see it continuing into the rest of the year? And secondly, on your own business, when you look at lapping All Day Breakfast in the fourth quarter, how are you thinking about the ability to sustain positive trends here as you lap that? Is extending the All Day Breakfast menu enough? Or are there more initiatives required, in your mind?"

And therefore, we are very mindful of our competitive",554,"So on the first one, on the industry, well, clearly, I mean, it's been fairly well documented on the consumer slowdown across most consumer segments, to be honest with you, through the second quarter. And therefore, we are very mindful of our competitive position, the competitive gap. So it was important to us that we maintain that competitive advantage and fought for market share. No, we're not immune from what's happening in the outside world at all, but nor are we letting that deflect our focus on what really matters to us and our customers. I think the general sense is there's a couple of things at play. I mean, first of all, there is a widening gap between food away from home and food at home, where the commodity decreases are being passed through by the grocers. So the food at home is -- there's value to be had for families there, whereas [indiscernible] others if there was a price inflation environment. So that's a small part of it. I think, generally, there's just a broader level of uncertainty in consumers' minds at the moment, both trying to gauge the -- their financial security going forward here. Whether through elections or through global events, people are slightly mindful of an unsettled world. When people are uncertain, when families are uncertain, caution starts to prevail, and they start to hold back on spend. 
And for a business like us, I mean, clearly, we generate a lot of our own business directly, but also, we do benefit from people moving around, going to the malls, driving around, going on vacation. And if people are reigning in their spend across broader categories, that will have a little bit of a flow-through to us as well. 
So we are mindful of it. It just means we've got to be closer to our customers than ever and adapt to make sure that we're building compelling brands in the short term as well as the long. 
In terms of sustaining trends, well, clearly, we plan to grow our business. But at the same time, we're not trying to do that on a ""quarter to quarter to quarter"" basis. Yes, we are mindful of the short term, but we have our eye aligned on the long term. And we believe we've got the number of the right drivers in place to give us sustained, long-term growth here in the U.S. 
Our value platform is here. We continue to learn. So from a McPick 2 for $5, for example, we have our second national campaign in May, and we learn more about it in terms of the items we can have within the bundle and how we position that, all the way through to some of the early markets, where we're testing out the Experience of the Future in the U.S., where we're making a significant -- an exciting rollout program in Florida and, certainly, within New York as well, which, we believe, there is also a mirror of what we're seeing elsewhere in our other major markets, providing very exciting opportunity across the next few years in the U.S. as well. 
So mindful of the short term. We're going to fight for share. But also, we don't want to lose the strategic direction that we believe is right for long-term."

Yes, so I -- if I were to be U.S.-specific, I mean, I referenced earlier the YouGov, like just following on brand perceptions, and we've made really encouraging progress. And I believe that's because as well as trying to drive the business in the immediate term, we've also made the investments and the commitments around food for equality, sustainability, the employment proposition, where not only to be move -- pay for our early phase stuff, but also a far broader, enhanced range of benefits, including trading and education opportunities for them. 
And with a brand like McDonald's, I think you do communicate. So the better you move on every single consumer touch point, then the broader halo in the brand starts to improve. 
So we're encouraged. We've got plenty of plans to maintain our momentum, but it's nice to sit, being recognized by consumers. Part of that is what comes after the basics of running better restaurants. And we've maintained a 6% year-on-year improvement in overall customer satisfaction. When I look into the detail there, we've made the progress on the areas that the team had intended to make the progress. So we've spoken in the past about an attention to order accuracy, particularly in the drive-thru. Our accuracy has improved. The quality of the food perception has improved. Friendliness is improved, all by the order of about 6%, and including speed of service as well. So I believe that day-to-day customer experience also enhances the brand and also just drives out immediate satisfaction. 
In terms of going forward, what's important? I'd say a couple of things. I mean, clearly, continuing the journey we are around food and food quality, both investing in the ingredients, the recipes and the items in the restaurants, as well as the perception on better explaining what's in our food, where it comes from and -- so that's where ""The simpler, the better"" campaign starts to focus. It chronicles the big, meaningful moves we've made and, I believe, signals the direction of travel for us going forward. And as I've said, I'm not going to disclose anything more about it, but there will be more news to come as we know is going to be powerful in the customer agenda and very, very strong for the brand as well. 
The other element that I'm excited to introduce that we will be introducing increasingly in the U.S., because we've seen it work elsewhere in our major, mature markets, is rolling out the Experience of the Future. It's a fundamentally different experience for the customer, and lot of that does involve technology as well as the service expenses as well. So how can we take out the -- any of the interactions that customers have with their experience in McDonald's, whether it's coming into the dining area or going through the drive-thru, how can we take out the non value-added processes in just make a smoother, more enjoyable and easier experience for customers? So at the introduction of self-order chaos, the development of the -- of our mobile apps so they could have -- order in ahead and just check in when you get into the restaurant, it takes out many of those human interactions where complications can arise and just makes it a smoother experience for customers. 
We are seeing a good pickup in sales as we roll this out across U.K., Canada, Australia and early days, but also in Germany as well. So we know we're onto something. We know customers respond well. And certainly, in breathes of new life into our restaurants and into the brand."

You saw in second quarter of this year, we were able to actually grow margins 30 basis points in the U.S. with the 1.8% comp sales, which we were certainly pleased about. As you know, long-term, margins are a top line gain for us. We need to grow comps in order to maintain and improve margins. But what we were able to do this quarter was effectively manage the restaurant profitability as well. So while commodity costs were more favorable this quarter, our management of what we call, controllable costs, both on the food side and the labor side was better this quarter than prior quarters. And so we're pleased that we're doing a better job of managing -- running the restaurant, but also managing the profitability of the restaurants. Going forward, we've always said that we need about a 2% to 3% comp in a normal inflationary environment. That probably hasn't changed much, and there's certainly isn't anything structural that would prevent us from getting back to kind of where we were on high margins in the U.S."

I mean, the reality is the customer experience is critical in just our underlying business momentum. Speed of service has predominantly improved largely because we've got the accuracy element of service far better. So we've enhanced the training and some of the operational procedures through the drive-thru. And you may have heard me talk about a program we called, ""ask, ask, tell,"" which is a way of really ensuring we took -- we both took and then delivered the right order day in, day out to our customers. Once you get your accuracy right, then the whole drive-thru lane just operates fast, smoother. 
We also made significant changes to the merchandise in the drive-thru with more tailored and focused merchandising menu boards, which, again, just made it easier for customers to order and identify the products they want, but also easier for our teams to take and get right. 
So I think that there's a lot of work that's gone on. The real devil in the detail, down to the font size on the order receipts to make sure our teams reflect, and the orderers can gather the right items. 
But also there's a lot of work we're doing in the future, where we believe we can also enhance service, speed and accuracy and get technology to do some of that heavy lifting for us, so whether it's voice recognition in the drive-thru speaker post all the way through to ordering ahead via either the Internet or the app. Now we have elements of this going on around the world. I'm not sure we're going to pull them all together here in one market, but we are going to take those learnings and see how the customers respond to some of the capabilities we're introducing. And clearly, if the response is strong, we can bring that in. And that will help again further enhance speed of service. 
I mean, all the way to -- we have markets where we have curbside collection for our orders. So if you actually order that ahead via the Internet, you can actually just go along to the curbside. And therefore, when you think about it, you've got one satisfied customer who is ordering and collecting and paying exactly how they want. That's also one fewer cargo to the drive-thrus of the existing drive-thru, laying one smoother.
So we're looking at this through a number of different directions. I'm definitely underestimating the day-to-day operation improvements the teams have done so far. But also we're looking at innovation in the future to try and keep it smoother and easier for customers and just easier for our teams to get right."

Yes, absolutely. We recognize that. That doesn't come as a surprise to us. What we want to do is work hard to still have a compelling everyday value proposition on our restaurants. And that can form -- that can take the form of many things. So we've gone with the McPick 2 platform. And again, just to step back and remind why we believe this is strong, it's because it's ground on what customers tell us is most important to them, which is choice and flexibility and not lock them into a certain price point, nor are we locking them into a certain selection of bundled items. So we believe that choice of flexibility is right for our customers and gives us flexibility in new news as we return to these programs across that year. Sometimes, there will be on a national level. If it's not national, it will be locally reinforced in the marketing windows in between. 
So we're continuing to learn. We've only been national with McPick 2 for $5 twice now. And again, the local co-ops have been working on their variations of particularly, the McPick 2 for $2 or other value price point. So we're continuing to learn and evolve that. But is there an transaction trade-off? Yes, there is. We knew that. We planned for that, and we -- but we still believe we have an everyday value proposition. 
And again, it's not just McPick 2. I mean, there's local promotional activity in the co-ops on an ongoing basis, whether it's $1 drink promotion, for example, all the way through to the office we're now offering through the global mobile app. We've had 12 million downloads of that. We've got 8 million registered users on the app. And clearly, the offers and the frequency card on there are driving over the interaction. 
In terms of quarter 4. Clearly, we know the -- if you like the corky cycles we're on, we believe the enhancement to All Day Breakfast will help reinforce the baseline momentum, as does running a better restaurant, as does reinforcing value. That team is certainly working on other activities. There is nothing in particular to share today. But I would say that we are playing the long game here. So we're not going to manage the business. We're mindful of the quarters, but we're not going to manage it by quarter. We believe were getting the right fundamental foundations and platforms in place to reinforced the long-term success and profitability of McDonald's. And we have consciously expanded our business plans and our activity away from just a product and price-led program, which we had been somewhat drawn to in the past. And we believe that the brand-enhancing, long-term perspective, as long as we're winning the short-term market share fight is a good combination for us."

Even more encouraging is in the nearing competition, the QSR market share, where we have made some substantial gains in U.K., Australia, China and Canada. And I think as part of the turnaround, we have really focused on making sure that we win in the most immediate competitive set we are. This is part of the modern progressive burger company ambition, which is make sure we're strong and dominant in our immediate sector. And then we start to take IEO share as we broaden the experience. I believe the Experience of the Future will have us fight increasingly in a -- into an increasing stronger position in the broader IEO. In the immediate term, it was getting the basics of the business right so we win to ourself market share. And I've shared over a number of these calls meetings, we've had about some of the successes in Australia and Canada, for instance. But the customer experience is noticeably different than it was 3 to 4 years ago, both from the designs of the restaurant, the introduction of technology, the substantially enhanced front-of-house hospitality that we now offer, all the way through to providing more options to customize your food by a self-order kiosks, for example, in the dining years. And now we're extending that to table service. So this is -- if a customer is to walk in now versus 2, 3, 4 years ago, it would be a noticeably different experience. And I believe that is both winning QSR share and IEO share. And those are the sorts of ideas that, with the new structure we have, we are looking to move and are moving very, very quickly between markets."

We would expect similar -- that we would also be able to improve operating margins going forward based on the activity. As you indicate, we're certainly not going to throw a number out there.

And what you'll see is in generally, in our major significant mature markets, that's the U.S. and International Lead markets, you'll see more of a conventional franchising, which is what we do in the U.S. So you would have seen some more conventional franchising, certainly, in this quarter, and there will likely be further franchising like that. 
In countries, certainly in certain parts of Asia and Europe, where either it's a bit more volatile from an economic and political standpoint and/or a partner can help us accelerate growth and grow faster than maybe we're willing to put in capital right now, those situations you will likely see us using that developmental license model that we view successfully for many years in a lot of the countries. All of the transaction that we have planned right now, we're taking into consideration when we came up with that $500 million of G&A reduction. So the $500 million contemplated all of the transactions that we have, kind of in our plans at this point. So none of those activities will, in and of themselves, drive further G&A reduction. That doesn't mean that we're not going to continue to look for efficiencies and run  the business in a disciplined manner. But you shouldn't expect that because we completed a franchising transaction or anything along those lines that, that would trigger automatically a further or additional G&A cut in addition to the $500 million."

Midway through 2016, I'm encouraged by the progress we've made in turning around our business and the way we've challenged legacy thinking, acting with greater urgency and shared successes more quickly across markets. These actions underlie the positive momentum that continued in second quarter, marking 4 consecutive quarters of positive comparable sales growth across all segments and franchisee cash flows at all-time highs in many markets. 
More specifically, global comparable sales increased 3.1% for the quarter. Operating income was up 3% in constant currencies and earnings per share was up 1% in constant currencies. Excluding the impact of the current and prior year strategic charges, earnings per share for the quarter was up 13% in constant currencies. 
As we entered 2016, we expected quarterly results to be variable throughout the year. Our top line performance in second quarter, while positive, reflects slower growth, due in part to challenging conditions in several countries. 
I'm encouraged that we continue to win relative to our QSR competitors in key markets around the world. In the U.S, our comparable sales gap versus the QSR sandwich segment was consistently positive and averaged 130 basis points for the quarter despite softer industry growth. Our balanced focus on All Day Breakfast, value and relevant promotions, including Monopoly, contributed to top line performance. 
In Australia, Canada and the U.K., we are gaining significant market share within the IEO segment and, in particular, relative to our traditional QSR competitors. Our formula for success in these markets is consistent: Commitment to running great restaurants, coupled with initiatives that create customer excitement across our menu, promotion and value offers, all supported by strong alignment with franchisees.
Early last year, we put the customer back at the center of everything we're doing. That mindset ignited our turnaround and continues to guide our decision-making, as evidenced by the enhancements we are making to the All Day Breakfast menu in the U.S., the leadership moves we've made around sustainability and the significant progress we're making to create a more modern customer experience as part of the Experience of the Future.
Over the past few quarters, we've heard from customers looking for more choices in the All Day Breakfast menu. Those with muffin sandwiches on the menu ask for biscuits. Those with biscuits sandwiches on the menu ask for muffins. We listened, worked through the operational challenges, and this fall, we'll begin offering muffins, biscuits and McGriddles all day in all U.S. restaurants. 
Under the broader food-quality umbrella, we continue to take a leadership stance of sustainability because it's the right thing to do for our business, society and the world at large. 
In Canada, we are breaking ground in the beef industry with our recently concluded sustainable beef pilots, part of our work with ranches and larger producers around the globe to measure and track sustainable beef from farm to fork.
Sustainability matters to our customers, and it matters to us. At the same time Experience of the Future is quickly coming to life in key markets around the world. For example, in Canada, over half of our restaurants have been fully converted. U.K. is almost 40%, and France is at nearly 25% with table service in about 80% of restaurants. This marks significant progress from where we were just 3 months ago.
The customers are noticing the steps we're taking to build a better McDonald's. The most recent customer satisfaction scores reflect improvements in 7 of our 9 largest markets. In the U.S., we are seeing further evidence of improved brand perceptions according to a recent YouGov report that measures consumer perceptions across 1,400 brands. McDonald's was ranked fourth most-improved brand across all brands measured and the most improved within QSR.
We're taking smart risks to address what matters most to customers. We also are being smarter about our structure and resources and prioritizing our activities to deliver the greatest impact. This includes putting more restaurants in the hands of dedicated franchisees, getting us closer to the customers and communities we serve, and unleashes more entrepreneurial spirit, risk-taking and innovation across the system, ultimately accelerating growth.
At the same time, we are further streamlining how we operate. We're in the midst of rightsizing our organization, taking a critical look at how we can reduce layers to be more agile in our decision-making. We also recently announced the relocation of our corporate headquarters. Our new location will support greater collaboration and innovation, help us better attract and retain talent and move us toward a more modern progressive culture with the added benefit of reducing costs. These are all important steps forward in our journey to building a better McDonald's. 
With that context, let's now turn to performance highlights in our major markets. Beginning with the U.S., comparable sales for second quarter increased 1.8%. Whilst modestly positive, this growth was not as strong as the last 2 quarters. This is due in part to the recent softening of the IEO industry which experienced minimal growth for the trailing 12-month period ending in May, at only 40 basis points. 
The All Day Breakfast platform continues to contribute to top line momentum to draw new customers into our restaurants and create additional reasons for existing customers to visit more often. This is also delivering bottom line growth with restaurant-level cash flows up for the third consecutive quarter. 
Franchisees are excited about our platform and its future growth potential. And the next phase of All Day Breakfast, which I mentioned earlier, was voted in with an overwhelming approval rating exceeding 99%. 
With food, we continue to enhance quality perceptions around our core menu, and we've been more vocal about the improvements we've made. Just last week, we launched our new brand campaign called, ""The simpler, the better,"" which highlights the progress we've made in the areas that matter most to our customers. And we'll have even more news to share in the coming weeks.
Value remains a top priority in the U.S. Franchisees have embraced the McPick 2 value platform at both the national and local levels. We're tapping into the flexibility this platform provides in terms of products and price points to enhance our appeal to a broader population of value-seeking customers, which is increasingly important given softer IEO industry trends.
Although the progress we've made in the U.S. is encouraging, our most significant opportunity continues to be bringing customers into our restaurants more often. As such, we are actively exploring new ways of increasing the frequency of visits from our loyal customers and win back customers we've lost.
Let's now turn to the International Lead segment. Second quarter comparable sales increased 2.6%, with 4 of the top 5 markets delivering positive comparable sales for the quarter. France was the exception with results that were relatively flat. 
Whilst the recent Brexit vote has created uncertainty in the U.K. and across Europe, our business remains strong, and we are confident in our ability to manage through the change. Having operated in these markets for over 40 years, we are accustomed to dealing with external challenges. I believe we are well positioned to seek out the opportunities it provides to build upon the strength of our U.K. business.
In fact, the U.K. market's long track record of success continued into second quarter. Compelling promotions, limited time offers such as the relaunch of Big Flavour Wraps and positive performance from Experience of the Future restaurants drove growth in both average check and guest counts, with guest count volume breaking all-time monthly highs in April and May. 
In Canada, our continued focus on lunch, along with successful marketing campaigns and positive performance from their Experience of the Future Restaurants, drove solid sales and guest count momentum into the second quarter.
Performance of All Day Breakfast in Australia is mirroring the success in the U.S., driving incremental sales by providing customers with even more reasons to visit McDonald's. 
In addition, we continue to fuel growth in more established platforms, like Experience of the Future and McCaf√©. We're introducing new customizable flavors and ingredients, supported by engaging marketing and promotional campaigns to create energy and excitement for our customers.
Sales were slightly positive in Germany for the second quarter. With the heavy concentration of price-conscious customers, value remains a critical priority. The new pricing structure we rolled out in February continues to perform in line with expectations. And McPick 2 for EUR 5, which we launched in May, resonated well with customers. 
However, these initiatives weren't enough to mitigate ongoing guest count and market share declines. Macroeconomic challenges persist in France. We're enhancing our appeal to customers by offering more compelling options at lower tiers of our menu. We're also pursuing growth opportunities at the premium end through engaging promotions and limited-time offers, including the recent New York Street Food event, which successfully drove sales of premium burgers and wraps. 
In the High Growth segment, second quarter comparable sales were up 1.6%, driven by positive performance in China and Russia. Despite the challenging environment, including aggressive discounting by competitors, China's comparable sales were up 2.1% for the quarter. We continue to gain significant market share in IEO, and more specifically from Chinese QSRs, whilst understating meaningful cost savings initiatives to enhance profitability in this important market.
In an effort to give customers more reason to choose McDonald's, we've introduced appealing new products, like the chicken snack sharing box. In addition, we're expanding our delivery business by tapping into growing digital channels, as well as other vendors, to offer added convenience to Chinese customers. 
In Russia, comparable sales remained positive, driven in part by successful promotions that showcase compelling, affordable menu options across multiple day parts and product categories. Results may be volatile moving forward given continuing macroeconomic uncertainties and lower consumer purchasing power.
I'm encouraged by our continued progress. We're creating a better McDonald's, one that customers will recognize as modern and progressive and a true global leader. Whilst we've come a long way, we recognize there is much more to do. That's why we remain committed to executing our turnaround plan through the end of the year. 
For now, we remain focused on continuing to win within the QSR segment as we give customers more reasons to choose McDonald's. At the same time, we are taking steps to build upon the progress we've made as we chart our long-term strategical path forward within the broader $1.2 trillion informal eating-out market. I am confident McDonald's will generate long-term value for both our system and our shareholders. 
Thanks. I'll now turn it over to Kevin."
139488,372629879,1012577,"McDonald's Corp., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 26, 2016",2016-07-26,"Earnings Calls","McDonald's Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. As a follow-up to Steve's remarks, I'd like to cover the key performance drivers for the quarter, provide an update on our outlook for the second half of 2016 and outline the recent progress we have made against",1435,"Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. As a follow-up to Steve's remarks, I'd like to cover the key performance drivers for the quarter, provide an update on our outlook for the second half of 2016 and outline the recent progress we have made against our financial initiatives. 
Starting with the performance drivers for the quarter. For the quarter as a whole, we're pleased with our efforts to effectively manage restaurant profitability, particularly in light of the industry trends and economic factors that we've experienced in certain markets. 
With more than 80% of our global restaurants franchised, the largest driver of operating income continues to be our franchise margins. For the quarter, growth in global franchise margins was led by the U.S. and the International Lead markets. Franchise margins totaled $1.9 billion, a 6% increase in constant currencies, and contributed about $100 million to our global operating income growth for the quarter. 
Growth in global company-operated margins also contributed to quarterly results as margins rose 150 basis points, with China leading the overall improvement. 
In the U.S., company-operated margins increased by 30 basis points for the quarter, as positive comparable sales and favorable commodity costs more than offset the investment we made last July to raise crew wages and enhance benefits for our restaurant employees. Given the magnitude of this investment, the improvement in second quarter margins is a noteworthy achievement for our U.S. business. 
Moving on to G&A. Our second quarter expenses increased 2% in constant currencies due to higher incentive-based compensation as our a result of our year-to-date performance as well as costs associated with our biennial Owner/Operator Convention in April. Excluding these items, G&A would have decreased. 
Looking ahead, third quarter G&A levels will remain elevated due to our sponsorship of the Summer Olympic Games in Rio next month. Taken together, the cost of our worldwide convention and the Olympics are expected to total about $25 million or roughly 1% of our G&A in 2016.
For the full year 2016, we continue to expect G&A in constant currencies to be 1% to 2% below prior year spending levels, excluding changes in incentive-based compensation and any impact from changes in timing of certain refranchising transactions. 
Global operating income for the quarter totaled more than $1.8 billion, up 3% in constant currencies, reflecting roughly $230 million in strategic charges recorded during the quarter. These charges were comprised of noncash impairment related to our ongoing refranchising in Asia and Europe and G&A initiatives, as well as the decision to relocate our corporate offices.
Diluted earnings per share for the quarter declined $0.01, which included $0.20 related to the strategic charges and $0.02 in negative foreign currency impact. 
As a reminder, in second quarter 2015, we have strategic charges of $0.04 per share related to restructuring. Excluding the impact of the current and prior year restructuring charges, earnings per share for second quarter 2016 were up 13% in constant currencies.
Turning next to menu pricing and commodity costs. In the U.S., commodity costs declined 4.5% during the second quarter. Looking to the second half of the year, we expect commodity costs to remain favorable, maintaining our outlook for the segment's full year basket of goods to be down 3.5% to 4.5%. Commodity costs for the International Lead segment were down about 1% for the second quarter and are expected to remain relatively flat during the second half of this year. Where possible, we source products in local currency to minimize cost fluctuations, and our suppliers also hedge a portion of foreign currency exposure. So at least in the near term, we don't expect Brexit to significantly impact U.K. commodity prices.
While we are benefiting from favorable commodity cost around the world, we are facing rising labor costs in many of our markets. As a result, we are carefully balancing price increases with a focus on maintaining our strong value proposition, which remains a key pillar of McDonald's brand to drive guest counts. 
In the U.S., second quarter pricing year-over-year was up about 3% compared with food-away-from-home inflation of 2.6%. Given the widening gap between food-at-home and food-away-from-home inflation in the U.S., we continue to track both of these metrics very closely. As it stands, food at home is projected to increase modestly from relatively flat to up about 1% for the full year, while food-away-from-home inflation is projected to increase between 2.5% and 3.5%.
For the International Lead segment, while price increases vary by market, year-over-year increases for these markets average 1.5% to 2%. Next, I'd like to provide an update on the impact of Brexit and our global foreign currency outlook. As I mentioned, we don't expect Brexit to have a significant impact on our near-term commodity prices in the U.K. And as Steve noted earlier, we also haven't seen a significant change in consumer demand in the U.K. since the vote.
While the long-term impact of Brexit is uncertain, in the near term, the most significant impact on our business will be currency translation. We view our geographic diversification as a key competitive strength. For perspective, the U.K. represents about 10% of consolidated operating income, and the Eurozone collectively represents about 25%. Given recent currency fluctuations, foreign currency translation is now expected to have a more significant impact on our reported results than previously estimated. Based on current exchange rates, we project foreign currency translation to negatively impact our earnings per share by $0.02 to $0.04 in the third quarter and $0.09 to $0.11 for the full year. As always, please take our currency guidance as directional only because rates will change as we move throughout the year.
Beyond the currency impact, we continue to expect variability in quarterly results due to increased volatility in the evolving global economic and geopolitical landscape, as well as uneven prior year comparisons. 
It was just over a year ago, beginning with the announcement of our turnaround plan in May 2015, that we began reshaping our business, from our organizational structure and restaurant ownership mix to our capital structure and the strategic allocation of our resources around the world. We've taken decisive actions to pursue each of these opportunities, and we continue to make meaningful progress. 
In the past 6 quarters, we refranchised about 850 restaurants, including over 160 in the second quarter. The large majority of restaurants refranchised to date were sold to existing conventional franchisees. 
Overall, our global refranchising efforts are moving along as expected, and we're pleased with the progress we've made to date. It's important to keep in mind that due to the unique nature and scope of the refranchising activity underway, the more complex, larger refranchising transactions do take time. We remain committed to our refranchising strategy and the benefit that will be realized by moving to a more heavily franchised system for McDonald's globally.
From a G&A standpoint, we remain on track to achieve our net annual savings target of $500 million by 2018, with the vast majority of the savings expected to be realized by the end of 2017. As Steve noted, we are in the midst of transforming our organization. We expect to share more detail on the role that our organizational restructuring is playing in reaching our G&A goal as part of our third quarter earnings update.
Relative to our capital structure, 2016 represents the final year of our 3-year $30 billion cash return-to-shareholders target. During the second quarter, we repurchased $3.4 billion of stock, bringing our year-to-date share repurchases to $7.1 billion or 57 million shares. 
In May, we completed a $2.7 billion accelerated share repurchase program and also entered into a new $2.6 billion program, which accounted for a significant portion of the share repurchase activity completed during second quarter.
Through June 2016, the cumulative cash return under our 3-year target stands at $24.4 billion, and we are on track to complete the remaining amount during the back half of this year. 
We've delivered positive results over the last 4 quarters, not just from improving efficiency and working to reduce costs, but most importantly, from top line growth as we've made strides improving the customer experience. These results reinforce my confidence that we're focused on the right things. We're also making good progress on all of the actions we outlined last year. We're actively refranchising restaurants, building stronger G&A discipline and returning more cash to shareholders. The strategic changes we're making and the actions we've taken over the course of the last year are positioning us to optimize our business operations and deliver sustained, profitable growth. 
Thanks. Now I'll turn it over to Chris to begin our Q&A."

On the industry, your outperformance against the industry this quarter is very similar to last quarter, which suggests the entire industry saw a huge deceleration around 350 basis points. So what do you believe, sitting in your seat, looking at the United States, what are the 2 largest drivers of the softening in the IEO trend? And do see it continuing into the rest of the year? And secondly, on your own business, when you look at lapping All Day Breakfast in the fourth quarter, how are you thinking about the ability to sustain positive trends here as you lap that? Is extending the All Day Breakfast menu enough? Or are there more initiatives required, in your mind?"

And therefore, we are very mindful of our competitive position, the competitive gap. So it was important to us that we maintain that competitive advantage and fought for market share. We're not immune from what's happening in the outside world at all, but nor are we letting that deflect our focus on what really matters to us and our customers. I think the general sense is there's a couple of things at play. I mean, first of all, there is a widening gap between food away from home and food at home, where the commodity decreases are being passed through by the grocers. So the food at home is -- there's value to be had for families there, whereas eating out, there is a price inflation environment. So that's a small part of it. I think, generally, there's just a broader level of uncertainty in consumers' minds at the moment, both trying to gauge the -- their financial security going forward here. Whether through elections or through global events, people are slightly mindful of an unsettled world. When people are uncertain, when families are uncertain, caution starts to prevail, and they start to hold back on spend. 
And for a business like us, I mean, clearly, we generate a lot of our own business directly, but also, we do benefit from people moving around, going to the malls, driving around, going on vacations. And if people are reining in their spend across broader categories, that will have a little bit of a flow-through to us as well. 
So we are mindful of it. It just means we've got to be closer to our customers than ever and adapt to make sure that we're building compelling brands in the short term as well as the long. 
In terms of sustaining trends, well, clearly, we plan to grow our business. But at the same time, we're not trying to do that on a ""quarter to quarter to quarter"" basis. Yes, we are mindful of the short term, but we have our eye aligned on the long term. And we believe we've got a number of the right drivers in place to give us sustained, long-term growth here in the U.S. 
Our value platform is -- we continue to learn. So for a McPick 2 for $5, for example, we had our second national campaign in May, and we learned more about it in terms of the items we can have within the bundle and how we position that, all the way through to some of the early markets where we're testing out the Experience of the Future in the U.S., where we're making a significant -- an exciting rollout program in Florida and, certainly, within New York as well, which, we believe, the results there mirror what we're seeing elsewhere in our other major markets, providing a very exciting opportunity across the next few years in the U.S. as well. 
So mindful of the short term. We're going to fight for share. But also, we don't want to lose the strategic direction that we believe is right for long term."

Yes, so I -- if I were to be U.S.-specific, I mean, I referenced earlier the YouGov, like [ph] just following on brand perceptions, and we've made really encouraging progress. And I believe that's because as well as trying to drive the business in the immediate term, we've also made the investments and the commitments around food, food quality, sustainability, the employment proposition, where not only did we move pay for our hourly paid staff, but also a far broader, enhanced range of benefits, including training and education opportunities for them. 
And with a brand like McDonald's, everything you do communicates. So the better you move on every single consumer touch point, then the broader halo in the brand starts to improve. 
So we're encouraged. We've got plenty of plans to maintain our momentum, but it's nice to see it being recognized by consumers. Part of that is what comes out of the basics of running better restaurants. And we've maintained a 6% year-on-year improvement in overall customer satisfaction. When I look into the detail there, we've made the progress on the areas that the team had intended to make the progress. So we've spoken in the past about an attention to order accuracy, particularly in the drive-thru. Our accuracy has improved, the quality of the food perception has improved, friendliness has improved, all by the order of about 6%, and including speed of service as well. So I believe that day-to-day customer experience also enhances the brand and also just drives that immediate satisfaction. 
In terms of going forward, what's important? I'd say a couple of things. I mean, clearly, continuing the journey we are around food and food quality, both investing in the ingredients, the recipes and the items in the restaurants, as well as the perception and better explaining what's in our food, where it comes from and -- so that's where ""The simpler, the better"" campaign starts to focus. It chronicles the big, meaningful moves we've made and, I believe, signals the direction of travel for us going forward. And as I've said, I'm not going to disclose anything more about it, but there will be more news to come, which we know is going to be powerful in the customer agenda and very, very strong for the brand as well. 
The other element that I'm excited to introduce that we will be introducing increasingly in the U.S., because we've seen it work elsewhere in our major, mature markets, is rolling out the Experience of the Future. It's a fundamentally different experience for the customer, and a lot of that does involve technology as well as the service experience as well. So how can we take out the -- any of the interactions that customers have with their experience in McDonald's, whether it's coming into the dining area or going through the drive-thru, how can we take out the non-value-added processes and just make it a smoother, more enjoyable and easier experience for customers? So the introduction of self-order kiosks, the development of the -- of our mobile apps so they could order in ahead and just check in when you get into the restaurant, it takes out many of those human interactions where complications can arise and just makes it a smoother experience for customers. 
We are seeing a good pickup in sales as we roll this out across U.K., Canada, Australia and early days, but also in Germany as well. So we know we're onto something. We know customers respond well. And certainly, it breathes a lot of new life into our restaurants and into the brand."

As you know, long term, margins are a top line game for us. We need to grow comps in order to maintain and improve margins. But what we were able to do this quarter was effectively manage the restaurant profitability as well. So while commodity costs were more favorable this quarter, our management of what we call controllable costs, both on the food side and the labor side, was better this quarter than prior quarters. And so we're pleased that we're doing a better job of managing -- running the restaurant, but also managing the profitability of the restaurants. Going forward, we've always said that we need about a 2% to 3% comp in a normal inflationary environment. That probably hasn't changed much, and there certainly isn't anything structural that would prevent us from getting back to kind of where we were on high margins in the U.S."

I mean, the reality is the customer experience is critical in just our underlying business momentum. Speed of service has predominantly improved, largely because we've got the accuracy element of service far better. So we've enhanced the training and some of the operational procedures through the drive-thru. And you may have heard me talk about a program we called, ""ask, ask, tell,"" which is a way of really ensuring we took -- we both took and then delivered the right order day in, day out to our customers. Once you get your accuracy right, then the whole drive-thru lane just operates far smoother. 
We also made significant changes to the merchandising in the drive-thru with more tailored and focused merchandising menu boards, which, again, just made it easier for customers to order and identify the products they want, but also easier for our teams to take and get right. 
So I think that there's a lot of work that's gone on. The real devil in the detail, down to the font size on the order receipts to make sure our teams that are collecting the orders can gather the right items. 
But also there's a lot of work we're doing in the future, where we believe we can also enhance service, speed and accuracy and get technology to do some of that heavy lifting for us, so whether it's voice recognition in the drive-thru speaker post all the way through to ordering ahead via either the Internet or the app. Now we have elements of this going on around the world. I'm not sure we're going to pull them all together here in one market, but we are going to take those learnings and see how the customer responds to some of the capabilities we're introducing. And clearly, if the response is strong, we can bring that in. And that will help, again, further enhance speed of service. 
I mean, all the way to -- we have markets where we have curbside collection for our orders. So if you actually order that ahead via the Internet, you can actually just go along to curbside. And therefore, when you think about it, you've got one satisfied customer who is ordering and collecting and paying exactly how they want. That's also one fewer car going through the drive-thru so the existing drive-thru lane runs smoother.
So we're looking at this from a number of different directions. I'm definitely not underestimating the day-to-day operation improvements the teams have done so far. But also we're looking at innovation in the future to try and keep it smoother and easier for customers and just easier for our teams to get right."

And one thing I would want to say is that when we have offers redeemed through the global mobile app, we see an average check increase. When we see the breakfast items bought during the main day part, we also see an average check increase. So part of it is not just price driven. It's actually product mix and bundling driven. 
I don't particularly want to talk to the monthly trends because we've got away from that. I just don't think, honestly, that's very valuable. I guess what I would say across the quarter is there wasn't really a deeply meaningful trend one way or the other. We consistently performed and we consistently outperformed the market. 
And if I look at the competitive gap week to week to week, which, clearly, we do, we had a pretty consistent outperformance right across the 13-week period. I don't know if, Kevin, you want to add anything to that."

Yes, absolutely. We recognize that. That doesn't come as a surprise to us. What we want to do is work hard to still have a compelling everyday value proposition in our restaurants. And that can form -- that can take the form of many things. So we've gone with the McPick 2 platform. And again, just to step back and remind why we believe this is strong, it's because it's grounded in what customers tell us is most important to them, which is choice and flexibility and not locking them into a certain price point, nor are we locking them into a certain selection of bundled items. So we believe that choice and flexibility is right for our customers and gives us flexibility and new news as we return to these programs across a year. Sometimes, they will be on a national level. If it's not national, it will be locally reinforced in the marketing windows in between. 
So we're continuing to learn. We've only been national with McPick 2 for $5 twice now. And again, the local co-ops have been working on their variations of, particularly, the McPick 2 for $2 or other value price point. So we're continuing to learn and evolve that. But is there a transaction trade-off? Yes, there is. We knew that. We planned for that, and we -- but we still believe we have an everyday value proposition. 
And again, it's not just McPick 2. I mean, there's local promotional activity in the co-ops on an ongoing basis, whether it's a $1 drink promotion, for example, all the way through to the offers we're now offering through the global mobile app. We've had 12 million downloads of that. We've got 8 million registered users on the app. And clearly, the offers and the frequency card on there are driving a lot of the interaction. 
In terms of quarter 4. Clearly, we know the, if you like, the core key [ph] cycles we're on. We believe the enhancement to All Day Breakfast will help reinforce the baseline momentum, as does running a better restaurant, as does reinforcing value. The team is certainly working on other activities. There is nothing in particular to share today. But I would say that we are playing the long game here. So we're not going to manage the business -- we're mindful of the quarters, but we're not going to manage it by quarter. We believe we're getting the right fundamental foundations and platforms in place to reinforce the long-term success and profitability of McDonald's. And we have consciously expanded our business plans and our activity away from just a product and price-led program, which we had been somewhat drawn to in the past. And we believe that the brand-enhancing, long-term perspective, as long as we're winning the short-term market share fight, is a good combination for us."

Even more encouraging is in the nearing competition, the QSR market share, where we have made some substantial gains in U.K., Australia, China and Canada. And I think as part of the turnaround, we have really focused on making sure that we win in the most immediate competitive set we are. This is part of the modern progressive burger company ambition, which is make sure we're strong and dominant in our immediate sector. And then we start to take IEO share as we broaden the experience. I believe the Experience of the Future will have us fight increasingly in a -- into an increasingly stronger position in the broader IEO. In the immediate term, it was getting the basics of the business right so we win QSR market share. And I've shared over a number of these calls and meetings we've had about some of the successes in Australia and Canada, for instance. But the customer experience is noticeably different than it was 3 to 4 years ago, both from the designs of the restaurant, the introduction of technology, the substantially enhanced front-of-house hospitality that we now offer, all the way through to providing more options to customize your food via self-order kiosks, for example, in the dining areas. And now we're extending that to table service. So this is -- if a customer is to walk in now versus 2, 3, 4 years ago, it would be a noticeably different experience.

Effectively, we're swapping company-operated margin dollars for franchised margin dollars, and certainly, then spending less G&A and capital to generate those franchise margin dollars.

We would expect similar -- that we would also be able to improve operating margins going forward based on the activity. As you indicate, we're certainly not going to throw a number out there.

In countries, certainly in certain parts of Asia and Europe, where either it's a little bit more volatile from an economic and political standpoint and/or a partner can help us accelerate growth and grow faster than maybe we're willing to put in capital right now, those situations you will likely see us using that developmental license model that we've used successfully for many years in a lot of the countries. All of the transactions that we have planned right now were taken into consideration when we came up with that $500 million of G&A reduction. So the $500 million contemplated all of the transactions that we have kind of in our plans at this point. So none of those activities will, in and of themselves, drive further G&A reduction.

But you shouldn't expect that because we completed a franchising transaction or anything along those lines that, that would trigger automatically a further or additional G&A cut in addition to the $500 million."

Midway through 2016, I'm encouraged by the progress we've made in turning around our business and the way we've challenged legacy thinking, acting with greater urgency and shared successes more quickly across markets. These actions underlie the positive momentum that continued in second quarter, marking 4 consecutive quarters of positive comparable sales growth across all segments and franchisee cash flows at all-time highs in many markets. 
More specifically, global comparable sales increased 3.1% for the quarter. Operating income was up 3% in constant currencies and earnings per share was up 1% in constant currencies. Excluding the impact of the current and prior year strategic charges, earnings per share for the quarter was up 13% in constant currencies. 
As we entered 2016, we expected quarterly results to be variable throughout the year. Our top line performance in second quarter, while positive, reflects slower growth, due in part to challenging conditions in several countries. 
I'm encouraged that we continue to win relative to our QSR competitors in key markets around the world. In the U.S, our comparable sales gap versus the QSR sandwich segment was consistently positive and averaged 130 basis points for the quarter despite softer industry growth. Our balanced focus on All Day Breakfast, value and relevant promotions, including Monopoly, contributed to top line performance. 
In Australia, Canada and the U.K., we are gaining significant market share within the IEO segment and, in particular, relative to our traditional QSR competitors. Our formula for success in these markets is consistent: Commitment to running great restaurants, coupled with initiatives that create customer excitement across our menu, promotion and value offers, all supported by strong alignment with franchisees.
Early last year, we put the customer back at the center of everything we're doing. That mindset ignited our turnaround and continues to guide our decision-making, as evidenced by the enhancements we are making to the All Day Breakfast menu in the U.S., the leadership moves we've made around sustainability and the significant progress we're making to create a more modern customer experience as part of the Experience of the Future.
Over the past few quarters, we've heard from customers looking for more choices in the All Day Breakfast menu. Those with muffin sandwiches on the menu ask for biscuits. Those with biscuits sandwiches on the menu ask for muffins. We listened, worked through the operational challenges, and this fall, we'll begin offering muffins, biscuits and McGriddles all day in all U.S. restaurants. 
Under the broader food-quality umbrella, we continue to take a leadership stance of sustainability because it's the right thing to do for our business, society and the world at large. 
In Canada, we are breaking ground in the beef industry with our recently concluded sustainable beef pilots, part of our work with ranches and larger producers around the globe to measure and track sustainable beef from farm to fork.
Sustainability matters to our customers, and it matters to us. At the same time Experience of the Future is quickly coming to life in key markets around the world. For example, in Canada, over half of our restaurants have been fully converted. U.K. is almost 40%, and France is at nearly 25% with table service in about 80% of restaurants. This marks significant progress from where we were just 3 months ago.
The customers are noticing the steps we're taking to build a better McDonald's. The most recent customer satisfaction scores reflect improvements in 7 of our 9 largest markets. In the U.S., we are seeing further evidence of improved brand perceptions according to a recent YouGov report that measures consumer perceptions across 1,400 brands. McDonald's was ranked fourth most-improved brand across all brands measured and the most improved within QSR.
We're taking smart risks to address what matters most to customers. We also are being smarter about our structure and resources and prioritizing our activities to deliver the greatest impact. This includes putting more restaurants in the hands of dedicated franchisees, getting us closer to the customers and communities we serve, and unleashes more entrepreneurial spirit, risk-taking and innovation across the system, ultimately accelerating growth.
At the same time, we are further streamlining how we operate. We're in the midst of rightsizing our organization, taking a critical look at how we can reduce layers to be more agile in our decision-making. We also recently announced the relocation of our corporate headquarters. Our new location will support greater collaboration and innovation, help us better attract and retain talent and move us toward a more modern progressive culture with the added benefit of reducing costs. These are all important steps forward in our journey to building a better McDonald's. 
With that context, let's now turn to performance highlights in our major markets. Beginning with the U.S., comparable sales for second quarter increased 1.8%. Whilst modestly positive, this growth was not as strong as the last 2 quarters. This is due in part to the recent softening of the IEO industry which experienced minimal growth for the trailing 12-month period ending in May, at only 40 basis points. 
The All Day Breakfast platform continues to contribute to top line momentum to draw new customers into our restaurants and create additional reasons for existing customers to visit more often. This is also delivering bottom line growth with restaurant-level cash flows up for the third consecutive quarter. 
Franchisees are excited about our platform and its future growth potential. And the next phase of All Day Breakfast, which I mentioned earlier, was voted in with an overwhelming approval rating exceeding 99%. 
With food, we continue to enhance quality perceptions around our core menu, and we've been more vocal about the improvements we've made. Just last week, we launched our new brand campaign called, ""The simpler, the better,"" which highlights the progress we've made in the areas that matter most to our customers. And we'll have even more news to share in the coming weeks.
Value remains a top priority in the U.S. Franchisees have embraced the McPick 2 value platform at both the national and local levels. We're tapping into the flexibility this platform provides in terms of products and price points to enhance our appeal to a broader population of value-seeking customers, which is increasingly important given softer IEO industry trends.
Although the progress we've made in the U.S. is encouraging, our most significant opportunity continues to be bringing customers into our restaurants more often. As such, we are actively exploring new ways of increasing the frequency of visits from our loyal customers and win back customers we've lost.
Let's now turn to the International Lead segment. Second quarter comparable sales increased 2.6%, with 4 of the top 5 markets delivering positive comparable sales for the quarter. France was the exception with results that were relatively flat. 
Whilst the recent Brexit vote has created uncertainty in the U.K. and across Europe, our business remains strong, and we are confident in our ability to manage through the change. Having operated in these markets for over 40 years, we are accustomed to dealing with external challenges. I believe we are well positioned to seek out the opportunities it provides to build upon the strength of our U.K. business.
In fact, the U.K. market's long track record of success continued into second quarter. Compelling promotions, limited time offers such as the relaunch of Big Flavour Wraps and positive performance from Experience of the Future restaurants drove growth in both average check and guest counts, with guest count volume breaking all-time monthly highs in April and May. 
In Canada, our continued focus on lunch, along with successful marketing campaigns and positive performance from their Experience of the Future Restaurants, drove solid sales and guest count momentum into the second quarter.
Performance of All Day Breakfast in Australia is mirroring the success in the U.S., driving incremental sales by providing customers with even more reasons to visit McDonald's. 
In addition, we continue to fuel growth in more established platforms, like Experience of the Future and McCaf√©. We're introducing new customizable flavors and ingredients, supported by engaging marketing and promotional campaigns to create energy and excitement for our customers.
Sales were slightly positive in Germany for the second quarter. With the heavy concentration of price-conscious customers, value remains a critical priority. The new pricing structure we rolled out in February continues to perform in line with expectations. And McPick 2 for EUR 5, which we launched in May, resonated well with customers. 
However, these initiatives weren't enough to mitigate ongoing guest count and market share declines. Macroeconomic challenges persist in France. We're enhancing our appeal to customers by offering more compelling options at lower tiers of our menu. We're also pursuing growth opportunities at the premium end through engaging promotions and limited-time offers, including the recent New York Street Food event, which successfully drove sales of premium burgers and wraps. 
In the High Growth segment, second quarter comparable sales were up 1.6%, driven by positive performance in China and Russia. Despite the challenging environment, including aggressive discounting by competitors, China's comparable sales were up 2.1% for the quarter. We continue to gain significant market share in IEO, and more specifically from Chinese QSRs, whilst understating meaningful cost savings initiatives to enhance profitability in this important market.
In an effort to give customers more reason to choose McDonald's, we've introduced appealing new products, like the chicken snack sharing box. In addition, we're expanding our delivery business by tapping into growing digital channels, as well as other vendors, to offer added convenience to Chinese customers. 
In Russia, comparable sales remained positive, driven in part by successful promotions that showcase compelling, affordable menu options across multiple day parts and product categories. Results may be volatile moving forward given continuing macroeconomic uncertainties and lower consumer purchasing power.
I'm encouraged by our continued progress. We're creating a better McDonald's, one that customers will recognize as modern and progressive and a true global leader. Whilst we've come a long way, we recognize there is much more to do. That's why we remain committed to executing our turnaround plan through the end of the year. 
For now, we remain focused on continuing to win within the QSR segment as we give customers more reasons to choose McDonald's. At the same time, we are taking steps to build upon the progress we've made as we chart our long-term strategical path forward within the broader $1.2 trillion informal eating-out market. I am confident McDonald's will generate long-term value for both our system and our shareholders. 
Thanks. I'll now turn it over to Kevin."
139488,372629879,1012847,"McDonald's Corp., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 26, 2016",2016-07-26,"Earnings Calls","McDonald's Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. As a follow-up to Steve's remarks, I'd like to cover the key performance drivers for the quarter, provide an update on our outlook for the second half of 2016 and outline the recent progress we have made against",1435,"Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. As a follow-up to Steve's remarks, I'd like to cover the key performance drivers for the quarter, provide an update on our outlook for the second half of 2016 and outline the recent progress we have made against our financial initiatives. 
Starting with the performance drivers for the quarter. For the quarter as a whole, we're pleased with our efforts to effectively manage restaurant profitability, particularly in light of the industry trends and economic factors that we've experienced in certain markets. 
With more than 80% of our global restaurants franchised, the largest driver of operating income continues to be our franchise margins. For the quarter, growth in global franchise margins was led by the U.S. and the International Lead markets. Franchise margins totaled $1.9 billion, a 6% increase in constant currencies, and contributed about $100 million to our global operating income growth for the quarter. 
Growth in global company-operated margins also contributed to quarterly results as margins rose 150 basis points, with China leading the overall improvement. 
In the U.S., company-operated margins increased by 30 basis points for the quarter, as positive comparable sales and favorable commodity costs more than offset the investment we made last July to raise crew wages and enhance benefits for our restaurant employees. Given the magnitude of this investment, the improvement in second quarter margins is a noteworthy achievement for our U.S. business. 
Moving on to G&A. Our second quarter expenses increased 2% in constant currencies due to higher incentive-based compensation as our a result of our year-to-date performance as well as costs associated with our biennial Owner/Operator Convention in April. Excluding these items, G&A would have decreased. 
Looking ahead, third quarter G&A levels will remain elevated due to our sponsorship of the Summer Olympic Games in Rio next month. Taken together, the cost of our worldwide convention and the Olympics are expected to total about $25 million or roughly 1% of our G&A in 2016.
For the full year 2016, we continue to expect G&A in constant currencies to be 1% to 2% below prior year spending levels, excluding changes in incentive-based compensation and any impact from changes in timing of certain refranchising transactions. 
Global operating income for the quarter totaled more than $1.8 billion, up 3% in constant currencies, reflecting roughly $230 million in strategic charges recorded during the quarter. These charges were comprised of noncash impairment related to our ongoing refranchising in Asia and Europe and G&A initiatives, as well as the decision to relocate our corporate offices.
Diluted earnings per share for the quarter declined $0.01, which included $0.20 related to the strategic charges and $0.02 in negative foreign currency impact. 
As a reminder, in second quarter 2015, we have strategic charges of $0.04 per share related to restructuring. Excluding the impact of the current and prior year restructuring charges, earnings per share for second quarter 2016 were up 13% in constant currencies.
Turning next to menu pricing and commodity costs. In the U.S., commodity costs declined 4.5% during the second quarter. Looking to the second half of the year, we expect commodity costs to remain favorable, maintaining our outlook for the segment's full year basket of goods to be down 3.5% to 4.5%. Commodity costs for the International Lead segment were down about 1% for the second quarter and are expected to remain relatively flat during the second half of this year. Where possible, we source products in local currency to minimize cost fluctuations, and our suppliers also hedge a portion of foreign currency exposure. So at least in the near term, we don't expect Brexit to significantly impact U.K. commodity prices.
While we are benefiting from favorable commodity cost around the world, we are facing rising labor costs in many of our markets. As a result, we are carefully balancing price increases with a focus on maintaining our strong value proposition, which remains a key pillar of McDonald's brand to drive guest counts. 
In the U.S., second quarter pricing year-over-year was up about 3% compared with food-away-from-home inflation of 2.6%. Given the widening gap between food-at-home and food-away-from-home inflation in the U.S., we continue to track both of these metrics very closely. As it stands, food at home is projected to increase modestly from relatively flat to up about 1% for the full year, while food-away-from-home inflation is projected to increase between 2.5% and 3.5%.
For the International Lead segment, while price increases vary by market, year-over-year increases for these markets average 1.5% to 2%. Next, I'd like to provide an update on the impact of Brexit and our global foreign currency outlook. As I mentioned, we don't expect Brexit to have a significant impact on our near-term commodity prices in the U.K. And as Steve noted earlier, we also haven't seen a significant change in consumer demand in the U.K. since the vote.
While the long-term impact of Brexit is uncertain, in the near term, the most significant impact on our business will be currency translation. We view our geographic diversification as a key competitive strength. For perspective, the U.K. represents about 10% of consolidated operating income, and the Eurozone collectively represents about 25%. Given recent currency fluctuations, foreign currency translation is now expected to have a more significant impact on our reported results than previously estimated. Based on current exchange rates, we project foreign currency translation to negatively impact our earnings per share by $0.02 to $0.04 in the third quarter and $0.09 to $0.11 for the full year. As always, please take our currency guidance as directional only because rates will change as we move throughout the year.
Beyond the currency impact, we continue to expect variability in quarterly results due to increased volatility in the evolving global economic and geopolitical landscape, as well as uneven prior year comparisons. 
It was just over a year ago, beginning with the announcement of our turnaround plan in May 2015, that we began reshaping our business, from our organizational structure and restaurant ownership mix to our capital structure and the strategic allocation of our resources around the world. We've taken decisive actions to pursue each of these opportunities, and we continue to make meaningful progress. 
In the past 6 quarters, we refranchised about 850 restaurants, including over 160 in the second quarter. The large majority of restaurants refranchised to date were sold to existing conventional franchisees. 
Overall, our global refranchising efforts are moving along as expected, and we're pleased with the progress we've made to date. It's important to keep in mind that due to the unique nature and scope of the refranchising activity underway, the more complex, larger refranchising transactions do take time. We remain committed to our refranchising strategy and the benefit that will be realized by moving to a more heavily franchised system for McDonald's globally.
From a G&A standpoint, we remain on track to achieve our net annual savings target of $500 million by 2018, with the vast majority of the savings expected to be realized by the end of 2017. As Steve noted, we are in the midst of transforming our organization. We expect to share more detail on the role that our organizational restructuring is playing in reaching our G&A goal as part of our third quarter earnings update.
Relative to our capital structure, 2016 represents the final year of our 3-year $30 billion cash return-to-shareholders target. During the second quarter, we repurchased $3.4 billion of stock, bringing our year-to-date share repurchases to $7.1 billion or 57 million shares. 
In May, we completed a $2.7 billion accelerated share repurchase program and also entered into a new $2.6 billion program, which accounted for a significant portion of the share repurchase activity completed during second quarter.
Through June 2016, the cumulative cash return under our 3-year target stands at $24.4 billion, and we are on track to complete the remaining amount during the back half of this year. 
We've delivered positive results over the last 4 quarters, not just from improving efficiency and working to reduce costs, but most importantly, from top line growth as we've made strides improving the customer experience. These results reinforce my confidence that we're focused on the right things. We're also making good progress on all of the actions we outlined last year. We're actively refranchising restaurants, building stronger G&A discipline and returning more cash to shareholders. The strategic changes we're making and the actions we've taken over the course of the last year are positioning us to optimize our business operations and deliver sustained, profitable growth. 
Thanks. Now I'll turn it over to Chris to begin our Q&A."

And therefore, we are very mindful of our competitive position, the competitive gap. So it was important to us that we maintain that competitive advantage and fought for market share. We're not immune from what's happening in the outside world at all, but nor are we letting that deflect our focus on what really matters to us and our customers. I think the general sense is there's a couple of things at play. I mean, first of all, there is a widening gap between food away from home and food at home, where the commodity decreases are being passed through by the grocers. So the food at home is -- there's value to be had for families there, whereas eating out, there is a price inflation environment. So that's a small part of it. I think, generally, there's just a broader level of uncertainty in consumers' minds at the moment, both trying to gauge the -- their financial security going forward here. Whether through elections or through global events, people are slightly mindful of an unsettled world. When people are uncertain, when families are uncertain, caution starts to prevail, and they start to hold back on spend. 
And for a business like us, I mean, clearly, we generate a lot of our own business directly, but also, we do benefit from people moving around, going to the malls, driving around, going on vacations. And if people are reining in their spend across broader categories, that will have a little bit of a flow-through to us as well. 
So we are mindful of it. It just means we've got to be closer to our customers than ever and adapt to make sure that we're building compelling brands in the short term as well as the long. 
In terms of sustaining trends, well, clearly, we plan to grow our business. But at the same time, we're not trying to do that on a ""quarter to quarter to quarter"" basis. Yes, we are mindful of the short term, but we have our eye aligned on the long term. And we believe we've got a number of the right drivers in place to give us sustained, long-term growth here in the U.S. 
Our value platform is -- we continue to learn. So for a McPick 2 for $5, for example, we had our second national campaign in May, and we learned more about it in terms of the items we can have within the bundle and how we position that, all the way through to some of the early markets where we're testing out the Experience of the Future in the U.S., where we're making a significant -- an exciting rollout program in Florida and, certainly, within New York as well, which, we believe, the results there mirror what we're seeing elsewhere in our other major markets, providing a very exciting opportunity across the next few years in the U.S. as well. 
So mindful of the short term. We're going to fight for share. But also, we don't want to lose the strategic direction that we believe is right for long term."

And with a brand like McDonald's, everything you do communicates. So the better you move on every single consumer touch point, then the broader halo in the brand starts to improve. 
So we're encouraged. We've got plenty of plans to maintain our momentum, but it's nice to see it being recognized by consumers. Part of that is what comes out of the basics of running better restaurants. And we've maintained a 6% year-on-year improvement in overall customer satisfaction. When I look into the detail there, we've made the progress on the areas that the team had intended to make the progress. So we've spoken in the past about an attention to order accuracy, particularly in the drive-thru. Our accuracy has improved, the quality of the food perception has improved, friendliness has improved, all by the order of about 6%, and including speed of service as well. So I believe that day-to-day customer experience also enhances the brand and also just drives that immediate satisfaction. 
In terms of going forward, what's important? I'd say a couple of things. I mean, clearly, continuing the journey we are around food and food quality, both investing in the ingredients, the recipes and the items in the restaurants, as well as the perception and better explaining what's in our food, where it comes from and -- so that's where ""The simpler, the better"" campaign starts to focus. It chronicles the big, meaningful moves we've made and, I believe, signals the direction of travel for us going forward. And as I've said, I'm not going to disclose anything more about it, but there will be more news to come, which we know is going to be powerful in the customer agenda and very, very strong for the brand as well. 
The other element that I'm excited to introduce that we will be introducing increasingly in the U.S., because we've seen it work elsewhere in our major, mature markets, is rolling out the Experience of the Future. It's a fundamentally different experience for the customer, and a lot of that does involve technology as well as the service experience as well. So how can we take out the -- any of the interactions that customers have with their experience in McDonald's, whether it's coming into the dining area or going through the drive-thru, how can we take out the non-value-added processes and just make it a smoother, more enjoyable and easier experience for customers? So the introduction of self-order kiosks, the development of the -- of our mobile apps so they could order in ahead and just check in when you get into the restaurant, it takes out many of those human interactions where complications can arise and just makes it a smoother experience for customers. 
We are seeing a good pickup in sales as we roll this out across U.K., Canada, Australia and early days, but also in Germany as well. So we know we're onto something. We know customers respond well. And certainly, it breathes a lot of new life into our restaurants and into the brand."

You saw in second quarter of this year, we were able to actually grow margins 30 basis points in the U.S. with the 1.8% comp sales, which we were certainly pleased about. As you know, long term, margins are a top line game for us. We need to grow comps in order to maintain and improve margins. But what we were able to do this quarter was effectively manage the restaurant profitability as well. So while commodity costs were more favorable this quarter, our management of what we call controllable costs, both on the food side and the labor side, was better this quarter than prior quarters. And so we're pleased that we're doing a better job of managing -- running the restaurant, but also managing the profitability of the restaurants. Going forward, we've always said that we need about a 2% to 3% comp in a normal inflationary environment. That probably hasn't changed much, and there certainly isn't anything structural that would prevent us from getting back to kind of where we were on high margins in the U.S."

I mean, the reality is the customer experience is critical in just our underlying business momentum. Speed of service has predominantly improved, largely because we've got the accuracy element of service far better. So we've enhanced the training and some of the operational procedures through the drive-thru. And you may have heard me talk about a program we called, ""ask, ask, tell,"" which is a way of really ensuring we took -- we both took and then delivered the right order day in, day out to our customers. Once you get your accuracy right, then the whole drive-thru lane just operates far smoother. 
We also made significant changes to the merchandising in the drive-thru with more tailored and focused merchandising menu boards, which, again, just made it easier for customers to order and identify the products they want, but also easier for our teams to take and get right. 
So I think that there's a lot of work that's gone on. The real devil in the detail, down to the font size on the order receipts to make sure our teams that are collecting the orders can gather the right items. 
But also there's a lot of work we're doing in the future, where we believe we can also enhance service, speed and accuracy and get technology to do some of that heavy lifting for us, so whether it's voice recognition in the drive-thru speaker post all the way through to ordering ahead via either the Internet or the app. Now we have elements of this going on around the world. I'm not sure we're going to pull them all together here in one market, but we are going to take those learnings and see how the customer responds to some of the capabilities we're introducing. And clearly, if the response is strong, we can bring that in. And that will help, again, further enhance speed of service. 
I mean, all the way to -- we have markets where we have curbside collection for our orders. So if you actually order that ahead via the Internet, you can actually just go along to curbside. And therefore, when you think about it, you've got one satisfied customer who is ordering and collecting and paying exactly how they want. That's also one fewer car going through the drive-thru so the existing drive-thru lane runs smoother.
So we're looking at this from a number of different directions. I'm definitely not underestimating the day-to-day operation improvements the teams have done so far. But also we're looking at innovation in the future to try and keep it smoother and easier for customers and just easier for our teams to get right."

I don't particularly want to talk to the monthly trends because we've got away from that. I just don't think, honestly, that's very valuable. I guess what I would say across the quarter is there wasn't really a deeply meaningful trend one way or the other. We consistently performed and we consistently outperformed the market.

Yes, absolutely. We recognize that. That doesn't come as a surprise to us. What we want to do is work hard to still have a compelling everyday value proposition in our restaurants. And that can form -- that can take the form of many things. So we've gone with the McPick 2 platform. And again, just to step back and remind why we believe this is strong, it's because it's grounded in what customers tell us is most important to them, which is choice and flexibility and not locking them into a certain price point, nor are we locking them into a certain selection of bundled items. So we believe that choice and flexibility is right for our customers and gives us flexibility and new news as we return to these programs across a year. Sometimes, they will be on a national level. If it's not national, it will be locally reinforced in the marketing windows in between. 
So we're continuing to learn. We've only been national with McPick 2 for $5 twice now. And again, the local co-ops have been working on their variations of, particularly, the McPick 2 for $2 or other value price point. So we're continuing to learn and evolve that. But is there a transaction trade-off? Yes, there is. We knew that. We planned for that, and we -- but we still believe we have an everyday value proposition. 
And again, it's not just McPick 2. I mean, there's local promotional activity in the co-ops on an ongoing basis, whether it's a $1 drink promotion, for example, all the way through to the offers we're now offering through the global mobile app. We've had 12 million downloads of that. We've got 8 million registered users on the app. And clearly, the offers and the frequency card on there are driving a lot of the interaction. 
In terms of quarter 4. Clearly, we know the, if you like, the core key [ph] cycles we're on. We believe the enhancement to All Day Breakfast will help reinforce the baseline momentum, as does running a better restaurant, as does reinforcing value. The team is certainly working on other activities. There is nothing in particular to share today. But I would say that we are playing the long game here. So we're not going to manage the business -- we're mindful of the quarters, but we're not going to manage it by quarter. We believe we're getting the right fundamental foundations and platforms in place to reinforce the long-term success and profitability of McDonald's. And we have consciously expanded our business plans and our activity away from just a product and price-led program, which we had been somewhat drawn to in the past. And we believe that the brand-enhancing, long-term perspective, as long as we're winning the short-term market share fight, is a good combination for us."

And we feel good about our position within the broader marketplace. Even more encouraging is in the nearing competition, the QSR market share, where we have made some substantial gains in U.K., Australia, China and Canada. And I think as part of the turnaround, we have really focused on making sure that we win in the most immediate competitive set we are. This is part of the modern progressive burger company ambition, which is make sure we're strong and dominant in our immediate sector. And then we start to take IEO share as we broaden the experience. I believe the Experience of the Future will have us fight increasingly in a -- into an increasingly stronger position in the broader IEO. In the immediate term, it was getting the basics of the business right so we win QSR market share. And I've shared over a number of these calls and meetings we've had about some of the successes in Australia and Canada, for instance. But the customer experience is noticeably different than it was 3 to 4 years ago, both from the designs of the restaurant, the introduction of technology, the substantially enhanced front-of-house hospitality that we now offer, all the way through to providing more options to customize your food via self-order kiosks, for example, in the dining areas. And now we're extending that to table service. So this is -- if a customer is to walk in now versus 2, 3, 4 years ago, it would be a noticeably different experience. And I believe that is both winning QSR share and IEO share. And those are the sorts of ideas that, with the new structure we have, we are looking to move and are moving very, very quickly between markets."

Going back and looking at the model, it looks like in '07 and '08, you did see some really, really impressive margin expansion, again, I think, after you developmentally licensed and refranchised more than a couple thousand restaurants. So with that precedent, what operating income margin level -- and again, I realize you're not going to give me a specific number, even a tight range, but when you guys move to a 95% franchise mix, how different do you think the operating income margin at McDonald's will look in '18 as compared to what it looks like today?"

Effectively, we're swapping company-operated margin dollars for franchised margin dollars, and certainly, then spending less G&A and capital to generate those franchise margin dollars.

We would expect similar -- that we would also be able to improve operating margins going forward based on the activity. As you indicate, we're certainly not going to throw a number out there. But generally, one of the main reasons we're doing that is because of the stability of both the cash flows and the operating performance going forward. So we've got a stable revenue stream that we'll collect and a predictable model that allows us to manage the business pretty effectively. 
Certainly, on a free cash flow basis, you should expect that it would be accretive because, as I said, we're generating more income, more cash flow and not spending as much capital."

And what you'll see is, and generally, in our major significant mature markets, that's the U.S. and International Lead markets, you'll see more of a conventional franchising, which is what we do in the U.S. So you would have seen some more conventional franchising, certainly in this quarter, and there will likely be further franchising like that. 
In countries, certainly in certain parts of Asia and Europe, where either it's a little bit more volatile from an economic and political standpoint and/or a partner can help us accelerate growth and grow faster than maybe we're willing to put in capital right now, those situations you will likely see us using that developmental license model that we've used successfully for many years in a lot of the countries. All of the transactions that we have planned right now were taken into consideration when we came up with that $500 million of G&A reduction. So the $500 million contemplated all of the transactions that we have kind of in our plans at this point. So none of those activities will, in and of themselves, drive further G&A reduction. That doesn't mean that we're not going to continue to look for efficiencies and run the business in a disciplined manner. But you shouldn't expect that because we completed a franchising transaction or anything along those lines that, that would trigger automatically a further or additional G&A cut in addition to the $500 million."

I'm encouraged by the actions we've taken and the progress we've made as we execute our turnaround plan. Customer perceptions at McDonald's have steadily improved over the past 18 months, and the third quarter marks 5 consecutive quarters of comparable sales growth across all business segments with many markets gaining share. 
For the third quarter, global comparable sales increased 3.5% and operating income was up 7% in constant currencies. Earnings per share rose 9% in constant currencies. Excluding the impact of previously announced current and prior year strategic charges, earnings per share for the quarter increased 17% in constant currencies. 
Profitability has increased both for McDonald's and franchisees. At the restaurant level, franchisee cash flows reached all-time highs in many markets, including the U.S. These results are a testament to our diligent execution of the turnaround plan as we put customers at the center of everything we do. We are at a point where we've begun to transition from a focus on revitalization to a mindset that's concentrated on strengthening the business to drive sustainable growth over the long term. 
We expected performance through 2016 to be uneven, and it has been. Markets such as the U.K., Australia and Canada continue to grow sales and guest counts, whilst market including the U.S., France and Germany work to overcome challenges of varying degrees.
We are mindful of the near-term headwinds we face, most notably in the U.S., as we lap the very successful reduction of All Day Breakfast, which was immediately popular to customers. However, we're not managing the business quarter-by-quarter. In fact, our commitment to investing in the business is stronger now than ever. We're taking action in the areas that matter most to customers. 
In particular, we're placing significant emphasis on food quality, the customer experience and value to give people more reasons to visit McDonald's. We believe the long-term investments we are making in these areas provide the foundation on which we'll build as we work to be recognized as a modern, progressive burger company by customers.
In the area of food, we are taking important steps in how our food is prepared and the ingredients we use. In the U.S., we completed our transition to chicken not treated by antibiotics important to human medicine a year ahead of schedule. We introduced new buns that do not contain high-fructose corn syrup, and we removed artificial preservatives from our popular Chicken McNuggets, and customers have responded favorably to this news and we've seen sales accelerate as a result.
Following the announcement, sales of McNuggets increased nearly 10%, and they are sustaining above previous levels. 
We're also modernizing the customer experience in markets around the world as we evolve to the Experience of the Future. 
And in Canada, we are engaging with customers in simpler, less stressful ways by offering them more choices on how they order and pay. We now have dual-point service [ph] and self-order kiosks in almost 90% of our traditional restaurants. In addition, we're taking steps to redefine hospitality on both sides of the counter with dedicated guest experience leaders in all of Canada's traditional restaurants. 
Finally, value, a critical priority in all markets. In Germany, for example, we've deployed a 2-pronged approach. First, we successfully added new layers [ph] to our value platform at mid-tier price points. At the same time, we're celebrating the quality and taste of our core products through strong marketing and promotional campaigns. These steps build on the new pricing structure we introduced earlier this year to strengthen our value platform, and that's resonating well with the price-conscious German consumer.
The actions we have taken [ph] specific to our food, the customer experience and the value and telling customers about the changes are making a difference. Customer satisfaction has improved significantly, up more than 6% year-to-date in both the U.S. and Canada, with most major markets seeing improvements. This is a testament to the progress we've made since we refocused on running better restaurants as part of our turnaround plan in May of last year.
With that context, let's turn to performance highlights in the markets. Beginning with the U.S., comparable sales remained positive for the third quarter, up 1.3%. Customers love All Day Breakfast and the way we've continued to build on its success. Since its introduction last year, customers asked for even more choices, so we recently launched the second phase of All Day Breakfast. The expanded menu now includes muffins and biscuits as well as our beloved McGriddles all day in all U.S. restaurants.
At the same time, we're enhancing the experience to adapt alongside customers' expectations. One of the most notable ways we're doing this in restaurants is by better integrating technology in visible, tangible ways. For example, more than 90% of U.S. restaurants now use digital menu boards. These new menu boards enable us to showcase the quality of our food with fresh photography. Because they're less congested and better organized, the menus now do a better job highlighting the broad range of choices available. The menu boards are also smart. They're built with a robust content management system that we haven't even begun tapping into yet. When fully enabled, we'll be able to adjust what's featured on the menu based on time of day or even weather conditions. We'll be more relevant to customers as we remind them about our ice cream cones and McFlurries on a hot summer day or handcrafted hot McCaf√© beverages if it's chilly outside and they feel the need to warm up.
We also continue to emphasize value, because we know how much budget-oriented customers come to McDonald's. Franchisees and customers alike have embraced the McPick 2 platform. They appreciate the choice and flexibility it provides. In September, we promoted McPick 2 for $5 nationally, whilst other variations of McPick 2 were offered on a local level. Some of our best-performing regions offered beverage value to complement the McPick 2 platform. We'll continue to tap into these learnings, both nationally and locally, as we design future McPick offers.
Underpinning these efforts is a continued focus on running better restaurants. Our commitment to raising the bar with an emphasis on underperforming restaurants is making a difference. Customer satisfaction scores have improved the most from our bottom-quintile restaurants, and we've cut the customer satisfaction score gap between the top and bottom quintile performance nearly in half through our efforts to provide a better, more consistent experience for customers in every restaurant every time they visit.
Turning to the International Lead Market segment. Third quarter comparable sales were up 3.3%, driven by positive performance across 4 of the 5 major markets, with France being the exception. The U.K., Australia and Canada delivered yet another quarter of comparable sales and guest count growth. These markets share similar elements that underlie their strong track records of success: contemporary restaurant designs with over 90% of restaurants reimaged; compelling menu strategies tailored to local customer tastes, such as the spice it up [ph] event bit in Canada featuring spicy Sriracha sauce on a country chicken or Angus beef sandwich; and a modern [ph] service experience that incorporates the elements of Experience of the Future to provide customers with more choice and flexibility on how they order, what they order and how they are served. These elements amplify each other to create a notable difference for customers who then reward us by visiting more often.
I'm encouraged by the progress we've made in Germany, which I had a chance to experience first hand when I visited the team there last quarter. Comparable sales were positive in the market for the third quarter. 
Earlier, I mentioned the steps we've taken to strengthen our value platform. Combined with strong promotions featuring customer favorites like the hamburger Royal with Cheese, these actions are making difference and getting us back on track to grow top line results once again.
That said, I want to stress the growing -- that growing guest counts remains a top priority. That's the key to winning back the share we've lost in recent years. 
In France, third quarter comparable sales were negative. This was driven in large part by ongoing macroeconomic challenges, including a declining GDP, high unemployment and the continuing concerns for personal safety, which is impacting both inbound tourism as well as the French consumer. 
The customers appreciate the actions we've taken to strengthen our value offer, including further extensions of the well-regarded and successful P'tit Plaisir [indiscernible] platform. We're also satisfying French consumers' growing appetite for premium burgers through strong promotional campaigns featuring customer favorites like the 280 Burger and the Big Tasty. In addition, we're introducing a new signature line of sandwiches in our Experience of the Future restaurants to give customers even more great-tasting burger choices at the convenience and value they've come to appreciate at McDonald's.
In the High Growth segment, third quarter comparable sales were up 1.5%, driven by positive performance in Russia and most other markets, partially offset by negative comparable sales in China. Whilst third quarter comparable sales in China were down 1.8%, results improved as the quarter progressed. Excluding the impact of temporary protests surrounding recent events related to the South China Sea, China's comparable sales would have been positive for the quarter.
A strong focus on enhancing convenience through greater integration with third-party delivery providers combined with aggressive core menu sampling events designed to offset the impact of the protests contributed to market share gains amidst the still challenging macroeconomic environment. 
In Russia, the economy remains difficult and consumer purchasing power continues to decline. Despite these challenges, we are growing comparable sales and guest count and gaining market share.
Specifically, our performance is a result of a heightened focus on value as well as the successful marketing campaigns to grow the Breakfast Day part. And I'll be remiss if I didn't mention Japan, where comparable sales increased 17.7% in the third quarter. Diligent execution to [ph] market's comprehensive turnaround plans, which include strong promotions, exciting menu variety, compelling value and a more modern restaurant experience, is enhancing McDonald's' relevance to customers and contributing to sustained momentum in this market.
As we look to the future, we recognize the importance of having the right structure, the right people, a common focus and, lastly, greater accountability across the entire McDonald's System. We've taken steps forward in all 4 areas to set a proper foundation for long-term growth. 
First, the right structure. Building on last year's shift to segments of similar markets, we took further steps in the third quarter to transition to a leaner, more efficient and more nimble organization. This will enable us to effectively [ph] share expertise, improve efficiencies and drive down costs, taking greater advantage of our size and scale. Kevin will provide further details in a moment. 
Second, the right talent. An important component of our turnaround plan has always been to ensure we have the right people in the most critical positions. Management changes have been and continue to be an anticipated part of the process. That's why we're focused on a blend of promoting individuals who are ready to take on additional responsibilities, continuing to develop leaders that have the right skills necessary to grow the business and attracting new executives into the business to provide fresh energy and innovative thinking.
I'm confident in the recent selections we have made. This includes Chris Kempczinski succeeding Mike Andres as President of McDonald's U.S.A. [ph] effective the 1st of January. As part of a fruitful [ph] transition, Chris is already spending significant time with Mike and our franchisees in the field. 
In the High Growth segment, Joe Erlinger has made an immediate impact upon stepping into the role of President in these markets. He knows these markets well, having been CFO of the segment and the former Managing Director of Korea.
Third, a common focus. In addition to making forward progress on running great restaurants, we have put a greater emphasis on accelerating initiatives that will bring more customers into our restaurants more often. This includes the Experience of the Future, which we're looking to roll out at greater speed in the U.S., and we look forward to sharing more details of those plans as they're finalized.
And lastly, accountability. We've made great progress executing our turnaround plan. Now we're starting to balance those efforts with a greater focus on longer-term growth. It will [ph] take all of our franchisees, employees and suppliers working together and holding each other accountable to achieve our ultimate goal of becoming the modern progressive burger company.
We have a long-term view on our potential and the opportunities that exist. I'm confident in the actions we are taking to run better restaurants and the investments we are making. We're getting the right people, foundations and platforms in place to properly grow the business and reassert McDonald's' global brand leadership.
Thanks very much, and now I'll turn it over to Kevin."

Since Ste",1574,"Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. We're pleased with our third quarter results. By staying keenly focused on our customers, we maintained positive momentum while continuing to make meaningful strides toward building a better McDonald's. Since Steve talked about sales and earnings per share, I'll focus on margins and G&A. I'll also provide an update on the key outlook items and the recent progress we've made against our financial targets. 
Starting with the performance drivers for the quarter. Franchise revenues continue to become an increasingly significant portion of our revenue stream as we evolve to a more heavily franchised organization. For third quarter, franchise revenues increased 6% in constant currencies, reflecting strong comparable sales and the impact of refranchising. For the quarter, franchise margin dollars exceeded $2 billion, a 6% increase in constant currencies, and contributed over $100 million to our growth in global operating income. This solid performance reflects sales driven improvements across all segments, led by results in the International Lead Markets. In addition, we maintained strong global franchise margins of over 82%. These results are a testament to the benefits of transitioning toward a more predictable and stable revenue stream.
Growth in company-operated margins also contributed about $75 million to our growth in global operating income, as company-operated margins rose to more than $730 million, an 11% increase in constant currencies. Company-operated margins climbed 260 basis points, with the U.S. and China leading the overall improvement. Our emphasis on running better restaurants, from enhanced conveniences to tighter operating controls, is yielding a better experience for our customers as well as improved restaurant profitability.
In the U.S., the company-operated margin percent increased 450 basis points for the quarter, reflecting positive comparable sales and a favorable commodity environment. These results also reflect the benefit from our refranchising as we optimize our company-operated restaurant portfolio and the ongoing contribution it makes to our bottom line.
Moving on to G&A. At the end of last year, we noted that we expected to realize about $150 million in savings during 2015 and 2016, with about half of the savings to be achieved in each year. For third quarter, our G&A expenses increased 1% in constant currencies due to higher incentive-based compensation as a result of our year-to-date performance. For the full year, we now expect G&A to be relatively flat in constant currencies. However, excluding incentive-based compensation, G&A for the year is expected to be down about 3% in constant currencies, which equates to roughly $75 million in savings due to lower employee-related costs resulting from our restructuring initiatives. This will bring our total G&A savings at the end of 2016 to at least $150 million. 
Let me switch gears now for an update on menu pricing and commodity costs. In the U.S., commodity costs declined by more than 6% during the third quarter. Given the strength of our third quarter savings, combined with our outlook for fourth quarter, we now expect the segment's full year basket of goods to be down 4.5% to 5%. Commodity costs for the International Lead segment were down about 1% for the third quarter and are expected to remain relatively flat for the remainder of this year. 
While we continue to benefit from favorable commodity costs around the world, we continue to experience rising labor costs in many of our markets. These pressures are considered as we make pricing decisions over the course of the year. Our objective is to manage pricing in a way that maintains our strong value proposition, contributes to guest traffic growth and supports restaurant profitability. In the U.S., third quarter pricing year-over-year was up about 3.5% compared with food-away-from-home inflation of about 2.5%.
For U.S. company-operated restaurant pricing, our goal is to approximate food-away-from-home inflation over time, so we may be a little higher or lower in any given quarter. We are also mindful that the current 450 basis point gap between the cost of eating at home versus dining out is the largest spread in more than 30 years and may be impacting consumer behavior. We continue to track these metrics and expect our overall menu price increase at year-end to be more in line with food-away-from-home inflation. For the International Lead segment, while price increases vary by market, year-over-year increases for these markets averaged about 2%.
Next, I'd like to provide an update on our foreign currency outlook. Based on current exchange rates, we project foreign currency translation to negatively impact our earnings per share by $0.01 to $0.02 in the fourth quarter, which will bring the full year impact to $0.09 to $0.10. As always, please take our currency guidance as directional only because rates will change as we move throughout the year.
Last quarter, I committed to providing more detail on today's call regarding the role that our organizational restructuring is playing in reaching our previously announced G&A savings target. For the last several months, we have been working with outside advisers to thoroughly analyze our G&A spending and organizational structure, from our corporate functions to the individual markets and the critical role they play in the field.
Our overall goal was to focus our resources in talent and customer-facing activities that drive business growth while creating a more globalized system that more effectively leverages our size and scale to spread learnings better and drive cost improvements and efficiencies.
As we move toward becoming a leaner and more agile organization, we're positioned to make quicker and better decisions and to execute on our strategic intent to create a better customer experience. The pace at which All Day Breakfast move from the U.S. to Australia is a great example of how we're accelerating knowledge transfer across the system to benefit customers globally. I'm confident that our redesigned organization is now better equipped to adapt to today's rapidly changing environment.
As a result of our reorganization, we incurred roughly $80 million in restructuring charges for the third quarter. While this component of our restructuring is nearing completion, we do expect to incur some additional but less significant charges in the fourth quarter. We remain on track to achieve our net annual G&A savings target of $500 million by 2018 with the vast majority of the savings expected to be realized by the end of next year.
We also continue to make changes to the business through our global refranchising efforts. Since the beginning of 2015, we refranchised nearly 1,000 restaurants, including 140 in the third quarter. The large majority of restaurants refranchised to date have been sold to existing conventional franchisees. As previously indicated, we're also actively pursuing a transaction in China, where we are currently in the process of vetting a select number of qualified bidders. 
In addition, we have made meaningful progress in our search for long-term strategic partners in Malaysia and Singapore. These markets collectively operate almost 400 restaurants, more than 80% of which are company-owned. We are in the final stages of the process and expect to complete these transactions by the end of this year. Given where the transaction stand, we recorded a noncash charge of approximately $40 million in the quarter to account for historical currency losses.
As we move into the month of October, we also completed the sale of 75 company-operated restaurants in the year old ration of Russia to an existing development of licensee. The results of this transaction will be reflected in fourth quarter. So we remain on track to refranchise about 4,000 restaurants by the end of 2018 and will continue to keep you priced of our progress.
Last November, we increased our 3-year cash return to shareholders target to $30 billion by the end of 2016. During the quarter, we returned $3.4 billion to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends. Share repurchases for the quarter totaled $2.7 billion, the vast majority of which was completed under our second accelerated share repurchase program of the year. 
Further, in September, our Board of Directors approved a 6% dividend increase effective in the fourth quarter, the equivalent of $3.76 annually. This increase marked the company's 40th consecutive year of delivering a dividend increase for our shareholders.
As a result of these activities, the cumulative cash return under our 3-year target stands at nearly $28 billion, and we are on track to complete the remaining amount by the end of this year. 
To summarize, over the course of the last year, we've demonstrated our commitment to meeting our financial targets. By the end of 2016, we will have met our $30 billion cash return to shareholders target, achieve nearly 1/3 of our G&A savings target and completed more than 1/3 of our restaurant refranchising with some significant transactions on track for completion in 2017.
We continue to measure our progress and hold ourselves accountable in each phase of the turnaround to ensure that we are appropriately allocating our resources to strategic out bringing plans that will grow our business. As we move into the final quarter of 2016, we are mindful of the hurdles we face in the near term, but we're keeping our line of sight clearly focused on the long term. Through our actions, we're unlocking financial value and using it to fuel the innovation and investments that will create a better customer experience and deliver sustained profitable growth for the long-term for our system and our shareholders.
Thanks. Now I'll turn it over to Chris to begin our Q&A."

Suffers of all of the All Day Breakfast and the McPick 2, so that was the -- they are 2 of the foundation elements of what's helped maintain and establish and then maintain momentum of the business. So as you know, we launched All Day Breakfast are on this time last year. It served us well. As you know, the initial peak was higher than we expected and it settle down to a level that we were happy with. In the meantime, we worked on how can we extend that platform, both operational and making sure the consumer had the demand was there and they extended it just a couple of weeks ago, [indiscernible] couple of weeks ago. So that is here today. It's doing well for us and it's a foundational element of our business momentum. McPick 2, similarly, it really is well embraced by both our operators and by our customers. So as you know, we tried both McPick 2 for $5, which is typically the platform we use at a national level and we'll be bringing that back, I don't know, 3, 4x a year and that in a national level and still using the flexibility of that platform to rotate the items through that menu. But what you don't see, perhaps, so visibility, is across is regions is how McPick 2 is always on and typically the reasons we'll use a greater value element, like a McPick 2 for $2.50, McPick for 2, McPick 2 for 3. And again, depending on this is all in of customer. So both of those platforms are good consumers to us an important part of our business going forward. In terms of what we got to be excited about going forward, there's plenty. And part of what we're enjoying about the new instruction this business is in the greater visibility we have to what works around the world and what's creating some of that success internationally for us, but also the way that they simplified the structure in the U.S, what's worked in the regional level. So there's a lot of product innovation, local product innovation at the regional level that we are looking to learn from and let where appropriate. There's some early this quarter, spent some time in Phoenix and Scottsdale in Arizona and then went up to Poland in Oregon. And one common success that in both of those regions, both are not the strongest sales region we have in the U.S. currently. And what was also particularly successful there was they were complementing local beverage value alongside the McPick 2 platform, alongside the fundamentals of running better restaurants. So those are the pockets of great success that we're looking to lift and localize and then long rapidly. So for the other piece that's I've always come back to and I won't hesitate income impact is probably the most important element of what has establishment in the U.S. is the operational improvements around running better restaurants. And that is something that is so, so fundamental and it may not be a headline grabber. But if you think about the 27 million, 28 million customers that come in every single day, if we can offer a more consistent, friendlier, more convenient service to them, that is where our greatest reward is. And the customer satisfaction scores are going significantly in the right direction. And again, we have a number of ways of we're looking to improve the operational sprains quitting using technologies to make it more easy more convenient for customers. So we have multiple future growth drivers. And internationally, again, we're scanning the horizon clearly. I mean, you've seen in the success of the very, very consistent, always consistent across the International Lead markets. And there are certain common success stories across those. Most notably, how they are embracing while the call, this expense of a feature, which is how you use modern facilities ago hopefully, we define experience, use of technology for self-order kiosks, for example, integrating that with mobile apps and again, offering a degree an appropriate degree of customization for customers so they can really exert their choice and enjoy variety across our menus. So again, you can expect us to incorporate all those successes into the U.S. business as we move forward."

It was positive GAAP was 0.6%. As you know, it's a market shift that really is a scramble. There is certainly a softening top line across the sector with consumer confidence. We -- I think all of us in the sector would prefer some tailwinds. If you look -- there aren't many tailwind at the moments. Yes, there's not great economic growth to help provide a lift. Consumer confidence is muted where they're unusual stage at the election cycle. So none of that is really providing a tailwind for us. That said, there's a significant market out there and we're going to keep battling for market share. That said, seeing the softening of the GAAP does not a great surprise to us because it was a stickler -- this time last year and heading to the fourth quarter, compared to a really strong perform for us. So the reality is the trends we're seeing are no surprise to us and certainly, our shape from a number term objectives. From a leadership perspective, I'd love to talk about it. I'm excited about where we're at. We're heading into 2017 now with really a world-class team that's what we expect for a world-class business. We have made changes. And as you go through the various phases of a turnaround into growth, there are times when the skill sets required, as we transition, also needs to change. So it's a delicate balance between leveraging the experience, the knowledge, the tenure, the understanding of the system with a more tenured leaders, also bringing in innovative thinking. But I could just draw some examples to this. I mean, there's -- giving Chris opportunity to lead the U.S. business I'm really excited about because the reality is whilst he had somewhat limited McDonald's experience, I think he brings some phenomenal external leadership experience from global brands, consumer brands, which will be valuable to us. But also, let's not forget, that he state the 5 or 6 key reports -- more than 120 years of McDonald's U.S. experience the long-term. So I think the got the McDonald's piece covered performing his fresh thinking, sure that's going to be a very, very potent combination. If you look at the role that we operated with Doug now. I mean, Doug has been around part of 40 years, and there are very few roles in this business that Doug hasn't filled yet. He's a, functional leadership, he's a supply chain functional leader for franchising of real estate as well as field leadership, both here in the U.S, previously run Europe, and and now he's proven to be a great leader of all International Lead markets. Leveraging Doug's experience to help blend gain with a new express like Chris, yes, we're all one team and that's a good balance. Joe have taken a high growth becoming Joe says up in the U.S. business 15 years to kind of regional manager very successful here with this, transition to become a market leader, Managing Director of the Korea market, has financial experience in the CFO in the newly formed high-growth market. Placed to step in and that is in energy and insight into leadership position. And then if you were to talk about from Chris transition, we propriety prepared for that. We're already see Brady Comintern our business. Was a Senior Vice President at BCG, 20 years of experience in helping global business develop growth strategies. So ideally placed seamlessly into that. So it's an important balance. It's something that I enjoyed leading when I was in the U.K, when we're transitioning from probably a McDonald's only management team to one that I felt had the right combination and getting that balance right now is critical. I mean, we're really excited to be in next year with a team that's sharp and ready to go."

I mean, really, it's a fascinating time to be running an international business. It really is. Because if you speak the team in France, for example, who have led so much for our strategic thinking and the innovation across our business, they're now facing, really, not just unforeseen, but previously not experienced challenges. And given not just their macroeconomic environment, we know that GDP is down in France, but there's different dynamics. And given some of the situation and the security terror situation they face there, it really is creating some very significant dynamic changes in that market. To resume, which is always been a substantial part of the's fuel the economy in France have really softened, and we are seeing -- you see it in hotel bookings and you see it impacted certainly, in the more tourist areas with its of the Southern France or Paris within our business, where we do have a heavy concentration of restaurants. We also see it affect the way that consumers live their lives. French consumers. So there's a slight reticence to go into high density tourist errs because of their slightly concern at the moment. Now I think some of those things have been great and some of the things maybe slightly more permanent. But it's really means our management teams in France having been much more agile and responsive to act in accordance with consumer sentiment. When you go to market like Spain where they have probably suffered more through the economic crisis than any other market that we do business in. Youth unemployment up 25%, for example. So we have just gently slowed down the new store opening there and also focused our efforts and our investment on existing store portfolio. I'm delighted with the progress that market has made as it's built its momentum, it's returning to growth for the second half of this year. I mean, the outlook looks very confident. U.K. is a probably a well and often spoken story. I think it's 42 consecutive quarters of growth now, and that momentum really does look very solid and well baked in. So I wouldn't say too much more about that. But then you could go internationally across to Asia. Now China is a challenging market. And the manner in which the team are adapting the variations that they have to experience, both again in consumers sentiment in the the broader economy is that [indiscernible]. And as they have seen, just as one example, they now have a substantial part of that business in the delivery business. And not just originally, we set up and established our own McDonald's delivery. So there's -- and that proved to be very successful. But now integrating it to third-party delivery providers. That has way for the accelerated the -- our momentum of business and customer satisfaction as more people are getting used to it all day and eating at home. So we're seeing different trends around the world. And one thing, it's particularly beneficial to us now, as we removed some of noise in our business, the visibility we haven't is going on and how we can transfer that knowledge and use it to our advantage in other markets. And part of the advantage of having Chris his position now. He's been in his first year traveling around the world both with myself and other senior leaders and on his own, losing these markets, seeing what's going on, understanding that big levers of our business and he's now perfectly placed help to go into the U.S. business."

I'd say, you can see out there, there's still some promotional offerings certainly, around the industry. I think all of us certainly, including us, I would like to see kind of like just a stable platform where you can -- that's why we put McPick 2 in. The idea is to have an ongoing value platform that customers can count on and not have to come up with some discounted promotion, if you will, every now and then. On the pricing side, to your point, right now, we're a little bit ahead of food-away-from-home and we certainly experienced very favorable margins here in the U.S. in the third quarter. Some of that is in the timing of when we take pricing. So if you look at last year, we actually took some pricing in October, whereas this year, we took it in September. So that when you look at a year-over-year basis, you have a little timing shift. There's about 70 to 75 basis points of pricing that will be in last year's fourth quarter that we may not replace some or all of that in the fourth quarter this year, which would bring some of our pricing don't maybe more in line with food-away-from-home. But we still do keep an eye on both food-away-from-home and food at home, which you mention is in the food at home is extremely low right now."

The other elements of the far broader elements consumer facing elements of the experience of the future, integrating the app into the self order kiosks, offering different ways that customers can be served, they can place their orders, they can customize their foods. So we expect to start seeing that wrapped up through '17. And literally, the minute you convert a restaurant, we see ourselves lead. So yes, it will be a contributor. Although probably getting that full run rate for '18 and '19 as well, which I think it is a very strong program. One of the things we have benefited from is we've learned a lot of what works most around 2 things that don't work in the markets that have been nearly adopted Australia and Canada, for example. So we can bring that best practices in the U.S. and make sure it's still relatively relevant in go high at it. So we're really excited. The is really just is just a collectible to invest plumbing and there is an investment commentary over a have and the company's early from a company perspective, we're allocating our capital to provide significant support alongside the operators to go invest in them. It will really happy at the moment that the U.S. cash flows are all-time high. That means their ability to invest can never have been greater. So I think we're in a good place."

And then my second point is -- second question is about the unit growth taking it down. Is that because you're intentionally steering more capital to existing in its remodels?

I think we have about 1,000 last quarter. Now we said about 900. It's a little bit in various markets, a few in China, a few in Spain. Nothing of significance, I would say. The reallocation is really to some of these investment areas that Steve was just talking about certainly, in places like Australia and the U.K. where we're very implementing Experience of the Future, seeing good sales lifts from those investments.

I'm encouraged by the actions we've taken and the progress we've made as we execute our turnaround plan. Customer perceptions at McDonald's have steadily improved over the past 18 months, and the third quarter marks 5 consecutive quarters of comparable sales growth across all business segments with many markets gaining share. 
For the third quarter, global comparable sales increased 3.5% and operating income was up 7% in constant currencies. Earnings per share rose 9% in constant currencies. Excluding the impact of previously announced current and prior year strategic charges, earnings per share for the quarter increased 17% in constant currencies. 
Profitability has increased both for McDonald's and franchisees. At the restaurant level, franchisee cash flows reached all-time highs in many markets, including the U.S. These results are a testament to our diligent execution of the turnaround plan as we put customers at the center of everything we do. We are at a point where we've begun to transition from a focus on revitalization to a mindset that's concentrated on strengthening the business to drive sustainable growth over the long term. 
We expected performance through 2016 to be uneven, and it has been. Markets such as the U.K., Australia and Canada continue to grow sales and guest counts, whilst market including the U.S., France and Germany work to overcome challenges of varying degrees.
We are mindful of the near-term headwinds we face, most notably in the U.S., as we lap the very successful reduction of All Day Breakfast, which was immediately popular to customers. However, we're not managing the business quarter-by-quarter. In fact, our commitment to investing in the business is stronger now than ever. We're taking action in the areas that matter most to customers. 
In particular, we're placing significant emphasis on food quality, the customer experience and value to give people more reasons to visit McDonald's. We believe the long-term investments we are making in these areas provide the foundation on which we'll build as we work to be recognized as a modern, progressive burger company by customers.
In the area of food, we are taking important steps in how our food is prepared and the ingredients we use. In the U.S., we completed our transition to chicken not treated by antibiotics important to human medicine a year ahead of schedule. We introduced new buns that do not contain high-fructose corn syrup, and we removed artificial preservatives from our popular Chicken McNuggets, and customers have responded favorably to this news and we've seen sales accelerate as a result.
Following the announcement, sales of McNuggets increased nearly 10%, and they are sustaining above previous levels. 
We're also modernizing the customer experience in markets around the world as we evolve to the Experience of the Future. 
And in Canada, we are engaging with customers in simpler, less stressful ways by offering them more choices on how they order and pay. We now have dual-point service and self-order kiosks in almost 90% of our traditional restaurants. In addition, we're taking steps to redefine hospitality on both sides of the counter with dedicated guest experience leaders in all of Canada's traditional restaurants. 
Finally, value, a critical priority in all markets. In Germany, for example, we've deployed a 2-pronged approach. First, we successfully added new layers to our value platform at mid-tier price points. At the same time, we're celebrating the quality and taste of our core products through strong marketing and promotional campaigns. These steps build on the new pricing structure we introduced earlier this year to strengthen our value platform, and that's resonating well with the price-conscious German consumer.
The actions we are taking specific to our food, the customer experience and the value, and telling customers about the changes, are making a difference. Customer satisfaction has improved significantly, up more than 6% year-to-date in both the U.S. and Canada, with most major markets seeing improvements. This is a testament to the progress we've made since we refocused on running better restaurants as part of our turnaround plan in May of last year.
With that context, let's turn to performance highlights in the markets. Beginning with the U.S., comparable sales remained positive for the third quarter, up 1.3%. Customers love All Day Breakfast and the way we've continued to build on its success. Since its introduction last year, customers asked for even more choices, so we recently launched the second phase of All Day Breakfast. The expanded menu now includes muffins and biscuits as well as our beloved McGriddles all day in all U.S. restaurants.
At the same time, we're enhancing the experience to adapt alongside customers' expectations. One of the most notable ways we're doing this in restaurants is by better integrating technology in visible, tangible ways. For example, more than 90% of U.S. restaurants now use digital menu boards. These new menu boards enable us to showcase the quality of our food with fresh photography. Because they're less congested and better organized, the menus now do a better job highlighting the broad range of choices available. The menu boards are also smart. They're built with a robust content management system that we haven't even begun tapping into yet. When fully enabled, we'll be able to adjust what's featured on the menu based on time of day or even weather conditions. We'll be more relevant to customers as we remind them about our ice cream cones and McFlurries on a hot summer day or handcrafted hot McCaf√© beverages if it's chilly outside and they feel the need to warm up.
We also continue to emphasize value, because we know how much budget-oriented customers come to McDonald's. Franchisees and customers alike have embraced the McPick 2 platform. They appreciate the choice and flexibility it provides. In September, we promoted McPick 2 for $5 nationally, whilst other variations of McPick 2 were offered on a local level. Some of our best-performing regions offered beverage value to complement the McPick 2 platform. We'll continue to tap into these learnings, both nationally and locally, as we design future McPick offers.
Underpinning these efforts is a continued focus on running better restaurants. Our commitment to raising the bar with an emphasis on underperforming restaurants is making a difference. Customer satisfaction scores have improved the most from our bottom-quintile restaurants, and we've cut the customer satisfaction score gap between the top and bottom quintile performance nearly in half through our efforts to provide a better, more consistent experience for customers in every restaurant every time they visit.
Turning to the International Lead Market segment. Third quarter comparable sales were up 3.3%, driven by positive performance across 4 of the 5 major markets, with France being the exception. The U.K., Australia and Canada delivered yet another quarter of comparable sales and guest count growth. These markets share similar elements that underlie their strong track records of success: contemporary restaurant designs with over 90% of restaurants reimaged; compelling menu strategies tailored to local customer tastes, such as the Spice It Up event in Canada featuring spicy Sriracha sauce on a country chicken or Angus beef sandwich; and a modern service experience that incorporates the elements of Experience of the Future to provide customers with more choice and flexibility on how they order, what they order and how they are served. These elements amplify each other to create a notable difference for customers who then reward us by visiting more often.
I'm encouraged by the progress we've made in Germany, which I had a chance to experience firsthand when I visited the team there last quarter. Comparable sales were positive in the market for the third quarter. 
Earlier, I mentioned the steps we've taken to strengthen our value platform. Combined with strong promotions featuring customer favorites like the hamburger Royal with Cheese, these actions are making difference and getting us back on track to grow top line results once again.
That said, I want to stress the growing -- that growing guest counts remains a top priority. That's the key to winning back the share we've lost in recent years. 
In France, third quarter comparable sales were negative. This was driven in large part by ongoing macroeconomic challenges, including a declining GDP, high unemployment and the continuing concerns for personal safety, which is impacting both inbound tourism as well as the French consumer. 
The customers appreciate the actions we've taken to strengthen our value offer, including further extensions of the well-regarded and successful P'tit Plaisir [indiscernible] platform. We're also satisfying French consumers' growing appetite for premium burgers through strong promotional campaigns featuring customer favorites like the 280 Burger and the Big Tasty. In addition, we're introducing a new signature line of sandwiches in our Experience of the Future restaurants to give customers even more great-tasting burger choices at the convenience and value they've come to appreciate at McDonald's.
In the High Growth segment, third quarter comparable sales were up 1.5%, driven by positive performance in Russia and most other markets, partially offset by negative comparable sales in China. Whilst third quarter comparable sales in China were down 1.8%, results improved as the quarter progressed. Excluding the impact of temporary protests surrounding recent events related to the South China Sea, China's comparable sales would have been positive for the quarter.
A strong focus on enhancing convenience through greater integration with third-party delivery providers combined with aggressive core menu sampling events designed to offset the impact of the protests contributed to market share gains amidst the still challenging macroeconomic environment. 
In Russia, the economy remains difficult and consumer purchasing power continues to decline. Despite these challenges, we are growing comparable sales and guest count and gaining market share.
Specifically, our performance is a result of a heightened focus on value as well as the successful marketing campaigns to grow the Breakfast Day part. And I'll be remiss if I didn't mention Japan, where comparable sales increased 17.7% in the third quarter. Diligent execution of the market's comprehensive turnaround plans, which include strong promotions, exciting menu variety, compelling value and a more modern restaurant experience, is enhancing McDonald's' relevance to customers and contributing to sustained momentum in this market.
As we look to the future, we recognize the importance of having the right structure, the right people, a common focus and, lastly, greater accountability across the entire McDonald's System. We've taken steps forward in all 4 areas to set a proper foundation for long-term growth. 
First, the right structure. Building on last year's shift to segments of similar markets, we took further steps in the third quarter to transition to a leaner, more efficient and more nimble organization. This will enable us to effectively share expertise, improve efficiencies and drive down costs, taking greater advantage of our size and scale. Kevin will provide further details in a moment. 
Second, the right talent. An important component of our turnaround plan has always been to ensure we have the right people in the most critical positions. Management changes have been and continue to be an anticipated part of the process. That's why we're focused on a blend of promoting individuals who are ready to take on additional responsibilities, continuing to develop leaders that have the right skills necessary to grow the business and attracting new executives into the business to provide fresh energy and innovative thinking.
I'm confident in the recent selections we have made. This includes Chris Kempczinski succeeding Mike Andres as President of McDonald's U.S.A. effective the 1st of January. As part of a full [ph] transition, Chris is already spending significant time with Mike and our franchisees in the field. 
In the High Growth segment, Joe Erlinger has made an immediate impact upon stepping into the role of President in these markets. He knows these markets well, having been CFO of the segment and the former Managing Director of Korea.
Third, a common focus. In addition to making forward progress on running great restaurants, we have put a greater emphasis on accelerating initiatives that will bring more customers into our restaurants more often. This includes the Experience of the Future, which we're looking to roll out at greater speed in the U.S., and we look forward to sharing more details of those plans as they're finalized.
And lastly, accountability. We've made great progress executing our turnaround plan. Now we're starting to balance those efforts with a greater focus on longer-term growth. It will take all of our franchisees, employees and suppliers working together and holding each other accountable to achieve our ultimate goal of becoming the modern progressive burger company.
We have a long-term view on our potential and the opportunities that exist. I'm confident in the actions we are taking to run better restaurants and the investments we are making. We're getting the right people, foundations and platforms in place to properly grow the business and reassert McDonald's' global brand leadership.
Thanks very much, and now I'll turn it over to Kevin."

Since Ste",1573,"Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. We're pleased with our third quarter results. By staying keenly focused on our customers, we maintained positive momentum while continuing to make meaningful strides toward building a better McDonald's. Since Steve talked about sales and earnings per share, I'll focus on margins and G&A. I'll also provide an update on the key outlook items and the recent progress we've made against our financial targets. 
Starting with the performance drivers for the quarter. Franchise revenues continue to become an increasingly significant portion of our revenue stream as we evolve to a more heavily franchised organization. For third quarter, franchise revenues increased 6% in constant currencies, reflecting strong comparable sales and the impact of refranchising. For the quarter, franchise margin dollars exceeded $2 billion, a 6% increase in constant currencies, and contributed over $100 million to our growth in global operating income. This solid performance reflects sales driven improvements across all segments, led by results in the International Lead Markets. In addition, we maintained strong global franchise margins of over 82%. These results are a testament to the benefits of transitioning toward a more predictable and stable revenue stream.
Growth in company-operated margins also contributed about $75 million to our growth in global operating income, as company-operated margins rose to more than $730 million, an 11% increase in constant currencies. Company-operated margins climbed 260 basis points, with the U.S. and China leading the overall improvement. Our emphasis on running better restaurants, from enhanced conveniences to tighter operating controls, is yielding a better experience for our customers as well as improved restaurant profitability.
In the U.S., the company-operated margin percent increased 450 basis points for the quarter, reflecting positive comparable sales and a favorable commodity environment. These results also reflect the benefit from our refranchising as we optimize our company-operated restaurant portfolio and the ongoing contribution it makes to our bottom line.
Moving on to G&A. At the end of last year, we noted that we expected to realize about $150 million in savings during 2015 and 2016, with about half of the savings to be achieved in each year. For third quarter, our G&A expenses increased 1% in constant currencies due to higher incentive-based compensation as a result of our year-to-date performance. For the full year, we now expect G&A to be relatively flat in constant currencies. However, excluding incentive-based compensation, G&A for the year is expected to be down about 3% in constant currencies, which equates to roughly $75 million in savings due to lower employee-related costs resulting from our restructuring initiatives. This will bring our total G&A savings at the end of 2016 to at least $150 million. 
Let me switch gears now for an update on menu pricing and commodity costs. In the U.S., commodity costs declined by more than 6% during the third quarter. Given the strength of our third quarter savings, combined with our outlook for fourth quarter, we now expect the segment's full year basket of goods to be down 4.5% to 5%. Commodity costs for the International Lead segment were down about 1% for the third quarter and are expected to remain relatively flat for the remainder of this year. 
While we continue to benefit from favorable commodity costs around the world, we continue to experience rising labor costs in many of our markets. These pressures are considered as we make pricing decisions over the course of the year. Our objective is to manage pricing in a way that maintains our strong value proposition, contributes to guest traffic growth and supports restaurant profitability. In the U.S., third quarter pricing year-over-year was up about 3.5% compared with food-away-from-home inflation of about 2.5%.
For U.S. company-operated restaurant pricing, our goal is to approximate food-away-from-home inflation over time, so we may be a little higher or lower in any given quarter. We are also mindful that the current 450 basis point gap between the cost of eating at home versus dining out is the largest spread in more than 30 years and may be impacting consumer behavior. We continue to track these metrics and expect our overall menu price increase at year-end to be more in line with food-away-from-home inflation. For the International Lead segment, while price increases vary by market, year-over-year increases for these markets averaged about 2%.
Next, I'd like to provide an update on our foreign currency outlook. Based on current exchange rates, we project foreign currency translation to negatively impact our earnings per share by $0.01 to $0.02 in the fourth quarter, which will bring the full year impact to $0.09 to $0.10. As always, please take our currency guidance as directional only because rates will change as we move throughout the year.
Last quarter, I committed to providing more detail on today's call regarding the role that our organizational restructuring is playing in reaching our previously announced G&A savings target. For the last several months, we have been working with outside advisers to thoroughly analyze our G&A spending and organizational structure, from our corporate functions to the individual markets and the critical role they play in the field.
Our overall goal was to focus our resources in talent and customer-facing activities that drive business growth while creating a more globalized system that more effectively leverages our size and scale to spread learnings better and drive cost improvements and efficiencies.
As we move toward becoming a leaner and more agile organization, we're positioned to make quicker and better decisions and to execute on our strategic intent to create a better customer experience. The pace at which All Day Breakfast moved from the U.S. to Australia is a great example of how we're accelerating knowledge transfer across the system to benefit customers globally. I'm confident that our redesigned organization is now better equipped to adapt to today's rapidly changing environment.
As a result of our reorganization, we incurred roughly $80 million in restructuring charges for the third quarter. While this component of our restructuring is nearing completion, we do expect to incur some additional but less significant charges in the fourth quarter. We remain on track to achieve our net annual G&A savings target of $500 million by 2018, with the vast majority of the savings expected to be realized by the end of next year.
We also continue to make changes to the business through our global refranchising efforts. Since the beginning of 2015, we refranchised nearly 1,000 restaurants, including 140 in the third quarter. The large majority of restaurants refranchised to date have been sold to existing conventional franchisees. As previously indicated, we're also actively pursuing a transaction in China, where we are currently in the process of vetting a select number of qualified bidders. 
In addition, we have made meaningful progress in our search for long-term strategic partners in Malaysia and Singapore. These markets collectively operate almost 400 restaurants, more than 80% of which are company-owned. We are in the final stages of the process and expect to complete these transactions by the end of this year. Given where the transactions stand, we recorded a noncash charge of approximately $40 million in the quarter to account for historical currency losses.
As we moved into the month of October, we also completed the sale of 75 company-operated restaurants in the Ural region of Russia to an existing developmental licensee. The results of this transaction will be reflected in fourth quarter. So we remain on track to refranchise about 4,000 restaurants by the end of 2018, and we'll continue to keep you apprised of our progress.
Last November, we increased our 3-year cash return to shareholders target to $30 billion by the end of 2016. During the quarter, we returned $3.4 billion to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends. Share repurchases for the quarter totaled $2.7 billion, the vast majority of which was completed under our second accelerated share repurchase program of the year. 
Further, in September, our Board of Directors approved a 6% dividend increase effective in the fourth quarter, the equivalent of $3.76 annually. This increase marked the company's 40th consecutive year of delivering a dividend increase for our shareholders.
As a result of these activities, the cumulative cash return under our 3-year target stands at nearly $28 billion, and we are on track to complete the remaining amount by the end of this year. 
To summarize, over the course of the last year, we've demonstrated our commitment to meeting our financial targets. By the end of 2016, we will have met our $30 billion cash return to shareholders target, achieved nearly 1/3 of our G&A savings target and completed more than 1/3 of our restaurant refranchising, with some significant transactions on track for completion in 2017.
We continue to measure our progress and hold ourselves accountable in each phase of the turnaround to ensure that we're appropriately allocating our resources to strategic operating out bringing plans that will grow our business. 
As we move into the final quarter of 2016, we are mindful of the hurdles we face in the near term, but we're keeping our line of sight clearly focused on the long term. Through our actions, we're unlocking financial value and using it to fuel the innovation and investments that will create a better customer experience and deliver sustained profitable growth for the long term for our system and our shareholders.
Thanks. Now I'll turn it over to Chris to begin our Q&A."

So first of all, on the All Day Breakfast and the McPick 2, so that was the -- they are 2 of the foundational elements of what's helped maintain and -- establish and then maintain momentum of the business. So as you know,",754,"David. Steve. I'll take this one. So first of all, on the All Day Breakfast and the McPick 2, so that was the -- they are 2 of the foundational elements of what's helped maintain and -- establish and then maintain momentum of the business. So as you know, we launched All Day Breakfast around this time last year. It's served us well. It -- as you know, the initial peak [ph] was higher than we expected, and it settled down to a level that we're happy with. In the meantime, we worked on how can we extend that platform, both operationally and making sure the consumer had -- the demand was there. And we extended it just a couple of weeks ago as well, 3 or 4 weeks ago. So that is here to stay. It's doing well for us, and it's a foundational element of our business momentum. McPick 2, like -- similarly, it really is well embraced by both our operators and by our customers. So as you know, we've tried both McPick 2 for $5, which is typically the platform we use at a national level. And we'll be bringing that back, I don't know, 3, 4 times a year and they're hitting [ph] at a national level and still using the flexibility of that platform to rotate several items through that menu. But what you don't see perhaps so visibly is -- across the regions is how McPick 2 is always on. And typically, the regions will use a greater value element, like a McPick 2 for $2.50, McPick 2 for $2, McPick 2 for $3. And again, depending on seasonality and the customer preference, we'll rotate several products through there. So both those platforms are good contributors to us and are important part of our business going forward. In terms of what we've got to be excited about going forward, there's plenty. And part of what we're enjoying about the new structure in this business is the greater visibility we have to what works around the world and what's creating some of that success internationally for us, but also the way that they've simplified the structure in the U.S. What's worked in a regional level? So there's a lot of product innovation, local product innovation at a regional level that we're looking to learn from and lift where appropriate. There's some -- earlier this quarter, I spent some time in Phoenix and Scottsdale in Arizona and then went up to Portland in Oregon. And one common success [ph] back in both those regions -- both of them are the strongest sales regions we have in the U.S. currently. And what was also particularly successful there was they were complementing local beverage value alongside the McPick 2 platform alongside the fundamentals of running better restaurants. So there are these pockets of great success that we're looking to lift and localize and then launch rapidly. So the other piece that I've always come back to, and I won't hesitate coming back to, is probably the most important element of what has established momentum in the U.S. It's the operational improvements around running better restaurants. And that is something that is so, so fundamental, and it may not be a headline grabber. But if you think about the 27 million, 28 million customers that come in every single day, if we can offer a more consistent, friendlier, more convenient service to them, that is where our greatest reward is. And the customer satisfaction scores are growing significantly in the right direction. And again, we have a number of ways that we're looking to improve the operational experience, including using technology to make it more easy and more convenient for customers. So we have multiple future growth drivers. And internationally, again, we're scanning the horizon, clearly. I mean, you've seen the success of -- the very, very consistent smaller [ph] success across the International Lead Markets. And there are certain common success stories across those. Most notably, how they are embracing what we're calling, describing the Experience of the Future, which is how you use modern facilities that, hopefully, redefine front-of-house hospitality experience; the use of technology with self-order kiosks, for example; integrating that with mobile apps and, again, offering a degree -- an appropriate degree of customization for customers so they can really exert their choice and enjoy variety across our menus. So again, you can expect us to incorporate all those successes into the U.S. business as we move forward."

As you know, it's a market share fight out there. It really is a scramble. The -- there is certainly a softening top line across the sector with consumer confidence. We -- I think all of us in the sector would prefer some tailwinds. If you look -- there aren't many tailwind at the moment, there's not great economic growth to help provide a lift. Consumer confidence is muted. We're at a rather unusual stage at the election cycle. So none of that's really providing a tailwind for us. That said, there's a significant market out there, and we're going to keep battling for market share. That said, seeing the softening of the gap was not a great surprise to us, because it was a particular -- this time last year and heading into the fourth quarter is fairly, relatively [ph] strong performance for us. So the reality is the trends we're seeing are no surprise to us and certainly, aren't shaking us from our longer-term objectives. From a leadership perspective, I'd love to talk about it. I'm excited about where we're at. We're heading into 2017 with a -- really a world-class team that one would expect from a world-class business. We have made changes. And as you go through the various phases of a turnaround into growth, there are times when the skill sets required, as we transition, also need to change. So it's a delicate balance between leveraging the experience, the knowledge, the tenure, the understanding of the system with more tenured leaders, also bringing in innovative thinking. But I could just draw some examples to this. I mean, there's -- giving Chris Kempczinski the opportunity to lead the U.S. business, I'm really excited about. Because the reality is whilst he has somewhat limited McDonald's experience, I think [ph] he brings some phenomenal external leadership experience from global brands, consumer brands, which will be valuable to us. But also, let's not forget that if he was to take the 5 or 6 key direct reports that he has reported [ph] on, there's more than 120 years of McDonald's U.S. experience amongst them. So I think we've got the McDonald's experience piece covered, and with his fresh thinking, I'm sure that's going to be a very, very potent combination. If you look at the role that we've created with Doug Goare now. I mean, Doug's been around for the best part of 40 years, and there are very few roles in this business that Doug hasn't filled yet. He's had functional leadership in supply chain, functional leadership for franchising, real estate, as well as field leadership both here in the U.S., previously ran Europe, and now he's proven to be a great leader of our International Lead Markets. Leveraging Doug's experience to help blend in with a new experience like Chris. We're all one team, and that's a good balance. Joe Erlinger taking the High Growth. I mean, Joe started off in the U.S. business 15 years ago. He became a regional manager, very successfully here in the U.S., transitioned to become a market leader, an Managing Director of the Korean market; has financial experience and became the CFO in the newly formed High Growth market. And he's perfectly placed to step in and add his energy and insight into a leadership position. And then if you were to talk about -- for Chris' transition, we'd already prepared for that. We'd already had Lucy Brady come and join our business. She's a Senior Vice President at BCG, 20 years' experience in helping global businesses develop growth strategies. So ideally placed seamlessly into that. So it's an important balance. It's something that I enjoyed leading when I was in the U.K., when we were transitioning from probably a McDonald's only management team to one that I felt had the right combination. And getting that balance right now is critical, and I'm really excited to be into next year with a team that's sharp and ready to go."

I mean, really, it's a fascinating time to be running an international business. It really is. Because if you speak to the team in France, for example, who have led so much of our strategic thinking and the innovation across our business, they're now facing, really, not just unforeseen, but previously not experienced challenges. And given not just their macroeconomic environment, we know that GDP is down in France, but there's different dynamics. And given some of the situation and the security terror situation they face there, it really is creating some very significant dynamic changes in that market. Tourism, which has always been a substantial part of -- that's fueled the economy in France has really softened. And we're seeing -- you see it in the hotel bookings, and you can see it impacted in, certainly, the more tourist areas, whether it's the Southern France or Paris, within our business, where we do have a heavy concentration of restaurants. We also see it affect the way that consumers live their lives, French consumers. So there's a slight reticence to go into high-density tourist areas because they're slightly concerned at the moment. Now I think some of those things are temporary, and some of the things may be slightly more permanent. But it certainly means our management teams in France happen to be much more agile and responsive to act in accordance with consumer sentiment. When you go to a market like Spain, where they have probably suffered more through the economic crisis than any other market that we do business in, youth unemployment up at 25%, for example. So we have just gently slowed down the new-store opening there and also focused our efforts and our investment on existing store portfolio, and I'm delighted with the progress that market's made, as it's built its momentum, it's returning to growth for the second half of this year, and the outlook looks very confident. U.K. is a -- probably a well- and often-spoken story. I think it's 42 consecutive quarters of growth now, and that momentum really does look very solid and well baked in. So I won't say too much more about that. But then you can go internationally across to Asia. Now China is a challenging market. And the manner in which the team are adapting to the variations that they have to experience, both, again, in consumer sentiment and the broader economy, is admirable. And as they are seeing -- just as one example, they now have a substantial part of that business is the delivery business. And not just -- originally, we set up and established our own McDonald's delivery. So there's -- and that proved to be very successful, but now integrating it into third-party delivery providers. And that has way further accelerated the -- our momentum of business and customer satisfaction, as more people are getting used to ordering and eating at home. So we're seeing different trends around the world. And the one thing that is particularly beneficial to us now is as we remove some of the layers in our business, the visibility we have into what's going on and how we can transfer that knowledge and use it to our advantage in other markets, and part of the advantage here of having Chris in his position now, he spent his first year traveling around the world, both with myself and other senior leaders and on his own, visiting these markets, seeing what's going on, understanding that big levers of our business. And he's now perfectly placed to help take that into the U.S. business."

Some of that is the timing of when we take pricing. So if you look at last year, we actually took some pricing in October, whereas this year, we took it in September. So that when you look at a year-over-year basis, you have a little timing shift. There's about 70 to 75 basis points of pricing that will be in last year's fourth quarter that we may not replace some or all of that in the fourth quarter this year, which would bring some of our pricing down and maybe more in line with food-away-from-home. But we still do keep an eye on both food-away-from-home and food at home, which, you mentioned, the food at home is extremely low right now. Thanks."

Thanks, John. I see it starting to make a contribution in '17. I mean, the reality is we would see this as something like a 3-year program, which is exactly what we're seeing through the markets like U.K., Canada, Australia. These are rolling programs and actually give us growth upon growth upon growth as it -- so for the U.K., for example, they're already almost 40% converted to the entire Experience of the Future, which is introducing that technology along with the hospitality as well as the food elements. And therefore, their visibility on year-on-year growth over the next 2 to 3 years looks pretty strong. In the U.S., we're certainly earlier in that cycle. In terms of modernized restaurants, just over 50% of the U.S. estate is modernized. We've got some work to do to complete that. And then, of course, within that, we want to layer on top the other elements -- or the far broader elements and consumer-facing elements of the Experience of the Future, integrating the app into the self-order kiosks, offering different ways that customers can be served, they can place their orders, they can customize their foods. So we expect to start seeing that ramped up through '17. And literally, the minute you convert a restaurant, we see a sales lift. So yes, it will be a contributor. But we'd probably be getting that full run rate for '18 and '19 as well, which I think it is a very strong program. One of the things we have benefited from is we've learned a lot of what works. [indiscernible] amongst 2 things that don't work in the markets that they nearly adopted in Australia and Canada, for example. So we can bring that best practice into the U.S., make sure it's locally relevant, and then go hard at it. So we're really excited. The barrier to it is really -- is just a collective will to invest. I mean, there is an investment element to it, both on our and our operator's level, for the company. And certainly, from a company perspective, we're allocating our capital to provide significant support alongside the operators to co-invest with them. And we're really happy at the moment that the U.S. cash flows are all-time high. That means their ability to invest can never have been greater. So I think we're in a good place."

The follow-up is it's starting -- you're talking about rolling off. To the extent that you know kind of what elasticity looks like in your business, is there any sense that maybe by allowing it to roll off, your traffic could accelerate in the sense that traffic has been negative, and maybe the higher prices is a contributor to that so that we could see that comp composition change a little based on what you know about your customers? And then my second point is -- second question is about the unit growth taking it down. Is that because you're intentionally steering more capital to existing units or remodels?

So it wouldn't be a surprise to see that come down a little bit, which could help then accelerate some of the guest count growth. Regarding unit growth, we've brought it down by around 100. I think we had about 1,000 last quarter. Now we said about 900. It's a little bit in various markets, a few in China, a few in Spain. Nothing of significance, I would say. The reallocation is really to some of these investment areas that Steve was just talking about, certainly, in places like Australia and the U.K. where we're implementing Experience of the Future, seeing good sales lifts from those investments. We continue to reinvest in those types of investments. So you saw that capital didn't come down.

So yes, it's probably in the mix, but it certainly doesn't explain. I think they are broader macroeconomic issues of consumer confidence and just uncertainty over wage increases. There's a slight squeeze on discretionary spend, with gas prices edging back up and health care cost going back up. So I think those are the sorts of things that we see affecting customers, and based on the spare cash they have in their pocket. With regards to Experience of the Future, I mean, one of the great learns we've had, and particularly with launching so aggressively in Australia over 1.5 year ago, which the main food element was something we described as Create Your Taste, and that was and in-store-only premium food offering. Now it worked great, but we wanted to find a way that we could take that to our entire customer base. So with the Aussie team, we've worked on solutions now, what we can now bring. So we believe there will be food elements, customizing premium quality food that we can deliver through both the drive-thru and in-store. And I think that's one of the benefits we have of getting those early-adopter markets, going aggressive, learn, bring it back over and localize it and launch it.

So we're very conscious of making sure that we've got the right investment levels to be able to strategically still invest in the business. Might there be some opportunity beyond the $500 million? I guess, I'd say it does -- we're not going to stop looking or stop having the discipline in the organization to continue managing the business appropriately. But there's been a lot of change in the organization in the near term. And our belief is that for us, right now, this is the right level for us to focus on in the near term. I wouldn't say that, that means we stop and then never kind of manage the business effectively going forward. But for us, right now, the commitment is to the $500 million. Regarding capital, right now, as you know, we're right around $2 billion. What you may see in the near term is as we convert some of these countries to developmental licensees where we free up some of that capital, some of that may be redeployed to the U.S. to spend on this Experience of the Future investment that Steve was talking about. So you could see some reallocation of that capital in the next few years that would effectively keep our capital envelope relatively similar to what it is today. And then once that's complete, it's likely to go down after that.

139488,377810078,1058968,"McDonald's Corp., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 21, 2016",2016-10-21,"Earnings Calls","McDonald's Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. I'm encouraged by the actions we've taken and the progress we've made as we execute our turnaround plan. Customer perceptions at McDonald's have steadily improved over the past 18 months, and the third quarter ma",2155,"Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. I'm encouraged by the actions we've taken and the progress we've made as we execute our turnaround plan. Customer perceptions at McDonald's have steadily improved over the past 18 months, and the third quarter marks 5 consecutive quarters of comparable sales growth across all business segments with many markets gaining share. 
For the third quarter, global comparable sales increased 3.5% and operating income was up 7% in constant currencies. Earnings per share rose 9% in constant currencies. Excluding the impact of previously announced current and prior year strategic charges, earnings per share for the quarter increased 17% in constant currencies. 
Profitability has increased both for McDonald's and franchisees. At the restaurant level, franchisee cash flows reached all-time highs in many markets, including the U.S. These results are a testament to our diligent execution of the turnaround plan as we put customers at the center of everything we do. We are at a point where we've begun to transition from a focus on revitalization to a mindset that's concentrated on strengthening the business to drive sustainable growth over the long term. 
We expected performance through 2016 to be uneven, and it has been. Markets such as the U.K., Australia and Canada continue to grow sales and guest counts, whilst market including the U.S., France and Germany work to overcome challenges of varying degrees.
We are mindful of the near-term headwinds we face, most notably in the U.S., as we lap the very successful introduction of All Day Breakfast, which was immediately popular to customers. However, we're not managing the business quarter-by-quarter. In fact, our commitment to investing in the business is stronger now than ever. We're taking action in the areas that matter most to customers. 
In particular, we're placing significant emphasis on food quality, the customer experience and value to give people more reasons to visit McDonald's. We believe the long-term investments we are making in these areas provide the foundation on which we'll build as we work to be recognized as a modern, progressive burger company by customers.
In the area of food, we are taking important steps in how our food is prepared and the ingredients we use. In the U.S., we completed our transition to chicken not treated by antibiotics important to human medicine a year ahead of schedule. We introduced new buns that do not contain high-fructose corn syrup, and we removed artificial preservatives from our popular Chicken McNuggets, and customers have responded favorably to this news and we've seen sales accelerate as a result.
Following the announcement, sales of McNuggets increased nearly 10%, and they are sustaining above previous levels. 
We're also modernizing the customer experience in markets around the world as we evolve to the Experience of the Future. 
In Canada, we are engaging with customers in simpler, less stressful ways by offering them more choices on how they order and pay. We now have dual-point service and self-order kiosks in almost 90% of our traditional restaurants. In addition, we're taking steps to redefine hospitality on both sides of the counter with dedicated guest experience leaders in all of Canada's traditional restaurants. 
Finally, value, a critical priority in all markets. In Germany, for example, we've deployed a 2-pronged approach. First, we successfully added new layers to our value platform at mid-tier price points. At the same time, we're celebrating the quality and taste of our core products through strong marketing and promotional campaigns. These steps build on the new pricing structure we introduced earlier this year to strengthen our value platform, and that's resonating well with the price-conscious German consumer.
The actions we are taking specific to our food, the customer experience and the value, and telling customers about the changes, are making a difference. Customer satisfaction has improved significantly, up more than 6% year-to-date in both the U.S. and Canada, with most major markets seeing improvements. This is a testament to the progress we've made since we refocused on running better restaurants as part of our turnaround plan in May of last year.
With that context, let's turn to performance highlights in the markets. Beginning with the U.S., comparable sales remained positive for the third quarter, up 1.3%. Customers love All Day Breakfast and the way we've continued to build on its success. Since its introduction last year, customers asked for even more choices, so we recently launched the second phase of All Day Breakfast. The expanded menu now includes muffins and biscuits as well as our beloved McGriddles all day in all U.S. restaurants.
At the same time, we're enhancing the experience to adapt alongside customers' expectations. One of the most notable ways we're doing this in restaurants is by better integrating technology in visible, tangible ways. For example, more than 90% of U.S. restaurants now use digital menu boards. These new menu boards enable us to showcase the quality of our food with fresh photography. Because they're less congested and better organized, the menus now do a better job highlighting the broad range of choices available. The menu boards are also smart. They're built with a robust content management system that we haven't even begun tapping into yet. When fully enabled, we'll be able to adjust what's featured on the menu based on time of day or even weather conditions. We'll be more relevant to customers as we remind them about our ice cream cones and McFlurries on a hot summer day or handcrafted hot McCaf√© beverages if it's chilly outside and they feel the need to warm up.
We also continue to emphasize value, because we know how much budget-oriented customers count on McDonald's. Franchisees and customers alike have embraced the McPick 2 platform. They appreciate the choice and flexibility it provides. In September, we promoted McPick 2 for $5 nationally, whilst other variations of McPick 2 were offered on a local level. Some of our best-performing regions offered beverage value to complement the McPick 2 platform. We'll continue to tap into these learnings, both nationally and locally, as we design future McPick offers.
Underpinning these efforts is a continued focus on running better restaurants. Our commitment to raising the bar with an emphasis on underperforming restaurants is making a difference. Customer satisfaction scores have improved the most for our bottom-quintile restaurants, and we've cut the customer satisfaction score gap between the top and bottom quintile performance nearly in half through our efforts to provide a better, more consistent experience for customers in every restaurant every time they visit.
Turning to the International Lead Market segment. Third quarter comparable sales were up 3.3%, driven by positive performance across 4 of the 5 major markets, with France being the exception. The U.K., Australia and Canada delivered yet another quarter of comparable sales and guest count growth. These markets share similar elements that underlie their strong track records of success: contemporary restaurant designs with over 90% of restaurants reimaged; compelling menu strategies tailored to local customer tastes, such as the Spice It Up event in Canada featuring spicy Sriracha sauce on a country chicken or Angus beef sandwich; and a modern service experience that incorporates the elements of Experience of the Future to provide customers with more choice and flexibility on how they order, what they order and how they are served. These elements amplify each other to create a notable difference for customers who then reward us by visiting more often.
I'm encouraged by the progress we've made in Germany, which I had a chance to experience firsthand when I visited the team there last quarter. Comparable sales were positive in the market for the third quarter. 
Earlier, I mentioned the steps we've taken to strengthen our value platform. Combined with strong promotions featuring customer favorites like the hamburger Royal with Cheese, these actions are making a difference and getting us back on track to grow top line results once again.
That said, I want to stress the growing -- that growing guest counts remains a top priority. That's the key to winning back the share we've lost in recent years. 
In France, third quarter comparable sales were negative. This was driven in large part by ongoing macroeconomic challenges, including a declining GDP, high unemployment and the continuing concerns for personal safety, which is impacting both inbound tourism as well as the French consumer. 
The customers appreciate the actions we've taken to strengthen our value offer, including further extensions of the well-regarded and successful P'tit Plaisir value platform. We're also satisfying French consumers' growing appetite for premium burgers through strong promotional campaigns featuring customer favorites like the 280 Burger and the Big Tasty. In addition, we're introducing a new signature line of sandwiches in our Experience of the Future restaurants to give customers even more great-tasting burger choices at the convenience and value they've come to appreciate at McDonald's.
In the High Growth segment, third quarter comparable sales were up 1.5%, driven by positive performance in Russia and most other markets, partially offset by negative comparable sales in China. Whilst third quarter comparable sales in China were down 1.8%, results improved as the quarter progressed. Excluding the impact of temporary protests surrounding recent events related to the South China Sea, China's comparable sales would have been positive for the quarter.
A strong focus on enhancing convenience through greater integration with third-party delivery providers combined with aggressive core menu sampling events designed to offset the impact of the protests contributed to market share gains amidst the still challenging macroeconomic environment. 
In Russia, the economy remains difficult and consumer purchasing power continues to decline. Despite these challenges, we are growing comparable sales and guest count and gaining market share.
Specifically, our performance is a result of a heightened focus on value as well as the successful marketing campaigns to grow the Breakfast Day part. And I'd be remiss if I didn't mention Japan, where comparable sales increased 17.7% in the third quarter. Diligent execution of the market's comprehensive turnaround plans, which include strong promotions, exciting menu variety, compelling value and a more modern restaurant experience, is enhancing McDonald's' relevance to customers and contributing to sustained momentum in this market.
As we look to the future, we recognize the importance of having the right structure, the right people, a common focus and, lastly, greater accountability across the entire McDonald's System. We've taken steps forward in all 4 areas to set a proper foundation for long-term growth. 
First, the right structure. Building on last year's shift to segments of similar markets, we took further steps in the third quarter to transition to a leaner, more efficient and more nimble organization. This will enable us to effectively share expertise, improve efficiencies and drive down costs, taking greater advantage of our size and scale. Kevin will provide further details in a moment. 
Second, the right talent. An important component of our turnaround plan has always been to ensure we have the right people in the most critical positions. Management changes have been and continue to be an anticipated part of the process. That's why we're focused on a blend of promoting individuals who are ready to take on additional responsibilities, continuing to develop leaders that have the right skills necessary to grow the business and attracting new executives into the business to provide fresh energy and innovative thinking.
I'm confident in the recent selections we have made. This includes Chris Kempczinski succeeding Mike Andres as President of McDonald's U.S.A. effective the 1st of January. As part of a focal transition, Chris is already spending significant time with Mike and our franchisees in the field. 
In the High Growth segment, Joe Erlinger has made an immediate impact upon stepping into the role of President in these markets. He knows these markets well, having been CFO of the segment and the former Managing Director of Korea.
Third, a common focus. In addition to making forward progress on running great restaurants, we are putting greater emphasis on accelerating initiatives that will bring more customers into our restaurants more often. This includes the Experience of the Future, which we're looking to roll out at greater speed in the U.S., and we look forward to sharing more details of those plans as they're finalized.
And lastly, accountability. We've made great progress executing our turnaround plan. Now we're starting to balance those efforts with a greater focus on longer-term growth. It will take all of our franchisees, employees and suppliers working together and holding each other accountable to achieve our ultimate goal of becoming the modern progressive burger company.
We have a long-term view on our potential and the opportunities that exist. I'm confident in the actions we are taking to run better restaurants and the investments we are making. We're getting the right people, foundations and platforms in place to properly grow the business and reassert McDonald's' global brand leadership.
Thanks very much, and now I'll turn it over to Kevin."

Since Ste",1569,"Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. We're pleased with our third quarter results. By staying keenly focused on our customers, we maintained positive momentum while continuing to make meaningful strides toward building a better McDonald's. Since Steve talked about sales and earnings per share, I'll focus on margins and G&A. I'll also provide an update on the key outlook items and the recent progress we've made against our financial targets. 
Starting with the performance drivers for the quarter. Franchise revenues continue to become an increasingly significant portion of our revenue stream as we evolve to a more heavily franchised organization. For third quarter, franchise revenues increased 6% in constant currencies, reflecting strong comparable sales and the impact of refranchising. For the quarter, franchise margin dollars exceeded $2 billion, a 6% increase in constant currencies, and contributed over $100 million to our growth in global operating income. This solid performance reflects sales driven improvements across all segments, led by results in the International Lead Markets. In addition, we maintained strong global franchise margins of over 82%. These results are a testament to the benefits of transitioning toward a more predictable and stable revenue stream.
Growth in company-operated margins also contributed about $75 million to our growth in global operating income, as company-operated margins rose to more than $730 million, an 11% increase in constant currencies. Company-operated margins climbed 260 basis points, with the U.S. and China leading the overall improvement. Our emphasis on running better restaurants, from enhanced conveniences to tighter operating controls, is yielding a better experience for our customers as well as improved restaurant profitability.
In the U.S., the company-operated margin percent increased 450 basis points for the quarter, reflecting positive comparable sales and a favorable commodity environment. These results also reflect the benefit from our refranchising as we optimize our company-operated restaurant portfolio and the ongoing contribution it makes to our bottom line.
Moving on to G&A. At the end of last year, we noted that we expected to realize about $150 million in savings during 2015 and 2016, with about half of the savings to be achieved in each year. For third quarter, our G&A expenses increased 1% in constant currencies due to higher incentive-based compensation as a result of our year-to-date performance. For the full year, we now expect G&A to be relatively flat in constant currencies. However, excluding incentive-based compensation, G&A for the year is expected to be down about 3% in constant currencies, which equates to roughly $75 million in savings due to lower employee-related costs resulting from our restructuring initiatives. This will bring our total G&A savings at the end of 2016 to at least $150 million. 
Let me switch gears now for an update on menu pricing and commodity costs. In the U.S., commodity costs declined by more than 6% during the third quarter. Given the strength of our third quarter savings, combined with our outlook for fourth quarter, we now expect the segment's full year basket of goods to be down 4.5% to 5%. Commodity costs for the International Lead segment were down about 1% for the third quarter and are expected to remain relatively flat for the remainder of this year. 
While we continue to benefit from favorable commodity costs around the world, we continue to experience rising labor costs in many of our markets. These pressures are considered as we make pricing decisions over the course of the year. Our objective is to manage pricing in a way that maintains our strong value proposition, contributes to guest traffic growth and supports restaurant profitability. In the U.S., third quarter pricing year-over-year was up about 3.5% compared with food-away-from-home inflation of about 2.5%.
For U.S. company-operated restaurant pricing, our goal is to approximate food-away-from-home inflation over time, so we may be a little higher or lower in any given quarter. We are also mindful that the current 450-basis-point gap between the cost of eating at home versus dining out is the largest spread in more than 30 years and may be impacting consumer behavior. We continue to track these metrics and expect our overall menu price increase at year-end to be more in line with food-away-from-home inflation. For the International Lead segment, while price increases vary by market, year-over-year increases for these markets averaged about 2%.
Next, I'd like to provide an update on our foreign currency outlook. Based on current exchange rates, we project foreign currency translation to negatively impact our earnings per share by $0.01 to $0.02 in the fourth quarter, which will bring the full year impact to $0.09 to $0.10. As always, please take our currency guidance as directional only because rates will change as we move throughout the year.
Last quarter, I committed to providing more detail on today's call regarding the role that our organizational restructuring is playing in reaching our previously announced G&A savings target. For the last several months, we have been working with outside advisers to thoroughly analyze our G&A spending and organizational structure, from our corporate functions to the individual markets and the critical role they play in the field.
Our overall goal was to focus our resources in talent and customer-facing activities that drive business growth while creating a more globalized system that more effectively leverages our size and scale to spread learnings better and drive cost improvements and efficiencies.
As we move toward becoming a leaner and more agile organization, we're positioned to make quicker and better decisions and to execute on our strategic intent to create a better customer experience. The pace at which All Day Breakfast moved from the U.S. to Australia is a great example of how we're accelerating knowledge transfer across the system to benefit customers globally. I'm confident that our redesigned organization is now better equipped to adapt to today's rapidly changing environment.
As a result of our reorganization, we incurred roughly $80 million in restructuring charges for the third quarter. While this component of our restructuring is nearing completion, we do expect to incur some additional but less significant charges in the fourth quarter. We remain on track to achieve our net annual G&A savings target of $500 million by 2018, with the vast majority of the savings expected to be realized by the end of next year.
We also continue to make changes to the business through our global refranchising efforts. Since the beginning of 2015, we refranchised nearly 1,000 restaurants, including 140 in the third quarter. The large majority of restaurants refranchised to date have been sold to existing conventional franchisees. As previously indicated, we're also actively pursuing a transaction in China, where we are currently in the process of vetting a select number of qualified bidders. 
In addition, we have made meaningful progress in our search for long-term strategic partners in Malaysia and Singapore. These markets collectively operate almost 400 restaurants, more than 80% of which are company-owned. We are in the final stages of the process and expect to complete these transactions by the end of this year. Given where the transactions stand, we recorded a noncash charge of approximately $40 million in the quarter to account for historical currency losses.
As we moved into the month of October, we also completed the sale of 75 company-operated restaurants in the Ural region of Russia to an existing developmental licensee. The results of this transaction will be reflected in fourth quarter. So we remain on track to refranchise about 4,000 restaurants by the end of 2018, and we'll continue to keep you appraised of our progress.
Last November, we increased our 3-year cash return to shareholders target to $30 billion by the end of 2016. During the quarter, we returned $3.4 billion to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends. Share repurchases for the quarter totaled $2.7 billion, the vast majority of which was completed under our second accelerated share repurchase program of the year. 
Further, in September, our Board of Directors approved a 6% dividend increase effective in the fourth quarter, the equivalent of $3.76 annually. This increase marked the company's 40th consecutive year of delivering a dividend increase for our shareholders.
As a result of these activities, the cumulative cash return under our 3-year target stands at nearly $28 billion, and we are on track to complete the remaining amount by the end of this year. 
To summarize, over the course of the last year, we've demonstrated our commitment to meeting our financial targets. By the end of 2016, we will have met our $30 billion cash return to shareholders target, achieved nearly 1/3 of our G&A savings target and completed more than 1/3 of our restaurant refranchising, with some significant transactions on track for completion in 2017.
We continue to measure our progress and hold ourselves accountable in each phase of the turnaround to ensure that we're appropriately allocating our resources to strategic operating plans that will grow our business. 
As we move into the final quarter of 2016, we are mindful of the hurdles we face in the near term, but we're keeping our line of sight clearly focused on the long term. Through our actions, we're unlocking financial value and using it to fuel the innovation and investments that will create a better customer experience and deliver sustained profitable growth for the long term for our system and our shareholders.
Thanks. Now I'll turn it over to Chris to begin our Q&A."

So as you know,",753,"David. Steve. I'll take this one. So first of all, on the All Day Breakfast and the McPick 2, so that was the -- they are 2 of the foundational elements of what's helped maintain and -- establish and then maintain momentum of the business. So as you know, we launched All Day Breakfast around this time last year. It's served us well. It -- as you know, the initial peak was higher than we expected, and it settled down to a level that we're happy with. In the meantime, we worked on how can we extend that platform, both operationally and making sure the consumer had -- demand was there. And we extended it just a couple of weeks ago as well, 3 or 4 weeks ago. So that is here to stay. It's doing well for us, and is a foundational element of our business momentum. McPick 2, like -- similarly, it really is well embraced by both our operators and by our customers. So as you know, we've tried both McPick 2 for $5, which is typically the platform we use at a national level. And we'll be bringing that back, I don't know, 3, 4 times a year and they're hitting at a national level and still using the flexibility of that platform to rotate different items through that menu. But what you don't see perhaps so visibly is -- across the regions is how McPick 2 is always on. And typically, the regions will use a greater value element, like a McPick 2 for $2.50, McPick 2 for $2, McPick 2 for $3. And again, depending on seasonality and the customer preference, we'll rotate several products through there. So both those platforms are good contributors to us and are important part of our business going forward. In terms of what we've got to be excited about going forward, there's plenty. And part of what we're enjoying about the new structure in this business is the greater visibility we have to what works around the world and what's creating some of that success internationally for us, but also the way that they've simplified the structure in the U.S. What's worked in a regional level? So there's a lot of product innovation, local product innovation at a regional level that we're looking to learn from and lift where appropriate. There's some -- earlier this quarter, I spent some time in Phoenix and Scottsdale in Arizona, then went up to Portland in Oregon. And one common success [ph] back in both those regions -- both of them are the strongest sales regions we have in the U.S. currently. And what was also particularly successful there was they were complementing local beverage value alongside the McPick 2 platform alongside the fundamentals of running better restaurants. So there are these pockets of great success that we're looking to lift and localize and then launch rapidly. So -- but the other piece that I've always come back to, and I won't hesitate coming back to, is probably the most important element of what has established momentum in the U.S. is the operational improvements around running better restaurants. And that is something that is so, so fundamental, and it may not be a headline grabber. But if you think about the 27 million, 28 million customers that come in every single day, if we can offer a more consistent, friendlier, more convenient service to them, that is where our greatest reward is. And the customer satisfaction scores are going significantly in the right direction. And again, we have a number of ways that we're looking to improve the operational experience, including using technology to make it more easy and more convenient for customers. So we have multiple future growth drivers. And internationally, again, we're scanning the horizon, clearly. I mean, you've seen the success of -- the very, very consistent sort of success across the International Lead Markets. And there are certain common success stories across those. Most notably, how they are embracing what we're calling, describing the Experience of the Future, which is how you use modern facilities that is a totally redefined front-of-house hospitality experience; use of technology with self-order kiosks, for example; integrating that with mobile apps and, again, offering a degree -- an appropriate degree of customization for customers so they can really exert their choice and enjoy variety across our menus. So again, you can expect us to incorporate on those successes into the U.S. business as we move forward."

As you know, it's a market share fight out there. It really is a scramble. The -- there is certainly a softening top line across the sector with consumer confidence. We -- I think all of us in the sector would prefer some tailwinds. If you look -- there aren't many tailwinds at the moment, there's not great economic growth to help provide a lift. Consumer confidence is muted. We're at a rather unusual stage of the election cycle. So none of that's really providing a tailwind for us. That said, there's a significant market out there, and we're going to keep battling for market share. That said, seeing the softening of the gap was not a great surprise to us, because it was a particular -- this time last year and heading into the fourth quarter was comparative really strong performance for us. So the reality is the trends we're seeing are no surprise to us and certainly aren't shaking us from our longer-term objectives. From a leadership perspective, I'd love to talk about it. I'm excited about where we're at. We're heading into 2017 now with a -- really a world-class team that one would expect from a world-class business. We have made changes. And as you go through the various phases of a turnaround into growth, there are times when the skill sets required, as we transition, also need to change. So it's a delicate balance between leveraging the experience, the knowledge, the tenure, the understanding of the system with our more tenured leaders, also bringing in innovative thinking. But I could just draw some examples to this. I mean, there's -- giving Chris Kempczinski the opportunity to lead the U.S. business, I'm really excited about. Because the reality is whilst he has somewhat limited McDonald's experience, he brings some phenomenal external leadership experience from global brands, consumer brands, which will be valuable to us. But also, let's not forget that if he was to take the 5 or 6 key direct reports that he has reportance of, there's more than 120 years of McDonald's U.S. experience amongst them. So I think we've got the McDonald's experience piece covered, and with his fresh thinking, I'm sure that's going to be a very, very potent combination. If you look at the role that we've created with Doug Goare now. I mean, Doug's been around for the best part of 40 years, and there are very few roles in this business that Doug hasn't filled yet. He's had functional leadership in supply chain, functional leadership of franchising, of real estate, as well as field leadership both here in the U.S., previously ran Europe, and now he's proven to be a great leader of our International Lead Markets. Leveraging Doug's experience to help blend in with a new experience like Chris. We're all one team, and that's a good balance. Joe Erlinger taking the High Growth. I mean, Joe started off in the U.S. business 15 years ago. He became a regional manager, very successfully here in the U.S., transitioned to become a market leader, a Managing Director of the Korean market; has financial experience and became the CFO in the newly formed High Growth market. And he's perfectly placed to step in and add his energy and insight into a leadership position. And then if you were to talk about -- for Chris' transition, we'd already prepared for that. We'd already had Lucy Brady come and join our business. She's a Senior Vice President at BCG, 20 years' experience in helping global businesses develop growth strategies. So ideally placed to seamlessly fit to that. So it's an important balance. It's something that I enjoyed leading when I was in the U.K., when we were transitioning from probably a McDonald's only management team to one that I felt had the right combination. And getting that balance right now is critical, and I'm really excited to be into next year with a team that's sharp and ready to go."

I mean, really, it's a fascinating time to be running an international business. It really is. Because if you speak to the team in France, for example, who have led so much of our strategic thinking and the innovation across our bus",605,"Yes, sure, absolutely. I mean, really, it's a fascinating time to be running an international business. It really is. Because if you speak to the team in France, for example, who have led so much of our strategic thinking and the innovation across our business, they're now facing, really, not just unforeseen, but previously not experienced challenges. And given not just their macroeconomic environment, we know that GDP is down in France, but there's different dynamics. And given some of the situation and the security terror situation they face there, it really is creating some very significant dynamic changes in that market. Tourism, which has always been a substantial part of -- that's fueled the economy in France, has really softened. And we're seeing -- you see it in the hotel bookings, and you can see it impacted in, certainly, the more tourist areas, whether it's the Southern France or Paris, within our business, where we do have a heavy concentration of restaurants. We also see it affect the way that consumers live their lives, French consumers. So there's a slight reticence to go into high-density tourist areas because they're slightly concerned at the moment. Now I think some of those things are temporary, and some of the things may be slightly more permanent. But it certainly means our management teams in France happen to be much more agile and responsive to act in accordance with consumer sentiment. When you go to a market like Spain, where they have probably suffered more through the economic crisis than any other market that we do business in, youth unemployment up at 25%, for example. So we have just gently slowed down the new-store opening there in order to focus our efforts and our investment on the existing store portfolio, and I'm delighted with the progress that market's made, as it's built its momentum, it's returning to growth through the second half of this year, and the outlook looks very confident. U.K. is a -- probably a well- and often-spoken story. I think it's 42 consecutive quarters of growth now, and that momentum really does look very solid and well baked in. So I won't say too much more about that. But then you can go internationally across to Asia. Now China is a challenging market. And the manner in which the team are adapting to the variations that they have to experience, both, again, in consumer sentiment and the broader economy, is admirable. And as they are seeing -- just as one example, they now have a substantial part of that business is the delivery business. And not just -- originally, we set up and established our own McDonald's delivery service, and that proved to be very successful, but now integrating it into third-party delivery providers. And that has way further accelerated the -- our momentum of business and customer satisfaction, as more people are getting used to ordering and eating at home. So we're seeing different trends around the world. And the one thing that is particularly beneficial to us now is as we remove some of the layers in our business, the visibility we have into what's going on and how we can transfer that knowledge and use it to our advantage in other markets, and part of the advantage here of having Chris in his position now, he spent his first year traveling around the world, both with myself and other senior leaders and on his own, visiting these markets, seeing what's going on, understanding the big levers of our business. And he's now perfectly placed to help take that into the U.S. business."

I'd say you can see out there, there's still some promotional offerings, certainly, around the industry. I think all of us, certainly including us, would like to see kind of just a stable platform where you can -- that's why we put McPick 2 in. The idea is to have an ongoing value platform that customers can count on and not have to come up with some discounted promotion, if you will, every now and then. On the pricing side, to your point, right now, we're a little bit ahead of food-away-from-home, and we certainly experienced very favorable margins here in the U.S. in the third quarter. Some of that is the timing of when we take pricing. So if you look at last year, we actually took some pricing in October, whereas this year, we took it in September. So that when you look at a year-over-year basis, you have a little timing shift. There's about 70 to 75 basis points of pricing that will be in last year's fourth quarter that we may not replace some or all of that in the fourth quarter this year, which would bring some of our pricing down and maybe more in line with food-away-from-home. But we still do keep an eye on both food-away-from-home and food at home, which, you mentioned, the food at home is extremely low right now. Thanks."

Thanks, John. I see it starting to make a contribution in '17. I mean, the reality is we would see this as something like a 3-year program, which is exactly what we're seeing through the markets like U.K., Canada, Australia. These are rolling programs and actually give us growth upon growth upon growth as it -- for the U.K., for example, they're already almost 40% converted to the entire Experience of the Future, which is introducing that technology along with the hospitality as well as the food elements. And therefore, their visibility on year-on-year growth over the next 2 to 3 years looks pretty strong. In the U.S., we're certainly earlier in that cycle. In terms of modernized restaurants, just over 50% of the U.S. estate is modernized. We've got some work to do to complete that. And then, of course, within that, we want to layer on top the other elements -- or the far broader elements and consumer-facing elements of the Experience of the Future, integrating the app into the self-order kiosks, offering different ways that customers can be served, they can place their orders, they can customize their foods. So we expect to start seeing that ramped up through '17. And literally, the minute you convert a restaurant, we see a sales lift. So yes, it will be a contributor. But we'd probably be getting that full run rate for '18 and '19 as well, which I think it is a very strong program. One of the things we have benefited from is we've learned a lot of what works but also 1 or 2 things that don't work in the markets that they nearly adopted in Australia and Canada, for example. So we can bring that best practice into the U.S., make sure it's locally relevant, and then go hard at it. So we're really excited. The barrier to it is really -- is just a collective will to invest. I mean, there is an investment element to it, both on our own and an operator level, for the company. And certainly, from a company perspective, we're allocating our capital to provide significant support alongside the operators to co-invest with them. And we're really happy at the moment that the U.S. cash flows are all-time high. That means their ability to invest can never have been greater. So I think we're in a good place."

The follow-up is it's starting -- you're talking about rolling off. To the extent that you know kind of what elasticity looks like in your business, is there any sense that maybe by allowing it to roll off, your traffic could accelerate in the sense that traffic has been negative, and maybe the higher prices is a contributor to that so that we could see that comp composition change a little based on what you know about your customers? And then my second point is -- second question is about the unit growth taking it down. Is that because you're intentionally steering more capital to existing units or remodels?

What we try and balance is, certainly, restaurant profitability with continuing to grow guest counts. And so we've talked about our main focus being growing guest count, certainly in the U.S., and again, as I mentioned, the pricing is a little bit of a timing issue. So it wouldn't be a surprise to see that come down a little bit, which could help then accelerate some of the guest count growth. Regarding unit growth, we brought it down by around 100. I think we had about 1,000 last quarter. Now we said about 900. It's a little bit in various markets, a few in China, a few in Spain. Nothing of significance, I would say. The reallocation is really to some of these investment areas that Steve was just talking about, certainly, in places like Australia and the U.K. where we're implementing Experience of the Future, seeing good sales lifts from those investments. We continue to reinvest in those types of investments. So you saw the capital didn't come down. It was really a reallocation of a little bit of the new-store openings to some of that reinvestment to continue to grow sales."

With regards to Experience of the Future, I mean, one of the great learns we've had, and particularly with launching so aggressively in Australia over 1.5 year ago, which the main food element was something we described as Create Your Taste, and that was an in-store-only premium food offering. Now it worked great, but we wanted to find a way that we could take that to our entire customer base. So with the Aussie team, we've worked on solutions now, what we can now bring. So we believe there will be food elements, customizing premium quality food that we can deliver through both the drive-thru and in-store. And I think that's one of the benefits we have of getting those early-adopter markets, going aggressive, learn, bring it back over and localize it and launch it. And so we believe we have a good solution for that."

Our organization structure, our layers, the way we design structures, et cetera. And for now, what we've agreed to is that we're going and reducing our G&A by just $500 million net. That still allows us to continue investing where we believe we need to, to continue to grow the business. So we're very conscious of making sure that we've got the right investment levels to be able to strategically still invest in the business. Might there be some opportunity beyond the $500 million? I guess, I'd say it does -- we're not going to stop looking or stop having the discipline in the organization to continue managing the business appropriately. But there's been a lot of change in the organization in the near term. And our belief is that for us, right now, this is the right level for us to focus on in the near term. I wouldn't say that, that means we stop and then never kind of manage the business effectively going forward. But for us, right now, the commitment is to the $500 million. Regarding capital, right now, as you know, we're right around $2 billion. What you may see in the near term is as we convert some of these countries to developmental licensees where we free up some of that capital, some of that may be redeployed to the U.S. to spend on this Experience of the Future investment that Steve was talking about. So you could see some reallocation of that capital in the next few years that would effectively keep our capital envelope relatively similar to what it is today. And then once that's complete, it's likely to go down after that. But in the near term, we may reallocate some of the capital that we've freed up to spending to accelerate that U.S. Experience of the Future investment."

I'm encouraged by the actions we've taken and the progress we've made as we execute our turnaround plan.

I'm encouraged by the actions we've taken and the progress we've made as we execute our turnaround plan. Customer perceptions at McDonald's have steadily improved over the past 18 months, and the third quarter marks 5 consecutive quarters of comparable sales growth across all business segments with many markets gaining share. 
For the third quarter, global comparable sales increased 3.5% and operating income was up 7% in constant currencies. Earnings per share rose 9% in constant currencies. Excluding the impact of previously announced current and prior year strategic charges, earnings per share for the quarter increased 17% in constant currencies. 
Profitability has increased both for McDonald's and franchisees. At the restaurant level, franchisee cash flows reached all-time highs in many markets, including the U.S. These results are a testament to our diligent execution of the turnaround plan as we put customers at the center of everything we do. We are at a point where we've begun to transition from a focus on revitalization to a mindset that's concentrated on strengthening the business to drive sustainable growth over the long term. 
We expected performance through 2016 to be uneven, and it has been. Markets such as the U.K., Australia and Canada continue to grow sales and guest counts, whilst market including the U.S., France and Germany work to overcome challenges of varying degrees.
We are mindful of the near-term headwinds we face, most notably in the U.S., as we lap the very successful introduction of All Day Breakfast, which was immediately popular to customers. However, we're not managing the business quarter-by-quarter. In fact, our commitment to investing in the business is stronger now than ever. We're taking action in the areas that matter most to customers. 
In particular, we're placing significant emphasis on food quality, the customer experience and value to give people more reasons to visit McDonald's. We believe the long-term investments we are making in these areas provide the foundation on which we'll build as we work to be recognized as a modern, progressive burger company by customers.
In the area of food, we are taking important steps in how our food is prepared and the ingredients we use. In the U.S., we completed our transition to chicken not treated by antibiotics important to human medicine a year ahead of schedule. We introduced new buns that do not contain high-fructose corn syrup, and we removed artificial preservatives from our popular Chicken McNuggets, and customers have responded favorably to this news and we've seen sales accelerate as a result.
Following the announcement, sales of McNuggets increased nearly 10%, and they are sustaining above previous levels. 
We're also modernizing the customer experience in markets around the world as we evolve to the Experience of the Future. 
In Canada, we are engaging with customers in simpler, less stressful ways by offering them more choices on how they order and pay. We now have dual-point service and self-order kiosks in almost 90% of our traditional restaurants. In addition, we're taking steps to redefine hospitality on both sides of the counter with dedicated guest experience leaders in all of Canada's traditional restaurants. 
Finally, value, a critical priority in all markets. In Germany, for example, we've deployed a 2-pronged approach. First, we successfully added new layers to our value platform at mid-tier price points. At the same time, we're celebrating the quality and taste of our core products through strong marketing and promotional campaigns. These steps build on the new pricing structure we introduced earlier this year to strengthen our value platform, and that's resonating well with the price-conscious German consumer.
The actions we are taking specific to our food, the customer experience and the value, and telling customers about the changes, are making a difference. Customer satisfaction has improved significantly, up more than 6% year-to-date in both the U.S. and Canada, with most major markets seeing improvements. This is a testament to the progress we've made since we refocused on running better restaurants as part of our turnaround plan in May of last year.
With that context, let's turn to performance highlights in the markets. Beginning with the U.S., comparable sales remained positive for the third quarter, up 1.3%. Customers love All Day Breakfast and the way we've continued to build on its success. Since its introduction last year, customers asked for even more choices, so we recently launched the second phase of All Day Breakfast. The expanded menu now includes muffins and biscuits as well as our beloved McGriddles all day in all U.S. restaurants.
At the same time, we're enhancing the experience to adapt alongside customers' expectations. One of the most notable ways we're doing this in restaurants is by better integrating technology in visible, tangible ways. For example, more than 90% of U.S. restaurants now use digital menu boards. These new menu boards enable us to showcase the quality of our food with fresh photography. Because they're less congested and better organized, the menus now do a better job highlighting the broad range of choices available. The menu boards are also smart. They're built with a robust content management system that we haven't even begun tapping into yet. When fully enabled, we'll be able to adjust what's featured on the menu based on time of day or even weather conditions. We'll be more relevant to customers as we remind them about our ice cream cones and McFlurries on a hot summer day or handcrafted hot McCaf√© beverages if it's chilly outside and they feel the need to warm up.
We also continue to emphasize value, because we know how much budget-oriented customers count on McDonald's. Franchisees and customers alike have embraced the McPick 2 platform. They appreciate the choice and flexibility it provides. In September, we promoted McPick 2 for $5 nationally, whilst other variations of McPick 2 were offered on a local level. Some of our best-performing regions offered beverage value to complement the McPick 2 platform. We'll continue to tap into these learnings, both nationally and locally, as we design future McPick offers.
Underpinning these efforts is a continued focus on running better restaurants. Our commitment to raising the bar with an emphasis on underperforming restaurants is making a difference. Customer satisfaction scores have improved the most for our bottom-quintile restaurants, and we've cut the customer satisfaction score gap between the top and bottom quintile performance nearly in half through our efforts to provide a better, more consistent experience for customers in every restaurant every time they visit.
Turning to the International Lead Market segment. Third quarter comparable sales were up 3.3%, driven by positive performance across 4 of the 5 major markets, with France being the exception. The U.K., Australia and Canada delivered yet another quarter of comparable sales and guest count growth. These markets share similar elements that underlie their strong track records of success: contemporary restaurant designs with over 90% of restaurants reimaged; compelling menu strategies tailored to local customer tastes, such as the Spice It Up event in Canada featuring spicy Sriracha sauce on a country chicken or Angus beef sandwich; and a modern service experience that incorporates the elements of Experience of the Future to provide customers with more choice and flexibility on how they order, what they order and how they are served. These elements amplify each other to create a notable difference for customers who then reward us by visiting more often.
I'm encouraged by the progress we've made in Germany, which I had a chance to experience firsthand when I visited the team there last quarter. Comparable sales were positive in the market for the third quarter. 
Earlier, I mentioned the steps we've taken to strengthen our value platform. Combined with strong promotions featuring customer favorites like the hamburger Royal with Cheese, these actions are making a difference and getting us back on track to grow top line results once again.
That said, I want to stress the growing -- that growing guest counts remains a top priority. That's the key to winning back the share we've lost in recent years. 
In France, third quarter comparable sales were negative. This was driven in large part by ongoing macroeconomic challenges, including a declining GDP, high unemployment and the continuing concerns for personal safety, which is impacting both inbound tourism as well as the French consumer. 
The customers appreciate the actions we've taken to strengthen our value offer, including further extensions of the well-regarded and successful P'tit Plaisir value platform. We're also satisfying French consumers' growing appetite for premium burgers through strong promotional campaigns featuring customer favorites like the 280 Burger and the Big Tasty. In addition, we're introducing a new signature line of sandwiches in our Experience of the Future restaurants to give customers even more great-tasting burger choices at the convenience and value they've come to appreciate at McDonald's.
In the High Growth segment, third quarter comparable sales were up 1.5%, driven by positive performance in Russia and most other markets, partially offset by negative comparable sales in China. Whilst third quarter comparable sales in China were down 1.8%, results improved as the quarter progressed. Excluding the impact of temporary protests surrounding recent events related to the South China Sea, China's comparable sales would have been positive for the quarter.
A strong focus on enhancing convenience through greater integration with third-party delivery providers combined with aggressive core menu sampling events designed to offset the impact of the protests contributed to market share gains amidst the still challenging macroeconomic environment. 
In Russia, the economy remains difficult and consumer purchasing power continues to decline. Despite these challenges, we are growing comparable sales and guest count and gaining market share.
Specifically, our performance is a result of a heightened focus on value as well as the successful marketing campaigns to grow the Breakfast Day part. And I'd be remiss if I didn't mention Japan, where comparable sales increased 17.7% in the third quarter. Diligent execution of the market's comprehensive turnaround plans, which include strong promotions, exciting menu variety, compelling value and a more modern restaurant experience, is enhancing McDonald's' relevance to customers and contributing to sustained momentum in this market.
As we look to the future, we recognize the importance of having the right structure, the right people, a common focus and, lastly, greater accountability across the entire McDonald's System. We've taken steps forward in all 4 areas to set a proper foundation for long-term growth. 
First, the right structure. Building on last year's shift to segments of similar markets, we took further steps in the third quarter to transition to a leaner, more efficient and more nimble organization. This will enable us to effectively share expertise, improve efficiencies and drive down costs, taking greater advantage of our size and scale. Kevin will provide further details in a moment. 
Second, the right talent. An important component of our turnaround plan has always been to ensure we have the right people in the most critical positions. Management changes have been and continue to be an anticipated part of the process. That's why we're focused on a blend of promoting individuals who are ready to take on additional responsibilities, continuing to develop leaders that have the right skills necessary to grow the business and attracting new executives into the business to provide fresh energy and innovative thinking.
I'm confident in the recent selections we have made. This includes Chris Kempczinski succeeding Mike Andres as President of McDonald's U.S.A. effective the 1st of January. As part of a focal transition, Chris is already spending significant time with Mike and our franchisees in the field. 
In the High Growth segment, Joe Erlinger has made an immediate impact upon stepping into the role of President in these markets. He knows these markets well, having been CFO of the segment and the former Managing Director of Korea.
Third, a common focus. In addition to making forward progress on running great restaurants, we are putting greater emphasis on accelerating initiatives that will bring more customers into our restaurants more often. This includes the Experience of the Future, which we're looking to roll out at greater speed in the U.S., and we look forward to sharing more details of those plans as they're finalized.
And lastly, accountability. We've made great progress executing our turnaround plan. Now we're starting to balance those efforts with a greater focus on longer-term growth. It will take all of our franchisees, employees and suppliers working together and holding each other accountable to achieve our ultimate goal of becoming the modern progressive burger company.
We have a long-term view on our potential and the opportunities that exist. I'm confident in the actions we are taking to run better restaurants and the investments we are making. We're getting the right people, foundations and platforms in place to properly grow the business and reassert McDonald's' global brand leadership.
Thanks very much, and now I'll turn it over to Kevin."

Since Ste",1569,"Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. We're pleased with our third quarter results. By staying keenly focused on our customers, we maintained positive momentum while continuing to make meaningful strides toward building a better McDonald's. Since Steve talked about sales and earnings per share, I'll focus on margins and G&A. I'll also provide an update on the key outlook items and the recent progress we've made against our financial targets. 
Starting with the performance drivers for the quarter. Franchise revenues continue to become an increasingly significant portion of our revenue stream as we evolve to a more heavily franchised organization. For third quarter, franchise revenues increased 6% in constant currencies, reflecting strong comparable sales and the impact of refranchising. For the quarter, franchise margin dollars exceeded $2 billion, a 6% increase in constant currencies, and contributed over $100 million to our growth in global operating income. This solid performance reflects sales driven improvements across all segments, led by results in the International Lead Markets. In addition, we maintained strong global franchise margins of over 82%. These results are a testament to the benefits of transitioning toward a more predictable and stable revenue stream.
Growth in company-operated margins also contributed about $75 million to our growth in global operating income, as company-operated margins rose to more than $730 million, an 11% increase in constant currencies. Company-operated margins climbed 260 basis points, with the U.S. and China leading the overall improvement. Our emphasis on running better restaurants, from enhanced conveniences to tighter operating controls, is yielding a better experience for our customers as well as improved restaurant profitability.
In the U.S., the company-operated margin percent increased 450 basis points for the quarter, reflecting positive comparable sales and a favorable commodity environment. These results also reflect the benefit from our refranchising as we optimize our company-operated restaurant portfolio and the ongoing contribution it makes to our bottom line.
Moving on to G&A. At the end of last year, we noted that we expected to realize about $150 million in savings during 2015 and 2016, with about half of the savings to be achieved in each year. For third quarter, our G&A expenses increased 1% in constant currencies due to higher incentive-based compensation as a result of our year-to-date performance. For the full year, we now expect G&A to be relatively flat in constant currencies. However, excluding incentive-based compensation, G&A for the year is expected to be down about 3% in constant currencies, which equates to roughly $75 million in savings due to lower employee-related costs resulting from our restructuring initiatives. This will bring our total G&A savings at the end of 2016 to at least $150 million. 
Let me switch gears now for an update on menu pricing and commodity costs. In the U.S., commodity costs declined by more than 6% during the third quarter. Given the strength of our third quarter savings, combined with our outlook for fourth quarter, we now expect the segment's full year basket of goods to be down 4.5% to 5%. Commodity costs for the International Lead segment were down about 1% for the third quarter and are expected to remain relatively flat for the remainder of this year. 
While we continue to benefit from favorable commodity costs around the world, we continue to experience rising labor costs in many of our markets. These pressures are considered as we make pricing decisions over the course of the year. Our objective is to manage pricing in a way that maintains our strong value proposition, contributes to guest traffic growth and supports restaurant profitability. In the U.S., third quarter pricing year-over-year was up about 3.5% compared with food-away-from-home inflation of about 2.5%.
For U.S. company-operated restaurant pricing, our goal is to approximate food-away-from-home inflation over time, so we may be a little higher or lower in any given quarter. We are also mindful that the current 450-basis-point gap between the cost of eating at home versus dining out is the largest spread in more than 30 years and may be impacting consumer behavior. We continue to track these metrics and expect our overall menu price increase at year-end to be more in line with food-away-from-home inflation. For the International Lead segment, while price increases vary by market, year-over-year increases for these markets averaged about 2%.
Next, I'd like to provide an update on our foreign currency outlook. Based on current exchange rates, we project foreign currency translation to negatively impact our earnings per share by $0.01 to $0.02 in the fourth quarter, which will bring the full year impact to $0.09 to $0.10. As always, please take our currency guidance as directional only because rates will change as we move throughout the year.
Last quarter, I committed to providing more detail on today's call regarding the role that our organizational restructuring is playing in reaching our previously announced G&A savings target. For the last several months, we have been working with outside advisers to thoroughly analyze our G&A spending and organizational structure, from our corporate functions to the individual markets and the critical role they play in the field.
Our overall goal was to focus our resources in talent and customer-facing activities that drive business growth while creating a more globalized system that more effectively leverages our size and scale to spread learnings better and drive cost improvements and efficiencies.
As we move toward becoming a leaner and more agile organization, we're positioned to make quicker and better decisions and to execute on our strategic intent to create a better customer experience. The pace at which All Day Breakfast moved from the U.S. to Australia is a great example of how we're accelerating knowledge transfer across the system to benefit customers globally. I'm confident that our redesigned organization is now better equipped to adapt to today's rapidly changing environment.
As a result of our reorganization, we incurred roughly $80 million in restructuring charges for the third quarter. While this component of our restructuring is nearing completion, we do expect to incur some additional but less significant charges in the fourth quarter. We remain on track to achieve our net annual G&A savings target of $500 million by 2018, with the vast majority of the savings expected to be realized by the end of next year.
We also continue to make changes to the business through our global refranchising efforts. Since the beginning of 2015, we refranchised nearly 1,000 restaurants, including 140 in the third quarter. The large majority of restaurants refranchised to date have been sold to existing conventional franchisees. As previously indicated, we're also actively pursuing a transaction in China, where we are currently in the process of vetting a select number of qualified bidders. 
In addition, we have made meaningful progress in our search for long-term strategic partners in Malaysia and Singapore. These markets collectively operate almost 400 restaurants, more than 80% of which are company-owned. We are in the final stages of the process and expect to complete these transactions by the end of this year. Given where the transactions stand, we recorded a noncash charge of approximately $40 million in the quarter to account for historical currency losses.
As we moved into the month of October, we also completed the sale of 75 company-operated restaurants in the Ural region of Russia to an existing developmental licensee. The results of this transaction will be reflected in fourth quarter. So we remain on track to refranchise about 4,000 restaurants by the end of 2018, and we'll continue to keep you appraised of our progress.
Last November, we increased our 3-year cash return to shareholders target to $30 billion by the end of 2016. During the quarter, we returned $3.4 billion to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends. Share repurchases for the quarter totaled $2.7 billion, the vast majority of which was completed under our second accelerated share repurchase program of the year. 
Further, in September, our Board of Directors approved a 6% dividend increase effective in the fourth quarter, the equivalent of $3.76 annually. This increase marked the company's 40th consecutive year of delivering a dividend increase for our shareholders.
As a result of these activities, the cumulative cash return under our 3-year target stands at nearly $28 billion, and we are on track to complete the remaining amount by the end of this year. 
To summarize, over the course of the last year, we've demonstrated our commitment to meeting our financial targets. By the end of 2016, we will have met our $30 billion cash return to shareholders target, achieved nearly 1/3 of our G&A savings target and completed more than 1/3 of our restaurant refranchising, with some significant transactions on track for completion in 2017.
We continue to measure our progress and hold ourselves accountable in each phase of the turnaround to ensure that we're appropriately allocating our resources to strategic operating plans that will grow our business. 
As we move into the final quarter of 2016, we are mindful of the hurdles we face in the near term, but we're keeping our line of sight clearly focused on the long term. Through our actions, we're unlocking financial value and using it to fuel the innovation and investments that will create a better customer experience and deliver sustained profitable growth for the long term for our system and our shareholders.

So first of all, on the All Day Breakfast and the McPick 2, so that was the -- they are 2 of the foundational elements of what's helped maintain and -- establish and then maintain momentum of the business. So as you know,",753,"David. Steve. I'll take this one. So first of all, on the All Day Breakfast and the McPick 2, so that was the -- they are 2 of the foundational elements of what's helped maintain and -- establish and then maintain momentum of the business. So as you know, we launched All Day Breakfast around this time last year. It's served us well. It -- as you know, the initial peak was higher than we expected, and it settled down to a level that we're happy with. In the meantime, we worked on how can we extend that platform, both operationally and making sure the consumer had -- demand was there. And we extended it just a couple of weeks ago as well, 3 or 4 weeks ago. So that is here to stay. It's doing well for us, and is a foundational element of our business momentum. McPick 2, like -- similarly, it really is well embraced by both our operators and by our customers. So as you know, we've tried both McPick 2 for $5, which is typically the platform we use at a national level. And we'll be bringing that back, I don't know, 3, 4 times a year and they're hitting at a national level and still using the flexibility of that platform to rotate different items through that menu. But what you don't see perhaps so visibly is -- across the regions is how McPick 2 is always on. And typically, the regions will use a greater value element, like a McPick 2 for $2.50, McPick 2 for $2, McPick 2 for $3. And again, depending on seasonality and the customer preference, we'll rotate several products through there. So both those platforms are good contributors to us and are important part of our business going forward. In terms of what we've got to be excited about going forward, there's plenty. And part of what we're enjoying about the new structure in this business is the greater visibility we have to what works around the world and what's creating some of that success internationally for us, but also the way that they've simplified the structure in the U.S. What's worked in a regional level? So there's a lot of product innovation, local product innovation at a regional level that we're looking to learn from and lift where appropriate. There's some -- earlier this quarter, I spent some time in Phoenix and Scottsdale in Arizona, then went up to Portland in Oregon. And one common success [ph] back in both those regions -- both of them are the strongest sales regions we have in the U.S. currently. And what was also particularly successful there was they were complementing local beverage value alongside the McPick 2 platform alongside the fundamentals of running better restaurants. So there are these pockets of great success that we're looking to lift and localize and then launch rapidly. So -- but the other piece that I've always come back to, and I won't hesitate coming back to, is probably the most important element of what has established momentum in the U.S. is the operational improvements around running better restaurants. And that is something that is so, so fundamental, and it may not be a headline grabber. But if you think about the 27 million, 28 million customers that come in every single day, if we can offer a more consistent, friendlier, more convenient service to them, that is where our greatest reward is. And the customer satisfaction scores are going significantly in the right direction. And again, we have a number of ways that we're looking to improve the operational experience, including using technology to make it more easy and more convenient for customers. So we have multiple future growth drivers. And internationally, again, we're scanning the horizon, clearly. I mean, you've seen the success of -- the very, very consistent sort of success across the International Lead Markets. And there are certain common success stories across those. Most notably, how they are embracing what we're calling, describing the Experience of the Future, which is how you use modern facilities that is a totally redefined front-of-house hospitality experience; use of technology with self-order kiosks, for example; integrating that with mobile apps and, again, offering a degree -- an appropriate degree of customization for customers so they can really exert their choice and enjoy variety across our menus. So again, you can expect us to incorporate on those successes into the U.S. business as we move forward."

The -- there is certainly a softening top line across",693,"Yes, sure. First of all, on the gap, competitive gap, we had a positive gap for the quarter. It was -- positive gap was 0.6%. As you know, it's a market share fight out there. It really is a scramble. The -- there is certainly a softening top line across the sector with consumer confidence. We -- I think all of us in the sector would prefer some tailwinds. If you look -- there aren't many tailwinds at the moment, there's not great economic growth to help provide a lift. Consumer confidence is muted. We're at a rather unusual stage of the election cycle. So none of that's really providing a tailwind for us. That said, there's a significant market out there, and we're going to keep battling for market share. That said, seeing the softening of the gap was not a great surprise to us, because it was a particular -- this time last year and heading into the fourth quarter was comparative really strong performance for us. So the reality is the trends we're seeing are no surprise to us and certainly aren't shaking us from our longer-term objectives. From a leadership perspective, I'd love to talk about it. I'm excited about where we're at. We're heading into 2017 now with a -- really a world-class team that one would expect from a world-class business. We have made changes. And as you go through the various phases of a turnaround into growth, there are times when the skill sets required, as we transition, also need to change. So it's a delicate balance between leveraging the experience, the knowledge, the tenure, the understanding of the system with our more tenured leaders, also bringing in innovative thinking. But I could just draw some examples to this. I mean, there's -- giving Chris Kempczinski the opportunity to lead the U.S. business, I'm really excited about. Because the reality is whilst he has somewhat limited McDonald's experience, he brings some phenomenal external leadership experience from global brands, consumer brands, which will be valuable to us. But also, let's not forget that if he was to take the 5 or 6 key direct reports that he has reportance of, there's more than 120 years of McDonald's U.S. experience amongst them. So I think we've got the McDonald's experience piece covered, and with his fresh thinking, I'm sure that's going to be a very, very potent combination. If you look at the role that we've created with Doug Goare now. I mean, Doug's been around for the best part of 40 years, and there are very few roles in this business that Doug hasn't filled yet. He's had functional leadership in supply chain, functional leadership of franchising, of real estate, as well as field leadership both here in the U.S., previously ran Europe, and now he's proven to be a great leader of our International Lead Markets. Leveraging Doug's experience to help blend in with a new experience like Chris. We're all one team, and that's a good balance. Joe Erlinger taking the High Growth. I mean, Joe started off in the U.S. business 15 years ago. He became a regional manager, very successfully here in the U.S., transitioned to become a market leader, a Managing Director of the Korean market; has financial experience and became the CFO in the newly formed High Growth market. And he's perfectly placed to step in and add his energy and insight into a leadership position. And then if you were to talk about -- for Chris' transition, we'd already prepared for that. We'd already had Lucy Brady come and join our business. She's a Senior Vice President at BCG, 20 years' experience in helping global businesses develop growth strategies. So ideally placed to seamlessly fit to that. So it's an important balance. It's something that I enjoyed leading when I was in the U.K., when we were transitioning from probably a McDonald's only management team to one that I felt had the right combination. And getting that balance right now is critical, and I'm really excited to be into next year with a team that's sharp and ready to go."

I mean, really, it's a fascinating time to be running an international business. It really is. Because if you speak to the team in France, for example, who have led so much of our strategic thinking and the innovation across our bus",605,"Yes, sure, absolutely. I mean, really, it's a fascinating time to be running an international business. It really is. Because if you speak to the team in France, for example, who have led so much of our strategic thinking and the innovation across our business, they're now facing, really, not just unforeseen, but previously not experienced challenges. And given not just their macroeconomic environment, we know that GDP is down in France, but there's different dynamics. And given some of the situation and the security terror situation they face there, it really is creating some very significant dynamic changes in that market. Tourism, which has always been a substantial part of -- that's fueled the economy in France, has really softened. And we're seeing -- you see it in the hotel bookings, and you can see it impacted in, certainly, the more tourist areas, whether it's the Southern France or Paris, within our business, where we do have a heavy concentration of restaurants. We also see it affect the way that consumers live their lives, French consumers. So there's a slight reticence to go into high-density tourist areas because they're slightly concerned at the moment. Now I think some of those things are temporary, and some of the things may be slightly more permanent. But it certainly means our management teams in France happen to be much more agile and responsive to act in accordance with consumer sentiment. When you go to a market like Spain, where they have probably suffered more through the economic crisis than any other market that we do business in, youth unemployment up at 25%, for example. So we have just gently slowed down the new-store opening there in order to focus our efforts and our investment on the existing store portfolio, and I'm delighted with the progress that market's made, as it's built its momentum, it's returning to growth through the second half of this year, and the outlook looks very confident. U.K. is a -- probably a well- and often-spoken story. I think it's 42 consecutive quarters of growth now, and that momentum really does look very solid and well baked in. So I won't say too much more about that. But then you can go internationally across to Asia. Now China is a challenging market. And the manner in which the team are adapting to the variations that they have to experience, both, again, in consumer sentiment and the broader economy, is admirable. And as they are seeing -- just as one example, they now have a substantial part of that business is the delivery business. And not just -- originally, we set up and established our own McDonald's delivery service, and that proved to be very successful, but now integrating it into third-party delivery providers. And that has way further accelerated the -- our momentum of business and customer satisfaction, as more people are getting used to ordering and eating at home. So we're seeing different trends around the world. And the one thing that is particularly beneficial to us now is as we remove some of the layers in our business, the visibility we have into what's going on and how we can transfer that knowledge and use it to our advantage in other markets, and part of the advantage here of having Chris in his position now, he spent his first year traveling around the world, both with myself and other senior leaders and on his own, visiting these markets, seeing what's going on, understanding the big levers of our business. And he's now perfectly placed to help take that into the U.S. business."

I'd say you can see out there, there's still some promotional offerings, certainly, around the industry. I think all of us, certainly including us, would like to see kind of just a stable platform where you can -- that's why we put McPick 2 in. The idea is to have an ongoing value platform that customers can count on and not have to come up with some discounted promotion, if you will, every now and then. On the pricing side, to your point, right now, we're a little bit ahead of food-away-from-home, and we certainly experienced very favorable margins here in the U.S. in the third quarter. Some of that is the timing of when we take pricing. So if you look at last year, we actually took some pricing in October, whereas this year, we took it in September. So that when you look at a year-over-year basis, you have a little timing shift. There's about 70 to 75 basis points of pricing that will be in last year's fourth quarter that we may not replace some or all of that in the fourth quarter this year, which would bring some of our pricing down and maybe more in line with food-away-from-home. But we still do keep an eye on both food-away-from-home and food at home, which, you mentioned, the food at home is extremely low right now. Thanks."

Thanks, John. I see it starting to make a contribution in '17. I mean, the reality is we would see this as something like a 3-year program, which is exactly what we're seeing through the markets like U.K., Canada, Australia. These are rolling programs and actually give us growth upon growth upon growth as it -- for the U.K., for example, they're already almost 40% converted to the entire Experience of the Future, which is introducing that technology along with the hospitality as well as the food elements. And therefore, their visibility on year-on-year growth over the next 2 to 3 years looks pretty strong. In the U.S., we're certainly earlier in that cycle. In terms of modernized restaurants, just over 50% of the U.S. estate is modernized. We've got some work to do to complete that. And then, of course, within that, we want to layer on top the other elements -- or the far broader elements and consumer-facing elements of the Experience of the Future, integrating the app into the self-order kiosks, offering different ways that customers can be served, they can place their orders, they can customize their foods. So we expect to start seeing that ramped up through '17. And literally, the minute you convert a restaurant, we see a sales lift. So yes, it will be a contributor. But we'd probably be getting that full run rate for '18 and '19 as well, which I think it is a very strong program. One of the things we have benefited from is we've learned a lot of what works but also 1 or 2 things that don't work in the markets that they nearly adopted in Australia and Canada, for example. So we can bring that best practice into the U.S., make sure it's locally relevant, and then go hard at it. So we're really excited. The barrier to it is really -- is just a collective will to invest. I mean, there is an investment element to it, both on our own and an operator level, for the company. And certainly, from a company perspective, we're allocating our capital to provide significant support alongside the operators to co-invest with them. And we're really happy at the moment that the U.S. cash flows are all-time high. That means their ability to invest can never have been greater. So I think we're in a good place."

So it wouldn't be a surprise to see that come down a little bit, which could help then accelerate some of the guest count growth. Regarding unit growth, we brought it down by around 100. I think we had about 1,000 last quarter. Now we said about 900. It's a little bit in various markets, a few in China, a few in Spain. Nothing of significance, I would say. The reallocation is really to some of these investment areas that Steve was just talking about, certainly, in places like Australia and the U.K. where we're implementing Experience of the Future, seeing good sales lifts from those investments. We continue to reinvest in those types of investments. So you saw the capital didn't come down. It was really a reallocation of a little bit of the new-store openings to some of that reinvestment to continue to grow sales."

But when you are a lower average check business like we are, I don't think that magnifies out the same as if we were mid-scale dining or fine-end dining. So yes, it's probably in the mix, but it certainly doesn't explain. I think there are broader macroeconomic issues of consumer confidence and just uncertainty over wage increases. There's a slight squeeze on discretionary spend, with gas prices edging back up and health care cost going back up. So I think those are the sorts of things that we see affecting customers, and based on the spare cash they have in their pocket. With regards to Experience of the Future, I mean, one of the great learns we've had, and particularly with launching so aggressively in Australia over 1.5 year ago, which the main food element was something we described as Create Your Taste, and that was an in-store-only premium food offering. Now it worked great, but we wanted to find a way that we could take that to our entire customer base. So with the Aussie team, we've worked on solutions now, what we can now bring. So we believe there will be food elements, customizing premium quality food that we can deliver through both the drive-thru and in-store. And I think that's one of the benefits we have of getting those early-adopter markets, going aggressive, learn, bring it back over and localize it and launch it. And so we believe we have a good solution for that."

That still allows us to continue investing where we believe we need to, to continue to grow the business. So we're very conscious of making sure that we've got the right investment levels to be able to strategically still invest in the business. Might there be some opportunity beyond the $500 million? I guess, I'd say it does -- we're not going to stop looking or stop having the discipline in the organization to continue managing the business appropriately. But there's been a lot of change in the organization in the near term. And our belief is that for us, right now, this is the right level for us to focus on in the near term. I wouldn't say that, that means we stop and then never kind of manage the business effectively going forward. But for us, right now, the commitment is to the $500 million. Regarding capital, right now, as you know, we're right around $2 billion. What you may see in the near term is as we convert some of these countries to developmental licensees where we free up some of that capital, some of that may be redeployed to the U.S. to spend on this Experience of the Future investment that Steve was talking about. So you could see some reallocation of that capital in the next few years that would effectively keep our capital envelope relatively similar to what it is today. And then once that's complete, it's likely to go down after that. But in the near term, we may reallocate some of the capital that we've freed up to spending to accelerate that U.S. Experience of the Future investment."

I'm encouraged by the actions we've taken and the progress we've made as we execute our turnaround plan. Customer perceptions at McDonald's have steadily improved over the past 18 months, and the third quarter marks 5 consecutive quarters of comparable sales growth across all business segments with many markets gaining share. 
For the third quarter, global comparable sales increased 3.5% and operating income was up 7% in constant currencies. Earnings per share rose 9% in constant currencies. Excluding the impact of previously announced current and prior year strategic charges, earnings per share for the quarter increased 17% in constant currencies. 
Profitability has increased both for McDonald's and franchisees. At the restaurant level, franchisee cash flows reached all-time highs in many markets, including the U.S. These results are a testament to our diligent execution of the turnaround plan as we put customers at the center of everything we do. We are at a point where we've begun to transition from a focus on revitalization to a mindset that's concentrated on strengthening the business to drive sustainable growth over the long term. 
We expected performance through 2016 to be uneven, and it has been. Markets such as the U.K., Australia and Canada continue to grow sales and guest counts, whilst market including the U.S., France and Germany work to overcome challenges of varying degrees.
We are mindful of the near-term headwinds we face, most notably in the U.S., as we lap the very successful introduction of All Day Breakfast, which was immediately popular to customers. However, we're not managing the business quarter-by-quarter. In fact, our commitment to investing in the business is stronger now than ever. We're taking action in the areas that matter most to customers. 
In particular, we're placing significant emphasis on food quality, the customer experience and value to give people more reasons to visit McDonald's. We believe the long-term investments we are making in these areas provide the foundation on which we'll build as we work to be recognized as a modern, progressive burger company by customers.
In the area of food, we are taking important steps in how our food is prepared and the ingredients we use. In the U.S., we completed our transition to chicken not treated by antibiotics important to human medicine a year ahead of schedule. We introduced new buns that do not contain high-fructose corn syrup, and we removed artificial preservatives from our popular Chicken McNuggets, and customers have responded favorably to this news and we've seen sales accelerate as a result.
Following the announcement, sales of McNuggets increased nearly 10%, and they are sustaining above previous levels. 
We're also modernizing the customer experience in markets around the world as we evolve to the Experience of the Future. 
In Canada, we are engaging with customers in simpler, less stressful ways by offering them more choices on how they order and pay. We now have dual-point service and self-order kiosks in almost 90% of our traditional restaurants. In addition, we're taking steps to redefine hospitality on both sides of the counter with dedicated guest experience leaders in all of Canada's traditional restaurants. 
Finally, value, a critical priority in all markets. In Germany, for example, we've deployed a 2-pronged approach. First, we successfully added new layers to our value platform at mid-tier price points. At the same time, we're celebrating the quality and taste of our core products through strong marketing and promotional campaigns. These steps build on the new pricing structure we introduced earlier this year to strengthen our value platform, and that's resonating well with the price-conscious German consumer.
The actions we are taking specific to our food, the customer experience and the value, and telling customers about the changes, are making a difference. Customer satisfaction has improved significantly, up more than 6% year-to-date in both the U.S. and Canada, with most major markets seeing improvements. This is a testament to the progress we've made since we refocused on running better restaurants as part of our turnaround plan in May of last year.
With that context, let's turn to performance highlights in the markets. Beginning with the U.S., comparable sales remained positive for the third quarter, up 1.3%. Customers love All Day Breakfast and the way we've continued to build on its success. Since its introduction last year, customers asked for even more choices, so we recently launched the second phase of All Day Breakfast. The expanded menu now includes muffins and biscuits as well as our beloved McGriddles all day in all U.S. restaurants.
At the same time, we're enhancing the experience to adapt alongside customers' expectations. One of the most notable ways we're doing this in restaurants is by better integrating technology in visible, tangible ways. For example, more than 90% of U.S. restaurants now use digital menu boards. These new menu boards enable us to showcase the quality of our food with fresh photography. Because they're less congested and better organized, the menus now do a better job highlighting the broad range of choices available. The menu boards are also smart. They're built with a robust content management system that we haven't even begun tapping into yet. When fully enabled, we'll be able to adjust what's featured on the menu based on time of day or even weather conditions. We'll be more relevant to customers as we remind them about our ice cream cones and McFlurries on a hot summer day or handcrafted hot McCaf√© beverages if it's chilly outside and they feel the need to warm up.
We also continue to emphasize value, because we know how much budget-oriented customers count on McDonald's. Franchisees and customers alike have embraced the McPick 2 platform. They appreciate the choice and flexibility it provides. In September, we promoted McPick 2 for $5 nationally, whilst other variations of McPick 2 were offered on a local level. Some of our best-performing regions offered beverage value to complement the McPick 2 platform. We'll continue to tap into these learnings, both nationally and locally, as we design future McPick offers.
Underpinning these efforts is a continued focus on running better restaurants. Our commitment to raising the bar with an emphasis on underperforming restaurants is making a difference. Customer satisfaction scores have improved the most for our bottom-quintile restaurants, and we've cut the customer satisfaction score gap between the top and bottom quintile performance nearly in half through our efforts to provide a better, more consistent experience for customers in every restaurant every time they visit.
Turning to the International Lead Market segment. Third quarter comparable sales were up 3.3%, driven by positive performance across 4 of the 5 major markets, with France being the exception. The U.K., Australia and Canada delivered yet another quarter of comparable sales and guest count growth. These markets share similar elements that underlie their strong track records of success: contemporary restaurant designs with over 90% of restaurants reimaged; compelling menu strategies tailored to local customer tastes, such as the Spice It Up event in Canada featuring spicy Sriracha sauce on a country chicken or Angus beef sandwich; and a modern service experience that incorporates the elements of Experience of the Future to provide customers with more choice and flexibility on how they order, what they order and how they are served. These elements amplify each other to create a notable difference for customers who then reward us by visiting more often.
I'm encouraged by the progress we've made in Germany, which I had a chance to experience firsthand when I visited the team there last quarter. Comparable sales were positive in the market for the third quarter. 
Earlier, I mentioned the steps we've taken to strengthen our value platform. Combined with strong promotions featuring customer favorites like the hamburger Royal with Cheese, these actions are making a difference and getting us back on track to grow top line results once again.
That said, I want to stress the growing -- that growing guest counts remains a top priority. That's the key to winning back the share we've lost in recent years. 
In France, third quarter comparable sales were negative. This was driven in large part by ongoing macroeconomic challenges, including a declining GDP, high unemployment and the continuing concerns for personal safety, which is impacting both inbound tourism as well as the French consumer. 
The customers appreciate the actions we've taken to strengthen our value offer, including further extensions of the well-regarded and successful P'tit Plaisir value platform. We're also satisfying French consumers' growing appetite for premium burgers through strong promotional campaigns featuring customer favorites like the 280 Burger and the Big Tasty. In addition, we're introducing a new signature line of sandwiches in our Experience of the Future restaurants to give customers even more great-tasting burger choices at the convenience and value they've come to appreciate at McDonald's.
In the High Growth segment, third quarter comparable sales were up 1.5%, driven by positive performance in Russia and most other markets, partially offset by negative comparable sales in China. Whilst third quarter comparable sales in China were down 1.8%, results improved as the quarter progressed. Excluding the impact of temporary protests surrounding recent events related to the South China Sea, China's comparable sales would have been positive for the quarter.
A strong focus on enhancing convenience through greater integration with third-party delivery providers combined with aggressive core menu sampling events designed to offset the impact of the protests contributed to market share gains amidst the still challenging macroeconomic environment. 
In Russia, the economy remains difficult and consumer purchasing power continues to decline. Despite these challenges, we are growing comparable sales and guest count and gaining market share.
Specifically, our performance is a result of a heightened focus on value as well as the successful marketing campaigns to grow the Breakfast Day part. And I'd be remiss if I didn't mention Japan, where comparable sales increased 17.7% in the third quarter. Diligent execution of the market's comprehensive turnaround plans, which include strong promotions, exciting menu variety, compelling value and a more modern restaurant experience, is enhancing McDonald's' relevance to customers and contributing to sustained momentum in this market.
As we look to the future, we recognize the importance of having the right structure, the right people, a common focus and, lastly, greater accountability across the entire McDonald's System. We've taken steps forward in all 4 areas to set a proper foundation for long-term growth. 
First, the right structure. Building on last year's shift to segments of similar markets, we took further steps in the third quarter to transition to a leaner, more efficient and more nimble organization. This will enable us to effectively share expertise, improve efficiencies and drive down costs, taking greater advantage of our size and scale. Kevin will provide further details in a moment. 
Second, the right talent. An important component of our turnaround plan has always been to ensure we have the right people in the most critical positions. Management changes have been and continue to be an anticipated part of the process. That's why we're focused on a blend of promoting individuals who are ready to take on additional responsibilities, continuing to develop leaders that have the right skills necessary to grow the business and attracting new executives into the business to provide fresh energy and innovative thinking.
I'm confident in the recent selections we have made. This includes Chris Kempczinski succeeding Mike Andres as President of McDonald's U.S.A. effective the 1st of January. As part of a focal transition, Chris is already spending significant time with Mike and our franchisees in the field. 
In the High Growth segment, Joe Erlinger has made an immediate impact upon stepping into the role of President in these markets. He knows these markets well, having been CFO of the segment and the former Managing Director of Korea.
Third, a common focus. In addition to making forward progress on running great restaurants, we are putting greater emphasis on accelerating initiatives that will bring more customers into our restaurants more often. This includes the Experience of the Future, which we're looking to roll out at greater speed in the U.S., and we look forward to sharing more details of those plans as they're finalized.
And lastly, accountability. We've made great progress executing our turnaround plan. Now we're starting to balance those efforts with a greater focus on longer-term growth. It will take all of our franchisees, employees and suppliers working together and holding each other accountable to achieve our ultimate goal of becoming the modern progressive burger company.
We have a long-term view on our potential and the opportunities that exist. I'm confident in the actions we are taking to run better restaurants and the investments we are making. We're getting the right people, foundations and platforms in place to properly grow the business and reassert McDonald's' global brand leadership.
Thanks very much, and now I'll turn it over to Kevin."

By staying keenly focused on our customers, we maintained positive momentum while continuing to make meaningful strides toward building a better McDonald's. Since Steve talked about sales and earnings per share, I'll focus on margins and G&A. I'll also provide an update on the key outlook items and the recent progress we've made against our financial targets. 
Starting with the performance drivers for the quarter. Franchise revenues continue to become an increasingly significant portion of our revenue stream as we evolve to a more heavily franchised organization. For third quarter, franchise revenues increased 6% in constant currencies, reflecting strong comparable sales and the impact of refranchising. For the quarter, franchise margin dollars exceeded $2 billion, a 6% increase in constant currencies, and contributed over $100 million to our growth in global operating income. This solid performance reflects sales driven improvements across all segments, led by results in the International Lead Markets. In addition, we maintained strong global franchise margins of over 82%. These results are a testament to the benefits of transitioning toward a more predictable and stable revenue stream.
Growth in company-operated margins also contributed about $75 million to our growth in global operating income, as company-operated margins rose to more than $730 million, an 11% increase in constant currencies. Company-operated margins climbed 260 basis points, with the U.S. and China leading the overall improvement. Our emphasis on running better restaurants, from enhanced conveniences to tighter operating controls, is yielding a better experience for our customers as well as improved restaurant profitability.
In the U.S., the company-operated margin percent increased 450 basis points for the quarter, reflecting positive comparable sales and a favorable commodity environment. These results also reflect the benefit from our refranchising as we optimize our company-operated restaurant portfolio and the ongoing contribution it makes to our bottom line.
Moving on to G&A. At the end of last year, we noted that we expected to realize about $150 million in savings during 2015 and 2016, with about half of the savings to be achieved in each year. For third quarter, our G&A expenses increased 1% in constant currencies due to higher incentive-based compensation as a result of our year-to-date performance. For the full year, we now expect G&A to be relatively flat in constant currencies. However, excluding incentive-based compensation, G&A for the year is expected to be down about 3% in constant currencies, which equates to roughly $75 million in savings due to lower employee-related costs resulting from our restructuring initiatives. This will bring our total G&A savings at the end of 2016 to at least $150 million. 
Let me switch gears now for an update on menu pricing and commodity costs. In the U.S., commodity costs declined by more than 6% during the third quarter. Given the strength of our third quarter savings, combined with our outlook for fourth quarter, we now expect the segment's full year basket of goods to be down 4.5% to 5%. Commodity costs for the International Lead segment were down about 1% for the third quarter and are expected to remain relatively flat for the remainder of this year. 
While we continue to benefit from favorable commodity costs around the world, we continue to experience rising labor costs in many of our markets. These pressures are considered as we make pricing decisions over the course of the year. Our objective is to manage pricing in a way that maintains our strong value proposition, contributes to guest traffic growth and supports restaurant profitability. In the U.S., third quarter pricing year-over-year was up about 3.5% compared with food-away-from-home inflation of about 2.5%.
For U.S. company-operated restaurant pricing, our goal is to approximate food-away-from-home inflation over time, so we may be a little higher or lower in any given quarter. We are also mindful that the current 450-basis-point gap between the cost of eating at home versus dining out is the largest spread in more than 30 years and may be impacting consumer behavior. We continue to track these metrics and expect our overall menu price increase at year-end to be more in line with food-away-from-home inflation. For the International Lead segment, while price increases vary by market, year-over-year increases for these markets averaged about 2%.
Next, I'd like to provide an update on our foreign currency outlook. Based on current exchange rates, we project foreign currency translation to negatively impact our earnings per share by $0.01 to $0.02 in the fourth quarter, which will bring the full year impact to $0.09 to $0.10. As always, please take our currency guidance as directional only because rates will change as we move throughout the year.
Last quarter, I committed to providing more detail on today's call regarding the role that our organizational restructuring is playing in reaching our previously announced G&A savings target. For the last several months, we have been working with outside advisers to thoroughly analyze our G&A spending and organizational structure, from our corporate functions to the individual markets and the critical role they play in the field.
Our overall goal was to focus our resources in talent and customer-facing activities that drive business growth while creating a more globalized system that more effectively leverages our size and scale to spread learnings better and drive cost improvements and efficiencies.
As we move toward becoming a leaner and more agile organization, we're positioned to make quicker and better decisions and to execute on our strategic intent to create a better customer experience. The pace at which All Day Breakfast moved from the U.S. to Australia is a great example of how we're accelerating knowledge transfer across the system to benefit customers globally. I'm confident that our redesigned organization is now better equipped to adapt to today's rapidly changing environment.
As a result of our reorganization, we incurred roughly $80 million in restructuring charges for the third quarter. While this component of our restructuring is nearing completion, we do expect to incur some additional but less significant charges in the fourth quarter. We remain on track to achieve our net annual G&A savings target of $500 million by 2018, with the vast majority of the savings expected to be realized by the end of next year.
We also continue to make changes to the business through our global refranchising efforts. Since the beginning of 2015, we refranchised nearly 1,000 restaurants, including 140 in the third quarter. The large majority of restaurants refranchised to date have been sold to existing conventional franchisees. As previously indicated, we're also actively pursuing a transaction in China, where we are currently in the process of vetting a select number of qualified bidders. 
In addition, we have made meaningful progress in our search for long-term strategic partners in Malaysia and Singapore. These markets collectively operate almost 400 restaurants, more than 80% of which are company-owned. We are in the final stages of the process and expect to complete these transactions by the end of this year. Given where the transactions stand, we recorded a noncash charge of approximately $40 million in the quarter to account for historical currency losses.
As we moved into the month of October, we also completed the sale of 75 company-operated restaurants in the Ural region of Russia to an existing developmental licensee. The results of this transaction will be reflected in fourth quarter. So we remain on track to refranchise about 4,000 restaurants by the end of 2018, and we'll continue to keep you apprised of our progress.
Last November, we increased our 3-year cash return to shareholders target to $30 billion by the end of 2016. During the quarter, we returned $3.4 billion to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends. Share repurchases for the quarter totaled $2.7 billion, the vast majority of which was completed under our second accelerated share repurchase program of the year. 
Further, in September, our Board of Directors approved a 6% dividend increase effective in the fourth quarter, the equivalent of $3.76 annually. This increase marked the company's 40th consecutive year of delivering a dividend increase for our shareholders.
As a result of these activities, the cumulative cash return under our 3-year target stands at nearly $28 billion, and we are on track to complete the remaining amount by the end of this year. 
To summarize, over the course of the last year, we've demonstrated our commitment to meeting our financial targets. By the end of 2016, we will have met our $30 billion cash return to shareholders target, achieved nearly 1/3 of our G&A savings target and completed more than 1/3 of our restaurant refranchising, with some significant transactions on track for completion in 2017.
We continue to measure our progress and hold ourselves accountable in each phase of the turnaround to ensure that we're appropriately allocating our resources to strategic operating plans that will grow our business. 
As we move into the final quarter of 2016, we are mindful of the hurdles we face in the near term, but we're keeping our line of sight clearly focused on the long term. Through our actions, we're unlocking financial value and using it to fuel the innovation and investments that will create a better customer experience and deliver sustained profitable growth for the long term for our system and our shareholders.
Thanks. Now I'll turn it over to Chris to begin our Q&A."

So first of all, on the All Day Breakfast and the McPick 2, so that was the -- they are 2 of the foundational elements of what's helped maintain and -- establish and then maintain momentum of the business. So as you know,",753,"David. Steve. I'll take this one. So first of all, on the All Day Breakfast and the McPick 2, so that was the -- they are 2 of the foundational elements of what's helped maintain and -- establish and then maintain momentum of the business. So as you know, we launched All Day Breakfast around this time last year. It's served us well. It -- as you know, the initial peak was higher than we expected, and it settled down to a level that we're happy with. In the meantime, we worked on how can we extend that platform, both operationally and making sure the consumer had -- demand was there. And we extended it just a couple of weeks ago as well, 3 or 4 weeks ago. So that is here to stay. It's doing well for us, and is a foundational element of our business momentum. McPick 2, like -- similarly, it really is well embraced by both our operators and by our customers. So as you know, we've tried both McPick 2 for $5, which is typically the platform we use at a national level. And we'll be bringing that back, I don't know, 3, 4 times a year and they're hitting at a national level and still using the flexibility of that platform to rotate different items through that menu. But what you don't see perhaps so visibly is -- across the regions is how McPick 2 is always on. And typically, the regions will use a greater value element, like a McPick 2 for $2.50, McPick 2 for $2, McPick 2 for $3. And again, depending on seasonality and the customer preference, we'll rotate several products through there. So both those platforms are good contributors to us and are important part of our business going forward. In terms of what we've got to be excited about going forward, there's plenty. And part of what we're enjoying about the new structure in this business is the greater visibility we have to what works around the world and what's creating some of that success internationally for us, but also the way that they've simplified the structure in the U.S. What's worked in a regional level? So there's a lot of product innovation, local product innovation at a regional level that we're looking to learn from and lift where appropriate. There's some -- earlier this quarter, I spent some time in Phoenix and Scottsdale in Arizona, then went up to Portland in Oregon. And one common success [ph] back in both those regions -- both of them are the strongest sales regions we have in the U.S. currently. And what was also particularly successful there was they were complementing local beverage value alongside the McPick 2 platform alongside the fundamentals of running better restaurants. So there are these pockets of great success that we're looking to lift and localize and then launch rapidly. So -- but the other piece that I've always come back to, and I won't hesitate coming back to, is probably the most important element of what has established momentum in the U.S. is the operational improvements around running better restaurants. And that is something that is so, so fundamental, and it may not be a headline grabber. But if you think about the 27 million, 28 million customers that come in every single day, if we can offer a more consistent, friendlier, more convenient service to them, that is where our greatest reward is. And the customer satisfaction scores are going significantly in the right direction. And again, we have a number of ways that we're looking to improve the operational experience, including using technology to make it more easy and more convenient for customers. So we have multiple future growth drivers. And internationally, again, we're scanning the horizon, clearly. I mean, you've seen the success of -- the very, very consistent sort of success across the International Lead Markets. And there are certain common success stories across those. Most notably, how they are embracing what we're calling, describing the Experience of the Future, which is how you use modern facilities that is a totally redefined front-of-house hospitality experience; use of technology with self-order kiosks, for example; integrating that with mobile apps and, again, offering a degree -- an appropriate degree of customization for customers so they can really exert their choice and enjoy variety across our menus. So again, you can expect us to incorporate on those successes into the U.S. business as we move forward."

First of all, on the gap, competitive gap, we had a positive gap for the quarter. It was -- positive gap was 0.6%. As you know, it's a market share fight out there. It really is a scramble. The -- there is certainly a softening top line across",693,"Yes, sure. First of all, on the gap, competitive gap, we had a positive gap for the quarter. It was -- positive gap was 0.6%. As you know, it's a market share fight out there. It really is a scramble. The -- there is certainly a softening top line across the sector with consumer confidence. We -- I think all of us in the sector would prefer some tailwinds. If you look -- there aren't many tailwinds at the moment, there's not great economic growth to help provide a lift. Consumer confidence is muted. We're at a rather unusual stage of the election cycle. So none of that's really providing a tailwind for us. That said, there's a significant market out there, and we're going to keep battling for market share. That said, seeing the softening of the gap was not a great surprise to us, because it was a particular -- this time last year and heading into the fourth quarter was comparative really strong performance for us. So the reality is the trends we're seeing are no surprise to us and certainly aren't shaking us from our longer-term objectives. From a leadership perspective, I'd love to talk about it. I'm excited about where we're at. We're heading into 2017 now with a -- really a world-class team that one would expect from a world-class business. We have made changes. And as you go through the various phases of a turnaround into growth, there are times when the skill sets required, as we transition, also need to change. So it's a delicate balance between leveraging the experience, the knowledge, the tenure, the understanding of the system with our more tenured leaders, also bringing in innovative thinking. But I could just draw some examples to this. I mean, there's -- giving Chris Kempczinski the opportunity to lead the U.S. business, I'm really excited about. Because the reality is whilst he has somewhat limited McDonald's experience, he brings some phenomenal external leadership experience from global brands, consumer brands, which will be valuable to us. But also, let's not forget that if he was to take the 5 or 6 key direct reports that he has reportance of, there's more than 120 years of McDonald's U.S. experience amongst them. So I think we've got the McDonald's experience piece covered, and with his fresh thinking, I'm sure that's going to be a very, very potent combination. If you look at the role that we've created with Doug Goare now. I mean, Doug's been around for the best part of 40 years, and there are very few roles in this business that Doug hasn't filled yet. He's had functional leadership in supply chain, functional leadership of franchising, of real estate, as well as field leadership both here in the U.S., previously ran Europe, and now he's proven to be a great leader of our International Lead Markets. Leveraging Doug's experience to help blend in with a new experience like Chris. We're all one team, and that's a good balance. Joe Erlinger taking the High Growth. I mean, Joe started off in the U.S. business 15 years ago. He became a regional manager, very successfully here in the U.S., transitioned to become a market leader, a Managing Director of the Korean market; has financial experience and became the CFO in the newly formed High Growth market. And he's perfectly placed to step in and add his energy and insight into a leadership position. And then if you were to talk about -- for Chris' transition, we'd already prepared for that. We'd already had Lucy Brady come and join our business. She's a Senior Vice President at BCG, 20 years' experience in helping global businesses develop growth strategies. So ideally placed to seamlessly fit to that. So it's an important balance. It's something that I enjoyed leading when I was in the U.K., when we were transitioning from probably a McDonald's only management team to one that I felt had the right combination. And getting that balance right now is critical, and I'm really excited to be into next year with a team that's sharp and ready to go."

Because if you speak to the team in France, for example, who have led so much of our strategic thinking and the innovation across our bus",605,"Yes, sure, absolutely. I mean, really, it's a fascinating time to be running an international business. It really is. Because if you speak to the team in France, for example, who have led so much of our strategic thinking and the innovation across our business, they're now facing, really, not just unforeseen, but previously not experienced challenges. And given not just their macroeconomic environment, we know that GDP is down in France, but there's different dynamics. And given some of the situation and the security terror situation they face there, it really is creating some very significant dynamic changes in that market. Tourism, which has always been a substantial part of -- that's fueled the economy in France, has really softened. And we're seeing -- you see it in the hotel bookings, and you can see it impacted in, certainly, the more tourist areas, whether it's the Southern France or Paris, within our business, where we do have a heavy concentration of restaurants. We also see it affect the way that consumers live their lives, French consumers. So there's a slight reticence to go into high-density tourist areas because they're slightly concerned at the moment. Now I think some of those things are temporary, and some of the things may be slightly more permanent. But it certainly means our management teams in France happen to be much more agile and responsive to act in accordance with consumer sentiment. When you go to a market like Spain, where they have probably suffered more through the economic crisis than any other market that we do business in, youth unemployment up at 25%, for example. So we have just gently slowed down the new-store opening there in order to focus our efforts and our investment on the existing store portfolio, and I'm delighted with the progress that market's made, as it's built its momentum, it's returning to growth through the second half of this year, and the outlook looks very confident. U.K. is a -- probably a well- and often-spoken story. I think it's 42 consecutive quarters of growth now, and that momentum really does look very solid and well baked in. So I won't say too much more about that. But then you can go internationally across to Asia. Now China is a challenging market. And the manner in which the team are adapting to the variations that they have to experience, both, again, in consumer sentiment and the broader economy, is admirable. And as they are seeing -- just as one example, they now have a substantial part of that business is the delivery business. And not just -- originally, we set up and established our own McDonald's delivery service, and that proved to be very successful, but now integrating it into third-party delivery providers. And that has way further accelerated the -- our momentum of business and customer satisfaction, as more people are getting used to ordering and eating at home. So we're seeing different trends around the world. And the one thing that is particularly beneficial to us now is as we remove some of the layers in our business, the visibility we have into what's going on and how we can transfer that knowledge and use it to our advantage in other markets, and part of the advantage here of having Chris in his position now, he spent his first year traveling around the world, both with myself and other senior leaders and on his own, visiting these markets, seeing what's going on, understanding the big levers of our business. And he's now perfectly placed to help take that into the U.S. business."

I'd say you can see out there, there's still some promotional offerings, certainly, around the industry. I think all of us, certainly including us, would like to see kind of just a stable platform where you can -- that's why we put McPick 2 in. The idea is to have an ongoing value platform that customers can count on and not have to come up with some discounted promotion, if you will, every now and then. On the pricing side, to your point, right now, we're a little bit ahead of food-away-from-home, and we certainly experienced very favorable margins here in the U.S. in the third quarter. Some of that is the timing of when we take pricing. So if you look at last year, we actually took some pricing in October, whereas this year, we took it in September. So that when you look at a year-over-year basis, you have a little timing shift. There's about 70 to 75 basis points of pricing that will be in last year's fourth quarter that we may not replace some or all of that in the fourth quarter this year, which would bring some of our pricing down and maybe more in line with food-away-from-home. But we still do keep an eye on both food-away-from-home and food at home, which, you mentioned, the food at home is extremely low right now. Thanks."

Thanks, John. I see it starting to make a contribution in '17. I mean, the reality is we would see this as something like a 3-year program, which is exactly what we're seeing through the markets like U.K., Canada, Australia. These are rolling programs and actually give us growth upon growth upon growth as it -- for the U.K., for example, they're already almost 40% converted to the entire Experience of the Future, which is introducing that technology along with the hospitality as well as the food elements. And therefore, their visibility on year-on-year growth over the next 2 to 3 years looks pretty strong. In the U.S., we're certainly earlier in that cycle. In terms of modernized restaurants, just over 50% of the U.S. estate is modernized. We've got some work to do to complete that. And then, of course, within that, we want to layer on top the other elements -- or the far broader elements and consumer-facing elements of the Experience of the Future, integrating the app into the self-order kiosks, offering different ways that customers can be served, they can place their orders, they can customize their foods. So we expect to start seeing that ramped up through '17. And literally, the minute you convert a restaurant, we see a sales lift. So yes, it will be a contributor. But we'd probably be getting that full run rate for '18 and '19 as well, which I think it is a very strong program. One of the things we have benefited from is we've learned a lot of what works but also 1 or 2 things that don't work in the markets that they nearly adopted in Australia and Canada, for example. So we can bring that best practice into the U.S., make sure it's locally relevant, and then go hard at it. So we're really excited. The barrier to it is really -- is just a collective will to invest. I mean, there is an investment element to it, both on our own and an operator level, for the company. And certainly, from a company perspective, we're allocating our capital to provide significant support alongside the operators to co-invest with them. And we're really happy at the moment that the U.S. cash flows are all-time high. That means their ability to invest can never have been greater. So I think we're in a good place."

The follow-up is it's starting -- you're talking about rolling off. To the extent that you know kind of what elasticity looks like in your business, is there any sense that maybe by allowing it to roll off, your traffic could accelerate in the sense that traffic has been negative, and maybe the higher prices is a contributor to that so that we could see that comp composition change a little based on what you know about your customers? And then my second point is -- second question is about the unit growth taking it down. Is that because you're intentionally steering more capital to existing units or remodels?

So it wouldn't be a surprise to see that come down a little bit, which could help then accelerate some of the guest count growth. Regarding unit growth, we brought it down by around 100. I think we had about 1,000 last quarter. Now we said about 900. It's a little bit in various markets, a few in China, a few in Spain. Nothing of significance, I would say. The reallocation is really to some of these investment areas that Steve was just talking about, certainly, in places like Australia and the U.K. where we're implementing Experience of the Future, seeing good sales lifts from those investments. We continue to reinvest in those types of investments. So you saw the capital didn't come down.

But when you are a lower average check business like we are, I don't think that magnifies out the same as if we were mid-scale dining or fine-end dining. So yes, it's probably in the mix, but it certainly doesn't explain. I think there are broader macroeconomic issues of consumer confidence and just uncertainty over wage increases. There's a slight squeeze on discretionary spend, with gas prices edging back up and health care cost going back up. So I think those are the sorts of things that we see affecting customers, and based on the spare cash they have in their pocket. With regards to Experience of the Future, I mean, one of the great learns we've had, and particularly with launching so aggressively in Australia over 1.5 year ago, which the main food element was something we described as Create Your Taste, and that was an in-store-only premium food offering. Now it worked great, but we wanted to find a way that we could take that to our entire customer base. So with the Aussie team, we've worked on solutions now, what we can now bring. So we believe there will be food elements, customizing premium quality food that we can deliver through both the drive-thru and in-store. And I think that's one of the benefits we have of getting those early-adopter markets, going aggressive, learn, bring it back over and localize it and launch it.

So we're very conscious of making sure that we've got the right investment levels to be able to strategically still invest in the business. Might there be some opportunity beyond the $500 million? I guess, I'd say it does -- we're not going to stop looking or stop having the discipline in the organization to continue managing the business appropriately. But there's been a lot of change in the organization in the near term. And our belief is that for us, right now, this is the right level for us to focus on in the near term. I wouldn't say that, that means we stop and then never kind of manage the business effectively going forward. But for us, right now, the commitment is to the $500 million. Regarding capital, right now, as you know, we're right around $2 billion. What you may see in the near term is as we convert some of these countries to developmental licensees where we free up some of that capital, some of that may be redeployed to the U.S. to spend on this Experience of the Future investment that Steve was talking about. So you could see some reallocation of that capital in the next few years that would effectively keep our capital envelope relatively similar to what it is today. And then once that's complete, it's likely to go down after that.

Midway through 2016, I'm encouraged by the progress we've made in turning around our business and the way we've challenged legacy thinking, acting with greater urgency and shared successes more quickly across",1768,"Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Midway through 2016, I'm encouraged by the progress we've made in turning around our business and the way we've challenged legacy thinking, acting with greater urgency and shared successes more quickly across markets. These actions underlie the positive momentum that continued in second quarter, marking 4 consecutive quarters of positive comparable sales growth across all segments and franchisee cash flows at all-time highs in many markets. 
More specifically, global comparable sales increased 3.1% for the quarter. Operating income was up 3% in constant currencies and earnings per share was up 1% in constant currencies. Excluding the impact of the current and prior year strategic charges, earnings per share for the quarter was up 13% in constant currencies. 
As we entered 2016, we expected quarterly results to be variable throughout the year. Our top line performance in second quarter, while positive, reflects slower growth, due in part to challenging conditions in several countries. 
I'm encouraged that we continue to win relative to our QSR competitors in key markets around the world. In the U.S, our comparable sales gap versus the QSR sandwich segment was consistently positive and averaged 130 basis points for the quarter despite softer industry growth. Our balanced focus on All Day Breakfast, value and relevant promotions, including Monopoly, contributed to top line performance. 
In Australia, Canada and the U.K., we are gaining significant market share within the IEO segment and, in particular, relative to our traditional QSR competitors. Our formula for success in these markets is consistent: Commitment to running great restaurants, coupled with initiatives that create customer excitement across our menu, promotion and value offers, all supported by strong alignment with franchisees.
Early last year, we put the customer back at the center of everything we're doing. That mindset ignited our turnaround and continues to guide our decision-making, as evidenced by the enhancements we are making to the All Day Breakfast menu in the U.S., the leadership moves we've made around sustainability and the significant progress we're making to create a more modern customer experience as part of the Experience of the Future.
Over the past few quarters, we've heard from customers looking for more choices in the All Day Breakfast menu. Those with muffin sandwiches on the menu ask for biscuits. Those with biscuits sandwiches on the menu ask for muffins. We listened, worked through the operational challenges, and this fall, we'll begin offering muffins, biscuits and McGriddles all day in all U.S. restaurants. 
Under the broader food-quality umbrella, we continue to take a leadership stance of sustainability because it's the right thing to do for our business, society and the world at large. 
In Canada, we are breaking ground in the beef industry with our recently concluded sustainable beef pilots, part of our work with ranches and larger producers around the globe to measure and track sustainable beef from farm to fork.
Sustainability matters to our customers, and it matters to us. At the same time Experience of the Future is quickly coming to life in key markets around the world. For example, in Canada, over half of our restaurants have been fully converted. U.K. is almost 40%, and France is at nearly 25% with table service in about 80% of restaurants. This marks significant progress from where we were just 3 months ago.
The customers are noticing the steps we're taking to build a better McDonald's. The most recent customer satisfaction scores reflect improvements in 7 of our 9 largest markets. In the U.S., we are seeing further evidence of improved brand perceptions according to a recent YouGov report that measures consumer perceptions across 1,400 brands. McDonald's was ranked fourth most-improved brand across all brands measured and the most improved within QSR.
We're taking smart risks to address what matters most to customers. We also are being smarter about our structure and resources and prioritizing our activities to deliver the greatest impact. This includes putting more restaurants in the hands of dedicated franchisees, getting us closer to the customers and communities we serve, and unleashes more entrepreneurial spirit, risk-taking and innovation across the system, ultimately accelerating growth.
At the same time, we are further streamlining how we operate. We're in the midst of rightsizing our organization, taking a critical look at how we can reduce layers to be more agile in our decision-making. We also recently announced the relocation of our corporate headquarters. Our new location will support greater collaboration and innovation, help us better attract and retain talent and move us toward a more modern progressive culture with the added benefit of reducing costs. These are all important steps forward in our journey to building a better McDonald's. 
With that context, let's now turn to performance highlights in our major markets. Beginning with the U.S., comparable sales for second quarter increased 1.8%. Whilst modestly positive, this growth was not as strong as the last 2 quarters. This is due in part to the recent softening of the IEO industry which experienced minimal growth for the trailing 12-month period ending in May, at only 40 basis points. 
The All Day Breakfast platform continues to contribute to top line momentum to draw new customers into our restaurants and create additional reasons for existing customers to visit more often. This is also delivering bottom line growth with restaurant-level cash flows up for the third consecutive quarter. 
Franchisees are excited about our platform and its future growth potential. And the next phase of All Day Breakfast, which I mentioned earlier, was voted in with an overwhelming approval rating exceeding 99%. 
With food, we continue to enhance quality perceptions around our core menu, and we've been more vocal about the improvements we've made. Just last week, we launched our new brand campaign called, ""The simpler, the better,"" which highlights the progress we've made in the areas that matter most to our customers. And we'll have even more news to share in the coming weeks.
Value remains a top priority in the U.S. Franchisees have embraced the McPick 2 value platform at both the national and local levels. We're tapping into the flexibility this platform provides in terms of products and price points to enhance our appeal to a broader population of value-seeking customers, which is increasingly important given softer IEO industry trends.
Although the progress we've made in the U.S. is encouraging, our most significant opportunity continues to be bringing customers into our restaurants more often. As such, we are actively exploring new ways of increasing the frequency of visits from our loyal customers and win back customers we've lost.
Let's now turn to the International Lead segment. Second quarter comparable sales increased 2.6%, with 4 of the top 5 markets delivering positive comparable sales for the quarter. France was the exception with results that were relatively flat. 
Whilst the recent Brexit vote has created uncertainty in the U.K. and across Europe, our business remains strong, and we are confident in our ability to manage through the change. Having operated in these markets for over 40 years, we are accustomed to dealing with external challenges. I believe we are well positioned to seek out the opportunities it provides to build upon the strength of our U.K. business.
In fact, the U.K. market's long track record of success continued into second quarter. Compelling promotions, limited time offers such as the relaunch of Big Flavour Wraps and positive performance from Experience of the Future restaurants drove growth in both average check and guest counts, with guest count volume breaking all-time monthly highs in April and May. 
In Canada, our continued focus on lunch, along with successful marketing campaigns and positive performance from their Experience of the Future Restaurants, drove solid sales and guest count momentum into the second quarter.
Performance of All Day Breakfast in Australia is mirroring the success in the U.S., driving incremental sales by providing customers with even more reasons to visit McDonald's. 
In addition, we continue to fuel growth in more established platforms, like Experience of the Future and McCaf√©. We're introducing new customizable flavors and ingredients, supported by engaging marketing and promotional campaigns to create energy and excitement for our customers.
Sales were slightly positive in Germany for the second quarter. With the heavy concentration of price-conscious customers, value remains a critical priority. The new pricing structure we rolled out in February continues to perform in line with expectations. And McPick 2 for EUR 5, which we launched in May, resonated well with customers. 
However, these initiatives weren't enough to mitigate ongoing guest count and market share declines. Macroeconomic challenges persist in France. We're enhancing our appeal to customers by offering more compelling options at lower tiers of our menu. We're also pursuing growth opportunities at the premium end through engaging promotions and limited-time offers, including the recent New York Street Food event, which successfully drove sales of premium burgers and wraps. 
In the High Growth segment, second quarter comparable sales were up 1.6%, driven by positive performance in China and Russia. Despite the challenging environment, including aggressive discounting by competitors, China's comparable sales were up 2.1% for the quarter. We continue to gain significant market share in IEO, and more specifically from Chinese QSRs, whilst understating meaningful cost savings initiatives to enhance profitability in this important market.
In an effort to give customers more reason to choose McDonald's, we've introduced appealing new products, like the chicken snack sharing box. In addition, we're expanding our delivery business by tapping into growing digital channels, as well as other vendors, to offer added convenience to Chinese customers. 
In Russia, comparable sales remained positive, driven in part by successful promotions that showcase compelling, affordable menu options across multiple day parts and product categories. Results may be volatile moving forward given continuing macroeconomic uncertainties and lower consumer purchasing power.
I'm encouraged by our continued progress. We're creating a better McDonald's, one that customers will recognize as modern and progressive and a true global leader. Whilst we've come a long way, we recognize there is much more to do. That's why we remain committed to executing our turnaround plan through the end of the year. 
For now, we remain focused on continuing to win within the QSR segment as we give customers more reasons to choose McDonald's. At the same time, we are taking steps to build upon the progress we've made as we chart our long-term strategical path forward within the broader $1.2 trillion informal eating-out market. I am confident McDonald's will generate long-term value for both our system and our shareholders. 
Thanks. I'll now turn it over to Kevin."
139488,372629879,1758749,"McDonald's Corp., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 26, 2016",2016-07-26,"Earnings Calls","McDonald's Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. As a follow-up to Steve's remarks, I'd like to cover the key performance drivers for the quarter, provide an update on our outlook for the second half of 2016 and outline the recent progress we have made against",1435,"Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. As a follow-up to Steve's remarks, I'd like to cover the key performance drivers for the quarter, provide an update on our outlook for the second half of 2016 and outline the recent progress we have made against our financial initiatives. 
Starting with the performance drivers for the quarter. For the quarter as a whole, we're pleased with our efforts to effectively manage restaurant profitability, particularly in light of the industry trends and economic factors that we've experienced in certain markets. 
With more than 80% of our global restaurants franchised, the largest driver of operating income continues to be our franchise margins. For the quarter, growth in global franchise margins was led by the U.S. and the International Lead markets. Franchise margins totaled $1.9 billion, a 6% increase in constant currencies, and contributed about $100 million to our global operating income growth for the quarter. 
Growth in global company-operated margins also contributed to quarterly results as margins rose 150 basis points, with China leading the overall improvement. 
In the U.S., company-operated margins increased by 30 basis points for the quarter, as positive comparable sales and favorable commodity costs more than offset the investment we made last July to raise crew wages and enhance benefits for our restaurant employees. Given the magnitude of this investment, the improvement in second quarter margins is a noteworthy achievement for our U.S. business. 
Moving on to G&A. Our second quarter expenses increased 2% in constant currencies due to higher incentive-based compensation as our a result of our year-to-date performance as well as costs associated with our biennial Owner/Operator Convention in April. Excluding these items, G&A would have decreased. 
Looking ahead, third quarter G&A levels will remain elevated due to our sponsorship of the Summer Olympic Games in Rio next month. Taken together, the cost of our worldwide convention and the Olympics are expected to total about $25 million or roughly 1% of our G&A in 2016.
For the full year 2016, we continue to expect G&A in constant currencies to be 1% to 2% below prior year spending levels, excluding changes in incentive-based compensation and any impact from changes in timing of certain refranchising transactions. 
Global operating income for the quarter totaled more than $1.8 billion, up 3% in constant currencies, reflecting roughly $230 million in strategic charges recorded during the quarter. These charges were comprised of noncash impairment related to our ongoing refranchising in Asia and Europe and G&A initiatives, as well as the decision to relocate our corporate offices.
Diluted earnings per share for the quarter declined $0.01, which included $0.20 related to the strategic charges and $0.02 in negative foreign currency impact. 
As a reminder, in second quarter 2015, we have strategic charges of $0.04 per share related to restructuring. Excluding the impact of the current and prior year restructuring charges, earnings per share for second quarter 2016 were up 13% in constant currencies.
Turning next to menu pricing and commodity costs. In the U.S., commodity costs declined 4.5% during the second quarter. Looking to the second half of the year, we expect commodity costs to remain favorable, maintaining our outlook for the segment's full year basket of goods to be down 3.5% to 4.5%. Commodity costs for the International Lead segment were down about 1% for the second quarter and are expected to remain relatively flat during the second half of this year. Where possible, we source products in local currency to minimize cost fluctuations, and our suppliers also hedge a portion of foreign currency exposure. So at least in the near term, we don't expect Brexit to significantly impact U.K. commodity prices.
While we are benefiting from favorable commodity cost around the world, we are facing rising labor costs in many of our markets. As a result, we are carefully balancing price increases with a focus on maintaining our strong value proposition, which remains a key pillar of McDonald's brand to drive guest counts. 
In the U.S., second quarter pricing year-over-year was up about 3% compared with food-away-from-home inflation of 2.6%. Given the widening gap between food-at-home and food-away-from-home inflation in the U.S., we continue to track both of these metrics very closely. As it stands, food at home is projected to increase modestly from relatively flat to up about 1% for the full year, while food-away-from-home inflation is projected to increase between 2.5% and 3.5%.
For the International Lead segment, while price increases vary by market, year-over-year increases for these markets average 1.5% to 2%. Next, I'd like to provide an update on the impact of Brexit and our global foreign currency outlook. As I mentioned, we don't expect Brexit to have a significant impact on our near-term commodity prices in the U.K. And as Steve noted earlier, we also haven't seen a significant change in consumer demand in the U.K. since the vote.
While the long-term impact of Brexit is uncertain, in the near term, the most significant impact on our business will be currency translation. We view our geographic diversification as a key competitive strength. For perspective, the U.K. represents about 10% of consolidated operating income, and the Eurozone collectively represents about 25%. Given recent currency fluctuations, foreign currency translation is now expected to have a more significant impact on our reported results than previously estimated. Based on current exchange rates, we project foreign currency translation to negatively impact our earnings per share by $0.02 to $0.04 in the third quarter and $0.09 to $0.11 for the full year. As always, please take our currency guidance as directional only because rates will change as we move throughout the year.
Beyond the currency impact, we continue to expect variability in quarterly results due to increased volatility in the evolving global economic and geopolitical landscape, as well as uneven prior year comparisons. 
It was just over a year ago, beginning with the announcement of our turnaround plan in May 2015, that we began reshaping our business, from our organizational structure and restaurant ownership mix to our capital structure and the strategic allocation of our resources around the world. We've taken decisive actions to pursue each of these opportunities, and we continue to make meaningful progress. 
In the past 6 quarters, we refranchised about 850 restaurants, including over 160 in the second quarter. The large majority of restaurants refranchised to date were sold to existing conventional franchisees. 
Overall, our global refranchising efforts are moving along as expected, and we're pleased with the progress we've made to date. It's important to keep in mind that due to the unique nature and scope of the refranchising activity underway, the more complex, larger refranchising transactions do take time. We remain committed to our refranchising strategy and the benefit that will be realized by moving to a more heavily franchised system for McDonald's globally.
From a G&A standpoint, we remain on track to achieve our net annual savings target of $500 million by 2018, with the vast majority of the savings expected to be realized by the end of 2017. As Steve noted, we are in the midst of transforming our organization. We expect to share more detail on the role that our organizational restructuring is playing in reaching our G&A goal as part of our third quarter earnings update.
Relative to our capital structure, 2016 represents the final year of our 3-year $30 billion cash return-to-shareholders target. During the second quarter, we repurchased $3.4 billion of stock, bringing our year-to-date share repurchases to $7.1 billion or 57 million shares. 
In May, we completed a $2.7 billion accelerated share repurchase program and also entered into a new $2.6 billion program, which accounted for a significant portion of the share repurchase activity completed during second quarter.
Through June 2016, the cumulative cash return under our 3-year target stands at $24.4 billion, and we are on track to complete the remaining amount during the back half of this year. 
We've delivered positive results over the last 4 quarters, not just from improving efficiency and working to reduce costs, but most importantly, from top line growth as we've made strides improving the customer experience. These results reinforce my confidence that we're focused on the right things. We're also making good progress on all of the actions we outlined last year. We're actively refranchising restaurants, building stronger G&A discipline and returning more cash to shareholders. The strategic changes we're making and the actions we've taken over the course of the last year are positioning us to optimize our business operations and deliver sustained, profitable growth. 
Thanks. Now I'll turn it over to Chris to begin our Q&A."

On the industry, your outperformance against the industry this quarter is very similar to last quarter, which suggests the entire industry saw a huge deceleration around 350 basis points. So what do you believe, sitting in your seat, looking at the United States, what are the 2 largest drivers of the softening in the IEO trend? And do see it continuing into the rest of the year? And secondly, on your own business, when you look at lapping All Day Breakfast in the fourth quarter, how are you thinking about the ability to sustain positive trends here as you lap that? Is extending the All Day Breakfast menu enough? Or are there more initiatives required, in your mind?"

And therefore, we are very mindful of our competitive position, the competitive gap. So it was important to us that we maintain that competitive advantage and fought for market share. We're not immune from what's happening in the outside world at all, but nor are we letting that deflect our focus on what really matters to us and our customers. I think the general sense is there's a couple of things at play. I mean, first of all, there is a widening gap between food away from home and food at home, where the commodity decreases are being passed through by the grocers. So the food at home is -- there's value to be had for families there, whereas eating out, there is a price inflation environment. So that's a small part of it. I think, generally, there's just a broader level of uncertainty in consumers' minds at the moment, both trying to gauge the -- their financial security going forward here. Whether through elections or through global events, people are slightly mindful of an unsettled world. When people are uncertain, when families are uncertain, caution starts to prevail, and they start to hold back on spend. 
And for a business like us, I mean, clearly, we generate a lot of our own business directly, but also, we do benefit from people moving around, going to the malls, driving around, going on vacations. And if people are reining in their spend across broader categories, that will have a little bit of a flow-through to us as well. 
So we are mindful of it. It just means we've got to be closer to our customers than ever and adapt to make sure that we're building compelling brands in the short term as well as the long. 
In terms of sustaining trends, well, clearly, we plan to grow our business. But at the same time, we're not trying to do that on a ""quarter to quarter to quarter"" basis. Yes, we are mindful of the short term, but we have our eye aligned on the long term. And we believe we've got a number of the right drivers in place to give us sustained, long-term growth here in the U.S. 
Our value platform is -- we continue to learn. So for a McPick 2 for $5, for example, we had our second national campaign in May, and we learned more about it in terms of the items we can have within the bundle and how we position that, all the way through to some of the early markets where we're testing out the Experience of the Future in the U.S., where we're making a significant -- an exciting rollout program in Florida and, certainly, within New York as well, which, we believe, the results there mirror what we're seeing elsewhere in our other major markets, providing a very exciting opportunity across the next few years in the U.S. as well. 
So mindful of the short term. We're going to fight for share. But also, we don't want to lose the strategic direction that we believe is right for long term."

Yes, so I -- if I were to be U.S.-specific, I mean, I referenced earlier the YouGov, like [ph] just following on brand perceptions, and we've made really encouraging progress. And I believe that's because as well as trying to drive the business in the immediate term, we've also made the investments and the commitments around food, food quality, sustainability, the employment proposition, where not only did we move pay for our hourly paid staff, but also a far broader, enhanced range of benefits, including training and education opportunities for them. 
And with a brand like McDonald's, everything you do communicates. So the better you move on every single consumer touch point, then the broader halo in the brand starts to improve. 
So we're encouraged. We've got plenty of plans to maintain our momentum, but it's nice to see it being recognized by consumers. Part of that is what comes out of the basics of running better restaurants. And we've maintained a 6% year-on-year improvement in overall customer satisfaction. When I look into the detail there, we've made the progress on the areas that the team had intended to make the progress. So we've spoken in the past about an attention to order accuracy, particularly in the drive-thru. Our accuracy has improved, the quality of the food perception has improved, friendliness has improved, all by the order of about 6%, and including speed of service as well. So I believe that day-to-day customer experience also enhances the brand and also just drives that immediate satisfaction. 
In terms of going forward, what's important? I'd say a couple of things. I mean, clearly, continuing the journey we are around food and food quality, both investing in the ingredients, the recipes and the items in the restaurants, as well as the perception and better explaining what's in our food, where it comes from and -- so that's where ""The simpler, the better"" campaign starts to focus. It chronicles the big, meaningful moves we've made and, I believe, signals the direction of travel for us going forward. And as I've said, I'm not going to disclose anything more about it, but there will be more news to come, which we know is going to be powerful in the customer agenda and very, very strong for the brand as well. 
The other element that I'm excited to introduce that we will be introducing increasingly in the U.S., because we've seen it work elsewhere in our major, mature markets, is rolling out the Experience of the Future. It's a fundamentally different experience for the customer, and a lot of that does involve technology as well as the service experience as well. So how can we take out the -- any of the interactions that customers have with their experience in McDonald's, whether it's coming into the dining area or going through the drive-thru, how can we take out the non-value-added processes and just make it a smoother, more enjoyable and easier experience for customers? So the introduction of self-order kiosks, the development of the -- of our mobile apps so they could order in ahead and just check in when you get into the restaurant, it takes out many of those human interactions where complications can arise and just makes it a smoother experience for customers. 
We are seeing a good pickup in sales as we roll this out across U.K., Canada, Australia and early days, but also in Germany as well. So we know we're onto something. We know customers respond well. And certainly, it breathes a lot of new life into our restaurants and into the brand."

As you know, long term, margins are a top line game for us. We need to grow comps in order to maintain and improve margins. But what we were able to do this quarter was effectively manage the restaurant profitability as well. So while commodity costs were more favorable this quarter, our management of what we call controllable costs, both on the food side and the labor side, was better this quarter than prior quarters. And so we're pleased that we're doing a better job of managing -- running the restaurant, but also managing the profitability of the restaurants. Going forward, we've always said that we need about a 2% to 3% comp in a normal inflationary environment. That probably hasn't changed much, and there certainly isn't anything structural that would prevent us from getting back to kind of where we were on high margins in the U.S."

I mean, the reality is the customer experience is critical in just our underlying business momentum. Speed of service has predominantly improved, largely because we've got the accuracy element of service far better. So we've enhanced the training and some of the operational procedures through the drive-thru. And you may have heard me talk about a program we called, ""ask, ask, tell,"" which is a way of really ensuring we took -- we both took and then delivered the right order day in, day out to our customers. Once you get your accuracy right, then the whole drive-thru lane just operates far smoother. 
We also made significant changes to the merchandising in the drive-thru with more tailored and focused merchandising menu boards, which, again, just made it easier for customers to order and identify the products they want, but also easier for our teams to take and get right. 
So I think that there's a lot of work that's gone on. The real devil in the detail, down to the font size on the order receipts to make sure our teams that are collecting the orders can gather the right items. 
But also there's a lot of work we're doing in the future, where we believe we can also enhance service, speed and accuracy and get technology to do some of that heavy lifting for us, so whether it's voice recognition in the drive-thru speaker post all the way through to ordering ahead via either the Internet or the app. Now we have elements of this going on around the world. I'm not sure we're going to pull them all together here in one market, but we are going to take those learnings and see how the customer responds to some of the capabilities we're introducing. And clearly, if the response is strong, we can bring that in. And that will help, again, further enhance speed of service. 
I mean, all the way to -- we have markets where we have curbside collection for our orders. So if you actually order that ahead via the Internet, you can actually just go along to curbside. And therefore, when you think about it, you've got one satisfied customer who is ordering and collecting and paying exactly how they want. That's also one fewer car going through the drive-thru so the existing drive-thru lane runs smoother.
So we're looking at this from a number of different directions. I'm definitely not underestimating the day-to-day operation improvements the teams have done so far. But also we're looking at innovation in the future to try and keep it smoother and easier for customers and just easier for our teams to get right."

I don't particularly want to talk to the monthly trends because we've got away from that. I just don't think, honestly, that's very valuable. I guess what I would say across the quarter is there wasn't really a deeply meaningful trend one way or the other. We consistently performed and we consistently outperformed the market.

Yes, absolutely. We recognize that. That doesn't come as a surprise to us. What we want to do is work hard to still have a compelling everyday value proposition in our restaurants. And that can form -- that can take the form of many things. So we've gone with the McPick 2 platform. And again, just to step back and remind why we believe this is strong, it's because it's grounded in what customers tell us is most important to them, which is choice and flexibility and not locking them into a certain price point, nor are we locking them into a certain selection of bundled items. So we believe that choice and flexibility is right for our customers and gives us flexibility and new news as we return to these programs across a year. Sometimes, they will be on a national level. If it's not national, it will be locally reinforced in the marketing windows in between. 
So we're continuing to learn. We've only been national with McPick 2 for $5 twice now. And again, the local co-ops have been working on their variations of, particularly, the McPick 2 for $2 or other value price point. So we're continuing to learn and evolve that. But is there a transaction trade-off? Yes, there is. We knew that. We planned for that, and we -- but we still believe we have an everyday value proposition. 
And again, it's not just McPick 2. I mean, there's local promotional activity in the co-ops on an ongoing basis, whether it's a $1 drink promotion, for example, all the way through to the offers we're now offering through the global mobile app. We've had 12 million downloads of that. We've got 8 million registered users on the app. And clearly, the offers and the frequency card on there are driving a lot of the interaction. 
In terms of quarter 4. Clearly, we know the, if you like, the core key [ph] cycles we're on. We believe the enhancement to All Day Breakfast will help reinforce the baseline momentum, as does running a better restaurant, as does reinforcing value. The team is certainly working on other activities. There is nothing in particular to share today. But I would say that we are playing the long game here. So we're not going to manage the business -- we're mindful of the quarters, but we're not going to manage it by quarter. We believe we're getting the right fundamental foundations and platforms in place to reinforce the long-term success and profitability of McDonald's. And we have consciously expanded our business plans and our activity away from just a product and price-led program, which we had been somewhat drawn to in the past. And we believe that the brand-enhancing, long-term perspective, as long as we're winning the short-term market share fight, is a good combination for us."

Even more encouraging is in the nearing competition, the QSR market share, where we have made some substantial gains in U.K., Australia, China and Canada. And I think as part of the turnaround, we have really focused on making sure that we win in the most immediate competitive set we are. This is part of the modern progressive burger company ambition, which is make sure we're strong and dominant in our immediate sector. And then we start to take IEO share as we broaden the experience. I believe the Experience of the Future will have us fight increasingly in a -- into an increasingly stronger position in the broader IEO. In the immediate term, it was getting the basics of the business right so we win QSR market share. And I've shared over a number of these calls and meetings we've had about some of the successes in Australia and Canada, for instance. But the customer experience is noticeably different than it was 3 to 4 years ago, both from the designs of the restaurant, the introduction of technology, the substantially enhanced front-of-house hospitality that we now offer, all the way through to providing more options to customize your food via self-order kiosks, for example, in the dining areas. And now we're extending that to table service. So this is -- if a customer is to walk in now versus 2, 3, 4 years ago, it would be a noticeably different experience.

We would expect similar -- that we would also be able to improve operating margins going forward based on the activity. As you indicate, we're certainly not going to throw a number out there.

Let me talk about the whole DL versus -- Developmental Licensee versus conventional. So as we talked about last year, we effectively took a restaurant-by-restaurant and market-by-market approach to look at kind of the best way of franchising in our mind. And what you'll see is, and generally, in our major significant mature markets, that's the U.S. and International Lead markets, you'll see more of a conventional franchising, which is what we do in the U.S. So you would have seen some more conventional franchising, certainly in this quarter, and there will likely be further franchising like that. 
In countries, certainly in certain parts of Asia and Europe, where either it's a little bit more volatile from an economic and political standpoint and/or a partner can help us accelerate growth and grow faster than maybe we're willing to put in capital right now, those situations you will likely see us using that developmental license model that we've used successfully for many years in a lot of the countries. All of the transactions that we have planned right now were taken into consideration when we came up with that $500 million of G&A reduction. So the $500 million contemplated all of the transactions that we have kind of in our plans at this point. So none of those activities will, in and of themselves, drive further G&A reduction. That doesn't mean that we're not going to continue to look for efficiencies and run the business in a disciplined manner. But you shouldn't expect that because we completed a franchising transaction or anything along those lines that, that would trigger automatically a further or additional G&A cut in addition to the $500 million."

I want to reemphasize our focus on putting the customer at the center of everything we're doing, from the food we cook, to the conveniences we offer, to the service we provide. 
That mindset ignited our turnaround last year and continues to guide our decision-making. We're moving in the right direction with 4 quarters of growth, with growth across all 4 segments in each quarter. But there is more work to do. And that's precisely why we remain committed to executing our turnaround plan through the end of the year. 
I'm encouraged by the way we're creating a better McDonald's and excited about the opportunities ahead. And I'm confident we will continue to aggressively take actions to strengthen our business and reassert our leadership position as the modern progressive burger company in the global IEO industry. Thanks to all of you, and have a great day."
