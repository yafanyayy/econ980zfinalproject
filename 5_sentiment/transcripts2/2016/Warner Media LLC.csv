Thanks, everyone, for listening in this morning. We had another strong year in 2015. Our revenues increased 3% to $28.1 billion, adjusted operating income grew 19% to $6.9 billion and adjusted earnings per share grew 14% to $4.75 a share.",2105,"Thanks, Mike. Thanks, everyone, for listening in this morning. 
We had another strong year in 2015. Our revenues increased 3% to $28.1 billion, adjusted operating income grew 19% to $6.9 billion and adjusted earnings per share grew 14% to $4.75 a share. That's our seventh consecutive year of double-digit growth in adjusted EPS, and we've outpaced all of our peers over that time. 
We also returned close to $5 billion to shareholders in share repurchases in dividends and our updated $5 billion share repurchase authorization and our 15% increase in the dividend, underscore our commitment to disciplined capital allocation and continue direct returns to shareholders. It's the same combination of strong execution, continued investment in our businesses and disciplined capital allocation that has allowed us to provide superior long-term returns to shareholders. 
As we discussed with you last quarter, the shift to on-demand multiplatform consumption of video content is accelerating. Consumers increasingly have a greater control over where, when and on what device they launch their favorite content. And they're responding by spending more time and money watching video than ever. 
With more options available, they are also demanding great content via company by a great viewing experience. 
While these shifts present challenges, they also create enormous opportunities. In this environment, we're convinced that the strongest class, biggest network and the best content will take share. Our strategy was designed with these shifts in mind, and we're more confident than ever that we are ideally positioned to benefit. 
For years, we've been investing in the very best video content and using technology to enhance the value of our brands. With our revenue growth that will accelerate this year, we'll be investing more aggressively, not only in content but also in new capabilities of digital products to ensure our brand and content are available wherever and however consumers look for them. And that we can monetize them effectively when they do. 
At the same time, we'll continue to take our brands around the world and operate it as efficiently as possible to help fund investments and future growth. 
Our structure supports this strategy. We've deliberately reshaped the company to focus on high-quality video businesses with global scale and are well positioned to capitalize on the growing demand for the very best video content. 
The combined scale of our businesses is critical to our ability to take advantage of that growth, and it's particularly important in distribution and programming, the core of what we do as a company. 
The benefits of our strategy and the advantages of our scale and structure were evident in our many successes in 2015. 
Let me share a few highlights starting at our networks, which continue to lead the industry. Turner was the only programming group with 3 of the top 10 ad-supported cable networks in primetime among adults 18-49 and TBS finished as the #1 entertainment cable network in that demo for the third consecutive year. 
Our operating momentum was strong at CNN and Cartoon Network. In 2015, CNN was the fastest-growing top 40 cable network in the U.S. in its key demo and Cartoon Network was the only top 3 kids networks to grow ratings. 
And then when it comes to premium content, HBO remains peerless. Its 43 primetime Emmy Awards not only led all networks for the 14th consecutive year, but was also the most Emmys received in a single year by any network in at least 25 years. That included 12 for Game of Thrones setting a record for any series in one year. 
We demonstrated the combined strength of our brands and the scale of our networks in affiliate negotiations during 2015. Last spring, for example, Turner and HBO worked together to renew their agreements with DISH and late in the year, Turner completed the deal with one of its largest distributors and now has all of its top 10 affiliates on new rate par that will drive accelerating revenue growth starting in 2016. 
While strengthening its place inside the multi-channel ecosystem, Turner has been expanding its presence outside, with 2 of our biggest digital properties, CNN Digital and Bleacher Report, growing revenue over 25% of a combined basis. 
CNN Digital remain the top position in news for multiplatform views and Bleacher Report, again, finished the year as the #2 digital sports destination in the U.S. 
HBO also accelerated its efforts outside the ecosystem with the pioneering launch of HBO NOW last April. HBO NOW was a significant contributor to HBO's 2.7 million domestic subscriber additions last year, capping its best 2-year period of subscriber additions in the past 30 years. 
Just as importantly, HBO continue to have positive momentum with its traditional distributors. 
Outside the U.S., HBO Latin America introduced a standalone OTT product in Colombia, followed recently by Mexico, expanding the international reach of our streaming products. 
We also expanded high return low risk licensing agreements in Canada and certain European territories as we continue to execute a multimodal international distribution strategy that we think best monetize our great content. 
At Warner Bros, we had a record year, both revenue and process, driven by growth in its television business and the best-ever year in video games. 
While our overall theatrical performance was not a strong as in other years, we're really proud of our 2 Oscar-nominated films, Mad Max: Fury Road and Creed. 
In television, we were the leading supplier to broadcast again, and we had the top new broadcast show in Blindspot, the top reality program with The Voice and the top comedy in the Big Bang Theory. 
And Warner Bros. ended the year as a top 3 video game publisher in the U.S. and Europe on the strength of Mortal Kombat X, Batman: Arkham Knight and the successful introduction of a new franchise in LEGO Dimensions. 
Warner also continue to build its international business. To topping to this significant growth opportunity we see in China specifically, last year, Warner entered into an exciting new venture to produce local language films. Our confidence in the China opportunity were reinforced by the success of Hollywood VIP, and SVOD partnership between Warner and Tencent. Hollywood VIP added more than 5 million new subscribers in 2015, helped by its exclusive access to Warner Bros. movies and HBO's original programming. 
So 2015 was another very successful year on multiple fronts, and thanks to the investments we've been making, we're poised for an ever been better year in 2016 as we roll out richer, more engaging content lineups across the company and accelerated the pace of investment and innovation. 
At HBO, that includes increasingly hours of original programming by 50% globally. We'll have an unmatched lineup of returning shows, including Game of Thrones, Silicon Valley, John Oliver, Followers, and Veep as well as some of our oldest new programming in years, including Vital from Martin Scorsese and Mick Jagger, which will debut this Sunday, Last World from J.J. Abrams and produced by Warners and Divorce with Sarah Jessica Parker. 
We also have an ambitious roster of new programming geared to the now audience, including shows from Jon Stewart, Bill Simmons, Sesame Street and a daily VICE News cast. 
As we introduce all this new content and further expand distribution, we're going to step up our marketing of HBO NOW. We think the combination of an even stronger original programming lineup, the best selection of hit Hollywood movies and ever improving digital products will drive continued subscriber growth both at HBO NOW and with our traditional distributors. 
As we renegotiate some of our more important affiliate agreements over the next couple of years, we expect to better monetize those subscribers and accelerate subscription revenue growth at HBO. 
We'll continue to expand HBO streaming products internationally as well. We anticipate significantly expanding our OTT footprint in Latin America and recently, we announced plans to launch a standalone streaming product in Spain later this year. 
We're equally excited about everything that Turner has in-store for 2016. It's going to be a historic year for Turner Sports, which will broadcast the NCAA men's basketball finals for the first time, and we're rolling out Turner's new East sports league in partnership with WME | IMG. 
And as we head into the home stretch of the revoting 2016 presidential election race, CNN will continue to be the place to find authoritative political coverage and analysis. 
In kids, cartoon will look to build on its momentum from last year, and we're excited about boomerangs content refresh and global expansion, which is the centerpiece of the kids partnership between Warner and Turner. 
This year, we'll also start to refresh of TBS and TNT. TBS recently kicked off its new line up with the launches of Angie Tribeca and Full Frontal with Samantha Bee. They're already changing perceptions what to expect from a network and there's a lot more to come. 
TNT will start its own refresh later this year with projects such as Animal Kingdom from producer John Wells and Warner Bros.; Good Behavior and the aliens joining its existing lineup of leading originals. 
While it will take some time to fully refresh their lineups, we're already seeing evidence of a full new voice from both network. 
These changes at TBS and TNT are just the latest steps in a multi-year transformation at Turner. Over the last several years, we put in place new management teams at Cartoon Network, CNN, truTV and Turner's international portfolio and the results give us a lot of confidence in our ability to further strengthen TBS and TNT in the years ahead. 
In 2015, CNN and Cartoon significantly outpaced the their peers and 1 year after its rebrand, truTV's ratings and its key demos returned to growth from the fourth quarter. 
And excluding the impact of FX, Turner's international networks have grown profits over 60% since 2013. 
2016 is also set to be a blockbuster year at Warner Bros. We're expecting another record performance this time led by that theatrical business. Batman vs Superman, Dawn of Justice, arrived in theaters on March 25, and it's one of the most anticipated films of this or any year. More than just the clash between the 2 iconic superhero, we will mark the beginning of a multi-year slate of franchise films at Warner's. DC. will be a significant part of that slate, including Suicide Squad this August and Wonder Woman and the first Justice League movie in 2017. 
Cartoon Network is also launching a new Justice League TV show, which will join Teen Titans Go, another DC-based program from Warner Bros. and the #1 show on Cartoon Network. That underscores both DC's success in television, it has 8 shows on air this season. And the deepening integration between Warner's and Turner kids business. 
The strength of our theatrical slates extends far beyond our DC titles. We're just as excited about fantastic and where to find them. The magical return to J.K. Rowling's World of Harry Potter set for release this November, and we're already looking forward to the return of our LEGO franchise in 2017 with LEGO Batman and Ninja. As those titles migrate into premium and broadcast windows, we'll also benefit from them on HBO and Turner's networks. 
While it's still early in the development season, we're very confident about the prospects of Warner Bros. TV in the upcoming TV season. We're expanding and diversifying our slate of programming, working to extend our leadership position in broadcast to basic cable, premium cable and OTT services. That include some of HBO's and Turner's biggest new shows that I noted before as well as original programming for SVOD services like 112263 for Hulu and Fuller House from Netflix. 
Putting all these together, I hope you can appreciate why we expect 2016 to be a standout year for Time Warner. We expect the investments we've made in recent years to drive an acceleration in revenue growth. Along with continued cost discipline that will allow us to invest aggressively in the business, while delivering very attractive financial results. All that's reflected in the outlook we released this morning. 
We're just as confident about our long-term prospects. As I noted earlier, the shift to on-demand consumption is accelerating, and we're stepping up our pace of innovation investment to match it. 
Because of our industry-leading brands and scale, we're in a great position to take advantage of the many opportunities these shifts are creating. And we have clear momentum across the company. So we fully expect to continue delivering industry-leading financial results and shareholder returns for many years to come. 
Thanks for listening in. I'll turn it over to Howard."
24689,322502383,930291,"Time Warner Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 10, 2016",2016-02-10,"Earnings Calls","Warner Media, LLC","Executives","Thanks, Jeff, and good morning. I'll begin by referring to the first slide of our presentation, which is now available on our website. As you'll recall, 2014's results were affected by significant restructuring and severance charges cost the company and",2703,"Thanks, Jeff, and good morning. I'll begin by referring to the first slide of our presentation, which is now available on our website. 
As you'll recall, 2014's results were affected by significant restructuring and severance charges cost the company and programming charges at Turner. Given the nature and size of these items, my comments today related expenses, margins and adjusted operating income for the fourth quarter and full year will exclude these charges from all periods. 
Starting with consolidated results. For the year, revenues grew 3% or 7%, excluding the drag of almost 400 basis points from FX. 
Adjusted operating income increased 6% or a very healthy 13%, absent a more than 700 basis point currency headwind and that came despite a decline in the fourth quarter, primarily due to the timing of programming expenses at Turner, programming charges at HBO and difficult comparisons at Warner. 
As a result of the restructuring actions we took and ongoing efficiency measures, we limited total expense growth to 2% and increased margins close to 100 basis points. 
When we took those actions, we set a goal of $500 million in cost savings. We recognized the majority of those savings this year and expect to surpass our initial target in 2016. Those savings help fund nearly $12 billion in content investment across the company. So we were able to drive margin expansion, while still investing aggressively in the business. 
Moving down the income statement. Adjusted EPS of $4.75 exceeded our outlook for the year. And when excluding an FX drag of $0.50, adjusted EPS growth was a very strong 27%. 
In addition to its strong operating performance, we also benefited from our share repurchase program. 
In 2015, we repurchased $3.6 billion of our shares, so combined with $1.2 billion in dividends, we returned $4.8 billion to shareholders during the year. So we had another really good year in 2015. That was a result of the same combination of top tier operating performance, relentless focus on efficiency, most investments and disciplined capital allocation that's allowed us to provide our shareholders with long-term returns well above our peer group average.  And that's the combination we will continue to strive for in 2016 when we anticipate another year of target growth. 
That's reflected in our 2016 outlook for adjusted EPS of $5.30 to $5.40, achieving current rates, including approximately $0.15 year-over-year headwind from FX. 
Absent additional FX headwind, our outlook would imply mid- to high teens growth in adjusted EPS. I'll provide additional context around our outlook as we go through the presentation. 
Now turning to the segment highlights. I'll start at Turner, where we grew adjusted operating income double digits in 2015 even in the face of significant FX headwind and while we continue to invest in the transformation Jeff discussed. 
Advertising revenues increased 2% for the year and 5% in the quarter, that was ahead of our expectations for the quarter due to the strong domestic add market and improved ratings trends. 
Domestic advertising grew high single digits in the quarter, that was boosted by particularly strong results in news and kids, record ratings for our MLB playoff games, the comparison for last year's dispute of DISH and the airing of 3 additional Major League Baseball play off games. 
International advertising grew low double digits in the quarter, excluding on over 18 percentage points drag from FX and the benefit from the consolidation of our sports network in Brazil. 
Looking ahead to the first quarter. We're seeing a continuation of the recent positive trend. So we expect total advertising revenue to be up in the mid-single digits despite continued FX headwinds and with scattered pricing pacing up double digits versus the up front, historically low cancelations levels and great momentum at many of our brands, every indication points to a very strong up front this year. 
Moving on. Subscription revenues were up 1% for the year, but looking through the impact of foreign currency, would have increased 5%. In the fourth quarter, domestic subscription revenues grew in the mid-single digits, which included the benefit from the comp against the dispute with DISH last year and absent a greater than 20 percentage points drag from FX, international subscription revenue grew in the low single digits. A slow down internationally was due in part to the timing of revenues related to a contract renewal. 
Looking to 2016, we've now achieved the rate increases we were targeting with all of our top 10 domestic distributors. So we continue to expect domestic subscription revenue growth to accelerate into the low teens starting in the first quarter. 
We also anticipate attractive local currency growth at our international networks and at current rates, FX headwinds would prevent a return to our reported growth in until the latter parts of the year. 
Adjusted operating income was up 11% for the year. As we anticipated, that included a fourth quarter declined due to 13% programming cost growth, which was manually result the higher MLB expenses and the timing of original programming. 
For the year, total expenses declined 3% and margins expanded over 300 basis points to the highest level in Turner's history. That reflected continued tight cost control and of the benefit of the restructuring we undertook in 2014. 
Putting that all together, Turner delivered very strong growth in adjusted operating income, while making progress on the multi-year transformation of our core networks. We took share in both news and kids and started the hard work of rebranding our entertainment networks. And with the investments we've made across the business, we laid the groundwork for continued attractive growth in the years to come. 
Turning now to HBO where we had another year of strong subscriber growth, while continuing to make the investments necessary to go after the significant global opportunity we see for the business. 
Subscription revenues were up 3% for the quarter and 4% for the year. Both periods included about 100 basis points headwind from the combination of foreign exchange and the transfer of HBO's basic cable service in India to Turner. The rest of subscription revenue increase in the mid-single digits for both the quarter and the year. We continue to see very strong growth in our subscriber base, our subscriber mix remained at constraint on revenue growth. 
At the same time, we're pleased with the early progress we're making at HBO NOW whose contribution to subscription revenue increased sequentially throughout the year. 
As we move into 2016, we expect the revenue contributions from HBO NOW to increase further as we roll out new programming and expand distribution, allowing us to invest even more aggressively in marketing the product. And later in the year, we expect to begin renewing some of our affiliate deal, which should result in improved monetization of our subscriber base. 
Moving to content and other revenue, which grew 20% in the quarter and 6% for the year. That's mainly due to higher international licensing revenues and indicative of the strong demand we're seeing globally for HBO's premium content. 
Across HBO's international networks, including unconsolidated JVs, revenues increased high single digits for the quarter and year when excluding the impact of FX and transfer of the basic service in India. And subscriber growth remains strong especially in Latin America and Europe. 
Adjusted operating income was down 3% in the quarter but up 1% for the year. Decline in the fourth quarter was mainly due to higher programming expenses, which increased 11%. That growth included programming charges primarily related to series in development that HBO decided not to move forward with. Looking through discharges, programming cost would have grown 1% in the quarter. 
For the full year, total expenses increased 5%, reflecting investments in technology and marketing related to the launch of HBO NOW as well as higher programming costs. 
So 2015 was another successful year for HBO as we maintain the subscriber momentum we had the past few years and another year profit growth and continue to execute our key strategic initiatives, including the launch of standalone streaming products in the U.S. and Latin America.  Giving us strength of the global demand for our product and our programming slate, we remain very confident in HBO's ability to accelerate its growth over the next several years. 
Moving on to Warner Bros. Despite the dip in the fourth quarter, we finished the year with record revenues and profits led by our TV and games businesses. We achieved that even with the material drag from FX. 
On the TV side, revenues increased modestly in the quarter due largely to international growth. And for the year, TV revenue grew double digits. That was primarily due to significant growth in licensing revenue, including the domestic licensing of 2 Broke Girls, Big Bang Theory, Person of Interest, Seinfeld and Friends. 
We also continue to see increasing demand and strong pricing around the globe for Warner's hit content. So we remain encouraged by the strong secular trends in the TV business. 
Turning to video games, where we had difficult comparisons in the quarter against LEGO Batman 3 and Middle Earth, Shadow of Mordor. Even so, we approached a record of the year games revenue up close to $1.5 billion for the year. And with the great IP and strong franchises at Warner's, we're confident we can continue to grow our games business over time. 
Theatrically, we knew 2015 would be a challenging year given the lack of any core franchise releases and the comparison against the end of The Hobbit trilogy as well as the releases of the LEGO movie and Godzilla. So as expected, revenues declined for both the quarter and the year. 
Looking ahead, 2016 will mark the beginning of an ambitious slate of franchise movies, including at least 17 releases from our DC, LEGO and World of Harry Potter franchises through 2020. So we feel great about the outlook for our theatrical business in 2016 and beyond. 
Across theatrical and TV, home entertainment revenues declined 10% for the year due to continued weakness in physical sales, in particular, catalog releases and lower carryover revenue. However, digital remains healthy with DST growing in high teens for Warner's. 
On the expense side and in line with enterprise-wide focus on cost efficiency, Warner's reduced SG&A by 2% for the year, and that includes a significant savings from the 2014 restructuring actions. 
So on the whole, Warner's had a terrific year and with the momentum at our TV and Games businesses and ambitious franchise film slate set for the next several years, we're in great position to drive attractive growth at Warner's for the foreseeable future. 
Turning to the next slide. We generated very healthy pay cash of $3.6 billion in 2015, converting over 90% of our earnings into cash. The year-over-year increase was due to the growth in adjusted operating income and lower cash taxes. And that was despite the increase in working capital as a result of increased content investments across divisions and severance payments related to the restructuring initiatives in 2014. Our cash taxes declined, primarily due to the timing of tax legislation and the related payments. 
Looking to 2016, we expect another year of solid growth and free cash flow, driven by strong profit growth and continued high conversion. 
Now looking at our balance sheet. We ended 2015 with $21.6 billion of net debt, up $1.8 billion from the end of 2014. That's primarily a result of our continued commitment to direct returns to shareholders. 
During 2015, we repurchased $3.6 billion in shares and combined with our dividend, returned $4.8 billion to shareholders. And as Jeff noted earlier, the Board authorized a 15% increase in our dividend and up to $5 billion in share repurchases, reinforcing our commitment to provide direct returns to shareholders. 
During the year, we took advantage of favorable market conditions to strengthen our balance sheet by issuing $3.8 billion of long-term debt, including our first euro-denominated debt offering. We also extended the maturity of our revolving bank credit facilities through the end of 2020. 
Meanwhile, we retired $2 billion of debt in the year as a result of the maturity and a tender offer and redemption of higher price debt. 
And on the investment front, we spent close to $700 million, about half of which is related to our real estate project at Hudson Yards.  We expect to invest a similar amount in that project in 2016. 
We ended the year with a net leverage ratio at approximately 2.85x, just above our target level. 
Looking forward, we plan to return to our target leverage ratio of 2.75x over the next few quarters, and we don't anticipate a change in either that target level or our capital allocation philosophy, which will remain focused on investments back into our businesses, targeted M&A and consistent direct returns to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. 
With that, let's move on to the final slide, which looks at our outlook for 2016. 2016 marks the start of what we anticipate will be a strong content cycle across the company, and that's to translate into acceleration in revenue and adjusted operating income growth and another year of strong growth in adjusted EPS. 
At Turner, we expect another strong year to take advantage of faster revenue growth and continued cost efficiencies to increase investments for the future. 
As I mentioned earlier, subscription revenue growth should accelerate meaningfully and advertising revenue should benefit from a strong ad market, continued momentum at CNN, including from a selection coverage and airing the NCAA championship game for the same time. 
At the same time, we're planning for higher programming and marketing expenses tied primarily to the NCAA championship game and the start of our NBA deal in 4Q as well as election coverage at CNN and investments in originals related to the brand repositioning at both TBS and TNT. 
We remain focused on continuing to efficiently manage overhead expenses to help fund these initiatives. 
At HBO, we also expect faster growth in subscription revenue in 2016, driven by continued subscriber gains, including from HBO NOW and improved monetization of our subscriber base. 
Over the next couple of years, we would expect that to take HBO's subscription revenue growth into the high single digits. That will be balanced against investments associated with HBO's slate of new originals as well as new programming targeted for digital platforms. 
We will also continue to invest in marketing and technology to drive growth on HBO digital platform. 
At Warner Bros., we'll kick off our slate of franchise films with the release of Batman vs Superman, Suicide Squad and the first J.K. Rowling's Fantastic Beast films. And while we're facing challenging comparisons licensing video games, we expect both businesses to continue to deliver healthy results. 
In addition, we remain focused on driving margin expansion through efficiency measures and a transition to digital. So all in all, we expect very strong growth and another record year at Warner. 
So looking across all 3 segments, we are set up  for a very good year from an operating perspective. That's despite an estimated year-over-year FX drag of approximately $125 million on adjusted operating income and approximately $0.15 on adjusted EPS, which we have factored into our outlook. 
And if we look back relative to the expectations we shared with you at our Investor Day, the FX drag on adjusted EPS in 2016 is in the range of $0.55 to $0.60. 
Absent that, we will be on track for the close to $6 in adjusted EPS we shared with you then. 
In terms of the cadence for the year, we expect our earnings to be weighted towards the back half as a result of the timing of both our film slate and the marketing investments at HBO and Turner. 
Putting all that together, we expect another very good year in 2016, which is reflected in our outlook for adjusted EPS of $5.30 to $5.40, and that incorporates continued investments in high-quality video content and new business model for capabilities that should position the company to continue to drive very attractive growth for the next several years and beyond. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Mike to start the Q&A."

HBO NOW, where we're just getting started, I think we've made a lot of progress. We are not yet out on 2 major platforms, PlayStation and Xbox, which, for example, in HBO GO account for over 20% of viewing, and we've not yet put out the content like Jon Stewart, Bill Simmons, Vice Daily new show that we think is particularly suited for those platforms, and that, of course, will catalyze a great deal of marketing digitally and otherwise, which we think will drive subscription. So we're very excited about where we are. And it's important to punctuate that of the 2.7 million, those are full paying subscribers. Our job now is to go as the deal renewal cycles open up at the end of this year and into the next 18 months to go capture that revenue, and we intend to do that."

So in terms of programming impairments, at Turner, we have about $130 million in the fourth quarter, and that was tied to that TBS and TNT transition, which has now started at TBS, and we've rolled out some new shows and we're  pretty pleased so far with where that's going. There's another $50 million-or-so of charges at HBO and that was tied to some series that we decided not to move forward with which happens occasionally. So in the quarter, it was about $180 million of charges. As far as the taxes and the buyback. I would say the tax rate in '16 will actually go up versus '15. That's in part because we saw some fourth quarter benefits to lower the rate overall for '15. So I think if you look forward, you should see a tax rate that might be a couple of hundred basis points, more in line with what we had in the first 3 quarters of 2015. In terms of buybacks, as always, that's going to depend on what our cash flow generation is and what other alternative uses of capital are. But given that we ended the year at about 2.85x, which was above our target leverage of 2.75x, I would expect that the buyback would come down a bit versus 2015 levels."

We're audiological about syndication with windows. That's depend on evolution and a lot of factors. But I think the overriding point out of focus on is that it's becoming crystal clear that consumers want the ability to watch their favorite show, their favorite network OnDemand across whatever platform they are watching, whatever window it is, whether it's a new show currencies and whether it's 1- or 2-year old show, they want to see it OnDemand. We want to make sure our networks have the flexibility to meet that consumer demand. Now if you look at HBO, perfect example, HBO has, for many years, provided on-demand access to almost all the content multiple seasons that it's ever produced. Some of the new entrance in the business that have VOD as the primary feature have also put multiple seasons on. The Turner networks are committed to delivering more programming on-demand across their distribution channels, that's whether you get it on the new bundle, over-the-top, whether you get it through a traditional distributor. And Warner already sells broad suites of rights when partners are interested in that. And of course, Warner sells to every kind of network, broadcast, premium, cable, over-the-top subscription VOD services. So the overriding development, which is a good development is that consumers want VOD on whatever show window they're watching. And we're basically moving to satisfy consumer demand. Now your second question, which is what has to happen and not just in our company and I think we've been pretty clear about what he said is that distributors need to be able to offer more on-demand functionality. We see them moving quite rapidly now to do that. You can look at interfaces and on-demand offerings at Comcast, you can see new bundles and moves at Verizon or Swing. And I think Sony has a new product. I think you're going to see ever-increasing innovation across the distribution platforms over the top and in traditional distribution package offerings. So this consumer demand is going to be satisfied, and it's basically going to be good for any brand, and a network or any show that has a strong consumer resonance, and that's why we think that it's very good for our very concentrated suite of networks at Turner and HBO, and we think it's very good for the world's leading producer of TV shows and films, which is Warner Bros. He had one more question."

That's why HBO OnDemand more than a decade ago and now they have now. And so what we've been doing if you go beyond those 2 pretty obvious examples is we've been building more digital businesses now straight to mobile. So let's look at them. There's CNN, which is the leader in mobile news, and you're seeing very strong growth in CNN in all-digital platforms but certainly, in mobile. And domestically and internationally, by the way. You have the launch of Great Big Story, that's already with 170 million video usage in the first few months. Bleacher Report, #2 online sports destination in the country has a very strong mobile price that's given the nature of that programming, particularly where the team's stream that. Super Deluxe, which is the new launch of Turner digital studio that makes a short form video that is very weighted to mobile is yet another one.

And listen, our distributors are selling HBO in a variety of different ways. I've dined with one of our major distributors the other night, we talked about our growth opportunities, part of that conversation was HBO NOW, and they were very excited by it. So I reject the notion that our major distributors out of band don't want to bundle HBO NOW. I don't think that's true. And as our deals come up for renewal, I think we'll see different kinds of packaging. But listen, if they want to sell HBO through skinny bundles, fantastic. If they want to sell HBO through triple place, fantastic. And I think it's very important to remember that in the last 4 years, we've grown 8 million subscribers over the 44-year and just in the United States, in the 44-year history of our company, that's 20% of our sub growth. What that tells you is, as I've said before, nobody's doing us any favors selling HBO. They're growing their own businesses by using our brand to grow their different companies. So I think this is a win-win and whether they want marketing bundle now or whether they want to do skinny bundles or basic packages or triple plays, there's growth opportunities for them and growth opportunities for us.

So we're looking ahead, and we think all indicators would seem to suggest that this year's upfront is going to be particularly strong. And I think that's going to reverse what's been a couple of years of being not so strong. So I think there is a recognition that TV is still the best reach medium and the most effective option for brand advertisers to convey their message.

This morning, we issued 2 press releases, one detailing our results for the fourth quarter and full year, and the other providing our 2016 full year business outlook. 
Before we begin, there are 2 items I need to cover. First, we refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Schedules setting out reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our earnings release and trending schedules. These reconciliations are available on our website at www.timewarner.com/investors. Reconciliations of our expected future financial performance are also included in the business outlook release that is available on our website. 
Second, today's announcement includes certain forward-looking statements, which are based on management's current expectations. Actual results may vary materially from those expressed or implied by these statements due to various factors. These factors are discussed in detail in Time Warner's SEC filings, including its most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. Time Warner is under no obligation and, in fact, expressly disclaims any obligation to update or alter its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. 
I'll now turn the call over to Jeff Bewkes, Time Warner's Chairman and CEO, who will be followed by Howard Averill, Time Warner's CFO. After their prepared remarks, our divisional CEOs, John Martin, Richard Plepler and Kevin Tsujihara, will join us for our Q&A session. Jeff?"

Thanks, everyone, for listening in this morning. We had another strong year in 2015. Our revenues increased 3% to $28.1 billion, adjusted operating income grew 19% to $6.9 billion and adjusted earnings per share grew 14% to $4.75 a share.",2105,"Thanks, Mike. Thanks, everyone, for listening in this morning. 
We had another strong year in 2015. Our revenues increased 3% to $28.1 billion, adjusted operating income grew 19% to $6.9 billion and adjusted earnings per share grew 14% to $4.75 a share. That's our seventh consecutive year of double-digit growth in adjusted EPS, and we've outpaced all of our peers over that time. 
We also returned close to $5 billion to shareholders in share repurchases and dividends, and our updated $5 billion share repurchase authorization and our 15% increase in the dividend underscore our commitment to disciplined capital allocation and continued direct returns to shareholders. It's the same combination of strong execution, continued investment in our businesses and disciplined capital allocation that's allowed us to provide superior long-term returns to shareholders. 
As we discussed with you last quarter, the shift to on-demand multiplatform consumption of video content is accelerating. Consumers increasingly have greater control over where, when and on what device they watch their favorite content. And they're responding by spending more time and money watching video than ever. With more options available, they are also demanding great content be accompanied by a great viewing experience. 
And while these shifts present challenges, they also create enormous opportunities. In this environment, we're convinced that the strongest brands, biggest networks and the best content will take share. Our strategy was designed with these shifts in mind, and we're more confident than ever that we are ideally positioned to benefit. 
For years, we've been investing in the very best video content and using technology to enhance the value of our brands. With our revenue growth set to accelerate this year, we'll be investing more aggressively not only in content but also in new capabilities and digital product to ensure our brands and content are available wherever and however consumers look for them and that we can monetize them effectively when they do. At the same time, we'll continue to take our brands around the world and operate as efficiently as possible to help fund investments in future growth. 
Our structure supports this strategy. We've deliberately reshaped the company to focus on high-quality video businesses with global scale and are well positioned to capitalize on the growing demand for the very best video content. 
The combined scale of our businesses is critical to our ability to take advantage of that growth, and it's particularly important in distribution and programming, the core of what we do as a company. 
The benefits of our strategy and the advantages of our scale and structure were evident in our many successes in 2015. 
Let me share a few highlights, starting at our networks, which continue to lead the industry. Turner was the only programming group with 3 of the top 10 ad-supported cable networks in primetime among adults 18-49, and TBS finished as the #1 entertainment cable network in that demo for the third consecutive year. Our operating momentum was strongest at CNN and Cartoon Network. In 2015, CNN was the fastest-growing top 40 cable network in the U.S. in its key demo, and Cartoon Network was the only top 3 kid's network to grow ratings. 
And then when it comes to premium content, HBO remained peerless. Its 43 primetime Emmy Awards not only led all networks for the 14th consecutive year, but was also the most Emmys received in a single year by any network in at least 25 years. That included 12 for Game of Thrones, setting a record for any series in one year. 
We demonstrated the combined strength of our brands and the scale of our networks in affiliate negotiations during 2015. Last spring, for example, Turner and HBO worked together to renew their agreements with DISH. And late in the year, Turner completed a deal with one of its largest distributors and now has all of its top 10 affiliates on a new rate car that will drive accelerating revenue growth starting in 2016. 
While strengthening its place inside the multichannel ecosystem, Turner has been expanding its presence outside it, with 2 of our biggest digital properties, CNN Digital and Bleacher Report, growing revenue over 25% on a combined basis. CNN Digital remained at the top position in news for multiplatform views and Bleacher Report again finished the year as the #2 digital sports destination in the U.S. 
HBO also accelerated its efforts outside the ecosystem with the pioneering launch of HBO NOW last April. HBO NOW was a significant contributor to HBO's 2.7 million domestic subscriber additions last year, capping its best 2-year period of subscriber additions in the past 30 years. 
Just as importantly, HBO continued to have positive momentum with its traditional distributors. 
Outside the U.S., HBO Latin America introduced a standalone OTT product in Colombia, followed recently by Mexico, expanding the international reach of our streaming products. 
We also extended high-return, low-risk licensing agreements in Canada and certain European territories as we continue to execute the multimodal international distribution strategy that we think best monetizes our great content. 
At Warner Bros, we had a record year in both revenue and process, driven by growth in its television business and a best-ever year in video games. While our overall theatrical performance was not a strong as in other years, we're really proud of our 2 Oscar-nominated films, Mad Max: Fury Road and Creed. 
In television, we were the leading supplier to broadcast again, and we had the top new broadcast show in Blindspot, the top reality program with The Voice and the top comedy in the Big Bang Theory. 
And Warner Bros. ended the year as a top 3 video game publisher in the U.S. and Europe on the strength of Mortal Kombat X, Batman: Arkham Knight and the successful introduction of a new franchise in LEGO Dimensions. 
Warner's also continued to build its international business. To tapping to this significant growth opportunity we see in China specifically, last year, Warner's entered into an exciting new venture to produce local language films. Our confidence in the China opportunity has been reinforced by the success of Hollywood VIP, an SVOD partnership between Warner's and Tencent. Hollywood VIP added more than 5 million new subscribers in 2015, helped by its exclusive access to Warner Bros. movies and HBO's original programming. 
So 2015 was another very successful year on multiple fronts, and thanks to the investments we've been making, we're poised for an ever better year in 2016 as we roll out richer, more engaging content lineups across the company and accelerate the pace of investment and innovation. 
At HBO, that includes increasing the hours of original programming by 50% globally. We'll have an unmatched lineup of returning shows, including Game of Thrones, Silicon Valley, John Oliver, Ballers and Veep, as well as some of our boldest new programming in years, including Vinyl from Martin Scorsese and Mick Jagger, which will debut this Sunday, Westworld from J.J. Abrams and produced by Warner and Divorce with Sarah Jessica Parker. We also have an ambitious roster of new programming geared to the NOW audience, including shows from Jon Stewart, Bill Simmons, Sesame Street and a daily VICE newscast. 
As we introduce all this new content and further expand distribution, we're going to step up our marketing of HBO NOW. We think the combination of an even stronger original programming lineup, the best selection of hit Hollywood movies and ever-improving digital products will drive continued subscriber growth both at HBO NOW and with our traditional distributors. As we renegotiate some of our more important affiliate agreements over the next couple of years, we expect to better monetize those subscribers and accelerate subscription revenue growth at HBO. 
We'll continue to expand HBO streaming product internationally as well. We anticipate significantly expanding our OTT footprint in Latin America. And recently, we announced plans to launch a standalone streaming product in Spain later this year. 
We're equally excited about everything that Turner has in store for 2016. It's going to be a historic year for Turner Sports, which will broadcast the NCAA men's basketball finals for the first time, and we're rolling out Turner's new e-sports league in partnership with WME | IMG. 
And as we head into the home stretch of the riveting 2016 presidential election race, CNN will continue to be the place to find authoritative political coverage and analysis. 
In kids, Cartoon will look to build on its momentum from last year, and we're excited about Boomerang's content refresh and global expansion, which is the centerpiece of the kids partnership between Warner and Turner. 
This year, we'll also start the brand refreshes of TBS and TNT. TBS recently kicked off its new lineup with the launches of Angie Tribeca and Full Frontal with Samantha Bee. They're already changing perceptions of what to expect from the network, and there's a lot more to come. 
TNT will start its own refresh later this year with projects such as Animal Kingdom from producer John Wells and Warner Bros.; Good Behavior and The Alienist joining its existing lineup of leading originals. 
While it will take some time to fully refresh their lineups, we're already seeing evidence of the bold, new voice from both networks. These changes at TBS and TNT are just the latest steps in a multi-year transformation at Turner. Over the last several years, we've put in place new management teams at Cartoon Network, CNN, truTV and Turner's international portfolio, and the results give us a lot of confidence in our ability to further strengthen TBS and TNT in the years ahead. 
In 2015, CNN and Cartoon significantly outpaced the their peers. And 1 year after its rebrand, truTV's ratings in its key demos returned to growth in the fourth quarter. And excluding the impact of FX, Turner's international networks have grown profits over 60% since 2013. 
2016 is also set to be a blockbuster year at Warner Bros. We're expecting another record performance, this time led by theatrical business. Batman vs Superman: Dawn of Justice arrives in theaters on March 25, and it's one of the most anticipated films of this or any year. More than just a clash between the 2 iconic superheros, it will mark the beginning of a multi-year slate of franchise films at Warner's. DC will be a significant part of that slate, including Suicide Squad this August and Wonder Woman and the first Justice League movie in 2017. 
Cartoon Network is also launching a new Justice League TV show, which will join Teen Titans Go, another DC-based program from Warner Bros. and the #1 show on Cartoon Network. That underscores both DC's success in television, it has 8 shows on air this season, and the deepening integration between Warner's and Turner's kids business. 
The strength of our theatrical slate extends far beyond our DC titles. We're just as excited about Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, the magical return to J.K. Rowling's World of Harry Potter set for release this November. And we're already looking forward to the return of our LEGO franchise in 2017, with LEGO Batman and Ninjago. As those titles migrate into premium and broadcast windows, we'll also benefit from them on HBO and Turner's networks. 
While it's still early in the development season, we're very confident about the prospects of Warner Bros. TV in the upcoming TV season. We're expanding and diversifying our slate of programming, working to extend our leadership position in broadcast to basic cable, premium cable and OTT services. That includes some of HBO's and Turner's biggest new shows that I noted before, as well as original programming for SVOD services, like 11.22.63 for Hulu and Fuller House for Netflix. 
Putting all of this together, I hope you can appreciate why we expect 2016 to be a standout year for Time Warner. We expect the investments we've made in recent years to drive an acceleration in revenue growth, along with continued cost discipline that will allow us to invest aggressively in the business while delivering very attractive financial results. All that's reflected in the outlook we released this morning. 
We're just as confident about our long-term prospects. As I noted earlier, the shift to on-demand consumption is accelerating, and we're stepping up our pace of innovation investment to match it. 
Because of our industry-leading brands and scale, we're in a great position to take advantage of the many opportunities these shifts are creating. And we have clear momentum across the company. So we fully expect to continue delivering industry-leading financial results and shareholder returns for many years to come. 
Thanks for listening in. I'll turn it over to Howard."

As you'll recall, 2014's results were affected by significant restructuring and severance charges across the company and programming charges at Turner. Given the nature and size of these items, my comments today related to expenses, margins and adjusted operating income for the fourth quarter and full year will exclude these charges from all periods. 
Starting with consolidated results. For the year, revenues grew 3% or 7% excluding a drag of almost 400 basis points from FX. 
Adjusted operating income increased 6% or a very healthy 13% absent a more than 700 basis point currency headwind. And that came despite a decline in the fourth quarter, primarily due to the timing of programming expenses at Turner, programming charges at HBO and difficult comparisons at Warner. 
As a result of the restructuring actions we took and ongoing efficiency measures, we limited total expense growth to 2% and increased margins close to 100 basis points. When we took those actions, we set a goal of $500 million in cost savings. We recognized the majority of those savings this year and expect to surpass our initial target in 2016. Those savings helped fund nearly $12 billion in content investment across the company. So we were able to drive margin expansion while still investing aggressively in the business. 
Moving down the income statement. Adjusted EPS of $4.75 exceeded our outlook for the year. And when excluding an FX drag of $0.50, adjusted EPS growth was a very strong 27%. 
In addition to our strong operating performance, we also benefited from our share repurchase program. In 2015, we repurchased $3.6 billion of our shares, so combined with $1.2 billion in dividends, we returned $4.8 billion to shareholders during the year. So we had another really good year in 2015. That was a result of the same combination of top tier operating performance, relentless focus on efficiency, good [ph] investments and disciplined capital allocation that's allowed us to provide our shareholders with long-term returns well above our peer group average. And that's the combination we will continue to strive for in 2016 when we anticipate another year of attractive growth. 
That's reflected in our 2016 outlook for adjusted EPS of $5.30 to $5.40, which using current rates included an approximately $0.15 year-over-year headwind from FX. Absent that additional FX headwind, our outlook would imply mid- to high teens growth in adjusted EPS. I'll provide additional context around our outlook as we go through the presentation. 
Now turning to the segment highlights. I'll start at Turner, where we grew adjusted operating income double digits in 2015 even in the face of significant FX headwind and while we continue to invest in the transformation Jeff discussed. 
Advertising revenues increased 2% for the year and 5% in the quarter, that was ahead of our expectations for the quarter due to the strong domestic ad market and improved ratings trends. Domestic advertising grew high single digits in the quarter. That was boosted by particularly strong results in news and kids, record ratings for our MLB playoff games, the comparison to last year's dispute with DISH and the airing of 3 additional Major League Baseball playoff games. 
International advertising grew low double digits in the quarter, excluding on over 18 percentage point drag from FX and the benefit from the consolidation of our sports network in Brazil. 
Looking ahead to the first quarter. We're seeing a continuation of the recent positive trends. So we expect total advertising revenue to be up in the mid-single digits despite continued FX headwinds. And with scatter pricing pacing up double digits versus the upfront, historically low cancelation levels and great momentum at many of our brands, every indication points to a very strong upfront this year. 
Moving on. Subscription revenues were up 1% for the year, but looking through the impact of foreign currency, would have increased 5%. In the fourth quarter, domestic subscription revenues grew in the mid-single digits, which included a benefit from the comp against the dispute with DISH last year. And absent a greater than 20 percentage point drag from FX, international subscription revenue grew in the low single digits. A slowdown internationally was due in part to the timing of revenues related to a contract renewal. 
Looking to 2016, we now have achieved the rate increases we were targeting with all of our top 10 domestic distributors. So we continue to expect domestic subscription revenue growth to accelerate into the low teens starting in the first quarter. We also anticipate attractive local currency growth at our international networks, though at current rates, FX headwinds would prevent a return to reported growth until the latter parts of the year. 
Adjusted operating income was up 11% for the year. As we anticipated, that included a fourth quarter decline due to 13% programming cost growth, which was mainly a result of higher MLB expenses and the timing of original programming. 
For the year, total expenses declined 3% and margins expanded over 300 basis points to the highest level in Turner's history. That reflected continued tight cost control and the benefits of the restructuring we undertook in 2014. 
Putting that all together, Turner delivered very strong growth in adjusted operating income, while making progress on the multi-year transformation of our core networks. We took share in both news and kids and started the hard work of rebranding our entertainment networks. And with the investments we made across the business, we laid the groundwork for continued attractive growth in the years to come. 
Turning now to HBO, where we had another year of strong subscriber growth while continuing to make the investments necessary to go after the significant global opportunity we see for the business. 
Subscription revenues were up 3% for the quarter and 4% for the year. Both periods included about 100 basis point headwind from the combination of foreign exchange and the transfer of HBO's basic cable service in India to Turner. Domestic subscription revenue increase in the mid-single digits for both the quarter and the year. We continue to see very strong growth in our subscriber base. Our subscriber mix remained a constraint on revenue growth. 
At the same time, we're pleased with the early progress we're making with HBO NOW, whose contribution to subscription revenue increased sequentially throughout the year. As we move into 2016, we expect the revenue contributions from HBO NOW to increase further as we roll out new programming and expand distribution, allowing us to invest even more aggressively in marketing the product. And later in the year, we expect to begin renewing some of our affiliate deal, which should result in improved monetization of our subscriber base. 
Moving to content and other revenue, which grew 20% in the quarter and 6% for the year. That's mainly due to higher international licensing revenues and is indicative of the strong demand we're seeing globally for HBO's premium content. 
Across HBO's international networks, including unconsolidated JVs, revenues increased high single digits for the quarter and year when excluding the impact of FX and transfer of the basic service in India. And subscriber growth remained strong, especially in Latin America and Europe. 
Adjusted operating income was down 3% in the quarter but up 1% for the year. The decline in the fourth quarter was mainly due to higher programming expenses, which increased 11%. That growth included programming charges primarily related to series in development that HBO decided not to move forward with. Looking through those charges, programming cost would have grown 1% in the quarter. 
For the full year, total expenses increased 5%, reflecting investments in technology and marketing related to the launch of HBO NOW, as well as higher programming costs. 
So 2015 was another successful year for HBO as we maintained the subscriber momentum we've had the past few years. And with another year of profit growth and continue to execute our key strategic initiatives, including the launch of standalone streaming products in the U.S. and Latin America. And given the strength of both the global demand for our product and our programming slate, we remain very confident in HBO's ability to accelerate its growth over the next several years. 
Moving on to Warner Bros., where despite a dip in the fourth quarter, we finished the year with record revenues and profits led by our TV and games businesses. We achieved that even with a material drag from FX. 
On the TV side, revenues increased modestly in the quarter, due largely to international growth. And for the year, TV revenue grew double digits. That was primarily due to significant growth in licensing revenue, including the domestic licensing of Two Broke Girls, Big Bang Theory, Person of Interest, Seinfeld and Friends. We also continue to see increasing demand and strong pricing around the globe for Warner's hit content. So we remain encouraged by the strong secular trends in the TV business. 
Turning to video games, where we had difficult comparisons in the quarter against LEGO Batman 3 and Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor. Even so, we approached a record video games revenue of close to $1.5 billion for the year. And with the great IP and strong franchises at Warner's, we're confident we can continue to grow our games business over time. 
Theatrically, we knew 2015 would be a challenging year, given the lack of any core franchise releases and the comparison against the end of The Hobbit trilogy, as well as the releases of The LEGO Movie and Godzilla. So as expected, revenues declined for both the quarter and the year. 
Looking ahead, 2016 will mark the beginning of an ambitious slate of franchise movies, including at least 17 releases from our DC, LEGO and World of Harry Potter franchises through 2020. So we feel great about the outlook for our theatrical business in 2016 and beyond. 
Across theatrical and TV, home entertainment revenue declined 10% for the year due to continued weakness in physical sales, in particular, catalog releases, and lower carryover revenue. However, digital trends remained healthy, with EST growing in the high teens for Warner's. 
On the expense side and in line with enterprise-wide focus on cost efficiency, Warner's reduced SG&A by 2% for the year, and that included significant savings from the 2014 restructuring actions. 
So on the whole, Warner's had a terrific year. And with the momentum at our TV and Games businesses and an ambitious franchise film slate set for the next several years, we're in great position to drive attractive growth at Warner's for the foreseeable future. 
Turning to the next slide. We generated very healthy free cash of $3.6 billion in 2015, converting over 90% of our earnings into cash. The year-over-year increase was due to the growth in adjusted operating income and lower cash taxes. And that was despite the increase in working capital as a result of increased content investments across our divisions and severance payments related to the restructuring initiatives in 2014. Our cash taxes declined, primarily due to the timing of tax legislation and the related payments. 
Looking to 2016, we expect another year of solid growth in free cash flow, driven by strong profit growth and continued high conversion. 
Now looking at our balance sheet. We ended 2015 with $21.6 billion of net debt, up $1.8 billion from the end of 2014. That's primarily a result of our continued commitment to direct returns to shareholders. 
During 2015, we repurchased $3.6 billion in shares, and combined with our dividend, returned $4.8 billion to shareholders. And as Jeff noted earlier, the board authorized a 15% increase in our dividend and up to $5 billion in share repurchases, reinforcing our commitment to provide direct returns to shareholders. 
During the year, we took advantage of favorable market conditions to strengthen our balance sheet by issuing $3.8 billion of long-term debt, including our first euro-denominated debt offering. We also extended the maturity of our revolving bank credit facilities through the end of 2020. Meanwhile, we retired $2 billion of debt in the year as a result of a maturity and a tender offer and redemption of higher-priced debt. 
And on the investment front, we spent close to $700 million, about half of which is related to our real estate project at Hudson Yards. We expect to invest a similar amount in that project in 2016. 
We ended the year with a net leverage ratio at approximately 2.85x, just above our target level. Looking forward, we plan to return to our target leverage ratio of 2.75x over the next few quarters, and we don't anticipate a change in either that target level or our capital allocation philosophy, which will remain focused on investments back into our businesses, targeted M&A and consistent direct returns to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. 
With that, let's move on to the final slide, which looks at our outlook for 2016. 2016 marks the start of what we anticipate will be a strong content cycle across the company, and that should translate into an acceleration in revenue and adjusted operating income growth and another year of strong growth in adjusted EPS. 
At Turner, we expect another strong year as we  take advantage of faster revenue growth and continued cost efficiencies to increase investment for the future. 
As I mentioned earlier, subscription revenue growth should accelerate meaningfully, and advertising revenue should benefit from a strong ad market, continued momentum at CNN, including U.S. election coverage and airing the NCAA championship game for the first time. And at the same time, we're planning for higher programming and marketing expenses tied primarily to the NCAA championship game and the start of our new NBA deal in 4Q, as well as election coverage at CNN and investments in originals related to the brand repositioning at both TBS and TNT. We remain focused on continuing to efficiently manage overhead expenses to help fund these initiatives. 
At HBO, we also expect faster growth in subscription revenue in 2016, driven by continued subscriber gains, including from HBO NOW, and improved monetization of our subscriber base. Over the next couple of years, we would expect that to take HBO's subscription revenue growth into the high single digits. That will be balanced against investments associated with HBO's slate of new originals, as well as the new programming targeted for digital platforms. We will also continue to invest in marketing and technology to drive growth on HBO's digital platform. 
At Warner Bros., we'll kick off our slate of franchise films with the release of Batman vs Superman, Suicide Squad and the first of Jo Rowling's Fantastic Beast films. And while we're facing challenging comparisons in TV licensing and video games, we expect both businesses to continue to deliver healthy results. 
In addition, we remain focused on driving margin expansion through efficiency measures and a transition to digital. So all in all, we expect very strong growth and another record year at Warner. 
So looking across all 3 segments, we're set up  for a very good year from an operating perspective. That's despite an estimated year-over-year FX drag of approximately $125 million on adjusted operating income and approximately $0.15 on adjusted EPS, which we have factored into our outlook. 
And if we look back relative to the expectations we shared with you at our Investor Day, the FX drag on adjusted EPS in 2016 is in the range of $0.55 to $0.60. Absent that, we would be on track for the close to $6 in adjusted EPS we shared with you then. 
In terms of the cadence for the year, we expect our earnings to be weighted toward the back half as a result of the timing of both our film slate and marketing investments at HBO and Turner. 
Putting all that together, we expect another very good year in 2016, which is reflected in our outlook for adjusted EPS of $5.30 to $5.40, and that incorporates continued investments in high-quality video content and new business models and capabilities that should position the company to continue to drive very attractive growth for the next several years and beyond. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Mike to start the Q&A."

HBO NOW, where we're just getting started, I think we've made a lot of progress. We are not yet out on 2 major platforms, PlayStation and Xbox, which for example on HBO GO, count for over 20% of viewing. And we've not yet put out the content like Jon Stewart, Bill Simmons, VICE daily news show, that we think is particularly suited for those platforms. And that, of course, will catalyze a great deal of marketing, digitally and otherwise, which we think will drive subscription. So we're very excited about where we are. And it's important to punctuate that of the 2.7 million, those are full paying subscribers. Our job now is to go, as the deal renewal cycles open up at the end of this year and into the next 18 months, to go capture that revenue, and we intend to do that."

And we are pushing HBO out both in traditional distribution and on the NOW platform to cover either the 70 million basics that don't have pay TV or to go after the 12 million or 13 million broadband-onlys. Again just in the U.S., but if you look at it across all of those platforms, it's basically quite an advantageous position that HBO's now in to accelerate the revenues, not just in '16 but in '17, '18 and beyond."

And we've rolled out some new shows, and we're pretty pleased so far with where that's going. There's another $50 million-or-so of charges at HBO, and that was tied to some series that we decided not to move forward with, which happens occasionally. So in the quarter, it was about $180 million of charges. As far as the taxes and the buyback. I would say the tax rate in '16 will actually go up versus '15. That's in part because we saw some fourth quarter benefits that lowered the rate overall for '15. So I think if you look forward, you should see a tax rate that might be up a couple of hundred basis points, more in line with what we had in the first 3 quarters of 2015. In terms of buybacks, as always, that's going to depend on what our free cash flow generation is and what other alternative uses of capital are. But given that we ended the year at about 2.85x, which was above our target leverage of 2.75x, I would expect that the buyback would come down a bit versus 2015 levels."

We're not ideological about syndication windows, that depend on evolution and a lot of factors. But I think the overriding point everybody ought to focus on is that it's becoming crystal clear that consumers want the ability to watch their favorite show, their favorite network on demand, across whatever platform they are watching, whatever window it is. Whether it's a new show, current season, whether it's 1- or 2-year old show, they want to see it on demand. We want to make sure our networks have the flexibility to meet that consumer demand. Now if you look at HBO, perfect example. HBO has, for many years, provided on-demand access to almost all the content, multiple seasons, that it's ever produced. Some of the new entrants in the business that have VOD as a primary feature have also put multiple seasons on. The Turner networks are committed to delivering more programming on demand across their distribution channels, that's whether you get it in a new bundle, over-the-top, whether you get it through a traditional distributor. And Warner's already sells broad suites of rights when partners are interested in them. And of course, Warner sells to every kind of network, broadcast, premium, cable, over-the-top subscription VOD services. So the overriding development, which is a good development, is the consumers want VOD on whatever show or window they're watching. And we're basically moving to satisfy consumer demand. Now your second question, which is what has to happen, and not just in our company, and I think we've been pretty clear about what he said, is that distributors need to be able to offer more on-demand functionality. We see them moving quite rapidly now to do that. You can look at interfaces and on-demand offerings at Comcast. You can see new bundles and moves at Verizon or Sling. And I think Sony has a new product. I think you're going to see ever-increasing innovation across the distribution platforms over the top and in traditional distribution package offerings. So this consumer demand is going to be satisfied, and it's basically going to be good for any brand, any network or any show that has strong consumer resonance, and that's why we think that it's very good for our very concentrated suite of networks at Turner and HBO, and we think it's very good for the world's leading producer of TV shows and films, which is Warner Bros. He had one more question, what was it?"

Big shows like Blindspot, Supergirl, Lucifer and Legends of Tomorrow, which are big first-year shows this year, won't have the same type of onetime kind of lumpiness as you look at how we're recognizing revenue and how we're selling these shows going forward.

And so what we've been doing, if you go beyond those 2 pretty obvious examples, is we've been building more digital businesses that go straight to mobile. So let's look at them. There's CNN, which is the leader in mobile news, and you're seeing very strong growth in CNN in all digital platforms, but certainly in mobile, and domestically and internationally, by the way. You have the launch of Great Big Story, that's already with 170 million video views in just the first few months. Bleacher Report, #2 online sports destination in the country, has a very strong mobile presence, given the nature of that programming, particularly with its Team Stream app. Super Deluxe, which is a new launch at Turner of a digital studio that makes short-form video that is very weighted to mobile, is yet another one.

I mean, the company-specific factors would be, right now, our news business is killing it. And we're really taking advantage of the hot news cycle. And sports is really strong for us. We're seeing very strong demand for the NBA and for the NCAA men's basketball championship. We're also seeing great strength in the kids market and I think we're taking share there. In terms of the overall ad market, I think you're seeing a few things that are contributing to the buoyancy and the vibrancy of the market. Number one, the strength of scatter all throughout 2015 means that if you've sat out the upfront, you pay for it in the scatter market. So we're looking ahead and we think all indicators would seem to suggest that this year's upfront is going to be particularly strong. And I think that's going to reverse what's been a couple of years of being not so strong. So I think there is a recognition that TV is still the best-reach medium and the most effective option for brand advertisers to convey their message. And so there's going to be a lot of innovation happening in advertising. We want to lead the market there. But we feel really good about where things are right now."

Second, today's announcement includes certain forward-looking statements, which are based on management's current expectations. Actual results may vary materially from those expressed or implied by these statements due to various factors. These factors are discussed in detail in Time Warner's SEC filings, including its most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. Time Warner is under no obligation and, in fact, expressly disclaims any obligation to update or alter its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

Thanks, everyone, for listening in this morning. We had another strong year in 2015.

Thanks, everyone, for listening in this morning. 
We had another strong year in 2015. Our revenues increased 3% to $28.1 billion, adjusted operating income grew 19% to $6.9 billion and adjusted earnings per share grew 14% to $4.75 a share. That's our seventh consecutive year of double-digit growth in adjusted EPS, and we've outpaced all of our peers over that time. 
We also returned close to $5 billion to shareholders in share repurchases and dividends, and our updated $5 billion share repurchase authorization and our 15% increase in the dividend underscore our commitment to disciplined capital allocation and continued direct returns to shareholders. It's the same combination of strong execution, continued investment in our businesses and disciplined capital allocation that's allowed us to provide superior long-term returns to shareholders. 
As we discussed with you last quarter, the shift to on-demand multiplatform consumption of video content is accelerating. Consumers increasingly have greater control over where, when and on what device they watch their favorite content. And they're responding by spending more time and money watching video than ever. With more options available, they are also demanding great content be accompanied by a great viewing experience. 
And while these shifts present challenges, they also create enormous opportunities. In this environment, we're convinced that the strongest brands, biggest networks and the best content will take share. Our strategy was designed with these shifts in mind, and we're more confident than ever that we are ideally positioned to benefit. 
For years, we've been investing in the very best video content and using technology to enhance the value of our brands. With our revenue growth set to accelerate this year, we'll be investing more aggressively not only in content but also in new capabilities and digital product to ensure our brands and content are available wherever and however consumers look for them and that we can monetize them effectively when they do. At the same time, we'll continue to take our brands around the world and operate as efficiently as possible to help fund investments in future growth. 
Our structure supports this strategy. We've deliberately reshaped the company to focus on high-quality video businesses with global scale that are well positioned to capitalize on the growing demand for the very best video content. 
The combined scale of our businesses is critical to our ability to take advantage of that growth, and it's particularly important in distribution and programming, the core of what we do as a company. 
The benefits of our strategy and the advantages of our scale and structure were evident in our many successes in 2015. 
Let me share a few highlights, starting at our networks, which continued to lead the industry. Turner was the only programming group with 3 of the top 10 ad-supported cable networks in primetime among adults 18-49, and TBS finished as the #1 entertainment cable network in that demo for the third consecutive year. Our operating momentum was strongest at CNN and Cartoon Network. In 2015, CNN was the fastest-growing top 40 cable network in the U.S. in its key demo, and Cartoon Network was the only top 3 kid's network to grow ratings. 
And then when it comes to premium content, HBO remained peerless. Its 43 primetime Emmy Awards not only led all networks for the 14th consecutive year, but was also the most Emmys received in a single year by any network in at least 25 years. That included 12 for Game of Thrones, setting a record for any series in one year. 
We demonstrated the combined strength of our brands and the scale of our networks in affiliate negotiations during 2015. Last spring, for example, Turner and HBO worked together to renew their agreements with DISH. And late in the year, Turner completed a deal with one of its largest distributors, and it now has all of its top 10 affiliates on a new rate card that will drive accelerating revenue growth starting in 2016. 
While strengthening its place inside the multichannel ecosystem, Turner has been expanding its presence outside it, with 2 of our biggest digital properties, CNN Digital and Bleacher Report, growing revenue over 25% on a combined basis. CNN Digital remained at the top position in news for multiplatform views and Bleacher Report again finished the year as the #2 digital sports destination in the U.S. 
HBO also accelerated its efforts outside the ecosystem with the pioneering launch of HBO NOW last April. HBO NOW was a significant contributor to HBO's 2.7 million domestic subscriber additions last year, capping its best 2-year period of subscriber additions in the past 30 years. 
Just as importantly, HBO continued to have positive momentum with its traditional distributors. 
Outside the U.S., HBO Latin America introduced a standalone OTT product in Colombia, followed recently by Mexico, expanding the international reach of our streaming products. 
We also extended high-return, low-risk licensing agreements in Canada and certain European territories as we continue to execute the multimodal international distribution strategy that we think best monetizes our great content. 
At Warner Bros, we had a record year in both revenue and process, driven by growth in its television business and a best-ever year in video games. While our overall theatrical performance was not a strong as in other years, we're really proud of our 2 Oscar-nominated films, Mad Max: Fury Road and Creed. 
In television, we were the leading supplier to broadcast again, and we had the top new broadcast show in Blindspot, the top reality program with The Voice and the top comedy in the Big Bang Theory. 
And Warner Bros. ended the year as a top 3 video game publisher in the U.S. and Europe on the strength of Mortal Kombat X, Batman: Arkham Knight and the successful introduction of a new franchise in LEGO Dimensions. 
Warner's also continued to build its international business. To tap into the significant growth opportunity we see in China specifically, last year, Warner's entered into an exciting new venture to produce local language films. Our confidence in the China opportunity has been reinforced by the success of Hollywood VIP, an SVOD partnership between Warner's and Tencent. Hollywood VIP added more than 5 million new subscribers in 2015, helped by its exclusive access to Warner Bros. movies and HBO's original programming. 
So 2015 was another very successful year on multiple fronts, and thanks to the investments we've been making, we're poised for an even better year in 2016 as we roll out richer, more engaging content lineups across the company and accelerate the pace of investment and innovation. 
At HBO, that includes increasing the hours of original programming by 50% globally. We'll have an unmatched lineup of returning shows, including Game of Thrones, Silicon Valley, John Oliver, Ballers and Veep, as well as some of our boldest new programming in years, including Vinyl from Martin Scorsese and Mick Jagger, which will debut this Sunday, Westworld from J.J. Abrams and produced by Warner and Divorce with Sarah Jessica Parker. We also have an ambitious roster of new programming geared to the NOW audience, including shows from Jon Stewart, Bill Simmons, Sesame Street and a daily VICE newscast. 
As we introduce all this new content and further expand distribution, we're going to step up our marketing of HBO NOW. We think the combination of an even stronger original programming lineup, the best selection of hit Hollywood movies and ever-improving digital products will drive continued subscriber growth both at HBO NOW and with our traditional distributors. As we renegotiate some of our more important affiliate agreements over the next couple of years, we expect to better monetize those subscribers and accelerate Subscription revenue growth at HBO. 
We'll continue to expand HBO streaming product internationally as well. We anticipate significantly expanding our OTT footprint in Latin America. And recently, we announced plans to launch a standalone streaming product in Spain later this year. 
We're equally excited about everything that Turner has in store for 2016. It's going to be a historic year for Turner Sports, which will broadcast the NCAA men's basketball finals for the first time, and we're rolling out Turner's new e-sports league in partnership with WME | IMG. 
And as we head into the home stretch of the riveting 2016 presidential election race, CNN will continue to be the place to find authoritative political coverage and analysis. 
In kids, Cartoon will look to build on its momentum from last year, and we're excited about Boomerang's content refresh and global expansion, which is the centerpiece of the kids partnership between Warner and Turner. 
This year, we'll also start the brand refreshes of TBS and TNT. TBS recently kicked off its new lineup with the launches of Angie Tribeca and Full Frontal with Samantha Bee. They're already changing perceptions of what to expect from the network, and there's a lot more to come. 
TNT will start its own refresh later this year with projects such as Animal Kingdom from producer John Wells and Warner Bros., Good Behavior and The Alienist joining its existing lineup of leading originals. 
While it will take some time to fully refresh their lineups, we're already seeing evidence of a bold, new voice from both networks. These changes at TBS and TNT are just the latest steps in a multiyear transformation at Turner. Over the last several years, we've put in place new management teams at Cartoon Network, CNN, truTV and Turner's international portfolio, and the results give us a lot of confidence in our ability to further strengthen TBS and TNT in the years ahead. 
In 2015, CNN and Cartoon significantly outpaced the their peers. And 1 year after its rebrand, truTV's ratings in its key demos returned to growth in the fourth quarter. And excluding the impact of FX, Turner's international networks have grown profits over 60% since 2013. 
2016 is also set to be a blockbuster year at Warner Bros. We're expecting another record performance, this time led by our theatrical business. Batman vs Superman: Dawn of Justice arrives in theaters on March 25, and it's one of the most anticipated films of this or any year. More than just a clash between the 2 iconic superheros, it will mark the beginning of a multiyear slate of franchise films at Warner's. DC will be a significant part of that slate, including Suicide Squad this August and Wonder Woman and the first Justice League movie in 2017. 
Cartoon Network is also launching a new Justice League TV show, which will join Teen Titans Go, another DC-based program from Warner Bros. and the #1 show on Cartoon Network. That underscores both DC's success in television, it has 8 shows on air this season, and the deepening integration between Warner's and Turner's kids business. 
The strength of our theatrical slate extends far beyond our DC titles. We're just as excited about Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, the magical return to J.K. Rowling's World of Harry Potter set for release this November. And we're already looking forward to the return of our LEGO franchise in 2017, with LEGO Batman and Ninjago. As those titles migrate into premium and broadcast windows, we'll also benefit from them on HBO and Turner's networks. 
While it's still early in the development season, we're very confident about the prospects of Warner Bros. TV in the upcoming TV season. We're expanding and diversifying our slate of programming, working to extend our leadership position in broadcast to basic cable, premium cable and OTT services. That includes some of HBO's and Turner's biggest new shows that I noted before, as well as original programming for SVOD services, like 11.22.63 for Hulu and Fuller House for Netflix. 
Putting all of this together, I hope you can appreciate why we expect 2016 to be a standout year for Time Warner. We expect the investments we've made in recent years to drive an acceleration in revenue growth, along with continued cost discipline that will allow us to invest aggressively in the business while delivering very attractive financial results. All that's reflected in the outlook we released this morning. 
We're just as confident about our long-term prospects. As I noted earlier, the shift to on-demand consumption is accelerating, and we're stepping up our pace of innovation investment to match it. 
Because of our industry-leading brands and scale, we're in a great position to take advantage of the many opportunities these shifts are creating. And we have clear momentum across the company. So we fully expect to continue delivering industry-leading financial results and shareholder returns for many years to come. 
Thanks for listening in. I'll turn it over to Howard."
24689,322502383,930766,"Time Warner Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 10, 2016",2016-02-10,"Earnings Calls","Warner Media, LLC","Executives","Thanks, Jeff, and good morning. I'll begin by referring to the first slide of our presentation, which is now available on our website. As you'll recall, 2014's results were affected by significant restructuring and severance charges across the company a",2714,"Thanks, Jeff, and good morning. I'll begin by referring to the first slide of our presentation, which is now available on our website. 
As you'll recall, 2014's results were affected by significant restructuring and severance charges across the company and programming charges at Turner. Given the nature and size of these items, my comments today related to expenses, margins and adjusted operating income for the fourth quarter and full year will exclude these charges from all periods. 
Starting with consolidated results. For the year, revenues grew 3% or 7% excluding a drag of almost 400 basis points from FX. 
Adjusted operating income increased 6% or a very healthy 13% absent a more than 700 basis point currency headwind. And that came despite a decline in the fourth quarter, primarily due to the timing of programming expenses at Turner, programming charges at HBO and difficult comparisons at Warner. 
As a result of the restructuring actions we took and ongoing efficiency measures, we limited total expense growth to 2% and increased margins close to 100 basis points. When we took those actions, we set a goal of $500 million in cost savings. We recognized the majority of those savings this year and expect to surpass our initial target in 2016. Those savings helped fund nearly $12 billion in content investment across the company. So we were able to drive margin expansion while still investing aggressively in the business. 
Moving down the income statement. Adjusted EPS of $4.75 exceeded our outlook for the year. And when excluding an FX drag of $0.50, adjusted EPS growth was a very strong 27%. 
In addition to our strong operating performance, we also benefited from our share repurchase program. In 2015, we repurchased $3.6 billion of our shares, so combined with $1.2 billion in dividends, we returned $4.8 billion to shareholders during the year. So we had another really good year in 2015. That was a result of the same combination of top tier operating performance, relentless focus on efficiency, growth investments and disciplined capital allocation that's allowed us to provide our shareholders with long-term returns well above our peer group average. And that's the combination we will continue to strive for in 2016 when we anticipate another year of attractive growth. 
That's reflected in our 2016 outlook for adjusted EPS of $5.30 to $5.40, which using current rates includes an approximately $0.15 year-over-year headwind from FX. Absent that additional FX headwind, our outlook would imply mid- to high teens growth in adjusted EPS. I'll provide additional context around our outlook as we go through the presentation. 
Now turning to the segment highlights. I'll start at Turner, where we grew adjusted operating income double digits in 2015 even in the face of significant FX headwind and while we continued to invest in the transformation Jeff discussed. 
Advertising revenues increased 2% for the year and 5% in the quarter. That was ahead of our expectations for the quarter due to the strong domestic ad market and improved ratings trends. Domestic advertising grew high single digits in the quarter. That was boosted by particularly strong results in news and kids, record ratings for our MLB playoff games, the comparison to last year's dispute with DISH and the airing of 3 additional Major League Baseball playoff games. 
International advertising grew low double digits in the quarter, excluding an over 18 percentage point drag from FX and the benefit from the consolidation of our sports network in Brazil. 
Looking ahead to the first quarter. We're seeing a continuation of the recent positive trends. So we expect total advertising revenue to be up in the mid-single digits despite continued FX headwinds. And with the scatter pricing pacing up double digits versus the upfront, historically low cancelation levels and great momentum at many of our brands, every indication points to a very strong upfront this year. 
Moving on. Subscription revenues were up 1% for the year, but looking through the impact of foreign currency, would have increased 5%. In the fourth quarter, domestic subscription revenues grew in the mid-single digits, which included a benefit from the comp against the dispute with DISH last year. And absent a greater than 20 percentage point drag from FX, international subscription revenue grew in the low single digits. A slowdown internationally was due in part to the timing of revenues related to a contract renewal. 
Looking to 2016, we now have achieved the rate increases we were targeting with all of our top 10 domestic distributors. So we continue to expect domestic subscription revenue growth to accelerate into the low teens starting in the first quarter. We also anticipate attractive local currency growth at our international networks, though at current rates, FX headwinds would prevent a return to reported growth until the latter parts of the year. 
Adjusted operating income was up 11% for the year. As we anticipated, that included a fourth quarter decline due to 13% programming cost growth, which was mainly a result of higher MLB expenses and the timing of original programming. 
For the year, total expenses declined 3% and margins expanded over 300 basis points to the highest level in Turner's history. That reflected continued tight cost control and the benefits of the restructuring we undertook in 2014. 
Putting that all together, Turner delivered very strong growth in adjusted operating income, while making progress on the multiyear transformation of our core networks. We took share in both news and kids and started the hard work of rebranding our entertainment networks. And with the investments we made across the business, we laid the groundwork for continued attractive growth in the years to come. 
Turning now to HBO, where we had another year of strong subscriber growth while continuing to make the investments necessary to go after the significant global opportunity we see for the business. 
Subscription revenues were up 3% for the quarter and 4% for the year. Both periods included about 100 basis point headwind from the combination of foreign exchange and the transfer of HBO's basic cable service in India to Turner. Domestic subscription revenue increased in the mid-single digits for both the quarter and the year. We continued to see very strong growth in our subscriber base, but subscriber mix remained a constraint on revenue growth. 
At the same time, we're pleased with the early progress we're making with HBO NOW, whose contribution to Subscription revenue increased sequentially throughout the year. As we move into 2016, we expect the revenue contributions from HBO NOW to increase further as we roll out new programming and expand distribution, allowing us to invest even more aggressively in marketing the product. And later in the year, we expect to begin renewing some of our affiliate deals, which should result in improved monetization of our subscriber base. 
Moving to content and other revenue, which grew 20% in the quarter and 6% for the year. That's mainly due to higher international licensing revenues and is indicative of the strong demand we're seeing globally for HBO's premium content. 
Across HBO's international networks, including unconsolidated JVs, revenues increased high single digits for the quarter and year when excluding the impact of FX and transfer of the basic service in India. And subscriber growth remained strong, especially in Latin America and Europe. 
Adjusted operating income was down 3% in the quarter but up 1% for the year. The decline in the fourth quarter was mainly due to higher programming expenses, which increased 11%. That growth included programming charges primarily related to series in development that HBO decided not to move forward with. Looking through those charges, programming cost would have grown 1% in the quarter. 
For the full year, total expenses increased 5%, reflecting investments in technology and marketing related to the launch of HBO NOW, as well as higher programming costs. 
So 2015 was another successful year for HBO as we maintained the subscriber momentum we've had the past few years, delivered another year of profit growth and continued to execute our key strategic initiatives, including the launch of standalone streaming products in the U.S. and Latin America. And given the strength of both the global demand for our product and our programming slate, we remain very confident in HBO's ability to accelerate its growth over the next several years. 
Moving on to Warner Bros., where despite a dip in the fourth quarter, we finished the year with record revenues and profits led by our TV and games businesses. We achieved that even with a material drag from FX. 
On the TV side, revenues increased modestly in the quarter, due largely to international growth. And for the year, TV revenue grew double digits. That was primarily due to significant growth in licensing revenue, including the domestic licensing of Two Broke Girls, Big Bang Theory, Person of Interest, Seinfeld and Friends. We also continue to see increasing demand and strong pricing around the globe for Warner's hit content. So we remain encouraged by the strong secular trends in the TV business. 
Turning to video games, where we had difficult comparisons in the quarter against LEGO Batman 3 and Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor. Even so, we posted record video games revenue of close to $1.5 billion for the year. And with the great IP and strong franchises at Warner's, we're confident we can continue to grow our games business over time. 
Theatrically, we knew 2015 would be a challenging year, given the lack of any core franchise releases and the comparison against the end of The Hobbit trilogy, as well as the releases of The LEGO Movie and Godzilla. So as expected, revenues declined for both the quarter and the year. 
Looking ahead, 2016 will mark the beginning of an ambitious slate of franchise movies, including at least 17 releases from our DC, LEGO and World of Harry Potter franchises through 2020. So we feel great about the outlook for our theatrical business in 2016 and beyond. 
Across theatrical and TV, home entertainment revenue declined 10% for the year due to continued weakness in physical sales, in particular, catalog releases and lower carryover revenue. However, digital trends remained healthy, with EST growing in the high teens for Warner's. 
On the expense side and in line with the enterprise-wide focus on cost efficiency, Warner's reduced SG&A by 2% for the year, and that included significant savings from the 2014 restructuring actions. 
So on the whole, Warner's had a terrific year. And with the momentum at our TV and Games businesses and an ambitious franchise film slate set for the next several years, we're in great position to drive attractive growth at Warner's for the foreseeable future. 
Turning to the next slide. We generated very healthy free cash of $3.6 billion in 2015, converting over 90% of our earnings into cash. The year-over-year increase was due to the growth in adjusted operating income and lower cash taxes. And that was despite the increase in working capital as a result of increased content investments across our divisions and severance payments related to the restructuring initiatives in 2014. Our cash taxes declined, primarily due to the timing of tax legislation and the related payments. 
Looking to 2016, we expect another year of solid growth in free cash flow, driven by strong profit growth and continued high conversion. 
Now looking at our balance sheet. We ended 2015 with $21.6 billion of net debt, up $1.8 billion from the end of 2014. That's primarily a result of our continued commitment to direct returns to shareholders. 
During 2015, we repurchased $3.6 billion in shares, and combined with our dividend, returned $4.8 billion to shareholders. And as Jeff noted earlier, the board authorized a 15% increase in our dividend and up to $5 billion in share repurchases, reinforcing our commitment to provide direct returns to shareholders. 
During the year, we took advantage of favorable market conditions to strengthen our balance sheet by issuing $3.8 billion of long-term debt, including our first euro-denominated debt offering. We also extended the maturity of our revolving bank credit facilities through the end of 2020. Meanwhile, we retired $2 billion of debt in the year as a result of a maturity and a tender offer and redemption of higher-priced debt. 
And on the investment front, we spent close to $700 million, about half of which is related to our real estate project at Hudson Yards. We expect to invest a similar amount in that project in 2016. 
We ended the year with a net leverage ratio at approximately 2.85x, just above our target level. Looking forward, we plan to return to our target leverage ratio of 2.75x over the next few quarters, and we don't anticipate a change in either that target level or our capital allocation philosophy, which will remain focused on investments back into our businesses, targeted M&A and consistent direct returns to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. 
With that, let's move on to the final slide, which looks at our outlook for 2016. 2016 marks the start of what we anticipate will be a strong content cycle across the company, and that should translate into an acceleration in revenue and adjusted operating income growth and another year of strong growth in adjusted EPS. 
At Turner, we expect another strong year as we  take advantage of faster revenue growth and continued cost efficiencies to increase investment for the future. 
As I mentioned earlier, Subscription revenue growth should accelerate meaningfully, and advertising revenue should benefit from a strong ad market, continued momentum at CNN, including from its election coverage, and airing the NCAA championship game for the first time. And at the same time, we're planning for higher programming and marketing expenses tied primarily to the NCAA championship game and the start of our new NBA deal in 4Q, as well as election coverage at CNN and investments in originals related to the brand repositioning at both TBS and TNT. We remain focused on continuing to efficiently manage overhead expenses to help fund these initiatives. 
At HBO, we also expect faster growth in Subscription revenue in 2016, driven by continued subscriber gains, including from HBO NOW, and improved monetization of our subscriber base. Over the next couple of years, we would expect that to take HBO's Subscription revenue growth into the high single digits. That will be balanced against investments associated with HBO's slate of new originals, as well as the new programming targeted for digital platforms. We will also continue to invest in marketing and technology to drive growth on HBO's digital platform. 
At Warner Bros., we'll kick off our slate of franchise films with the release of Batman v Superman, Suicide Squad and the first of Jo Rowling's Fantastic Beast films. And while we're facing challenging comparisons in TV licensing and video games, we expect both businesses to continue to deliver healthy results. 
In addition, we remain focused on driving margin expansion through efficiency measures and the transition to digital. So all in all, we expect very strong growth and another record year at Warner. 
So looking across all 3 segments, we're set up  for a very good year from an operating perspective. That's despite an estimated year-over-year FX drag of approximately $125 million on adjusted operating income and approximately $0.15 on adjusted EPS, which we have factored into our outlook. 
And if we look back relative to the expectations we shared with you at our Investor Day, the FX drag on adjusted EPS in 2016 is in the range of $0.55 to $0.60. Absent that, we would be on track for the close to $6 in adjusted EPS we shared with you then. 
In terms of the cadence of the year, we expect our earnings to be weighted toward the back half as a result of the timing of both our film slate and marketing investments at HBO and Turner. 
Putting all that together, we expect another very good year in 2016, which is reflected in our outlook for adjusted EPS of $5.30 to $5.40, and that incorporates continued investments in high-quality video content and new business models and capabilities that should position the company to continue to drive very attractive growth for the next several years and beyond.

HBO NOW, where we're just getting started, I think we've made a lot of progress. We are not yet out on 2 major platforms, PlayStation and Xbox, which for example on HBO GO, account for over 20% of viewing. And we've not yet put out the content like Jon Stewart, Bill Simmons, VICE daily news show, that we think is particularly suited for those platforms. And that, of course, will catalyze a great deal of marketing, digitally and otherwise, which we think will drive subscription. So we're very excited about where we are. And it's important to punctuate that of the 2.7 million, those are full paying subscribers. Our job now is to go, as the deal renewal cycles open up at the end of this year and into the next 18 months, to go capture that revenue, and we intend to do that."

So in terms of program impairments, at Turner, we had about $130 million in the fourth quarter, and that was tied to the TBS and TNT transition which has now started at TBS. And we've rolled out some new shows, and we're pretty pleased so far with where that's going. There's another $50 million-or-so of charges at HBO, and that was tied to some series that we decided not to move forward with, which happens occasionally. So in the quarter, it was about $180 million of charges. As far as the taxes and the buyback. I would say the tax rate in '16 will actually go up versus '15. That's in part because we saw some fourth quarter benefits that lowered the rate overall for '15. So I think if you look forward, you should see a tax rate that might be up a couple of hundred basis points, more in line with what we had in the first 3 quarters of 2015. In terms of buybacks, as always, that's going to depend on what our free cash flow generation is and what other alternative uses of capital are. But given that we ended the year at about 2.85x, which was above our target leverage of 2.75x, I would expect that the buyback would come down a bit versus 2015 levels."

We're not ideological about syndication windows, that depend on evolution and a lot of factors. But I think the overriding point everybody ought to focus on is that it's becoming crystal clear that consumers want the ability to watch their favorite show, their favorite network on demand, across whatever platform they are watching, whatever window it is. Whether it's a new show, current season, whether it's a 1- or 2-year old show, they want to see it on demand. We want to make sure our networks have the flexibility to meet that consumer demand. Now if you look at HBO, perfect example. HBO has, for many years, provided on-demand access to almost all the content, multiple seasons, that it's ever produced. Some of the new entrants in the business that have VOD as a primary feature have also put multiple seasons on. The Turner networks are committed to delivering more programming on demand across their distribution channels, that's whether you get it in a new bundle over-the-top, whether you get it through a traditional distributor. And Warner's already sells broad suites of rights when partners are interested in them. And of course, Warner sells to every kind of network, broadcast, premium, cable, over-the-top subscription VOD services. So the overriding development, which is a good development, is that consumers want VOD on whatever show or window they're watching. And we're basically moving to satisfy consumer demand. Now your second question, which is what has to happen and not just in our company. And I think we've been pretty clear about what we said, is that distributors need to be able to offer more on-demand functionality. We see them moving quite rapidly now to do that. You can look at interfaces and on-demand offerings at Comcast. You can see new bundles and moves at Verizon or Sling. And I think Sony has a new product. I think you're going to see ever-increasing innovation across the distribution platforms, over the top and in traditional distribution package offerings. So this consumer demand is going to be satisfied, and it's basically going to be good for any brand, any network or any show that has strong consumer resonance, and that's why we think that it's very good for our very concentrated suite of networks at Turner and HBO, and we think it's very good for the world's leading producer of TV shows and films, which is Warner Bros. He had one more question, what was it?"

We don't have -- we had Two Broke Girls, Person of Interest, Friends and Seinfeld, and the second cycle of Big Bang Theory. We don't have similar type product going down the pipeline in 2016. But I will say that one of the things that we do have, we have Mom coming up. And the lumpiness of television licensing has decreased as you've seen more of the SVOD revenue. Think shows like Blindspot, Supergirl, Lucifer and Legends of Tomorrow, which are big first-year shows this year, won't have the same type of onetime kind of lumpiness as you look at how we're recognizing revenue and how we're selling these shows going forward. '16 and beyond, '16 and '17 are big film years. It's what we talked to you about in October. Feel really good about kind of setting up of the film franchise with Batman vs Superman. Suicide Squad and Fantastic Beasts look great. And so yes, I do believe that film and games will more than offset what -- the difficult comp in TV, and we will have strong growth in 2016."

And I think our margins are now at or near the top of where the industry is. And having said that, we are going to remain incredibly disciplined across the entire company as it relates to expenses and pay very close attention to how and where we're spending our money. And we're going to be doing that at the same time that we're going to be investing to improve capabilities and building businesses. So I feel terrific about the efficiency of the operations of the company right now. I still believe, longer term, that our programming cost will kind of grow in the high single digit range, which is what we've been saying now for a long time, and our nonprogramming costs should grow much, much more slowly than that."

And so what we've been doing, if you go beyond those 2 pretty obvious examples, is we've been building more digital businesses that go straight to mobile. So let's look at them. There's CNN, which is the leader in mobile news, and you're seeing very strong growth in CNN in all digital platforms, but certainly in mobile, and domestically and internationally, by the way. You have the launch of Great Big Story, that's already with 170 million video views in just the first few months. Bleacher Report, #2 online sports destination in the country, has a very strong mobile presence, given the nature of that programming, particularly with its Team Stream app. Super Deluxe, which is a new launch at Turner of a digital studio that makes short-form video that is very weighted to mobile, is yet another one.

In terms of the overall ad market, I think you're seeing a few things that are contributing to the buoyancy and the vibrancy of the market. Number one, the strength of scatter all throughout 2015 means that if you sat out the upfront, you paid for it in the scatter market. So we're looking ahead and we think all indicators would seem to suggest that this year's upfront is going to be particularly strong. And I think that's going to reverse what's been a couple of years of being not so strong. So I think there is a recognition that TV is still the best reach medium and the most effective option for brand advertisers to convey their message.

Schedules setting out reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our earnings release and trending schedules. These reconciliations are available on our website at www.timewarner.com/investors. Reconciliations of our expected future financial performance are also included in the business outlook release that is available on our website. 
Second, today's announcement includes certain forward-looking statements, which are based on management's current expectations. Actual results may vary materially from those expressed or implied by these statements due to various factors. These factors are discussed in detail in Time Warner's SEC filings, including its most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. Time Warner is under no obligation and, in fact, expressly disclaims any obligation to update or alter its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

Thanks, everyone, for listening in this morning. We had another strong year in 2015.

Thanks, everyone, for listening in this morning. 
We had another strong year in 2015. Our revenues increased 3% to $28.1 billion, adjusted operating income grew 19% to $6.9 billion and adjusted earnings per share grew 14% to $4.75 a share. That's our seventh consecutive year of double-digit growth in adjusted EPS, and we've outpaced all of our peers over that time. 
We also returned close to $5 billion to shareholders in share repurchases and dividends, and our updated $5 billion share repurchase authorization and our 15% increase in the dividend underscore our commitment to disciplined capital allocation and continued direct returns to shareholders. It's the same combination of strong execution, continued investment in our businesses and disciplined capital allocation that's allowed us to provide superior long-term returns to shareholders. 
As we discussed with you last quarter, the shift to on-demand multiplatform consumption of video content is accelerating. Consumers increasingly have greater control over where, when and on what device they watch their favorite content. And they're responding by spending more time and money watching video than ever. With more options available, they are also demanding great content be accompanied by a great viewing experience. 
And while these shifts present challenges, they also create enormous opportunities. In this environment, we're convinced that the strongest brands, biggest networks and the best content will take share. Our strategy was designed with these shifts in mind, and we're more confident than ever that we are ideally positioned to benefit. 
For years, we've been investing in the very best video content and using technology to enhance the value of our brands. With our revenue growth set to accelerate this year, we'll be investing more aggressively not only in content but also in new capabilities and digital product to ensure our brands and content are available wherever and however consumers look for them and that we can monetize them effectively when they do. At the same time, we'll continue to take our brands around the world and operate as efficiently as possible to help fund investments in future growth. 
Our structure supports this strategy. We've deliberately reshaped the company to focus on high-quality video businesses with global scale that are well positioned to capitalize on the growing demand for the very best video content. 
The combined scale of our businesses is critical to our ability to take advantage of that growth, and it's particularly important in distribution and programming, the core of what we do as a company. 
The benefits of our strategy and the advantages of our scale and structure were evident in our many successes in 2015. 
Let me share a few highlights, starting at our networks, which continued to lead the industry. Turner was the only programming group with 3 of the top 10 ad-supported cable networks in primetime among adults 18-49, and TBS finished as the #1 entertainment cable network in that demo for the third consecutive year. Our operating momentum was strongest at CNN and Cartoon Network. In 2015, CNN was the fastest-growing top 40 cable network in the U.S. in its key demo, and Cartoon Network was the only top 3 kid's network to grow ratings. 
And then when it comes to premium content, HBO remained peerless. Its 43 primetime Emmy Awards not only led all networks for the 14th consecutive year, but was also the most Emmys received in a single year by any network in at least 25 years. That included 12 for Game of Thrones, setting a record for any series in one year. 
We demonstrated the combined strength of our brands and the scale of our networks in affiliate negotiations during 2015. Last spring, for example, Turner and HBO worked together to renew their agreements with DISH. And late in the year, Turner completed a deal with one of its largest distributors, and it now has all of its top 10 affiliates on a new rate card that will drive accelerating revenue growth starting in 2016. 
While strengthening its place inside the multichannel ecosystem, Turner has been expanding its presence outside it, with 2 of our biggest digital properties, CNN Digital and Bleacher Report, growing revenue over 25% on a combined basis. CNN Digital remained at the top position in news for multiplatform views and Bleacher Report again finished the year as the #2 digital sports destination in the U.S. 
HBO also accelerated its efforts outside the ecosystem with the pioneering launch of HBO NOW last April. HBO NOW was a significant contributor to HBO's 2.7 million domestic subscriber additions last year, capping its best 2-year period of subscriber additions in the past 30 years. 
Just as importantly, HBO continued to have positive momentum with its traditional distributors. 
Outside the U.S., HBO Latin America introduced a standalone OTT product in Colombia, followed recently by Mexico, expanding the international reach of our streaming products. 
We also extended high-return, low-risk licensing agreements in Canada and certain European territories as we continue to execute the multimodal international distribution strategy that we think best monetizes our great content. 
At Warner Bros, we had a record year in both revenue and process, driven by growth in its television business and a best-ever year in video games. While our overall theatrical performance was not a strong as in other years, we're really proud of our 2 Oscar-nominated films, Mad Max: Fury Road and Creed. 
In television, we were the leading supplier to broadcast again, and we had the top new broadcast show in Blindspot, the top reality program with The Voice and the top comedy in the Big Bang Theory. 
And Warner Bros. ended the year as a top 3 video game publisher in the U.S. and Europe on the strength of Mortal Kombat X, Batman: Arkham Knight and the successful introduction of a new franchise in LEGO Dimensions. 
Warner's also continued to build its international business. To tap into the significant growth opportunity we see in China specifically, last year, Warner's entered into an exciting new venture to produce local language films. Our confidence in the China opportunity has been reinforced by the success of Hollywood VIP, an SVOD partnership between Warner's and Tencent. Hollywood VIP added more than 5 million new subscribers in 2015, helped by its exclusive access to Warner Bros. movies and HBO's original programming. 
So 2015 was another very successful year on multiple fronts, and thanks to the investments we've been making, we're poised for an even better year in 2016 as we roll out richer, more engaging content lineups across the company and accelerate the pace of investment and innovation. 
At HBO, that includes increasing the hours of original programming by 50% globally. We'll have an unmatched lineup of returning shows, including Game of Thrones, Silicon Valley, John Oliver, Ballers and Veep, as well as some of our boldest new programming in years, including Vinyl from Martin Scorsese and Mick Jagger, which will debut this Sunday, Westworld from J.J. Abrams and produced by Warner and Divorce with Sarah Jessica Parker. We also have an ambitious roster of new programming geared to the NOW audience, including shows from Jon Stewart, Bill Simmons, Sesame Street and a daily VICE newscast. 
As we introduce all this new content and further expand distribution, we're going to step up our marketing of HBO NOW. We think the combination of an even stronger original programming lineup, the best selection of hit Hollywood movies and ever-improving digital products will drive continued subscriber growth both at HBO NOW and with our traditional distributors. As we renegotiate some of our more important affiliate agreements over the next couple of years, we expect to better monetize those subscribers and accelerate Subscription revenue growth at HBO. 
We'll continue to expand HBO streaming product internationally as well. We anticipate significantly expanding our OTT footprint in Latin America. And recently, we announced plans to launch a standalone streaming product in Spain later this year. 
We're equally excited about everything that Turner has in store for 2016. It's going to be a historic year for Turner Sports, which will broadcast the NCAA men's basketball finals for the first time, and we're rolling out Turner's new e-sports league in partnership with WME | IMG. 
And as we head into the home stretch of the riveting 2016 presidential election race, CNN will continue to be the place to find authoritative political coverage and analysis. 
In kids, Cartoon will look to build on its momentum from last year, and we're excited about Boomerang's content refresh and global expansion, which is the centerpiece of the kids partnership between Warner and Turner. 
This year, we'll also start the brand refreshes of TBS and TNT. TBS recently kicked off its new lineup with the launches of Angie Tribeca and Full Frontal with Samantha Bee. They're already changing perceptions of what to expect from the network, and there's a lot more to come. 
TNT will start its own refresh later this year with projects such as Animal Kingdom from producer John Wells and Warner Bros., Good Behavior and The Alienist joining its existing lineup of leading originals. 
While it will take some time to fully refresh their lineups, we're already seeing evidence of a bold, new voice from both networks. These changes at TBS and TNT are just the latest steps in a multiyear transformation at Turner. Over the last several years, we've put in place new management teams at Cartoon Network, CNN, truTV and Turner's international portfolio, and the results give us a lot of confidence in our ability to further strengthen TBS and TNT in the years ahead. 
In 2015, CNN and Cartoon significantly outpaced their peers. And 1 year after its rebrand, truTV's ratings in its key demos returned to growth in the fourth quarter. And excluding the impact of FX, Turner's international networks have grown profits over 60% since 2013. 
2016 is also set to be a blockbuster year at Warner Bros. We're expecting another record performance, this time led by our theatrical business. Batman vs Superman: Dawn of Justice arrives in theaters on March 25, and it's one of the most anticipated films of this or any year. More than just a clash between the 2 iconic superheroes, it will mark the beginning of a multiyear slate of franchise films at Warner's. DC will be a significant part of that slate, including Suicide Squad this August and Wonder Woman and the first Justice League movie in 2017. 
Cartoon Network is also launching a new Justice League TV show, which will join Teen Titans Go, another DC-based program from Warner Bros. and the #1 show on Cartoon Network. That underscores both DC's success in television, it has 8 shows on air this season, and the deepening integration between Warner's and Turner's kids business. 
The strength of our theatrical slate extends far beyond our DC titles. We're just as excited about Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, the magical return to J.K. Rowling's World of Harry Potter set for release this November. And we're already looking forward to the return of our LEGO franchise in 2017, with LEGO Batman and Ninjago. As those titles migrate into premium and broadcast windows, we'll also benefit from them on HBO and Turner's networks. 
While it's still early in the development season, we're very confident about the prospects of Warner Bros. TV in the upcoming TV season. We're expanding and diversifying our slate of programming, working to extend our leadership position in broadcast to basic cable, premium cable and OTT services. That includes some of HBO's and Turner's biggest new shows that I noted before, as well as original programming for SVOD services, like 11.22.63 for Hulu and Fuller House for Netflix. 
Putting all of this together, I hope you can appreciate why we expect 2016 to be a standout year for Time Warner. We expect the investments we've made in recent years to drive an acceleration in revenue growth, along with continued cost discipline that will allow us to invest aggressively in the business while delivering very attractive financial results. All that's reflected in the outlook we released this morning. 
We're just as confident about our long-term prospects. As I noted earlier, the shift to on-demand consumption is accelerating, and we're stepping up our pace of innovation investment to match it. 
Because of our industry-leading brands and scale, we're in a great position to take advantage of the many opportunities these shifts are creating. And we have clear momentum across the company. So we fully expect to continue delivering industry-leading financial results and shareholder returns for many years to come. 
Thanks for listening in. I'll turn it over to Howard."
24689,322502383,931114,"Time Warner Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 10, 2016",2016-02-10,"Earnings Calls","Warner Media, LLC","Executives","Thanks, Jeff, and good morning. I'll begin by referring to the first slide of our presentation, which is now available on our website. As you'll recall, 2014's results were affected by significant restructuring and severance charges across the company a",2714,"Thanks, Jeff, and good morning. I'll begin by referring to the first slide of our presentation, which is now available on our website. 
As you'll recall, 2014's results were affected by significant restructuring and severance charges across the company and programming charges at Turner. Given the nature and size of these items, my comments today related to expenses, margins and adjusted operating income for the fourth quarter and full year will exclude these charges from all periods. 
Starting with consolidated results. For the year, revenues grew 3% or 7% excluding a drag of almost 400 basis points from FX. 
Adjusted operating income increased 6% or a very healthy 13% absent a more than 700 basis point currency headwind. And that came despite a decline in the fourth quarter, primarily due to the timing of programming expenses at Turner, programming charges at HBO and difficult comparisons at Warner. 
As a result of the restructuring actions we took and ongoing efficiency measures, we limited total expense growth to 2% and increased margins close to 100 basis points. When we took those actions, we set a goal of $500 million in cost savings. We recognized the majority of those savings this year and expect to surpass our initial target in 2016. Those savings helped fund nearly $12 billion in content investment across the company. So we were able to drive margin expansion while still investing aggressively in the business. 
Moving down the income statement. Adjusted EPS of $4.75 exceeded our outlook for the year. And when excluding an FX drag of $0.50, adjusted EPS growth was a very strong 27%. 
In addition to our strong operating performance, we also benefited from our share repurchase program. In 2015, we repurchased $3.6 billion of our shares, so combined with $1.2 billion in dividends, we returned $4.8 billion to shareholders during the year. So we had another really good year in 2015. That was a result of the same combination of top tier operating performance, relentless focus on efficiency, growth investments and disciplined capital allocation that's allowed us to provide our shareholders with long-term returns well above our peer group average. And that's the combination we will continue to strive for in 2016 when we anticipate another year of attractive growth. 
That's reflected in our 2016 outlook for adjusted EPS of $5.30 to $5.40, which using current rates includes an approximately $0.15 year-over-year headwind from FX. Absent that additional FX headwind, our outlook would imply mid- to high teens growth in adjusted EPS. I'll provide additional context around our outlook as we go through the presentation. 
Now turning to the segment highlights. I'll start at Turner, where we grew adjusted operating income double digits in 2015 even in the face of significant FX headwind and while we continued to invest in the transformation Jeff discussed. 
Advertising revenues increased 2% for the year and 5% in the quarter. That was ahead of our expectations for the quarter due to the strong domestic ad market and improved ratings trends. Domestic advertising grew high single digits in the quarter. That was boosted by particularly strong results in news and kids, record ratings for our MLB playoff games, the comparison to last year's dispute with DISH and the airing of 3 additional Major League Baseball playoff games. 
International advertising grew low double digits in the quarter, excluding an over 18 percentage point drag from FX and the benefit from the consolidation of our sports network in Brazil. 
Looking ahead to the first quarter. We're seeing a continuation of the recent positive trends. So we expect total advertising revenue to be up in the mid-single digits despite continued FX headwinds. And with the scatter pricing pacing up double digits versus the upfront, historically low cancelation levels and great momentum at many of our brands, every indication points to a very strong upfront this year. 
Moving on. Subscription revenues were up 1% for the year, but looking through the impact of foreign currency, would have increased 5%. In the fourth quarter, domestic subscription revenues grew in the mid-single digits, which included a benefit from the comp against the dispute with DISH last year. And absent a greater than 20 percentage point drag from FX, international subscription revenue grew in the low single digits. A slowdown internationally was due in part to the timing of revenues related to a contract renewal. 
Looking to 2016, we now have achieved the rate increases we were targeting with all of our top 10 domestic distributors. So we continue to expect domestic subscription revenue growth to accelerate into the low teens starting in the first quarter. We also anticipate attractive local currency growth at our international networks, though at current rates, FX headwinds would prevent a return to reported growth until the latter parts of the year. 
Adjusted operating income was up 11% for the year. As we anticipated, that included a fourth quarter decline due to 13% programming cost growth, which was mainly a result of higher MLB expenses and the timing of original programming. 
For the year, total expenses declined 3% and margins expanded over 300 basis points to the highest level in Turner's history. That reflected continued tight cost control and the benefits of the restructuring we undertook in 2014. 
Putting that all together, Turner delivered very strong growth in adjusted operating income, while making progress on the multiyear transformation of our core networks. We took share in both news and kids and started the hard work of rebranding our entertainment networks. And with the investments we made across the business, we laid the groundwork for continued attractive growth in the years to come. 
Turning now to HBO, where we had another year of strong subscriber growth while continuing to make the investments necessary to go after the significant global opportunity we see for the business. 
Subscription revenues were up 3% for the quarter and 4% for the year. Both periods included about 100 basis point headwind from the combination of foreign exchange and the transfer of HBO's basic cable service in India to Turner. Domestic subscription revenue increased in the mid-single digits for both the quarter and the year. We continued to see very strong growth in our subscriber base, but subscriber mix remained a constraint on revenue growth. 
At the same time, we're pleased with the early progress we're making with HBO NOW, whose contribution to Subscription revenue increased sequentially throughout the year. As we move into 2016, we expect the revenue contributions from HBO NOW to increase further as we roll out new programming and expand distribution, allowing us to invest even more aggressively in marketing the product. And later in the year, we expect to begin renewing some of our affiliate deals, which should result in improved monetization of our subscriber base. 
Moving to content and other revenue, which grew 20% in the quarter and 6% for the year. That's mainly due to higher international licensing revenues and is indicative of the strong demand we're seeing globally for HBO's premium content. 
Across HBO's international networks, including unconsolidated JVs, revenues increased high single digits for the quarter and year when excluding the impact of FX and transfer of the basic service in India. And subscriber growth remained strong, especially in Latin America and Europe. 
Adjusted operating income was down 3% in the quarter but up 1% for the year. The decline in the fourth quarter was mainly due to higher programming expenses, which increased 11%. That growth included programming charges primarily related to series in development that HBO decided not to move forward with. Looking through those charges, programming cost would have grown 1% in the quarter. 
For the full year, total expenses increased 5%, reflecting investments in technology and marketing related to the launch of HBO NOW, as well as higher programming costs. 
So 2015 was another successful year for HBO as we maintained the subscriber momentum we've had the past few years, delivered another year of profit growth and continued to execute our key strategic initiatives, including the launch of standalone streaming products in the U.S. and Latin America. And given the strength of both the global demand for our product and our programming slate, we remain very confident in HBO's ability to accelerate its growth over the next several years. 
Moving on to Warner Bros., where despite a dip in the fourth quarter, we finished the year with record revenues and profits led by our TV and games businesses. We achieved that even with a material drag from FX. 
On the TV side, revenues increased modestly in the quarter, due largely to international growth. And for the year, TV revenue grew double digits. That was primarily due to significant growth in licensing revenue, including the domestic licensing of Two Broke Girls, Big Bang Theory, Person of Interest, Seinfeld and Friends. We also continue to see increasing demand and strong pricing around the globe for Warner's hit content. So we remain encouraged by the strong secular trends in the TV business. 
Turning to video games, where we had difficult comparisons in the quarter against LEGO Batman 3 and Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor. Even so, we posted record video games revenue of close to $1.5 billion for the year. And with the great IP and strong franchises at Warner's, we're confident we can continue to grow our games business over time. 
Theatrically, we knew 2015 would be a challenging year, given the lack of any core franchise releases and the comparison against the end of The Hobbit trilogy, as well as the releases of The LEGO Movie and Godzilla. So as expected, revenues declined for both the quarter and the year. 
Looking ahead, 2016 will mark the beginning of an ambitious slate of franchise movies, including at least 17 releases from our DC, LEGO and World of Harry Potter franchises through 2020. So we feel great about the outlook for our theatrical business in 2016 and beyond. 
Across theatrical and TV, home entertainment revenue declined 10% for the year due to continued weakness in physical sales, in particular, catalog releases and lower carryover revenue. However, digital trends remained healthy, with EST growing in the high teens for Warner's. 
On the expense side and in line with the enterprise-wide focus on cost efficiency, Warner's reduced SG&A by 2% for the year, and that included significant savings from the 2014 restructuring actions. 
So on the whole, Warner's had a terrific year. And with the momentum at our TV and Games businesses and an ambitious franchise film slate set for the next several years, we're in great position to drive attractive growth at Warner's for the foreseeable future. 
Turning to the next slide. We generated very healthy free cash of $3.6 billion in 2015, converting over 90% of our earnings into cash. The year-over-year increase was due to the growth in adjusted operating income and lower cash taxes. And that was despite the increase in working capital as a result of increased content investments across our divisions and severance payments related to the restructuring initiatives in 2014. Our cash taxes declined, primarily due to the timing of tax legislation and the related payments. 
Looking to 2016, we expect another year of solid growth in free cash flow, driven by strong profit growth and continued high conversion. 
Now looking at our balance sheet. We ended 2015 with $21.6 billion of net debt, up $1.8 billion from the end of 2014. That's primarily a result of our continued commitment to direct returns to shareholders. 
During 2015, we repurchased $3.6 billion in shares, and combined with our dividend, returned $4.8 billion to shareholders. And as Jeff noted earlier, the board authorized a 15% increase in our dividend and up to $5 billion in share repurchases, reinforcing our commitment to provide direct returns to shareholders. 
During the year, we took advantage of favorable market conditions to strengthen our balance sheet by issuing $3.8 billion of long-term debt, including our first euro-denominated debt offering. We also extended the maturity of our revolving bank credit facilities through the end of 2020. Meanwhile, we retired $2 billion of debt in the year as a result of a maturity and a tender offer and redemption of higher-priced debt. 
And on the investment front, we spent close to $700 million, about half of which is related to our real estate project at Hudson Yards. We expect to invest a similar amount in that project in 2016. 
We ended the year with a net leverage ratio at approximately 2.85x, just above our target level. Looking forward, we plan to return to our target leverage ratio of 2.75x over the next few quarters, and we don't anticipate a change in either that target level or our capital allocation philosophy, which will remain focused on investments back into our businesses, targeted M&A and consistent direct returns to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. 
With that, let's move on to the final slide, which looks at our outlook for 2016. 2016 marks the start of what we anticipate will be a strong content cycle across the company, and that should translate into an acceleration in revenue and adjusted operating income growth and another year of strong growth in adjusted EPS. 
At Turner, we expect another strong year as we take advantage of faster revenue growth and continued cost efficiencies to increase investment for the future. 
As I mentioned earlier, Subscription revenue growth should accelerate meaningfully, and advertising revenue should benefit from a strong ad market, continued momentum at CNN, including from its election coverage, and airing the NCAA championship game for the first time. And at the same time, we're planning for higher programming and marketing expenses tied primarily to the NCAA championship game and the start of our new NBA deal in 4Q, as well as election coverage at CNN and investments in originals related to the brand repositioning at both TBS and TNT. We remain focused on continuing to efficiently manage overhead expenses to help fund these initiatives. 
At HBO, we also expect faster growth in Subscription revenue in 2016, driven by continued subscriber gains, including from HBO NOW, and improved monetization of our subscriber base. Over the next couple of years, we would expect that to take HBO's Subscription revenue growth into the high single digits. That will be balanced against investments associated with HBO's slate of new originals, as well as the new programming targeted for digital platforms. We will also continue to invest in marketing and technology to drive growth on HBO's digital platform. 
At Warner Bros., we'll kick off our slate of franchise films with the release of Batman v Superman, Suicide Squad and the first of Jo Rowling's Fantastic Beast films. And while we're facing challenging comparisons in TV licensing and video games, we expect both businesses to continue to deliver healthy results. 
In addition, we remain focused on driving margin expansion through efficiency measures and the transition to digital. So all in all, we expect very strong growth and another record year at Warner. 
So looking across all 3 segments, we're set up for a very good year from an operating perspective. That's despite an estimated year-over-year FX drag of approximately $125 million on adjusted operating income and approximately $0.15 on adjusted EPS, which we have factored into our outlook. 
And if we look back relative to the expectations we shared with you at our Investor Day, the FX drag on adjusted EPS in 2016 is in the range of $0.55 to $0.60. Absent that, we would be on track for the close to $6 in adjusted EPS we shared with you then. 
In terms of the cadence of the year, we expect our earnings to be weighted toward the back half as a result of the timing of both our film slate and marketing investments at HBO and Turner. 
Putting all that together, we expect another very good year in 2016, which is reflected in our outlook for adjusted EPS of $5.30 to $5.40, and that incorporates continued investments in high-quality video content and new business models and capabilities that should position the company to continue to drive very attractive growth for the next several years and beyond. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Mike to start the Q&A."

We are not yet out on 2 major platforms, PlayStation and Xbox, which for example on HBO GO, account for over 20% of viewing. And we've not yet put out the content like Jon Stewart, Bill Simmons, VICE daily news show, that we think is particularly suited for those platforms. And that, of course, will catalyze a great deal of marketing, digitally and otherwise, which we think will drive subscription. So we're very excited about where we are.

There's another $50 million-or-so of charges at HBO, and that was tied to some series that we decided not to move forward with, which happens occasionally. So in the quarter, it was about $180 million of charges. As far as the taxes and the buyback. I would say the tax rate in '16 will actually go up versus '15. That's in part because we saw some fourth quarter benefits that lowered the rate overall for '15. So I think if you look forward, you should see a tax rate that might be up a couple of hundred basis points, more in line with what we had in the first 3 quarters of 2015. In terms of buybacks, as always, that's going to depend on what our free cash flow generation is and what other alternative uses of capital are. But given that we ended the year at about 2.85x, which was above our target leverage of 2.75x, I would expect that the buyback would come down a bit versus 2015 levels."

Let's start with what you were talking about in terms of either syndication sales, windows, et cetera. We're not ideological about syndication windows, that depend on evolution and a lot of factors.

We're not ideological about syndication windows, that depend on evolution and a lot of factors. But I think the overriding point everybody ought to focus on is that it's becoming crystal clear that consumers want the ability to watch their favorite show, their favorite network on demand, across whatever platform they are watching, whatever window it is. Whether it's a new show, current season, whether it's a 1- or 2-year old show, they want to see it on demand. We want to make sure our networks have the flexibility to meet that consumer demand. Now if you look at HBO, perfect example. HBO has, for many years, provided on-demand access to almost all the content, multiple seasons, that it's ever produced. Some of the new entrants in the business that have VOD as a primary feature have also put multiple seasons on. The Turner networks are committed to delivering more programming on demand across their distribution channels, that's whether you get it in a new bundle over-the-top, whether you get it through a traditional distributor. And Warner's already sells broad suites of rights when partners are interested in them. And of course, Warner sells to every kind of network, broadcast, premium, cable, over-the-top subscription VOD services. So the overriding development, which is a good development, is that consumers want VOD on whatever show or window they're watching. And we're basically moving to satisfy consumer demand. Now your second question, which is what has to happen and not just in our company. And I think we've been pretty clear about what we said, is that distributors need to be able to offer more on-demand functionality. We see them moving quite rapidly now to do that. You can look at interfaces and on-demand offerings at Comcast. You can see new bundles and moves at Verizon or Sling. And I think Sony has a new product. I think you're going to see ever-increasing innovation across the distribution platforms, over the top and in traditional distribution package offerings. So this consumer demand is going to be satisfied, and it's basically going to be good for any brand, any network or any show that has strong consumer resonance, and that's why we think that it's very good for our very concentrated suite of networks at Turner and HBO, and we think it's very good for the world's leading producer of TV shows and films, which is Warner Bros. He had one more question, what was it?"

There's CNN, which is the leader in mobile news, and you're seeing very strong growth in CNN in all digital platforms, but certainly in mobile, and domestically and internationally, by the way. You have the launch of Great Big Story, that's already with 170 million video views in just the first few months.

So I think this is a win-win, and whether they want to market and bundle NOW or whether they want to do skinny bundles or basic packages or triple plays, there's growth opportunities for them and parenthetical growth opportunities for us. That's what we're excited about."

We're seeing very strong demand for the NBA and for the NCAA men's basketball championship. We're also seeing great strength in the kids market and I think we're taking share there. In terms of the overall ad market, I think you're seeing a few things that are contributing to the buoyancy and the vibrancy of the market. Number one, the strength of scatter all throughout 2015 means that if you sat out the upfront, you paid for it in the scatter market. So we're looking ahead and we think all indicators would seem to suggest that this year's upfront is going to be particularly strong. And I think that's going to reverse what's been a couple of years of being not so strong. So I think there is a recognition that TV is still the best reach medium and the most effective option for brand advertisers to convey their message. And so there's going to be a lot of innovation happening in advertising. We want to lead the market there. But we feel really good about where things are right now."

So thanks, everyone, and good morning. Welcome to Time Warner's First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. This morning, we issued 2 press releases, one detailing our results for the first quarter, and the other reaffirming our 2016 full year business outlook.
Before we begin, there are 2 items I need to cover.  First, we refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Schedules setting out reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our earnings release and trending schedules. These reconciliations are available on our website at www.timewarner.com/investors. Reconciliations of our expected future financial performance are also included in the business outlook release that is available on our website.
Second, today's announcement includes certain forward-looking statements, which are based on management's current expectations. Actual results may vary materially from those expressed or implied by these statements due to various factors. These factors are discussed in detail in Time Warner's SEC filings, including its most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. Time Warner is under no obligation and, in fact, expressly disclaims any obligation to update or alter its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
I'll now turn the call over to Jeff Bewkes, Time Warner's Chairman and CEO, who'll be followed by Howard Averill, Time Warner's CFO. After their prepared remarks, our divisional CEOs, John Martin, Richard Plepler and Kevin  will join us for a Q&A session. Jeff?"
24689,329051687,972038,"Time Warner Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 04, 2016",2016-05-04,"Earnings Calls","Warner Media, LLC","Executives","Thanks, Mike, and thanks, everybody, for listening in, staying on the call through our medical report at the beginning. We told you on our last call that we expected 2016 to be another standout year for Time Warner. And in recent years, as you all know, w",1579,"Thanks, Mike, and thanks, everybody, for listening in, staying on the call through our medical report at the beginning. We told you on our last call that we expected 2016 to be another standout year for Time Warner. And in recent years, as you all know, we have been investing aggressively in the very best content while moving quickly to take advantage of new distribution opportunities that are emerging around the world. At the same time, we've maintained our disciplined approach to cost control and capital allocation in order to maximize shareholder returns. And we anticipate that, that combination would allow us to continue to deliver industry-leading performance. That's exactly what you're seeing in our first quarter results. Revenues increased 3% to $7.3 billion and adjusted operating income grew 11% to $2 billion. Adjusted earnings per share grew 25% to $1.49 per share, and we also returned over $1 billion to shareholders in share repurchases and dividends. In addition to strong financial results, we're off to a tremendous start this year from a content perspective. In just the past few weeks, we've had the buzzer-beating final game of March Madness in TBS; CNN's must-watch election coverage; a global hit from Warner Bros. in Batman versus Superman; and the return of HBO's epic series, Game of Thrones. Those are just a few examples of how our investments are translating into great content that deeply engages audiences across platforms and around the world. But there are many more. Let me start with Turner. Once again, Turner had 3 of the top 10 basic cable networks in the U.S., and it continued to make progress on a multiyear transformation of its brands. The first quarter marked the start of TBS' repositioning as for young flesh comedy, with the successful premieres of Full Frontal with Samantha Bee and Separation Anxiety. We follow those up last month with our new hit, The Detour. It's the biggest new comedy on cable this year. The early results are very encouraging with TBS ending the first quarter ranked as the #1 ad-supported cable network in primetime among adults 18-49. And we have a number of additional distinctive shows on this year, including Rex, which will debut next month. The first quarter also marked the start of an acceleration in Turner's domestic affiliate revenue growth, which we've been talking to you about now for some time. That acceleration underscores the strength of the Turner brands and the investments we have been making in them in recent years. One of our most important investments was March Madness. And last March, Turner brought the championship game of the tournament to cable for the very first time. This year's Turner was another great success towards sterling finale and record revenue. Recently, we agreed to build on that success by partnering with CBS to extend our television, digital and marketing rights to the NCAA tournament all the way through 2032. Marquee live sports continue to grow in importance, both the consumers and advertisers. And combined with our extensive multiplatform rights, that gives us a lot of confidence we'll be able to generate a very attractive return on our investment in this unique property. As March Madness wound down, the NBA playoffs are just getting started. The NBA on TNT grew viewership double digits in the first quarter. And with the playoffs underway, we have a great platform for TNT's own drama-focused brand refresh, which starts with Animal Kingdom from Warner Bros. in June. Nowhere Turner's transformation more evidence than CNN, which more than doubled its primetime audience in the first quarter. CNN's ratings benefited from its unrivaled coverage of the U.S. presidential race as well as from its continued success with original series. Those 2 areas overlapped in raise for the White House, which premiered as the most-watched CNN original telecast ever. Home Box Office, I mentioned Game of Thrones already, which grew its opening viewership double digits versus a year ago on a cross-platform basis. But it doesn't stop there. That same weekend, HBO was most to Beyonce's headline grabbing virtual album, lemonade. Also, television premiere of Jurassic World, a world championship boxing match and the return of our 2 lead comedies, feet and Silicon Valley. It was a great example of the range and quality of the content that HBO delivers to its subs. We're just as excited for what's still to come this year at HBO, including the second season of Ballers, that's our new series. It started last year. A new series, Divorce, with Sarah Jessica Parker; and our limited series, The Night Out, which has debuted a Film Festival. At Warner Bros, Batman versus Superman Dawn of Justice, set a record for a March opening weekend, and is already Warner's biggest ever first quarter release. Even better, it's only the opening chapter of an exciting slate of DC Entertainment films that we think will captivate audiences globally for years to come. Next up is Suicide Squad this summer, followed by LEGO Batman, Wonder Woman and Justice league, all in 2017. And as you know, these franchise films are the cornerstone of a strategy that's making DC a growth driver across film, television, digital, games and consumer products. Warner has a lot more on deck, including JK Rowling's return to the big screen this November with Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. Judging by the huge crowds since the opening last month of the Wizarding World of Harry Potter attraction in Hollywood, there are plenty of fans who were just excited as we are for the next installment of this great franchise. 
In television, Warner has built on its leading position in broadcast with 3 of the top 5 new series this season. That includes not only scripted series like the #1 new show, Blindspot, but also in scripted series like Little Big Shots, which is already been picked up in 2 major international territories. Given a performance of Warner's current shows, with a record 21 renewals ahead of the upfront this year and a strong slate of pilots, Warner's is in a great position to once again lead the industry in broadcast series programming this coming year. And we're also expanding our production for cable and over-the-top services. We have twice the number of new series delivered for next year. So across the company, we are continuing to lead the way of producing groundbreaking content. And to capitalize on the rapid shift to on-demand consumption and broadband delivery of video, we're focused on innovation, both in the type of content we produce and how we get it to consumers. For example, on May 24, Turner is launching . That's our professional competitive gaming league in partnership with WME | IMG. In addition to its telecast on the TBS, eLeague will have a significant digital component and partnership with Twitch. eLeague reflects Turner's commitment to creating and delivering content for multiplatform audience. That commitment is also reflected in Turner's other efforts to grow its presence outside the traditional television ecosystem, particularly in news and sports. CNN finished the quarter as the leading digital news brand in multiplatform video, and Bleacher Report remained the #2 online sports destination. We'll be ramping up investments in both of these properties over the next couple of years to further expand of their leadership positions. 
HBO is also investing in content geared towards digital audiences by bringing on board channels like Bill Simmons and Jon Stewart. Any given Wednesday with Bill Simmons is not to be viewed until next month. But Bill is already making his mark with HBO's first after the drama. Like the Animals, after the thrones is debuting first and HBO NOW and HBO GO. We continue to see significant growth in both users and usage of our digital platforms, and we expect that to continue with our recent expansion of HBO Now to Microsoft's Xbox and to Samsung Smart TVs. We're also expanding the reach of HBO's OTT products internationally. In the first quarter, HBO LAG launched an OTT service in Mexico, and HBO announced plans for OTT launches later this year in Spain, Brazil and Argentina. That's all part of a broader push across the company to develop new services and capabilities. We talked to you previously about Warner's SVOD investments in Asia. In February, Warner Bros. announced the acquisition of Drama Fever to further bolster our OTT capabilities. And just last week, Turner announced its first domestic Xbox service, Film Struck, which will build on the curation expertise of Tcf to targeted enthusiasts of independent, foreign and art house films. At the same time, we're deeply committed to strengthening our core networks and to helping our traditional distribution and network partners improve their products to satisfy consumers' desire for on-demand content. HBO and Turner have been at the forefront of providing multiplatform rights to our partners. And in March, Warners announced  a new deal granting ABC network in-season stacking rights for its new series. So we're making progress on many fronts, both inside and outside the traditional ecosystem. We're seeing the benefits of strong execution of our strategy and how that can continue to deliver superior returns for our shareholders. We've also ramped up our investments and our pace of innovation to meet the high expectations of today's and tomorrow's consumers. And that's why we're so confident about the rest of 2016 and beyond. Thanks for listening, and let me turn it over to Howard Averill."

I'll begin by referring to the first slide of our presentation, which is now available on our website. Starting with consolidated results. We're off to a terrific start in 2016 with growth across each of our divisions. And that resulted in a quarterly record for adjusted operating income, which reached over $2 billion and a 25% increase in adjusted EPS. Total revenues grew 3% and adjusted operating income was up a very healthy 11%, with margins expanding to 100 basis points. And we did that while continuing to grow our investments in programming and marketing at HBO and Turner. That was balanced by lower cost at Warner Bros, mainly due to the timing of our theatrical slate and by our continued company-wide focus on constraining growth and overhead costs. And we're able to once again leverage our positive operating results into even faster growth and adjusted EPS. That was partly due to our ongoing share repurchase program. During the quarter, we bought back $700 million of our shares and combined with our dividend, we've returned close to $1.3 billion to shareholders year-to-date. This morning, we reaffirmed our guidance for 2016 adjusted EPS to be in the range of $5.30 to $5.40. So we're pleased with how we're executing and have significant operating momentum across our businesses, which gives us great confidence in our outlook for the rest of this year and beyond. 
Now turning to the segment highlights. I'll start at Turner. With a benefit from our domestic affiliate renewal cycle and continued strong advertising performance resulting in our best quarter of revenue growth in almost 3 years and record adjusted operating income. Subscription revenues were up a strong 11% in the quarter. And that included a close to 300 basis point headwind from FX. Domestic Subscription revenues grew close to 15% as we benefited from the higher rates we achieved in our recent affiliate agreements. Excluding a 15 percentage point drag from FX, international subscription revenue growth within the high single-digit. While there may be quarter-to-quarter fluctuations due to a variety of factors, domestic sub revenue growth is on track to be in the low-teens for the year, and we expect total subscription revenue growth to the rest of the year to be similar to the first quarter. Advertising was up a solid 5% despite approximately 150 basis points of headwind from FX. Domestic advertising grew in the mid-single digits. That was due to double-digit growth across Time Warner's for both news and sports, including strong growth from the NCAA tournament. International advertising was also healthy in the quarter, up high single digits, excluding a close to 15 percentage point drag from FX. Looking to the second quarter, scatter pricing at our domestic entertainment networks continues to be up well in double digits versus the upfront, and will benefit from the NCAA championship game while FX remains a headwind. As a result, we expect total advertising revenue growth to be in the mid- to high single digits. And with a healthy ad market, continue to grow our industry-leading advance advertising products and momentum in many of our brands, every indication points to a very strong upfront this year. Adjusted operating income increased 10% and margins expanded 100 basis points. And we achieve that even as we continue to invest in programming and marketing as Turner kept all other expenses close to flat in the quarter. Programming expenses increased 4% mainly due to lower investments and sports and election coverage, and marketing costs were up well into the double digits to support TBS and TNT re-brands. So Turner is off to a terrific start in 2016 and is well-positioned for another strong year. And we're confident that the investments were making across our brands will enhance our competitive position and allow us to sustain strong revenue trends and attractive financial results in the future.
Turning now to HBO where we continue to see very strong global demand for the product in the form of both subscriber growth and content licensing. Domestic subscription revenue growth was in the mid-single digits, that included a sequential increase from the benefit from HBO NOW. However, despite year-over-year subscriber growth, we continue to experience headwinds from fewer revenue-generating subscribers at certain MVPDs, which has been partially driven by M&A activity. Over time, we actually see an opportunity to help those partners grow those businesses while accelerating our own revenue growth. Content and other revenue increased 23% in the quarter. That was mainly due to higher international licensing revenues as HBO continues to benefit from its ability to effectively monetize its original content around the world. Across HBO's international networks, including unconsolidated JVs, revenues were up in the double digits, excluding the impact of FX. And international subscriber trends remained strong with healthy growth across all regions, especially LatAm and Europe. Adjusted operating income was up 6% in the quarter, and that was despite a double-digit increase in programming costs as well as continued investments in marketing and technology related to HBO NOW. Increase in programming expenses related to new original programming like Vinyl and Sesame Street as well as programming charges related to series and development. Over HBO if off to a great start to of the year. We're excited about our upcoming programming lineup and we continued investments in the brand and product, we're in a great position to capitalize on the significant global opportunities for premium services.
Moving on to Warner Bros were we posted record first quarter adjusted operating income. On the TV side, we benefited from higher international licensing revenues and that our games business, the continued success of our LEGO and Mortal Kombat franchises helped drive another quarter of double-digit revenue growth. Despite the strong best of Batman versus Superman late in the quarter, total revenues were down modestly due to the difficult theatrical comparisons from last year's release of American Sniper and carryover from the final installment of The Hobbit. Across theatrical and TV, home entertainment revenues were down 12% as last year's quarter benefited from the home video release of the final Hobbit. Despite the difficult comparisons, ESD revenues were still up mid-single digits in the quarter, and we expect our home entertainment trends to improve in the back half of the year as a result of stronger theatrical slate. Adjusted operating income grew close to 30%. In addition to our strong games performance, we also benefited from lower PNA spending as a result of fewer releases this quarter. So Warner Bros. has great momentum, and we're just getting started on the theatrical side with Suicide Squad and Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, leading what should be a very strong lineup for both the remainder of this year and many years to come. Along with our strength in television and video games, that gives us great confidence and Warner's ability to continue delivering attractive growth well into the future. 
Turning to the next slide. Free cash flow totaled over $700 million, which was down from a year ago due to a significant increase in working capital. That is largely related to increased production spend at Warner Bros. as well as the performance of its theatrical product in the fourth quarter of last year and the related impact on accounts receivables. Even so, we still expect very strong cash flow in 2016, driven by strong profit growth and another year of high conversion. Now looking at our balance sheet. We ended the first quarter with $22 billion of net debt, up $500 million compared to the end of 2015. That's primarily a result of our ongoing commitment to direct returns to shareholders, which is a key component of our balanced approach to capital allocation. We ended the quarter just above our target leverage ratio of 2.75x. But we remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and our investment grade credit rating and are on track to return to our target by the end of this year. With that, let's move on to the final slide, which looks at our outlook for 2016. We got off to a strong start in the first quarter, delivering growth across each of our businesses and setting us up for another very good year. That's reflected in our outlook for adjusted EPS of $5.30 to $5.40, which we reaffirm this morning. And based on current rates, that includes an estimated $0.10 headwind from foreign exchange. 
Looking ahead, we still expect growth in adjusted OI to be weighted towards the back half of the year. Specifically in the second quarter, we continue to see positive trends in both advertising and subscription revenue. And global demand for our content remains very strong. But there are several items that we expect to weight on adjusted operating income, including the timing of content licensing revenue, the comparison to strong video games profits at Warner's and last year's quarters, and programming investments at Turner. Despite that, we're on track for another year of very healthy growth and adjusted operating income and solid double-digit earnings growth, extending our history of delivering consistently strong operating and financial performance. And with Turner's revenue trends accelerating, HBO's position to accelerate its subscription revenue growth over the next couple of years, and Warner's and early stages of exciting theatrical slate, we feel we are in great position to continue delivering strong results for many years to come.

And so, I mean, if you think about it, Kevin Reilly as the Head of our Entertainment Networks, has been on the job for about 1 year. And it's really his new programming slate that's just beginning to roll out. We debuted 24 new seasons of owned original series in our domestic networks in the first quarter alone. And we have 20 more slated for the second quarter. And in  this new series, hopefully, give you a small sense for the bold-type quality and engage in programming that you expect from Turner going forward, we are very happy with her critical acclaim and the performance of these new shows are demonstrating across, frankly, all platforms: TV, digital and social. And just to add a little bit more flavor to that, I mean, premiering Angie Tribeca in a very fair with a 25-hour commercial pre-marathon brought about 36% of new young audiences to network. Median age was about 10-year younger about our TBS median. The continued success regular season right, and it ranked #1 on Monday nights across all of cable sitcoms. I think it was Jeff that said who couldn't be more pleased than that with the success of Detour, which recently premiered, and is reaching over 5 million viewers per episode across all of our TBS platforms, and it's ranked #1 of the new comedy releases in adults aged 18-49. Full Frontal with Samantha Bee huge critical and commercial success across all platforms. We're reaching around 3.5 million viewers and we're driving 30 million views on the show's YouTube channel. And that's really just TBS. 
During the first quarter, we have new seasons of Impractical Jokers. And for those we Cartoon Network and the Race for the White House is on CNN. So we're driving, I think, a general improvement in the quality of our original programming across all of our networks. And we've got a lot more to come. And most notably, the TV -- the TNT rebrand will begin later this year. And Jeff mentioned some of the shows that we're really excited about. With respect to the upfront, I just would reiterate the enthusiasm that Howard suggested, which is that given the strong scatter, we're seeing some of our inventory sell for upwards of 30% to 50% higher than last year's upfront levels. And given low cancellations, we think all signs point to frankly the best upfront we would've seen in years. And we think our networks gained at least our fair share of what happens in the upfront. And we think it spells very, very well for just television in general as television is experiencing resurgence in the minds of brand advertisers as we're delivering reach and increasing targeting an audience capabilities. So very, very optimistic."

We're spending a lot of work, a lot of time, investment and increasing our capabilities and advertising. And frankly, we're holding ourselves accountable to lead the charge to modernize TV advertising by combining the unparalleled reach of television with the engaged -- and the engagement of TV with the measurement and targeting capabilities of digital. And we're quickly evolving the advertising industry to simultaneously benefit our advertisers as well as improve our overall consumer experience. And we don't see these goals as being mutually exclusive. Frankly, what we're trying to do is combine the best of both TV and digital, uniting scale and targeting a top-tier -- with top-tier content. As one of the reasons why we are very bullish about the upfront. In terms of our own new products, we've discussed before that we have built on the Turner which is the central depository of all of our consumer information. And that's helping us launch new innovative products that focus on analytics, targeting on ROIs. So just the products we got individual products called targeting now, Audience Now, ROI Now, Provable ROI. All that means it's going to be targeting audience-based selling coupled with our data cloud and client insights. And I think they are going to be increasing opportunities overtime and that's going to be a major, major focus in our upfronts. And then I think you asked specifically with respect to OTT. I think the opportunities to develop advanced targeting capabilities in OTT are absolutely there. They're available. That is assuming that the OTT offering is in fact ad-supported which is our first domestic offering is going to be non-ad-supported, which is consistent return of Turner Classic Movies. So I think the targeting opportunities will only grow over time, and we're still very, very -- in the very early stages. So we believe that TV advertising has to evolve but it's going to remain the most effective option for brand advertisers to convey the message at scale. And that's why we expect the resurgence in TV advertising beginning at this year's upfront."

Any if you think about subscription VOD, it's been an opportunity that started with the first Xbox service, which is called HBO, a long time ago. And while we're retching happen and I think it probably start with HBO ago is consumers want to expect there going to demand SVOD access to all their favorite networks, all their favorite shows. And what we've been seeing as an evolution is that on-demand functionality and better guys are sprouting up first in HBO, then in some of the broadband-delivered services and increasingly, you're seeing more full on-demand offerings of current exhibition networks and better interfaces and recommendation engines in places like Comcast, Verizon, . And for us, with our networks, whether it's the Turner networks or the HBO networks, we've long said that moved like our networks and their program, including the debuts of current 4 season exhibitions like what John is talking about and what Rich has been doing for years at HBO. We want them to be on-demand, and we would like to see most of our networks, whichever exhibition first-run or syndication to be on-demand. And we're basically in an enviable position networks, Turner and HBO, are among the most desired networks for consumers, and, therefore, to be included in all these packages. So you'll hear, I think increasingly, of different packages with different network offerings that consumers can choose between at different price points available from existing cable, satellite and telco distributors, increasingly from new virtual distributors, whether it be Hulu, whether it's Amazon, Apple. Whoever comes in and crates packages for consumers. So I think what you're seeing is a very vibrant rebirth of the strength of TV networks and TV programming across all of these distribution platforms. And because of our -- we've always taken the position being the first to launch VOD that we think more of it is better for consumers. And therefore, we're going to try to be available in all the packages consumers are interested in."

And when you have a highly concentrated portfolio of must-have networks which we do, where we've got 85% of our affiliate revenues in 4 networks, I think it's a really advantageous place to be. So I think, I'll leave it at that because obviously, we're not going to specifically comment on any particular consolidation. And then with respect to eLeague, look, this is one of the innovations with respect to content that I think we're particularly excited about and proud of. And it's really -- it's not necessarily by design that we're looking to take digitals content and move it to the TV. It's more just really trying to position the company to be where consumers are. And looking at secular growth areas and in looking at areas where particularly young people are spending tremendous amounts of time, you obviously have to pay attention to the gaming industry but this whole notion of very significant population of individuals were really excited to sit and watch professional gamers and some of the best gamers in the world, that's already happening. It's happening globally. And in some countries, it represents some of the highest levels of consumption of video content. So in some respects, having eLeague be aired on TBS is somewhat of an experiment. I think we're going to learn a lot this year.

Documentaries, miniseries, half hours, hours, original films, sports programming. And as I've said before, division of programming is to build as many addicts as we can out there in the consumer base and different people love different things. So you have huge Silicon Valley past, huge Oliver Spence, huge sports fans. So we'll like the way we are big enough our choices. And a lot of this, of course,'s informative talent it comes through the door. Somebody comes in with a renowned idea for an additional half hour, we're not going to say no to wait because we have a certain number that we think is a seeming. That's not how we make choices. Terms of HBO NOW, what we have done is we bought in our programming with decisions like Johnston words and VICE News. I think Bill Simmons will work across all platforms. So again, that opportunities to be not constrained by schedule is opening up a lot of creativity in the part of our talent were coming in literally every week with new ideas. So you're going to see more and more of that going forward. So listen, would like our mix.

So you do have affiliates, cable affiliates who are growing subs in penetration. And the reason basically is there offering very effective packages of VOD. They've got various packages of different network bundles for consumer. They've got that guide interfaces. So you have a fairly large disparity in performance between distributors. And I think if you look at the high-performance we see where the future can go. And the fact that you now have more VOD offerings in different packages and in price plants, is basically, I think -- we've seen it happen. It's going to increase penetration. The consumers are going to find more packages that suit what they want. And in most cases, that'll be the biggest and largest packages for the big networks. But not in all cases. So I think you're going to see -- and remember, with extent you have some marketing of VOD products and broadband delivery with good navigation. It basically increases consumer -- consumer recognition for powerful networks like CNN, TNT, HBO. All of that has kind of a national effect of increasing the presence of TV networks because all age groups increasingly now are finding the favorite programs offered the way they want them. They find a way to the networks if we sell them in the right distribution offering."

And I think further to what Jeff has said, as affiliates, whether they're traditional or nontraditional affiliates, put up packages are smaller packages of better networks at lower economic price points, we're going to be able to attract back households into the multichannel ecosystem that have, finally, moved away because they don't see the value of bundles.

Some people are going to look deep with the same passion that other people will look at Silicon Valley. So this is a very subjective determination. We've been doing it for a long time. We think we have pretty good instincts about how to build a large variety in our slate, which appeals to a huge part of our consumer base. There's no exact science to it. And obviously critical acclaim plays a role. But we have a very good collective instinct inside the company when we think something is resonating with a particular part of our audience.

This morning, we issued 2 press releases, one detailing our results for the first quarter; and the other reaffirming our 2016 full year business outlook.
Before we begin, there are 2 items I need to cover. First, we refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Schedules setting out reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our earnings release and trending schedules. These reconciliations are available on our website at www.timewarner.com/investors. Reconciliations of our expected future financial performance are also included in the business outlook release that is available on our website.
Second, today's announcement includes certain forward-looking statements, which are based on management's current expectations. Actual results may vary materially from those expressed or implied by these statements due to various factors. These factors are discussed in detail in Time Warner's SEC filings, including its most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. Time Warner is under no obligation and, in fact, expressly disclaims any obligation to update or alter its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
I'll now turn the call over to Jeff Bewkes, Time Warner's Chairman and CEO, who'll be followed by Howard Averill, Time Warner's CFO. After their prepared remarks, our divisional CEOs, John Martin, Richard Plepler and Kevin Tsujihara will join us for a Q&A session.

And in recent years, as you all know, w",1596,"Thanks, Mike, and thanks, everybody, for listening in, staying on the call through our medical report at the beginning. We told you on our last call that we expected 2016 to be another standout year for Time Warner. And in recent years, as you all know, we have been investing aggressively in the very best content while moving quickly to take advantage of new distribution opportunities that are emerging around the world. At the same time, we've maintained our disciplined approach to cost control and capital allocation in order to maximize shareholder returns. And we anticipate that, that combination would allow us to continue to deliver industry-leading performance.
That's exactly what you're seeing in our first quarter results. Revenues increased 3% to $7.3 billion and adjusted operating income grew 11% to $2 billion. Adjusted earnings per share grew 25% to $1.49 per share, and we also returned over $1 billion to shareholders in share repurchases and dividends.
In addition to strong financial results, we're off to a tremendous start this year from a content perspective. In just the past few weeks, we've had the buzzer-beating final game of March Madness on TBS; CNN's must-watch election coverage; a global hit from Warner Bros. in Batman v Superman; and the return of HBO's epic series, Game of Thrones. Those are just a few examples of how our investments are translating into great content that deeply engages audiences across platforms and around the world. But there are many more. Let me start with Turner.
Once again, Turner had 3 of the top 10 basic cable networks in the U.S., and it continued to make progress on a multiyear transformation of its brands. The first quarter marked the start of TBS's repositioning as the place for young, fresh comedy with the successful premieres of Angie Tribeca, Full Frontal with Samantha Bee and Separation Anxiety. We followed those up last month with our new hit, The Detour. It's the biggest new comedy on cable this year. The early results are very encouraging with TBS ending the first quarter ranked as the #1 ad-supported cable network in prime time among adults 18 to 49. And we have a number of additional distinctive shows on tap this year, including Rex Wrecked, which will debut next month.
The first quarter also marked the start of an acceleration in Turner's domestic affiliate revenue growth, which we've been talking to you about now for some time. That acceleration underscores the strength of the Turner brands and the investments we have been making in them in recent years. One of our most important investments was March Madness. And last March, Turner brought the championship game of the tournament to cable for the very first time. This year's tournament was another great success towards in both the sterling finale and record revenue. Recently, we agreed to build on that success by partnering with CBS to extend our television, digital and marketing rights to the NCAA tournament all the way through 2032. Marquee live sports continue to grow in importance, both to consumers and advertisers. And combined with our extensive multi-platform rights, that gives us a lot of confidence we'll be able to generate a very attractive return on our investment in this unique property.
As March Madness wound down, the NBA playoffs were just getting started. The NBA on TNT grew viewership double digits in the first quarter. And with the playoffs underway, we have a great platform for TNT's own drama-focused brand refresh, which starts with Animal Kingdom from Warner Bros. in June. Nowhere has Turner's transformation more evident than at CNN, which more than doubled its prime time audience in the first quarter. CNN's ratings benefited from its unrivaled coverage of the U.S. presidential race as well as from its continued success with original series. Those 2 areas overlapped in Race for the White House, which premiered as the most-watched CNN original telecast ever.
Over at Home Box Office, I mentioned Game of Thrones already, which grew its opening viewership double digits versus a year ago on a cross-platform basis. But it doesn't stop there. That same weekend, HBO was host to Beyoncé's headline-grabbing visual album, Lemonade; also, the television premiere of Jurassic World; a world championship boxing match; and the return of our 2 hit comedies, Veep and Silicon Valley. It's -- it was a great example of the range and quality of the content that HBO delivers to its subs. We're just as excited for what's still to come this year at HBO, including the second season of Ballers, that's our new series, started last year; a new series, Divorce, with Sarah Jessica Parker; and our limited series, THE NIGHT OF, which just previewed to a tremendous reception at the Tribeca Film Festival.
At Warner Bros., Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice set a record for a March opening weekend, and it's already Warner's biggest-ever first quarter release. Even better, it's only the opening chapter of an exciting slate of DC Entertainment films that we think will captivate audiences globally for years to come. Next up is Suicide Squad this summer, followed by LEGO Batman, Wonder Woman and Justice League, all in 2017. And as you know, these franchise films are the cornerstone of a strategy that's making DC a growth driver across film, television, digital, games and consumer products. Warner's has a lot more on deck, including J.K. Rowling's return to the big screen this November with Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. Judging by the huge crowd since the opening last month of The Wizarding World of Harry Potter attraction in Hollywood, there are plenty of fans who are just excited as we are for the next installment of this great franchise.
In television, Warner's has built on its leading position in broadcast with 3 of the top 5 new series this season. That includes not only scripted series like the #1 new show, Blindspot, but also unscripted series like Little Big Shots, which has already been picked up in 2 major international territories. Given the performance of Warner's current shows with a record 21 renewals ahead of the Upfront this year and a strong slate of pilots, Warner's is in a great position to once again lead the industry in broadcast series programming this coming season. And we're also expanding our production for cable and over-the-top services. We have twice the number of new series orders for next season. So across the company, we're continuing to lead the way of producing groundbreaking content.
And to capitalize on the rapid shift to on-demand consumption and broadband delivery of video, we're focused on innovation, both in the type of content we produce and how we get it to consumers. For example, on May 24, Turner is launching ELEAGUE, that's our professional competitive gaming league, in partnership with WME | IMG. In addition to its telecast on the TBS, ELEAGUE will have a significant digital component and partnership with Twitch. ELEAGUE reflects Turner's commitment to creating and delivering content for multi-platform audiences. That commitment is also reflected in Turner's other efforts to grow its presence outside the traditional television ecosystem, particularly in news and sports. CNN finished the quarter as the leading digital news brand in multi-platform video, and Bleacher Report remained the #2 online sports destination. We'll be ramping up investments in both of these properties over the next couple of years to further expand on their leadership positions.
HBO is also investing in content geared toward digital audiences by bringing onboard talent like Bill Simmons and Jon Stewart. Any Given Wednesday with Bill Simmons does not debut until next month, but Bill's already making his mark with HBO's first aftershow, After the Thrones. Like Animals, After the Thrones is debuting first and HBO NOW and HBO GO. We continue to see significant growth in both users and usage of our digital platforms, and we expect that to continue with our recent expansion of HBO NOW to Microsoft's Xbox and to Samsung Smart TVs.
We're also expanding the reach of HBO's OTT products internationally. In the first quarter, HBO LAG launched an OTT service in Mexico, and HBO announced plans for OTT launches later this year in Spain, Brazil and Argentina. That's all part of a broader push across the company to develop new services and capabilities. We talked to you previously about Warner's SVOD investments in Asia. In February, Warner Bros. announced the acquisition of DramaFever to further bolster our OTT capabilities. And just last week, Turner announced its first domestic SVOD service, FilmStruck, which will build on the curation expertise of TCM to targeted enthusiasts of independent, foreign and art house films. At the same time, we're deeply committed to strengthening our core networks and to helping our traditional distribution and network partners improve their products to satisfy consumers' desire for on-demand content. HBO and Turner have been at the forefront of providing on-demand and multi-platform rights to our partners. And in March, Warner's announced a new deal granting ABC network in-season stacking rights for its new series.
So we're making progress on many fronts, both inside and outside the traditional ecosystem. We're seeing the benefits of strong execution of our strategy and how that can continue to deliver superior returns for our shareholders. We've also ramped up our investments and our pace of innovation to meet the high expectations of today's and tomorrow's consumers. And that's why we're so confident about the rest of 2016 and beyond.
Thanks for listening, and let me turn it over to Howard Averill."

I'll begin by referring to the first slide of our presentation, which is now available on our website. Starting with consolidated results. We're off to a terrific start in 2016 with growth across each of our divisions, and that resulted in a quarterly record for adjusted operating income, which reached over $2 billion and a 25% increase in adjusted EPS. Total revenues grew 3%, and adjusted operating income was up a very healthy 11% with margins expanding 200 basis points. And we did that while continuing to grow our investments in programming and marketing at HBO and Turner. That was balanced by lower cost at Warner Bros., mainly due to the timing of our theatrical slate and by our continued company-wide focus on constraining growth and overhead costs. And we're able to once again leverage our positive operating results into even faster growth and adjusted EPS. That was partly due to our ongoing share repurchase program. During the quarter, we bought back $700 million of our shares. And combined with our dividend, we've returned close to $1.3 billion to shareholders year-to-date. This morning, we reaffirmed our guidance for 2016 adjusted EPS to be in the range of $5.30 to $5.40. So we're pleased with how we're executing and have significant operating momentum across our businesses, which gives us great confidence in our outlook for the rest of this year and beyond.
Now turning to the segment highlights. I'll start at Turner with the benefit from our domestic affiliate renewal cycle and continued strong advertising performance resulting in our best quarter of revenue growth in almost 3 years and record adjusted operating income. Subscription revenues were up a strong 11% in the quarter, and that included a close to 300 basis point headwind from FX. Domestic subscription revenues grew close to 15% as we benefited from the higher rates we achieved in our recent affiliate agreements. Excluding a 15 percentage point drag from FX, international subscription revenue growth was in the high single digits. While there may be quarter-to-quarter fluctuations due to a variety of factors, domestic sub revenue growth is on track to be in the low teens for the year, and we expect total subscription revenue growth through the rest of the year to be similar to the first quarter.
Advertising was up a solid 5% despite approximately 150 basis points of headwind from FX. Domestic advertising grew in the mid-single digits. That was due to double-digit growth across Turner's linear and digital properties for both news and sports, including strong growth from the NCAA tournament. International advertising was also healthy in the quarter, up high single digits, excluding a close to 15 percentage point drag from FX.
Looking to the second quarter, scatter pricing at our domestic entertainment networks continues to be up well in double digits versus the Upfront and will benefit from the NCAA championship game while FX remains a headwind. As a result, we expect total advertising revenue growth to be in the mid to high single digits. And with a healthy ad market, continued rollout of our industry-leading advance advertising products and momentum at many of our brands, every indication points to a very strong Upfront this year.
Adjusted operating income increased 10%, and margins expanded 100 basis points. And we achieved that even as we continue to invest in programming and marketing as Turner kept all other expenses close to flat in the quarter. Programming expenses increased 4% mainly due to our investments in sports and election coverage, and marketing costs were up well into the double digits to support the TBS and TNT rebrands. So Turner is off to a terrific start in 2016 and is well positioned for another strong year. And we're confident the investments we are making across our brands will enhance our competitive position and allow us to sustain strong revenue trends and attractive financial results in the future.
Turning now to HBO where we continue to see very strong global demand for the product in the form of both subscriber growth and content licensing. Domestic subscription revenue growth was in the mid-single digits, and that included a sequential increase on the benefit from HBO NOW. However, despite year-over-year subscriber growth, we continue to experience headwinds from fewer revenue-generating subscribers at certain MVPDs, which has been partially driven by M&A activity. Over time, we actually see an opportunity to help those partners grow their businesses while accelerating our own revenue growth.
Content and other revenue increased 23% in the quarter. That was mainly due to higher international licensing revenues as HBO continues to benefit from its ability to effectively monetize its original content around the world. Across HBO's international networks, including unconsolidated JVs, revenues were up in the double digits, excluding the impact of FX, and international subscriber trends remained strong with healthy growth across all regions, especially LatAm and Europe.
Adjusted operating income was up 6% in the quarter, and that was despite a double-digit increase in programming costs as well as continued investments in marketing and technology related to HBO NOW. The increase in programming expense is related to new original programming like Vinyl and Sesame Street as well as programming charges related to series and development. Overall, HBO is off to a great start to the year. We're excited about our upcoming programming lineup. And with continued investments in the brand and product, we're in a great position to capitalize on the significant global opportunities for premium services.
Moving on to Warner Bros. where we posted record first quarter adjusted operating income. On the TV side, we benefited from higher international licensing revenues. And at our games business, the continued success of our LEGO and Mortal Kombat franchises helped drive another quarter of double-digit revenue growth. Despite the strong box office opening of Batman v Superman late in the quarter, total revenues were down modestly due to the difficult theatrical comparisons from last year's release of American Sniper and carryover from the final installment of The Hobbit. Across theatrical and TV, home entertainment revenues were down 12% as last year's quarter benefited from the home video release of the final Hobbit. So despite the difficult comparisons, EST revenues were still up mid-single digits in the quarter, and we expect our home entertainment trends to improve in the back half of the year as a result of stronger theatrical slate.
Adjusted operating income grew close to 30%. In addition to our strong games performance, we also benefited from lower P&A spending as a result of fewer releases this quarter. So Warner Bros. has great momentum, and we're just getting started on the theatrical side with Suicide Squad and Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, leading what should be a very strong lineup for both the remainder of this year and many years to come. Along with our strength in television and video games, that gives us great confidence in Warner's ability to continue delivering attractive growth well into the future.
Turning to the next slide. Free cash flow totaled over $700 million, which was down from a year ago due to a significant increase in working capital. That was largely related to increased production spend at Warner Bros. as well as the performance of its theatrical product in the fourth quarter of last year and the related impact on accounts receivables. Even so, we still expect very strong cash flow in 2016 driven by strong profit growth and another year of high conversion.
Now looking at our balance sheet. We ended the first quarter with $22 billion of net debt, up $500 million compared to the end of 2015. That's primarily a result of our ongoing commitment to direct returns to shareholders, which is a key component of our balanced approach to capital allocation. We ended the quarter just above our target leverage ratio of 2.75x. But we remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and our investment-grade credit rating and are on track to return to our target by the end of this year.
With that, let's move on to the final slide, which looks at our outlook for 2016. We got off to a strong start in the first quarter, delivering growth across each of our businesses and setting us up for another very good year. That's reflected in our outlook for adjusted EPS of $5.30 to $5.40, which we reaffirmed this morning. And based on current rates, that includes an estimated $0.10 headwind from foreign exchange.
Looking ahead, we still expect growth in adjusted OI to be weighted towards the back half of the year. Specifically in the second quarter, we continue to see positive trends in both advertising and subscription revenue, and global demand for our content remains very strong. But there are several items that we expect to weigh on adjusted operating income, including the timing of content licensing revenue, the comparison to strong video games profits at Warner's in last year's quarters and programming investments at Turner. Despite that, we're on track for another year of very healthy growth in adjusted operating income and solid double-digit earnings growth, extending our history of delivering consistently strong operating and financial performance. And with Turner's revenue trends accelerating, HBO positioned to accelerate its subscription revenue growth over the next couple of years and Warner's in the early stages of an exciting theatrical slate, we feel we're in great position to continue delivering strong results for many years to come.
With that, I'll turn it back to Mike to start the Q&A."

Listen, I think we're -- we are proceeding exactly on pace with our internal plan. And so I mean, if you think about it, Kevin Reilly as the Head of our Entertainment Networks has been on the job for about a year. And it's really his new programming slate that's just beginning to roll out. We debut 24 new seasons of owned original series on our domestic networks in the first quarter alone, and we have 20 more slated for the second quarter. And these new series, hopefully, give you a small sense for the bold-type quality and engaging programming that you can expect from Turner going forward, and we're very happy with the critical acclaim and the performance of these new shows are demonstrating across, frankly, all platforms: TV, digital and social. And just to add a little bit more flavor to that, I mean, premiering Angie Tribeca in a very new and unique way with a 25-hour commercial-free marathon brought about 36% new young audiences to network. Median age was about 10 years younger that our TBS median. And it continued its success on its regular season run, and it ranked #1 on Monday nights across all of cable sitcoms. I think it was Jeff that said who couldn't be more pleased than with the success of Detour, which recently premiered, and is reaching over 5 million viewers per episode across all of our TBS platforms, and it's ranked #1 of the new comedy releases in adults 18 to 49. Full Frontal with Samantha Bee, huge critical and commercial success across all platforms. We're reaching around 3.5 million viewers, and we're driving 30 million views on the show's YouTube channel. And that's really just TBS. During the first quarter, we have new seasons of Impractical Jokers. And for those who can't actually [ph] DV, We Bare Bears and Steven Universe on Cartoon Network, and the Race for the White House from the 80s on CNN. So we're driving, I think, a general improvement in the quality of our original programming across all of our networks, and we've got a lot more to come. And most notably, the TV -- the TNT rebrand will begin later this year. And Jeff mentioned some of the shows that we're really excited about. With respect to the Upfront, I just would reiterate the enthusiasm that Howard suggested, which is that given the strong scatter, we're seeing some of our inventory sell for upwards of 30% to 50% higher than last year's Upfront levels. And given low cancellations, we think all signs point to, frankly, the best Upfront we would've seen in years. And we think our networks stand to gain at least our fair share of what happens in the Upfront. And we think it spells very, very well for just television in general as television is experiencing resurgence in the minds of brand advertisers as we're delivering reach and increasing targeting and audience capabilities. So very, very optimistic."

So I'll start just taking it in the order that you asked the questions. So listen, we -- and I appreciate the question, we're spending a lot of work, a lot of time, investment and increasing our capabilities in advertising. And frankly, we're holding ourselves accountable to lead the charge to modernize TV advertising by combining the unparalleled reach of television with the engaged -- and the engagement of TV with the measurement and targeting capabilities of digital. And we're quickly evolving the advertising industry to simultaneously benefit our advertisers as well as improve our overall consumer experience, and we don't see these goals as being mutually exclusive. Frankly, what we're trying to do is combine the best of both TV and digital, uniting scale and targeting a top-tier -- with top-tier content. That's one of the reasons why we're very bullish about the Upfront. In terms of our own new products, we've discussed before that we have built on the Turner Data Cloud, which is the central depository of all of our consumer information. And that's helping us launch new innovative products that focus on analytics, targeting an ROI. So just the names of the products, some of them, we've got individual products called Targeting Now, Audience Now, ROI Now, Provable ROI, and what all that means is that it's going to be targeting audience-based selling coupled with our data cloud and client insights. And I think there are going to be increasing opportunities over time, and that's going to be a major, major focus in our Upfronts. And then I think you asked specifically with respect to OTT. I think the opportunities to develop advanced targeting capabilities in OTT are absolutely there. They're available. That is what -- assuming that the OTT offering is, in fact, ad-supported, FilmStruck, which is our first domestic offering, is going to be non-ad-supported, which is consistent with Turner Classic Movies. So I think the targeting opportunities will only grow over time, and we're still very, very -- in the very early stages. So we believe that TV advertising has to evolve, but it's going to remain the most effective option for brand advertisers to convey the message at scale. And that's why we expect the resurgence in TV advertising beginning at this year's Upfront."

If you just -- maybe, maybe we want our networks in every one of these packets. I mean, I think we ought to include that in a larger view of how the industry is evolving. Any if you think about subscription VOD, it's been an opportunity that started with the first SVOD service, which is called HBO, a long time ago. And what we're watching happen, and I think it probably did start with HBO a decade ago, is consumers want to expect they're going to demand SVOD access to all their favorite networks, all their favorite shows. And what we've been seeing as an evolution is that on-demand functionality and better guides are sprouting up, first in HBO, then at some of the broadband-delivered services. And increasingly, you're seeing more full on-demand offerings of current exhibition networks and better interfaces guys and recommendation engines at places like Comcast, Verizon, Sling has one. And for us, with our networks, whether it's the Turner networks or the HBO networks, we've long said that we'd like our networks and their program, including the debuts of current 4-season exhibitions like what John is talking about and what Richard has been doing for years at HBO. We want them to be on-demand, and we would like to see most of our networks, whichever exhibition window, first run or syndication to be on-demand. And we're basically in an enviable position that our networks, Turner and HBO, are among the most desired networks for consumers and, therefore, to be included in all these packages. So you'll hear, I think, increasingly, of different packages with different network offerings that consumers can choose between at different price points available from existing cable, satellite and telco distributors, increasingly from new virtual distributors, whether it be Hulu, whether it's Amazon, Apple, whoever comes in and creates packages for consumers. So I think what you're seeing is a very vibrant rebirth of the strength of TV networks and TV programming across all of these distribution platforms. And because of our -- we've always taken the position being the first to launch VOD that we think more of it is better for consumers. And therefore, we're going to try to be available in all the packages consumers are interested in."

First, on the affiliate fee growth, several of your peers see impact from the distributor consideration and some rate resets dragging on their growth. Obviously, you're putting up great growth right now. Do you expect to have any impact in the future from consolidation? Is any impact of consolidation already in your results, or perhaps the way you're structured, you won't be impacted by that? And then my second question is on ELEAGUE. Specifically, most strategies we see is taking linear content and finding new digital avenues. This is a case where you're taking something that's done well digitally and you bring it to TV. Could you just talk a little bit about what -- why you think that's the right strategy, what your hopes are for that product?"

Look, with respect to our affiliate fees, I think you have the forecast or the guidance that we provided for this year and next year where we expect domestic subscriber revenues to be in the low teens. I think it's fair to say that, that considers the current environment, the number of distributors and what's happening in the marketplace. And when you have a highly concentrated portfolio of must-have networks, which we do, where we've got 85% of our affiliate revenues in 4 networks, I think it's a really advantageous place to be. So I think I'll leave it at that because obviously, we're not going to specifically comment on any particular consolidation. And then with respect to ELEAGUE, look, this is one of the innovations with respect to content that I think we're particularly excited about and proud of. And it's really -- it's not necessarily by design that we're looking to take digital content and move it to the TV. It's more just really trying to position the company to be where consumers are. And looking at secular growth areas and in looking at areas where particularly young people are spending tremendous amounts of time, you obviously have to pay attention to the gaming industry, but this whole notion of very significant population of individuals who are really excited to sit and watch professional gamers and some of the best gamers in the world, that's already happening. It's happening globally. And in some countries, it represents some of the highest levels of consumption of video content. So in some respects, having ELEAGUE be aired on TBS is somewhat of an experiment. I think we're going to learn a lot this year. And I look forward to hopefully building a big franchise and a big asset along with our partners on both TV and digital platforms."

We're not going to say no to it because we have a certain number that we think is a ceiling. That's not how we make choices. In terms of HBO NOW, what we have done is we've augmented our programming with decisions like Jon Stewart and VICE News, and I think Bill Simmons will work across all platforms.

And the fact that you now have more VOD offerings and different packages and price points is basically, I think -- and it -- we've seen it happen, it's going to increase penetration because consumers are going to find more packages that suit what they want. And in most cases, that'll be the biggest and largest packages of the big networks. But not in all cases. And so I think you're going to see -- and remember, to the extent you have some marketing of VOD products and good broadband delivery with good navigation, it basically increases consumer demand -- consumer recognition for powerful networks like CNN, TNT, HBO. All of that has kind of a national effect of increasing the presence of TV networks because all age groups increasingly now are finding the favorite programs offered the way they want them. They find a way to the networks if we sell them in the right distribution offering."

And I think, further to what Jeff just said, as affiliates, whether they're traditional or nontraditional affiliates, put out packages, smaller packages of better networks at lower economic price points, we're going to be able to attract back households into the multichannel ecosystem that have, frankly, moved away because they don't see the value of the uber-bundles.

Some people are going to look at Veep with the same passion that other people will look at Silicon Valley. So this is a very subjective determination. We've been doing it for a long time. We think we have pretty good instincts about how to build a large variety in our slate, which appeals to a huge part of our consumer base. There's no exact science to it, and obviously, critical acclaim plays a role.

And that, again, is consistent with our desire to evolve the industry that's going to simultaneously benefit our advertisers and improve the overall consumer experience. I will tell you, we are not doing it to lose money. So we fully intend to provide increased value per inventory unit that we sell. And now it's up to us to demonstrate that. But we are actively going to be moving beyond the 32nd spot of business to create innovative new ad products for advertisers and marketers. And we made a number of announcements, a number of months ago at CES, including data plus with longer-form brand ad breaks and launchpad, which is a social tool; and Courageous, which is our own in-house ability to develop branded content in the form of advertising.

So thanks, everyone, and good morning. Welcome to Time Warner's First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. This morning, we issued 2 press releases, one detailing our results for the first quarter; and the other reaffirming our 2016 full year business outlook.
Before we begin, there are 2 items I need to cover. First, we refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Schedules setting out reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our earnings release and trending schedules. These reconciliations are available on our website at www.timewarner.com/investors. Reconciliations of our expected future financial performance are also included in the business outlook release that is available on our website.
Second, today's announcement includes certain forward-looking statements, which are based on management's current expectations. Actual results may vary materially from those expressed or implied by these statements due to various factors. These factors are discussed in detail in Time Warner's SEC filings, including its most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. Time Warner is under no obligation and, in fact, expressly disclaims any obligation to update or alter its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
I'll now turn the call over to Jeff Bewkes, Time Warner's Chairman and CEO, who'll be followed by Howard Averill, Time Warner's CFO. After their prepared remarks, our divisional CEOs, John Martin, Richard Plepler and Kevin Tsujihara will join us for a Q&A session.
Jeff?"
24689,329051687,972749,"Time Warner Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 04, 2016",2016-05-04,"Earnings Calls","Warner Media, LLC","Executives","Thanks, Mike, and thanks, everybody, for listening in, staying on the call through our medical report at the beginning.

We told you on our last call that we expected 2016 to be another standout year for Time Warner. And in recent years, as you all know, we have been investing aggressively in the very best content while moving quickly to take advantage of new distribution opportunities that are emerging around the world. At the same time, we've maintained our disciplined approach to cost controls and capital allocation in order to maximize shareholder returns. And we anticipated that, that combination would allow us to continue to deliver industry-leading performance.
That's exactly what you're seeing in our first quarter results. Revenues increased 3% to $7.3 billion and adjusted operating income grew 11% to $2 billion. Adjusted earnings per share grew 25% to $1.49 per share, and we also returned over $1 billion to shareholders in share repurchases and dividends.
In addition to strong financial results, we're off to a tremendous start this year from a content perspective. In just the past few weeks, we've had the buzzer-beating final game of March Madness on TBS; CNN's must-watch election coverage; a global hit from Warner Bros. in Batman v Superman; and the return of HBO's epic series, Game of Thrones. Those are just a few examples of how our investments are translating into great content that deeply engages audiences across platforms and around the world. But there are many more. Let me start with Turner.
Once again, Turner had 3 of the top 10 basic cable networks in the U.S., and it continued to make progress on a multiyear transformation of its brands. The first quarter marked the start of TBS's repositioning as the place for young, fresh comedy with the successful premieres of Angie Tribeca, Full Frontal with Samantha Bee and Separation Anxiety. We followed those up last month with our new hit, The Detour. It's the biggest new comedy on cable this year. The early results are very encouraging with TBS ending the first quarter ranked as the #1 ad-supported cable network in prime time among adults 18 to 49. And we have a number of additional distinctive shows on tap this year, including Wrecked, which will debut next month.
The first quarter also marked the start of an acceleration in Turner's domestic affiliate revenue growth, which we've been talking to you about now for some time. That acceleration underscores the strength of the Turner brands and the investments we have been making in them in recent years. One of our most important investments was March Madness. And last March, Turner brought the championship game of the tournament to cable for the very first time. This year's tournament was another great success, delivering both a stirring finale and record revenue. Recently, we agreed to build on that success by partnering with CBS to extend our television, digital and marketing rights to the NCAA tournament all the way through 2032. Marquee live sports continue to grow in importance, both to consumers and advertisers. And combined with our extensive multi-platform rights, that gives us a lot of confidence we'll be able to generate a very attractive return on our investment in this unique property.
As March Madness wound down, the NBA playoffs were just getting started. The NBA on TNT grew viewership double digits in the first quarter. And with the playoffs underway, we have a great platform for TNT's own drama-focused brand refresh, which starts with Animal Kingdom from Warner Bros. in June. Nowhere is Turner's transformation more evident than at CNN, which more than doubled its prime time audience in the first quarter. CNN's ratings benefited from its unrivaled coverage of the U.S. presidential race as well as from its continued success with original series. Those 2 areas overlapped in Race for the White House, which premiered as the most-watched CNN original telecast ever.
Over at Home Box Office, I mentioned Game of Thrones already, which grew its opening viewership double digits versus a year ago on a cross-platform basis. But it doesn't stop there. That same weekend, HBO was host to Beyoncé's headline-grabbing visual album, Lemonade; also, the television premiere of Jurassic World; a world championship boxing match; and the return of our 2 hit comedies, Veep and Silicon Valley. It's -- it was a great example of the range and quality of the content that HBO delivers to its subs. We're just as excited for what's still to come this year at HBO, including the second season of Ballers, that's our new series, started last year; a new series, Divorce, with Sarah Jessica Parker; and our limited series, THE NIGHT OF, which just previewed to a tremendous reception at the Tribeca Film Festival.
At Warner Bros., Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice set a record for a March opening weekend, and it's already Warner's biggest-ever first quarter release. Even better, it's only the opening chapter of an exciting slate of DC Entertainment films that we think will captivate audiences globally for years to come. Next up is Suicide Squad this summer, followed by LEGO Batman, Wonder Woman and Justice League, all in 2017. And as you know, these franchise films are the cornerstone of a strategy that's making DC a growth driver across film, television, digital, games and consumer products. Warner's has a lot more on deck, including J.K. Rowling's return to the big screen this November with Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. Judging by the huge crowd since the opening last month of The Wizarding World of Harry Potter attraction in Hollywood, there are plenty of fans who are just excited as we are for the next installment of this great franchise.
In television, Warner's has built on its leading position in broadcast with 3 of the top 5 new series this season. That includes not only scripted series like the #1 new show, Blindspot, but also unscripted series like Little Big Shots, which has already been picked up in 2 major international territories. Given the performance of Warner's current shows with a record 21 renewals ahead of the Upfront this year and a strong slate of pilots, Warner's is in a great position to once again lead the industry in broadcast series programming this coming season. And we're also expanding our production for cable and over-the-top services. We have twice the number of new series orders for next season. So across the company, we're continuing to lead the way of producing groundbreaking content.
And to capitalize on the rapid shift to on-demand consumption and broadband delivery of video, we're focused on innovation, both in the type of content we produce and how we get it to consumers. For example, on May 24, Turner is launching ELEAGUE, that's our professional competitive gaming league, in partnership with WME | IMG. In addition to its telecast on TBS, ELEAGUE will have a significant digital component and partnership with Twitch. ELEAGUE reflects Turner's commitment to creating and delivering content for multi-platform audiences. That commitment is also reflected in Turner's other efforts to grow its presence outside the traditional television ecosystem, particularly in news and sports. CNN finished the quarter as the leading digital news brand in multi-platform video, and Bleacher Report remained the #2 online sports destination. We'll be ramping up investments in both of these properties over the next couple of years to further expand on their leadership positions.
HBO is also investing in content geared toward digital audiences by bringing onboard talent like Bill Simmons and Jon Stewart. Any Given Wednesday with Bill Simmons does not debut until next month, but Bill's already making his mark with HBO's first aftershow, After the Thrones. Like Animals, After the Thrones is debuting first on HBO NOW and HBO GO. We continue to see significant growth in both users and usage of our digital platforms, and we expect that to continue with our recent expansion of HBO NOW to Microsoft's Xbox and to Samsung Smart TVs.
We're also expanding the reach of HBO's OTT products internationally. In the first quarter, HBO LAG launched an OTT service in Mexico, and HBO announced plans for OTT launches later this year in Spain, Brazil and Argentina. That's all part of a broader push across the company to develop new services and capabilities. We talked to you previously about Warner's SVOD investments in Asia. In February, Warner Bros. announced the acquisition of DramaFever to further bolster our OTT capabilities. And just last week, Turner announced its first domestic SVOD service, FilmStruck, which will build on the curation expertise of TCM to targeted enthusiasts of independent, foreign and art house films. At the same time, we're deeply committed to strengthening our core networks and to helping our traditional distribution and network partners improve their products to satisfy consumers' desire for on-demand content. HBO and Turner have been at the forefront of providing on-demand and multi-platform rights to our partners. And in March, Warner's announced a new deal granting ABC network in-season stacking rights for its new series.
So we're making progress on many fronts, both inside and outside the traditional ecosystem. We're seeing the benefits of strong execution of our strategy and how that can continue to deliver superior returns for our shareholders. We've also ramped up our investments and our pace of innovation to meet the high expectations of today's and tomorrow's consumers. And that's why we're so confident about the rest of 2016 and beyond.
Thanks for listening, and let me turn it over to Howard Averill."

I'll begin by referring to the first slide of our presentation, which is now available on our website. Starting with consolidated results. We're off to a terrific start in 2016 with growth across each of our divisions, and that resulted in a quarterly record for adjusted operating income, which reached over $2 billion and a 25% increase in adjusted EPS. Total revenues grew 3%, and adjusted operating income was up a very healthy 11% with margins expanding 200 basis points. And we did that while continuing to grow our investments in programming and marketing at HBO and Turner. That was balanced by lower cost at Warner Bros., mainly due to the timing of our theatrical slate and by our continued company-wide focus on constraining growth and overhead costs. And we're able to once again leverage our positive operating results into even faster growth and adjusted EPS. That was partly due to our ongoing share repurchase program. During the quarter, we bought back $700 million of our shares. And combined with our dividend, we've returned close to $1.3 billion to shareholders year-to-date. This morning, we reaffirmed our guidance for 2016 adjusted EPS to be in the range of $5.30 to $5.40. So we're pleased with how we're executing and have significant operating momentum across our businesses, which gives us great confidence in our outlook for the rest of this year and beyond.
Now turning to the segment highlights. I'll start at Turner with the benefit from our domestic affiliate renewal cycle and continued strong advertising performance resulting in our best quarter of revenue growth in almost 3 years and record adjusted operating income. Subscription revenues were up a strong 11% in the quarter, and that included a close to 300 basis point headwind from FX. Domestic subscription revenues grew close to 15% as we benefited from the higher rates we achieved in our recent affiliate agreements. Excluding a 15 percentage point drag from FX, international subscription revenue growth was in the high single digits. While there may be quarter-to-quarter fluctuations due to a variety of factors, domestic sub revenue growth is on track to be in the low teens for the year, and we expect total subscription revenue growth through the rest of the year to be similar to the first quarter.
Advertising was up a solid 5% despite approximately 150 basis points of headwinds from FX. Domestic advertising grew in the mid-single digits. That was due to double-digit growth across Turner's linear and digital properties for both news and sports, including strong growth from the NCAA tournament. International advertising was also healthy in the quarter, up high single digits, excluding a close to 15 percentage point drag from FX.
Looking to the second quarter, scatter pricing at our domestic entertainment networks continues to be up well in double digits versus the Upfront and will benefit from the NCAA championship game while FX remains a headwind. As a result, we expect total advertising revenue growth to be in the mid to high single digits. And with a healthy ad market, continued rollout of our industry-leading advance advertising products and momentum at many of our brands, every indication points to a very strong Upfront this year.
Adjusted operating income increased 10%, and margins expanded 100 basis points. And we achieved that even as we continue to invest in programming and marketing as Turner kept all other expenses close to flat in the quarter. Programming expenses increased 4% mainly due to our investments in sports and election coverage, and marketing costs were up well into the double digits to support the TBS and TNT rebrands. So Turner is off to a terrific start in 2016 and is well positioned for another strong year. And we're confident the investments we are making across our brands will enhance our competitive position and allow us to sustain strong revenues trends and attractive financial results in the future.
Turning now to HBO where we continue to see very strong global demand for the product in the form of both subscriber growth and content licensing. Domestic subscription revenue growth was in the mid-single digits, and that included a sequential increase on the benefit from HBO NOW. However, despite year-over-year subscriber growth, we continue to experience headwinds from fewer revenue-generating subscribers at certain MVPDs, which has been partially driven by M&A activity. Over time, we actually see an opportunity to help those partners grow their businesses while accelerating our own revenue growth.
Content and other revenue increased 23% in the quarter. That was mainly due to higher international licensing revenues as HBO continues to benefit from its ability to effectively monetize its original content around the world. Across HBO's international networks, including unconsolidated JVs, revenues were up in the double digits, excluding the impact of FX, and international subscriber trends remained strong with healthy growth across all regions, especially LatAm and Europe.
Adjusted operating income was up 6% in the quarter, and that was despite a double-digit increase in programming costs as well as continued investments in marketing and technology related to HBO NOW. The increase in programming expense is related to new original programming like Vinyl and Sesame Street as well as programming charges related to series and development. Overall, HBO is off to a great start to the year. We're excited about our upcoming programming lineup. And with continued investments in the brand and product, we're in a great position to capitalize on the significant global opportunities for premium services.
Moving on to Warner Bros. where we posted record first quarter adjusted operating income. On the TV side, we benefited from higher international licensing revenues. And at our games business, the continued success of our LEGO and Mortal Kombat franchises helped drive another quarter of double-digit revenue growth. Despite the strong box office opening of Batman v Superman late in the quarter, total revenues were down modestly due to the difficult theatrical comparisons from last year's release of American Sniper and carryover from the final installment of The Hobbit. Across theatrical and TV, home entertainment revenues were down 12% as last year's quarter benefited from the home video release of the final Hobbit. So despite the difficult comparisons, EST revenues were still up mid-single digits in the quarter, and we expect our home entertainment trends to improve in the back half of the year as a result of stronger theatrical slate.
Adjusted operating income grew close to 30%. In addition to our strong games performance, we also benefited from lower P&A spending as a result of fewer releases this quarter. So Warner Bros. has great momentum, and we're just getting started on the theatrical side with Suicide Squad and Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, leading what should be a very strong lineup for both the remainder of this year and many years to come. Along with our strength in television and video games, that gives us great confidence in Warner's ability to continue delivering attractive growth well into the future.
Turning to the next slide. Free cash flow totaled over $700 million, which was down from a year ago due to a significant increase in working capital. That was largely related to increased production spend at Warner Bros. as well as the performance of its theatrical product in the fourth quarter of last year and the related impact on accounts receivables. Even so, we still expect very strong cash flow in 2016 driven by strong profit growth and another year of high conversion.
Now looking at our balance sheet. We ended the first quarter with $22 billion of net debt, up $500 million compared to the end of 2015. That's primarily a result of our ongoing commitment to direct returns to shareholders, which is a key component of our balanced approach to capital allocation. We ended the quarter just above our target leverage ratio of 2.75x. But we remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and our investment-grade credit ratings and are on track to return to our target by the end of this year.
With that, let's move on to the final slide, which looks at our outlook for 2016. We got off to a strong start in the first quarter, delivering growth across each of our businesses and setting us up for another very good year. That's reflected in our outlook for adjusted EPS of $5.30 to $5.40, which we reaffirmed this morning. And based on current rates, that includes an estimated $0.10 headwind from foreign exchange.
Looking ahead, we still expect growth in adjusted OI to be weighted towards the back half of the year. Specifically in the second quarter, we continue to see positive trends in both advertising and subscription revenue, and global demand for our content remains very strong. But there are several items that we expect to weigh on adjusted operating income, including the timing of content licensing revenue, the comparison to strong video games profits at Warner's in last year's quarter and programming investments at Turner. Despite that, we're on track for another year of very healthy growth in adjusted operating income and solid double-digit earnings growth, extending our history of delivering consistently strong operating and financial performance. And with Turner's revenue trends accelerating, HBO positioned to accelerate its subscription revenue growth over the next couple of years and Warner's in the early stages of an exciting theatrical slate, we feel we're in great position to continue delivering strong results for many years to come.
With that, I'll turn it back to Mike to start the Q&A."

Listen, I think we're -- we are proceeding exactly on pace with our internal plan. And so I mean, if you think about it, Kevin Reilly as the Head of our Entertainment Networks has been on the job for about a year. And it's really his new programming slate that's just beginning to roll out. We debuted 24 new seasons of owned original series on our domestic networks in the first quarter alone, and we have 20 more slated for the second quarter. And these new series, hopefully, give you a small sense for the bold-type quality and engaging programming that you can expect from Turner going forward, and we're very happy with the critical acclaim and the performance that these new shows are demonstrating across, frankly, all platforms: TV, digital and social. And just to add a little bit more flavor to that, I mean, premiering Angie Tribeca in a very new and unique way with a 25-hour commercial-free marathon brought about 36% new young audiences to network. Median age was about 10 years younger that our TBS median. And it continued its success on its regular season run, and it ranked #1 on Monday nights across all of cable sitcoms. I think it was Jeff that said -- who couldn't be more pleased than -- with the success of Detour, which recently premiered, and is reaching over 5 million viewers per episode across all of our TBS platforms, and it's ranked #1 of the new comedy releases in adults 18 to 49. Full Frontal with Samantha Bee, huge critical and commercial success across all platforms. We're reaching around 3.5 million viewers, and we're driving 30 million views on the show's YouTube channel. And that's really just TBS. During the first quarter, we have new seasons of Impractical Jokers. And for those who can actually [ph] DV, We Bare Bears and Steven Universe on Cartoon Network, and the Race for the White House in the 80s on CNN. So we're driving, I think, a general improvement in the quality of our original programming across all of our networks, and we've got a lot more to come. And most notably, the TV -- the TNT rebrand will begin later this year. And Jeff mentioned some of the shows that we're really excited about. With respect to the Upfront, I just would reiterate the enthusiasm that Howard suggested, which is that given the strong scatter, we're seeing some of our inventory sell for upwards of 30% to 50% higher than last year's Upfront levels. And given low cancellations, we think all signs point to, frankly, the best Upfront we will have seen in years. And we think our networks stand to gain at least our fair share of what happens in the Upfront. And we think it spells very, very well for just television in general as television is experiencing resurgence in the minds of brand advertisers as we're delivering reach and increasing targeting and audience capabilities. So very, very optimistic."

So I'll start just taking it in the order that you asked the questions. So listen, we -- and I appreciate the question, we're spending a lot of work, a lot of time, investment in increasing our capabilities in advertising. And frankly, we're holding ourselves accountable to lead the charge to modernize TV advertising by combining the unparalleled reach of television with the engaged -- and the engagement of TV with the measurement and targeting capabilities of digital. And we're quickly evolving the advertising industry to simultaneously benefit our advertisers as well as improve our overall consumer experience, and we don't see these goals as being mutually exclusive. Frankly, what we're trying to do is combine the best of both TV and digital, uniting scale and targeting a top-tier -- with top-tier content. That's one of the reasons why we're very bullish about the Upfront. In terms of our own new products, we've discussed before that we have built on the Turner Data Cloud, which is the central repository of all of our consumer information. And that's helping us launch new innovative products that focus on analytics, targeting an ROI. So just the names of the products, or some of them, we've got individual products called Targeting Now, Audience Now, ROI Now, Provable ROI, and what all that means is that it's going to be targeting audience-based selling coupled with our data cloud and client insights. And I think there are going to be increasing opportunities over time, and that's going to be a major, major focus in our Upfronts. And then I think you asked specifically with respect to OTT. I think the opportunities to develop advanced targeting capabilities in OTT are absolutely there. They're available. That is what -- assuming that the OTT offering is, in fact, ad-supported, FilmStruck, which is our first domestic offering, is going to be non-ad-supported, which is consistent with Turner Classic Movies. So I think the targeting opportunities will only grow over time, and we're still very, very -- in the very early stages. So we believe that TV advertising has to evolve, but it's going to remain the most effective option for brand advertisers to convey their message at scale. And that's why we expect a resurgence in TV advertising beginning at this year's Upfront."

If you just -- maybe, maybe we want our networks in every one of these packets. I mean, I think we ought to include that in a larger view of how the industry is evolving. And if you think about subscription VOD, it's been an opportunity that started with the first SVOD service, which is called HBO, a long time ago. And what we're watching happen, and I think it probably did start with HBO a decade ago, is consumers want to expect they're going to demand SVOD access to all their favorite networks, all their favorite shows. And what we've been seeing as an evolution is that on-demand functionality and better guides are sprouting up, first in HBO, then at some of the broadband-delivered services. And increasingly, you're seeing more full on-demand offerings of current exhibition networks and better interfaces guides and recommendation engines at places like Comcast, Verizon, Sling has one. And for us, with our networks, whether it's the Turner networks or the HBO networks, we've long said that we'd like our networks and their programming, including the debuts of current first-season exhibitions like what John is talking about and what Richard has been doing for years at HBO. We want them to be on-demand, and we would like to see most of our networks, whichever exhibition window, first run or syndication to be on-demand. And we're basically in an enviable position that our networks, Turner and HBO, are among the most desired networks for consumers and, therefore, to be included in all these packages. So you'll hear, I think, increasingly, of different packages with different network offerings that consumers can choose between at different price points available from existing cable, satellite and telco distributors, increasingly from new virtual distributors, whether it be Hulu, whether it's Amazon, Apple, whoever comes in and creates packages for consumers. So I think what you're seeing is a very vibrant rebirth of the strength of TV networks and TV programming across all of these distribution platforms. And because of our -- we've always taken the position being the first to launch VOD that we think more of it is better for consumers. And therefore, we're going to try to be available in all the packages consumers are interested in."

First, on the affiliate fee growth, several of your peers see impact from the distributor consideration and some rate resets dragging on their growth. Obviously, you're putting up great growth right now. Do you expect to have any impact in the future from consolidation? Is any impact of consolidation already in your results, or perhaps the way you're structured, you won't be impacted by that? And then my second question is on ELEAGUE. Specifically, most strategies we see is taking linear content and finding new digital avenues. This is a case where you're taking something that's done well digitally and you're bringing it to TV. Could you just talk a little bit about what -- why you think that's the right strategy, what your hopes are for that product?"

Look, with respect to our affiliate fees, I think you have the forecast or the guidance that we provided for this year and next year where we expect domestic subscriber revenues to be in the low teens. I think it's fair to say that, that considers the current environment, the number of distributors and what's happening in the marketplace. And when you have a highly concentrated portfolio of must-have networks, which we do, where we've got 85% of our affiliate revenues in 4 networks, I think it's a really advantageous place to be. So I think I'll leave it at that because obviously, we're not going to specifically comment on any particular consolidation. And then with respect to ELEAGUE, look, this is one of the innovations with respect to content that I think we're particularly excited about and proud of. And it's really -- it's not necessarily by design that we're looking to take digital content and move it to the TV. It's more just really trying to position the company to be where consumers are. And looking at secular growth areas and in looking at areas where particularly young people are spending tremendous amounts of time, you obviously have to pay attention to the gaming industry, but this whole notion of very significant population of individuals who are really excited to sit and watch professional gamers and some of the best gamers in the world, that's already happening. It's happening globally. And in some countries, it represents some of the highest levels of consumption of video content. So in some respects, having ELEAGUE be aired on TBS is somewhat of an experiment. I think we're going to learn a lot this year. And I look forward to hopefully building a big franchise and a big asset along with our partners on both TV and digital platforms."

And as I've said before, the mission of programming is to build as many addicts as we can out there in the consumer base, and different people love different things. So you have huge Silicon Valley fans, huge John Oliver or Bill Maher fans, huge sports fans. So we like the way we're breaking up our choices. And a lot of this, of course, is informed by the talent that comes through the door. Somebody comes in with a brilliant idea for an additional half hour. We're not going to say no to it because we have a certain number that we think is a ceiling. That's not how we make choices. In terms of HBO NOW, what we have done is we've augmented our programming with decisions like Jon Stewart and VICE News, and I think Bill Simmons will work across all platforms. So again, that opportunity to not be constrained by schedule is opening up a lot of creativity on the part of our talent who are coming in literally every week with new ideas. So you're going to see more and more of that going forward. So listen, we like our mix.

So you do have affiliates, cable affiliates who are growing subs in penetration. And the reason basically is they are offering very effective packages of VOD.

And so you have a fairly large disparity in performance between distributors. And I think if you look at the high performance, you see where the future can go. And the fact that you now have more VOD offerings and different packages and price points is basically, I think -- and it -- we've seen it happen, it's going to increase penetration because consumers are going to find more packages that suit what they want. And in most cases, that'll be the biggest and largest packages of the big networks. But not in all cases. And so I think you're going to see -- and remember, to the extent you have some marketing of VOD products -- think of broadband delivery with good navigation, it basically increases consumer demand -- consumer recognition for powerful networks like CNN, TNT, HBO.

So this is going to be an evolution. But it's something that we're planning now for what's going to take place in the future."

So thanks, everyone, and good morning. Welcome to Time Warner's First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. This morning, we issued 2 press releases, one detailing our results for the first quarter; and the other reaffirming our 2016 full year business outlook.
Before we begin, there are 2 items I need to cover. First, we refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Schedules setting out reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our earnings release and trending schedules. These reconciliations are available on our website at www.timewarner.com/investors. Reconciliations of our expected future financial performance are also included in the business outlook release that is available on our website.
Second, today's announcement includes certain forward-looking statements, which are based on management's current expectations. Actual results may vary materially from those expressed or implied by these statements due to various factors. These factors are discussed in detail in Time Warner's SEC filings, including its most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. Time Warner is under no obligation and, in fact, expressly disclaims any obligation to update or alter its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
I'll now turn the call over to Jeff Bewkes, Time Warner's Chairman and CEO, who'll be followed by Howard Averill, Time Warner's CFO. After their prepared remarks, our divisional CEOs, John Martin, Richard Plepler and Kevin Tsujihara will join us for a Q&A session.
Jeff?"
24689,329051687,972754,"Time Warner Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 04, 2016",2016-05-04,"Earnings Calls","Warner Media, LLC","Executives","Thanks, Mike, and thanks, everybody, for listening in, staying on the call through our medical report at the beginning.

We told you on our last call that we expected 2016 to be another standout year for Time Warner. And in recent years, as you all know, we have been investing aggressively in the very best content while moving quickly to take advantage of new distribution opportunities that are emerging around the world. At the same time, we've maintained our disciplined approach to cost controls and capital allocation in order to maximize shareholder returns. And we anticipated that, that combination would allow us to continue to deliver industry-leading performance.
That's exactly what you're seeing in our first quarter results. Revenues increased 3% to $7.3 billion and adjusted operating income grew 11% to $2 billion. Adjusted earnings per share grew 25% to $1.49 per share, and we also returned over $1 billion to shareholders in share repurchases and dividends.
In addition to strong financial results, we're off to a tremendous start this year from a content perspective. In just the past few weeks, we've had the buzzer-beating final game of March Madness on TBS; CNN's must-watch election coverage; a global hit from Warner Bros. in Batman v Superman; and the return of HBO's epic series, Game of Thrones. Those are just a few examples of how our investments are translating into great content that deeply engages audiences across platforms and around the world. But there are many more. Let me start with Turner.
Once again, Turner had 3 of the top 10 basic cable networks in the U.S., and it continued to make progress on a multiyear transformation of its brands. The first quarter marked the start of TBS's repositioning as the place for young, fresh comedy with the successful premieres of Angie Tribeca, Full Frontal with Samantha Bee and Separation Anxiety. We followed those up last month with our new hit, The Detour. It's the biggest new comedy on cable this year. The early results are very encouraging with TBS ending the first quarter ranked as the #1 ad-supported cable network in prime time among adults 18 to 49. And we have a number of additional distinctive shows on tap this year, including Wrecked, which will debut next month.
The first quarter also marked the start of an acceleration in Turner's domestic affiliate revenue growth, which we've been talking to you about now for some time. That acceleration underscores the strength of the Turner brands and the investments we have been making in them in recent years. One of our most important investments was March Madness. And last March, Turner brought the championship game of the tournament to cable for the very first time. This year's tournament was another great success, delivering both a stirring finale and record revenue. Recently, we agreed to build on that success by partnering with CBS to extend our television, digital and marketing rights to the NCAA tournament all the way through 2032. Marquee live sports continue to grow in importance, both to consumers and advertisers. And combined with our extensive multi-platform rights, that gives us a lot of confidence we'll be able to generate a very attractive return on our investment in this unique property.
As March Madness wound down, the NBA playoffs were just getting started. The NBA on TNT grew viewership double digits in the first quarter. And with the playoffs underway, we have a great platform for TNT's own drama-focused brand refresh, which starts with Animal Kingdom from Warner Bros. in June. Nowhere is Turner's transformation more evident than at CNN, which more than doubled its prime time audience in the first quarter. CNN's ratings benefited from its unrivaled coverage of the U.S. presidential race as well as from its continued success with original series. Those 2 areas overlapped in Race for the White House, which premiered as the most-watched CNN original telecast ever.
Over at Home Box Office, I mentioned Game of Thrones already, which grew its opening viewership double digits versus a year ago on a cross-platform basis. But it doesn't stop there. That same weekend, HBO was host to Beyoncé's headline-grabbing visual album, Lemonade; also, the television premiere of Jurassic World; a world championship boxing match; and the return of our 2 hit comedies, Veep and Silicon Valley. It's -- it was a great example of the range and quality of the content that HBO delivers to its subs. We're just as excited for what's still to come this year at HBO, including the second season of Ballers, that's our new series, started last year; a new series, Divorce, with Sarah Jessica Parker; and our limited series, THE NIGHT OF, which just previewed to a tremendous reception at the Tribeca Film Festival.
At Warner Bros., Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice set a record for a March opening weekend, and it's already Warner's biggest-ever first quarter release. Even better, it's only the opening chapter of an exciting slate of DC Entertainment films that we think will captivate audiences globally for years to come. Next up is Suicide Squad this summer, followed by LEGO Batman, Wonder Woman and Justice League, all in 2017. And as you know, these franchise films are the cornerstone of a strategy that's making DC a growth driver across film, television, digital, games and consumer products. Warner's has a lot more on deck, including J.K. Rowling's return to the big screen this November with Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. Judging by the huge crowd since the opening last month of The Wizarding World of Harry Potter attraction in Hollywood, there are plenty of fans who are just excited as we are for the next installment of this great franchise.
In television, Warner's has built on its leading position in broadcast with 3 of the top 5 new series this season. That includes not only scripted series like the #1 new show, Blindspot, but also unscripted series like Little Big Shots, which has already been picked up in 2 major international territories. Given the performance of Warner's current shows with a record 21 renewals ahead of the Upfront this year and a strong slate of pilots, Warner's is in a great position to once again lead the industry in broadcast series programming this coming season. And we're also expanding our production for cable and over-the-top services. We have twice the number of new series orders for next season. So across the company, we're continuing to lead the way of producing groundbreaking content.
And to capitalize on the rapid shift to on-demand consumption and broadband delivery of video, we're focused on innovation, both in the type of content we produce and how we get it to consumers. For example, on May 24, Turner is launching ELEAGUE, that's our professional competitive gaming league, in partnership with WME | IMG. In addition to its telecast on TBS, ELEAGUE will have a significant digital component and partnership with Twitch. ELEAGUE reflects Turner's commitment to creating and delivering content for multi-platform audiences. That commitment is also reflected in Turner's other efforts to grow its presence outside the traditional television ecosystem, particularly in news and sports. CNN finished the quarter as the leading digital news brand in multi-platform video, and Bleacher Report remained the #2 online sports destination. We'll be ramping up investments in both of these properties over the next couple of years to further expand on their leadership positions.
HBO is also investing in content geared toward digital audiences by bringing onboard talent like Bill Simmons and Jon Stewart. Any Given Wednesday with Bill Simmons does not debut until next month, but Bill's already making his mark with HBO's first aftershow, After the Thrones. Like Animals, After the Thrones is debuting first on HBO NOW and HBO GO. We continue to see significant growth in both users and usage of our digital platforms, and we expect that to continue with our recent expansion of HBO NOW to Microsoft's Xbox and to Samsung Smart TVs.
We're also expanding the reach of HBO's OTT products internationally. In the first quarter, HBO LAG launched an OTT service in Mexico, and HBO announced plans for OTT launches later this year in Spain, Brazil and Argentina. That's all part of a broader push across the company to develop new services and capabilities. We talked to you previously about Warner's SVOD investments in Asia. In February, Warner Bros. announced the acquisition of DramaFever to further bolster our OTT capabilities. And just last week, Turner announced its first domestic SVOD service, FilmStruck, which will build on the curation expertise of TCM to targeted enthusiasts of independent, foreign and art house films. At the same time, we're deeply committed to strengthening our core networks and to helping our traditional distribution and network partners improve their products to satisfy consumers' desire for on-demand content. HBO and Turner have been at the forefront of providing on-demand and multi-platform rights to our partners. And in March, Warner's announced a new deal granting ABC network in-season stacking rights for its new series.
So we're making progress on many fronts, both inside and outside the traditional ecosystem. We're seeing the benefits of strong execution of our strategy and how that can continue to deliver superior returns for our shareholders. We've also ramped up our investments and our pace of innovation to meet the high expectations of today's and tomorrow's consumers. And that's why we're so confident about the rest of 2016 and beyond.
Thanks for listening, and let me turn it over to Howard Averill."

I'll begin by referring to the first slide of our presentation, which is now available on our website. Starting with consolidated results. We're off to a terrific start in 2016 with growth across each of our divisions, and that resulted in a quarterly record for adjusted operating income, which reached over $2 billion and a 25% increase in adjusted EPS. Total revenues grew 3%, and adjusted operating income was up a very healthy 11% with margins expanding 200 basis points. And we did that while continuing to grow our investments in programming and marketing at HBO and Turner. That was balanced by lower cost at Warner Bros., mainly due to the timing of our theatrical slate and by our continued company-wide focus on constraining growth and overhead costs. And we're able to once again leverage our positive operating results into even faster growth and adjusted EPS. That was partly due to our ongoing share repurchase program. During the quarter, we bought back $700 million of our shares. And combined with our dividend, we've returned close to $1.3 billion to shareholders year-to-date. This morning, we reaffirmed our guidance for 2016 adjusted EPS to be in the range of $5.30 to $5.40. So we're pleased with how we're executing and have significant operating momentum across our businesses, which gives us great confidence in our outlook for the rest of this year and beyond.
Now turning to the segment highlights. I'll start at Turner with the benefit from our domestic affiliate renewal cycle and continued strong advertising performance resulting in our best quarter of revenue growth in almost 3 years and record adjusted operating income. Subscription revenues were up a strong 11% in the quarter, and that included a close to 300 basis point headwind from FX. Domestic subscription revenues grew close to 15% as we benefited from the higher rates we achieved in our recent affiliate agreements. Excluding a 15 percentage point drag from FX, international subscription revenue growth was in the high single digits. While there may be quarter-to-quarter fluctuations due to a variety of factors, domestic sub revenue growth is on track to be in the low teens for the year, and we expect total subscription revenue growth through the rest of the year to be similar to the first quarter.
Advertising was up a solid 5% despite approximately 150 basis points of headwinds from FX. Domestic advertising grew in the mid-single digits. That was due to double-digit growth across Turner's linear and digital properties for both news and sports, including strong growth from the NCAA tournament. International advertising was also healthy in the quarter, up high single digits, excluding a close to 15 percentage point drag from FX.
Looking to the second quarter, scatter pricing at our domestic entertainment networks continues to be up well in double digits versus the Upfront and will benefit from the NCAA championship game while FX remains a headwind. As a result, we expect total advertising revenue growth to be in the mid to high single digits. And with a healthy ad market, continued rollout of our industry-leading advance advertising products and momentum at many of our brands, every indication points to a very strong Upfront this year.
Adjusted operating income increased 10%, and margins expanded 100 basis points. And we achieved that even as we continue to invest in programming and marketing as Turner kept all other expenses close to flat in the quarter. Programming expenses increased 4% mainly due to our investments in sports and election coverage, and marketing costs were up well into the double digits to support the TBS and TNT rebrands. So Turner is off to a terrific start in 2016 and is well positioned for another strong year. And we're confident the investments we are making across our brands will enhance our competitive position and allow us to sustain strong revenues trends and attractive financial results in the future.
Turning now to HBO where we continue to see very strong global demand for the product in the form of both subscriber growth and content licensing. Domestic subscription revenue growth was in the mid-single digits, and that included a sequential increase on the benefit from HBO NOW. However, despite year-over-year subscriber growth, we continue to experience headwinds from fewer revenue-generating subscribers at certain MVPDs, which has been partially driven by M&A activity. Over time, we actually see an opportunity to help those partners grow their businesses while accelerating our own revenue growth.
Content and other revenue increased 23% in the quarter. That was mainly due to higher international licensing revenues as HBO continues to benefit from its ability to effectively monetize its original content around the world. Across HBO's international networks, including unconsolidated JVs, revenues were up in the double digits, excluding the impact of FX, and international subscriber trends remained strong with healthy growth across all regions, especially LatAm and Europe.
Adjusted operating income was up 6% in the quarter, and that was despite a double-digit increase in programming costs as well as continued investments in marketing and technology related to HBO NOW. The increase in programming expense is related to new original programming like Vinyl and Sesame Street as well as programming charges related to series and development. Overall, HBO is off to a great start to the year. We're excited about our upcoming programming lineup. And with continued investments in the brand and product, we're in a great position to capitalize on the significant global opportunities for premium services.
Moving on to Warner Bros. where we posted record first quarter adjusted operating income. On the TV side, we benefited from higher international licensing revenues. And at our games business, the continued success of our LEGO and Mortal Kombat franchises helped drive another quarter of double-digit revenue growth. Despite the strong box office opening of Batman v Superman late in the quarter, total revenues were down modestly due to the difficult theatrical comparisons from last year's release of American Sniper and carryover from the final installment of The Hobbit. Across theatrical and TV, home entertainment revenues were down 12% as last year's quarter benefited from the home video release of the final Hobbit. So despite the difficult comparisons, EST revenues were still up mid-single digits in the quarter, and we expect our home entertainment trends to improve in the back half of the year as a result of stronger theatrical slate.
Adjusted operating income grew close to 30%. In addition to our strong games performance, we also benefited from lower P&A spending as a result of fewer releases this quarter. So Warner Bros. has great momentum, and we're just getting started on the theatrical side with Suicide Squad and Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, leading what should be a very strong lineup for both the remainder of this year and many years to come. Along with our strength in television and video games, that gives us great confidence in Warner's ability to continue delivering attractive growth well into the future.
Turning to the next slide. Free cash flow totaled over $700 million, which was down from a year ago due to a significant increase in working capital. That was largely related to increased production spend at Warner Bros. as well as the performance of its theatrical product in the fourth quarter of last year and the related impact on accounts receivables. Even so, we still expect very strong cash flow in 2016 driven by strong profit growth and another year of high conversion.
Now looking at our balance sheet. We ended the first quarter with $22 billion of net debt, up $500 million compared to the end of 2015. That's primarily a result of our ongoing commitment to direct returns to shareholders, which is a key component of our balanced approach to capital allocation. We ended the quarter just above our target leverage ratio of 2.75x. But we remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and our investment-grade credit ratings and are on track to return to our target by the end of this year.
With that, let's move on to the final slide, which looks at our outlook for 2016. We got off to a strong start in the first quarter, delivering growth across each of our businesses and setting us up for another very good year. That's reflected in our outlook for adjusted EPS of $5.30 to $5.40, which we reaffirmed this morning. And based on current rates, that includes an estimated $0.10 headwind from foreign exchange.
Looking ahead, we still expect growth in adjusted OI to be weighted towards the back half of the year. Specifically in the second quarter, we continue to see positive trends in both advertising and subscription revenue, and global demand for our content remains very strong. But there are several items that we expect to weigh on adjusted operating income, including the timing of content licensing revenue, the comparison to strong video games profits at Warner's in last year's quarter and programming investments at Turner. Despite that, we're on track for another year of very healthy growth in adjusted operating income and solid double-digit earnings growth, extending our history of delivering consistently strong operating and financial performance. And with Turner's revenue trends accelerating, HBO positioned to accelerate its subscription revenue growth over the next couple of years and Warner's in the early stages of an exciting theatrical slate, we feel we're in great position to continue delivering strong results for many years to come.
With that, I'll turn it back to Mike to start the Q&A."

Listen, I think we're -- we are proceeding exactly on pace with our internal plan. And so I mean, if you think about it, Kevin Reilly as the Head of our Entertainment Networks has been on the job for about a year. And it's really his new programming slate that's just beginning to roll out. We debuted 24 new seasons of owned original series on our domestic networks in the first quarter alone, and we have 20 more slated for the second quarter. And these new series, hopefully, give you a small sense for the bold-type quality and engaging programming that you can expect from Turner going forward, and we're very happy with the critical acclaim and the performance that these new shows are demonstrating across, frankly, all platforms: TV, digital and social. And just to add a little bit more flavor to that, I mean, premiering Angie Tribeca in a very new and unique way with a 25-hour commercial-free marathon brought about 36% new young audiences to network. Median age was about 10 years younger that our TBS median. And it continued its success on its regular season run, and it ranked #1 on Monday nights across all of cable sitcoms. I think it was Jeff that said -- who couldn't be more pleased than -- with the success of Detour, which recently premiered, and is reaching over 5 million viewers per episode across all of our TBS platforms, and it's ranked #1 of the new comedy releases in adults 18 to 49. Full Frontal with Samantha Bee, huge critical and commercial success across all platforms. We're reaching around 3.5 million viewers, and we're driving 30 million views on the show's YouTube channel. And that's really just TBS. During the first quarter, we have new seasons of Impractical Jokers. And for those who can actually [ph] DV, We Bare Bears and Steven Universe on Cartoon Network, and the Race for the White House in the 80s on CNN. So we're driving, I think, a general improvement in the quality of our original programming across all of our networks, and we've got a lot more to come. And most notably, the TV -- the TNT rebrand will begin later this year. And Jeff mentioned some of the shows that we're really excited about. With respect to the Upfront, I just would reiterate the enthusiasm that Howard suggested, which is that given the strong scatter, we're seeing some of our inventory sell for upwards of 30% to 50% higher than last year's Upfront levels. And given low cancellations, we think all signs point to, frankly, the best Upfront we will have seen in years. And we think our networks stand to gain at least our fair share of what happens in the Upfront. And we think it spells very, very well for just television in general as television is experiencing resurgence in the minds of brand advertisers as we're delivering reach and increasing targeting and audience capabilities. So very, very optimistic."

So I'll start just taking it in the order that you asked the questions. So listen, we -- and I appreciate the question, we're spending a lot of work, a lot of time, investment in increasing our capabilities in advertising. And frankly, we're holding ourselves accountable to lead the charge to modernize TV advertising by combining the unparalleled reach of television with the engaged -- and the engagement of TV with the measurement and targeting capabilities of digital. And we're quickly evolving the advertising industry to simultaneously benefit our advertisers as well as improve our overall consumer experience, and we don't see these goals as being mutually exclusive. Frankly, what we're trying to do is combine the best of both TV and digital, uniting scale and targeting a top-tier -- with top-tier content. That's one of the reasons why we're very bullish about the Upfront. In terms of our own new products, we've discussed before that we have built on the Turner Data Cloud, which is the central repository of all of our consumer information. And that's helping us launch new innovative products that focus on analytics, targeting an ROI. So just the names of the products, or some of them, we've got individual products called Targeting Now, Audience Now, ROI Now, Provable ROI, and what all that means is that it's going to be targeting audience-based selling coupled with our data cloud and client insights. And I think there are going to be increasing opportunities over time, and that's going to be a major, major focus in our Upfronts. And then I think you asked specifically with respect to OTT. I think the opportunities to develop advanced targeting capabilities in OTT are absolutely there. They're available. That is what -- assuming that the OTT offering is, in fact, ad-supported, FilmStruck, which is our first domestic offering, is going to be non-ad-supported, which is consistent with Turner Classic Movies. So I think the targeting opportunities will only grow over time, and we're still very, very -- in the very early stages. So we believe that TV advertising has to evolve, but it's going to remain the most effective option for brand advertisers to convey their message at scale. And that's why we expect a resurgence in TV advertising beginning at this year's Upfront."

If you just -- maybe, maybe we want our networks in every one of these packets. I mean, I think we ought to include that in a larger view of how the industry is evolving. And if you think about subscription VOD, it's been an opportunity that started with the first SVOD service, which is called HBO, a long time ago. And what we're watching happen, and I think it probably did start with HBO a decade ago, is consumers want to expect they're going to demand SVOD access to all their favorite networks, all their favorite shows. And what we've been seeing as an evolution is that on-demand functionality and better guides are sprouting up, first in HBO, then at some of the broadband-delivered services. And increasingly, you're seeing more full on-demand offerings of current exhibition networks and better interfaces guides and recommendation engines at places like Comcast, Verizon, Sling has one. And for us, with our networks, whether it's the Turner networks or the HBO networks, we've long said that we'd like our networks and their programming, including the debuts of current first-season exhibitions like what John is talking about and what Richard has been doing for years at HBO. We want them to be on-demand, and we would like to see most of our networks, whichever exhibition window, first run or syndication to be on-demand. And we're basically in an enviable position that our networks, Turner and HBO, are among the most desired networks for consumers and, therefore, to be included in all these packages. So you'll hear, I think, increasingly, of different packages with different network offerings that consumers can choose between at different price points available from existing cable, satellite and telco distributors, increasingly from new virtual distributors, whether it be Hulu, whether it's Amazon, Apple, whoever comes in and creates packages for consumers. So I think what you're seeing is a very vibrant rebirth of the strength of TV networks and TV programming across all of these distribution platforms. And because of our -- we've always taken the position being the first to launch VOD that we think more of it is better for consumers. And therefore, we're going to try to be available in all the packages consumers are interested in."

Is any impact of consolidation already in your results, or perhaps the way you're structured, you won't be impacted by that? And then my second question is on ELEAGUE.

Could you just talk a little bit about what -- why you think that's the right strategy, what your hopes are for that product?"

I think it's fair to say that, that considers the current environment, the number of distributors and what's happening in the marketplace. And when you have a highly concentrated portfolio of must-have networks, which we do, where we've got 85% of our affiliate revenues in 4 networks, I think it's a really advantageous place to be. So I think I'll leave it at that because obviously, we're not going to specifically comment on any particular consolidation. And then with respect to ELEAGUE, look, this is one of the innovations with respect to content that I think we're particularly excited about and proud of. And it's really -- it's not necessarily by design that we're looking to take digital content and move it to the TV. It's more just really trying to position the company to be where consumers are. And looking at secular growth areas and in looking at areas where particularly young people are spending tremendous amounts of time, you obviously have to pay attention to the gaming industry, but this whole notion of very significant population of individuals who are really excited to sit and watch professional gamers and some of the best gamers in the world, that's already happening. It's happening globally. And in some countries, it represents some of the highest levels of consumption of video content. So in some respects, having ELEAGUE be aired on TBS is somewhat of an experiment. I think we're going to learn a lot this year. And I look forward to hopefully building a big franchise and a big asset along with our partners on both TV and digital platforms."

I just wanted to sort of understand as HBO NOW is a standalone product, trying to be an all-encompassing product for a consumer. Is there an optimal amount of content you expect in terms of new originals every year split between comedies, dramas, kids, and as you go international, how much local content do you need to make that a viable successful product rather? And where are we on that transition there as one?"

And as I've said before, the mission of programming is to build as many addicts as we can out there in the consumer base, and different people love different things. So you have huge Silicon Valley fans, huge John Oliver or Bill Maher fans, huge sports fans. So we like the way we're breaking up our choices. And a lot of this, of course, is informed by the talent that comes through the door. Somebody comes in with a brilliant idea for an additional half hour. We're not going to say no to it because we have a certain number that we think is a ceiling. That's not how we make choices. In terms of HBO NOW, what we have done is we've augmented our programming with decisions like Jon Stewart and VICE News, and I think Bill Simmons will work across all platforms. So again, that opportunity to not be constrained by schedule is opening up a lot of creativity on the part of our talent who are coming in literally every week with new ideas. So you're going to see more and more of that going forward. So listen, we like our mix. We think if you'll look at just the Emmy nominations and the Emmy wins of last year, I think the thing that was most rewarding for us was that they were across all categories, a wide range of categories. And I think that's what makes our programming mix so special."

So you do have affiliates, cable affiliates who are growing subs in penetration. And the reason basically is they are offering very effective packages of VOD. They've got various packages at different prices with different network bundles for consumers. They've got good guide interfaces. And so you have a fairly large disparity in performance between distributors. And I think if you look at the high performance, you see where the future can go. And the fact that you now have more VOD offerings and different packages and price points is basically, I think -- and it -- we've seen it happen, it's going to increase penetration because consumers are going to find more packages that suit what they want. And in most cases, that'll be the biggest and largest packages of the big networks. But not in all cases. And so I think you're going to see -- and remember, to the extent you have some marketing of VOD products -- think of broadband delivery with good navigation, it basically increases consumer demand -- consumer recognition for powerful networks like CNN, TNT, HBO. All of that has kind of a national effect of increasing the presence of TV networks because all age groups increasingly now are finding their favorite programs offered the way they want them. They find a way to the networks if we sell them in the right distribution offering."

It's not so much about rating as whether or not it's serving what we think is its design purpose to affect resonance with a particular part of our consumer base.

Some people are going to look at Real Sports with the same degree of passion that other people look at Bill Maher or John Oliver. Some people are going to look at Veep with the same passion that other people will look at Silicon Valley. So this is a very subjective determination. We've been doing it for a long time. We think we have pretty good instincts about how to build a large variety in our slate, which appeals to a huge part of our consumer base. There's no exact science to it, and obviously, critical acclaim plays a role.

We're going to essentially cut it in half. And that, again, is consistent with our desire to evolve the industry that's going to simultaneously benefit our advertisers and improve the overall consumer experience. I will tell you, we are not doing it to lose money. So we fully intend to provide increased value per inventory unit that we sell. And now it's up to us to demonstrate that. But we are actively going to be moving beyond the 32nd spot of business to create innovative new ad products for our advertisers and marketers. And we made a number of announcements a number of months ago at CES, including data plus with longer-form brand ad breaks and launchpad, which is a social tool; and Courageous, which is our own in-house ability to develop branded content in the form of advertising.

So thanks, everyone, and good morning. Welcome to Time Warner's First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. This morning, we issued 2 press releases, one detailing our results for the first quarter; and the other reaffirming our 2016 full year business outlook.
Before we begin, there are 2 items I need to cover. First, we refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Schedules setting out reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our earnings release and trending schedules. These reconciliations are available on our website at www.timewarner.com/investors. Reconciliations of our expected future financial performance are also included in the business outlook release that is available on our website.
Second, today's announcement includes certain forward-looking statements, which are based on management's current expectations. Actual results may vary materially from those expressed or implied by these statements due to various factors. These factors are discussed in detail in Time Warner's SEC filings, including its most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. Time Warner is under no obligation and, in fact, expressly disclaims any obligation to update or alter its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
I'll now turn the call over to Jeff Bewkes, Time Warner's Chairman and CEO, who'll be followed by Howard Averill, Time Warner's CFO. After their prepared remarks, our divisional CEOs, John Martin, Richard Plepler and Kevin Tsujihara will join us for a Q&A session.

We told you on our last call that we expected 2016 to be another standout year for Time Warner. And in recent years, as you all know, we have been investing aggressively in the very best content while moving quickly to take advantage of new distribution opportunities that are emerging around the world. At the same time, we've maintained our disciplined approach to cost controls and capital allocation in order to maximize shareholder returns. And we anticipated that, that combination would allow us to continue to deliver industry-leading performance.
That's exactly what you're seeing in our first quarter results. Revenues increased 3% to $7.3 billion and adjusted operating income grew 11% to $2 billion. Adjusted earnings per share grew 25% to $1.49 per share, and we also returned over $1 billion to shareholders in share repurchases and dividends.
In addition to strong financial results, we're off to a tremendous start this year from a content perspective. In just the past few weeks, we've had the buzzer-beating final game of March Madness on TBS; CNN's must-watch election coverage; a global hit from Warner Bros. in Batman v Superman; and the return of HBO's epic series, Game of Thrones. Those are just a few examples of how our investments are translating into great content that deeply engages audiences across platforms and around the world. But there are many more. Let me start with Turner.
Once again, Turner had 3 of the top 10 basic cable networks in the U.S., and it continued to make progress on a multiyear transformation of its brands. The first quarter marked the start of TBS's repositioning as the place for young, fresh comedy with the successful premieres of Angie Tribeca, Full Frontal with Samantha Bee and Separation Anxiety. We followed those up last month with our new hit, The Detour. It's the biggest new comedy on cable this year. The early results are very encouraging with TBS ending the first quarter ranked as the #1 ad-supported cable network in prime time among adults 18 to 49. And we have a number of additional distinctive shows on tap this year, including Wrecked, which will debut next month.
The first quarter also marked the start of an acceleration in Turner's domestic affiliate revenue growth, which we've been talking to you about now for some time. That acceleration underscores the strength of the Turner brands and the investments we have been making in them in recent years. One of our most important investments was March Madness. And last March, Turner brought the championship game of the tournament to cable for the very first time. This year's tournament was another great success, delivering both a stirring finale and record revenue. Recently, we agreed to build on that success by partnering with CBS to extend our television, digital and marketing rights to the NCAA tournament all the way through 2032. Marquee live sports continue to grow in importance, both to consumers and advertisers. And combined with our extensive multi-platform rights, that gives us a lot of confidence we'll be able to generate a very attractive return on our investment in this unique property.
As March Madness wound down, the NBA playoffs were just getting started. The NBA on TNT grew viewership double digits in the first quarter. And with the playoffs underway, we have a great platform for TNT's own drama-focused brand refresh, which starts with Animal Kingdom from Warner Bros. in June. Nowhere is Turner's transformation more evident than at CNN, which more than doubled its prime time audience in the first quarter. CNN's ratings benefited from its unrivaled coverage of the U.S. presidential race as well as from its continued success with original series. Those 2 areas overlapped in Race for the White House, which premiered as the most-watched CNN original telecast ever.
Over at Home Box Office, I mentioned Game of Thrones already, which grew its opening viewership double digits versus a year ago on a cross-platform basis. But it doesn't stop there. That same weekend, HBO was host to Beyoncé's headline-grabbing visual album, Lemonade; also, the television premiere of Jurassic World; a world championship boxing match; and the return of our 2 hit comedies, Veep and Silicon Valley. It's -- it was a great example of the range and quality of the content that HBO delivers to its subs. We're just as excited for what's still to come this year at HBO, including the second season of Ballers, that's our new series, started last year; a new series, Divorce, with Sarah Jessica Parker; and our limited series, THE NIGHT OF, which just previewed to a tremendous reception at the Tribeca Film Festival.
At Warner Bros., Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice set a record for a March opening weekend, and it's already Warner's biggest-ever first quarter release. Even better, it's only the opening chapter of an exciting slate of DC Entertainment films that we think will captivate audiences globally for years to come. Next up is Suicide Squad this summer, followed by LEGO Batman, Wonder Woman and Justice League, all in 2017. And as you know, these franchise films are the cornerstone of a strategy that's making DC a growth driver across film, television, digital, games and consumer products. Warner's has a lot more on deck, including J.K. Rowling's return to the big screen this November with Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. Judging by the huge crowd since the opening last month of The Wizarding World of Harry Potter attraction in Hollywood, there are plenty of fans who are just excited as we are for the next installment of this great franchise.
In television, Warner's has built on its leading position in broadcast with 3 of the top 5 new series this season. That includes not only scripted series like the #1 new show, Blindspot, but also unscripted series like Little Big Shots, which has already been picked up in 2 major international territories. Given the performance of Warner's current shows with a record 21 renewals ahead of the Upfront this year and a strong slate of pilots, Warner's is in a great position to once again lead the industry in broadcast series programming this coming season. And we're also expanding our production for cable and over-the-top services. We have twice the number of new series orders for next season. So across the company, we're continuing to lead the way of producing groundbreaking content.
And to capitalize on the rapid shift to on-demand consumption and broadband delivery of video, we're focused on innovation, both in the type of content we produce and how we get it to consumers. For example, on May 24, Turner is launching ELEAGUE, that's our professional competitive gaming league, in partnership with WME | IMG. In addition to its telecast on TBS, ELEAGUE will have a significant digital component and partnership with Twitch. ELEAGUE reflects Turner's commitment to creating and delivering content for multi-platform audiences. That commitment is also reflected in Turner's other efforts to grow its presence outside the traditional television ecosystem, particularly in news and sports. CNN finished the quarter as the leading digital news brand in multi-platform video, and Bleacher Report remained the #2 online sports destination. We'll be ramping up investments in both of these properties over the next couple of years to further expand on their leadership positions.
HBO is also investing in content geared toward digital audiences by bringing onboard talent like Bill Simmons and Jon Stewart. Any Given Wednesday with Bill Simmons does not debut until next month, but Bill's already making his mark with HBO's first aftershow, After the Thrones. Like Animals, After the Thrones is debuting first on HBO NOW and HBO GO. We continue to see significant growth in both users and usage of our digital platforms, and we expect that to continue with our recent expansion of HBO NOW to Microsoft's Xbox and to Samsung Smart TVs.
We're also expanding the reach of HBO's OTT products internationally. In the first quarter, HBO LAG launched an OTT service in Mexico, and HBO announced plans for OTT launches later this year in Spain, Brazil and Argentina. That's all part of a broader push across the company to develop new services and capabilities. We talked to you previously about Warner's SVOD investments in Asia. In February, Warner Bros. announced the acquisition of DramaFever to further bolster our OTT capabilities. And just last week, Turner announced its first domestic SVOD service, FilmStruck, which will build on the curation expertise of TCM to targeted enthusiasts of independent, foreign and art house films. At the same time, we're deeply committed to strengthening our core networks and to helping our traditional distribution and network partners improve their products to satisfy consumers' desire for on-demand content. HBO and Turner have been at the forefront of providing on-demand and multi-platform rights to our partners. And in March, Warner's announced a new deal granting ABC network in-season stacking rights for its new series.
So we're making progress on many fronts, both inside and outside the traditional ecosystem. We're seeing the benefits of strong execution of our strategy and how that can continue to deliver superior returns for our shareholders. We've also ramped up our investments and our pace of innovation to meet the high expectations of today's and tomorrow's consumers. And that's why we're so confident about the rest of 2016 and beyond.
Thanks for listening, and let me turn it over to Howard Averill."

I'll begin by referring to the first slide of our presentation, which is now available on our website. Starting with consolidated results. We're off to a terrific start in 2016 with growth across each of our divisions, and that resulted in a quarterly record for adjusted operating income, which reached over $2 billion and a 25% increase in adjusted EPS. Total revenues grew 3%, and adjusted operating income was up a very healthy 11% with margins expanding 200 basis points. And we did that while continuing to grow our investments in programming and marketing at HBO and Turner. That was balanced by lower cost at Warner Bros., mainly due to the timing of our theatrical slate and by our continued company-wide focus on constraining growth and overhead costs. And we're able to once again leverage our positive operating results into even faster growth and adjusted EPS. That was partly due to our ongoing share repurchase program. During the quarter, we bought back $700 million of our shares. And combined with our dividend, we've returned close to $1.3 billion to shareholders year-to-date. This morning, we reaffirmed our guidance for 2016 adjusted EPS to be in the range of $5.30 to $5.40. So we're pleased with how we're executing and have significant operating momentum across our businesses, which gives us great confidence in our outlook for the rest of this year and beyond.
Now turning to the segment highlights. I'll start at Turner with the benefit from our domestic affiliate renewal cycle and continued strong advertising performance resulting in our best quarter of revenue growth in almost 3 years and record adjusted operating income. Subscription revenues were up a strong 11% in the quarter, and that included a close to 300 basis point headwind from FX. Domestic subscription revenues grew close to 15% as we benefited from the higher rates we achieved in our recent affiliate agreements. Excluding a 15 percentage point drag from FX, international subscription revenue growth was in the high single digits. While there may be quarter-to-quarter fluctuations due to a variety of factors, domestic sub revenue growth is on track to be in the low teens for the year, and we expect total subscription revenue growth through the rest of the year to be similar to the first quarter.
Advertising was up a solid 5% despite approximately 150 basis points of headwinds from FX. Domestic advertising grew in the mid-single digits. That was due to double-digit growth across Turner's linear and digital properties for both news and sports, including strong growth from the NCAA tournament. International advertising was also healthy in the quarter, up high single digits, excluding a close to 15 percentage point drag from FX.
Looking to the second quarter, scatter pricing at our domestic entertainment networks continues to be up well in double digits versus the Upfront and will benefit from the NCAA championship game while FX remains a headwind. As a result, we expect total advertising revenue growth to be in the mid to high single digits. And with a healthy ad market, continued rollout of our industry-leading advance advertising products and momentum at many of our brands, every indication points to a very strong Upfront this year.
Adjusted operating income increased 10%, and margins expanded 100 basis points. And we achieved that even as we continue to invest in programming and marketing as Turner kept all other expenses close to flat in the quarter. Programming expenses increased 4% mainly due to our investments in sports and election coverage, and marketing costs were up well into the double digits to support the TBS and TNT rebrands. So Turner is off to a terrific start in 2016 and is well positioned for another strong year. And we're confident the investments we are making across our brands will enhance our competitive position and allow us to sustain strong revenues trends and attractive financial results in the future.
Turning now to HBO where we continue to see very strong global demand for the product in the form of both subscriber growth and content licensing. Domestic subscription revenue growth was in the mid-single digits, and that included a sequential increase on the benefit from HBO NOW. However, despite year-over-year subscriber growth, we continue to experience headwinds from fewer revenue-generating subscribers at certain MVPDs, which has been partially driven by M&A activity. Over time, we actually see an opportunity to help those partners grow their businesses while accelerating our own revenue growth.
Content and other revenue increased 23% in the quarter. That was mainly due to higher international licensing revenues as HBO continues to benefit from its ability to effectively monetize its original content around the world. Across HBO's international networks, including unconsolidated JVs, revenues were up in the double digits, excluding the impact of FX, and international subscriber trends remained strong with healthy growth across all regions, especially LatAm and Europe.
Adjusted operating income was up 6% in the quarter, and that was despite a double-digit increase in programming costs as well as continued investments in marketing and technology related to HBO NOW. The increase in programming expense is related to new original programming like Vinyl and Sesame Street as well as programming charges related to series and development. Overall, HBO is off to a great start to the year. We're excited about our upcoming programming lineup. And with continued investments in the brand and product, we're in a great position to capitalize on the significant global opportunities for premium services.
Moving on to Warner Bros. where we posted record first quarter adjusted operating income. On the TV side, we benefited from higher international licensing revenues. And at our games business, the continued success of our LEGO and Mortal Kombat franchises helped drive another quarter of double-digit revenue growth. Despite the strong box office opening of Batman v Superman late in the quarter, total revenues were down modestly due to the difficult theatrical comparisons from last year's release of American Sniper and carryover from the final installment of The Hobbit. Across theatrical and TV, home entertainment revenues were down 12% as last year's quarter benefited from the home video release of the final Hobbit. So despite the difficult comparisons, EST revenues were still up mid-single digits in the quarter, and we expect our home entertainment trends to improve in the back half of the year as a result of stronger theatrical slate.
Adjusted operating income grew close to 30%. In addition to our strong games performance, we also benefited from lower P&A spending as a result of fewer releases this quarter. So Warner Bros. has great momentum, and we're just getting started on the theatrical side with Suicide Squad and Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, leading what should be a very strong lineup for both the remainder of this year and many years to come. Along with our strength in television and video games, that gives us great confidence in Warner's ability to continue delivering attractive growth well into the future.
Turning to the next slide. Free cash flow totaled over $700 million, which was down from a year ago due to a significant increase in working capital. That was largely related to increased production spend at Warner Bros. as well as the performance of its theatrical product in the fourth quarter of last year and the related impact on accounts receivables. Even so, we still expect very strong cash flow in 2016 driven by strong profit growth and another year of high conversion.
Now looking at our balance sheet. We ended the first quarter with $22 billion of net debt, up $500 million compared to the end of 2015. That's primarily a result of our ongoing commitment to direct returns to shareholders, which is a key component of our balanced approach to capital allocation. We ended the quarter just above our target leverage ratio of 2.75x. But we remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and our investment-grade credit ratings and are on track to return to our target by the end of this year.
With that, let's move on to the final slide, which looks at our outlook for 2016. We got off to a strong start in the first quarter, delivering growth across each of our businesses and setting us up for another very good year. That's reflected in our outlook for adjusted EPS of $5.30 to $5.40, which we reaffirmed this morning. And based on current rates, that includes an estimated $0.10 headwind from foreign exchange.
Looking ahead, we still expect growth in adjusted OI to be weighted towards the back half of the year. Specifically in the second quarter, we continue to see positive trends in both advertising and subscription revenue, and global demand for our content remains very strong. But there are several items that we expect to weigh on adjusted operating income, including the timing of content licensing revenue, the comparison to strong video games profits at Warner's in last year's quarter and programming investments at Turner. Despite that, we're on track for another year of very healthy growth in adjusted operating income and solid double-digit earnings growth, extending our history of delivering consistently strong operating and financial performance. And with Turner's revenue trends accelerating, HBO positioned to accelerate its subscription revenue growth over the next couple of years and Warner's in the early stages of an exciting theatrical slate, we feel we're in great position to continue delivering strong results for many years to come.
With that, I'll turn it back to Mike to start the Q&A."

Listen, I think we're -- we are proceeding exactly on pace with our internal plan. And so I mean, if you think about it, Kevin Reilly as the Head of our Entertainment Networks has been on the job for about a year. And it's really his new programming slate that's just beginning to roll out. We debuted 24 new seasons of owned original series on our domestic networks in the first quarter alone, and we have 20 more slated for the second quarter. And these new series, hopefully, give you a small sense for the bold-type quality and engaging programming that you can expect from Turner going forward, and we're very happy with the critical acclaim and the performance that these new shows are demonstrating across, frankly, all platforms: TV, digital and social. And just to add a little bit more flavor to that, I mean, premiering Angie Tribeca in a very new and unique way with a 25-hour commercial-free marathon brought about 36% new young audiences to network. Median age was about 10 years younger that our TBS median. And it continued its success on its regular season run, and it ranked #1 on Monday nights across all of cable sitcoms. I think it was Jeff that said -- who couldn't be more pleased than -- with the success of Detour, which recently premiered, and is reaching over 5 million viewers per episode across all of our TBS platforms, and it's ranked #1 of the new comedy releases in adults 18 to 49. Full Frontal with Samantha Bee, huge critical and commercial success across all platforms. We're reaching around 3.5 million viewers, and we're driving 30 million views on the show's YouTube channel. And that's really just TBS. During the first quarter, we have new seasons of Impractical Jokers. And for those who can actually [ph] DV, We Bare Bears and Steven Universe on Cartoon Network, and the Race for the White House in the 80s on CNN. So we're driving, I think, a general improvement in the quality of our original programming across all of our networks, and we've got a lot more to come. And most notably, the TV -- the TNT rebrand will begin later this year. And Jeff mentioned some of the shows that we're really excited about. With respect to the Upfront, I just would reiterate the enthusiasm that Howard suggested, which is that given the strong scatter, we're seeing some of our inventory sell for upwards of 30% to 50% higher than last year's Upfront levels. And given low cancellations, we think all signs point to, frankly, the best Upfront we will have seen in years. And we think our networks stand to gain at least our fair share of what happens in the Upfront. And we think it spells very, very well for just television in general as television is experiencing resurgence in the minds of brand advertisers as we're delivering reach and increasing targeting and audience capabilities. So very, very optimistic."

Could you talk a little bit about what you're planning to do this year in terms of targeted or advanced advertising? And how different is it for television versus over-the-top? And on -- I know this is a long one question, but on over-the-top, will you participate in Hulu or -- I mean, or not? And then a separate -- second question is for Kevin. Do you think the sale of DreamWorks Animation will spark midsize or other studio consolidation? And if yes, will Warner Bros. participate in consolidation?"

So I'll start just taking it in the order that you asked the questions. So listen, we -- and I appreciate the question, we're spending a lot of work, a lot of time, investment in increasing our capabilities in advertising. And frankly, we're holding ourselves accountable to lead the charge to modernize TV advertising by combining the unparalleled reach of television with the engaged -- and the engagement of TV with the measurement and targeting capabilities of digital. And we're quickly evolving the advertising industry to simultaneously benefit our advertisers as well as improve our overall consumer experience, and we don't see these goals as being mutually exclusive. Frankly, what we're trying to do is combine the best of both TV and digital, uniting scale and targeting a top-tier -- with top-tier content. That's one of the reasons why we're very bullish about the Upfront. In terms of our own new products, we've discussed before that we have built on the Turner Data Cloud, which is the central repository of all of our consumer information. And that's helping us launch new innovative products that focus on analytics, targeting an ROI. So just the names of the products, or some of them, we've got individual products called Targeting Now, Audience Now, ROI Now, Provable ROI, and what all that means is that it's going to be targeting audience-based selling coupled with our data cloud and client insights. And I think there are going to be increasing opportunities over time, and that's going to be a major, major focus in our Upfronts. And then I think you asked specifically with respect to OTT. I think the opportunities to develop advanced targeting capabilities in OTT are absolutely there. They're available. That is what -- assuming that the OTT offering is, in fact, ad-supported, FilmStruck, which is our first domestic offering, is going to be non-ad-supported, which is consistent with Turner Classic Movies. So I think the targeting opportunities will only grow over time, and we're still very, very -- in the very early stages. So we believe that TV advertising has to evolve, but it's going to remain the most effective option for brand advertisers to convey their message at scale. And that's why we expect a resurgence in TV advertising beginning at this year's Upfront."

If you just -- maybe, maybe we want our networks in every one of these packets. I mean, I think we ought to include that in a larger view of how the industry is evolving. And if you think about subscription VOD, it's been an opportunity that started with the first SVOD service, which is called HBO, a long time ago. And what we're watching happen, and I think it probably did start with HBO a decade ago, is consumers want to expect they're going to demand SVOD access to all their favorite networks, all their favorite shows. And what we've been seeing as an evolution is that on-demand functionality and better guides are sprouting up, first in HBO, then at some of the broadband-delivered services. And increasingly, you're seeing more full on-demand offerings of current exhibition networks and better interfaces guides and recommendation engines at places like Comcast, Verizon, Sling has one. And for us, with our networks, whether it's the Turner networks or the HBO networks, we've long said that we'd like our networks and their programming, including the debuts of current first-season exhibitions like what John is talking about and what Richard has been doing for years at HBO. We want them to be on-demand, and we would like to see most of our networks, whichever exhibition window, first run or syndication to be on-demand. And we're basically in an enviable position that our networks, Turner and HBO, are among the most desired networks for consumers and, therefore, to be included in all these packages. So you'll hear, I think, increasingly, of different packages with different network offerings that consumers can choose between at different price points available from existing cable, satellite and telco distributors, increasingly from new virtual distributors, whether it be Hulu, whether it's Amazon, Apple, whoever comes in and creates packages for consumers. So I think what you're seeing is a very vibrant rebirth of the strength of TV networks and TV programming across all of these distribution platforms. And because of our -- we've always taken the position being the first to launch VOD that we think more of it is better for consumers. And therefore, we're going to try to be available in all the packages consumers are interested in."

First, on the affiliate fee growth, several of your peers see impact from the distributor consideration and some rate resets dragging on their growth. Obviously, you're putting up great growth right now. Do you expect to have any impact in the future from consolidation? Is any impact of consolidation already in your results, or perhaps the way you're structured, you won't be impacted by that? And then my second question is on ELEAGUE. Specifically, most strategies we see is taking linear content and finding new digital avenues. This is a case where you're taking something that's done well digitally and you're bringing it to TV. Could you just talk a little bit about what -- why you think that's the right strategy, what your hopes are for that product?"

Look, with respect to our affiliate fees, I think you have the forecast or the guidance that we provided for this year and next year where we expect domestic subscriber revenues to be in the low teens. I think it's fair to say that, that considers the current environment, the number of distributors and what's happening in the marketplace. And when you have a highly concentrated portfolio of must-have networks, which we do, where we've got 85% of our affiliate revenues in 4 networks, I think it's a really advantageous place to be. So I think I'll leave it at that because obviously, we're not going to specifically comment on any particular consolidation. And then with respect to ELEAGUE, look, this is one of the innovations with respect to content that I think we're particularly excited about and proud of. And it's really -- it's not necessarily by design that we're looking to take digital content and move it to the TV. It's more just really trying to position the company to be where consumers are. And looking at secular growth areas and in looking at areas where particularly young people are spending tremendous amounts of time, you obviously have to pay attention to the gaming industry, but this whole notion of very significant population of individuals who are really excited to sit and watch professional gamers and some of the best gamers in the world, that's already happening. It's happening globally. And in some countries, it represents some of the highest levels of consumption of video content. So in some respects, having ELEAGUE be aired on TBS is somewhat of an experiment. I think we're going to learn a lot this year. And I look forward to hopefully building a big franchise and a big asset along with our partners on both TV and digital platforms."

We're not going to say no to it because we have a certain number that we think is a ceiling. That's not how we make choices. In terms of HBO NOW, what we have done is we've augmented our programming with decisions like Jon Stewart and VICE News, and I think Bill Simmons will work across all platforms.

And I think, further to what Jeff just said, as affiliates, whether they're traditional or nontraditional affiliates, put out packages, smaller packages of better networks at lower economic price points, we're going to be able to attract back households into the multichannel ecosystem that have, frankly, moved away because they don't see the value of the uber-bundles. That'll be good for us."

It's not so much about rating as whether or not it's serving what we think is its design purpose to affect resonance with a particular part of our consumer base.

Some people are going to look at Real Sports with the same degree of passion that other people look at Bill Maher or John Oliver. Some people are going to look at Veep with the same passion that other people will look at Silicon Valley. So this is a very subjective determination. We've been doing it for a long time. We think we have pretty good instincts about how to build a large variety in our slate, which appeals to a huge part of our consumer base. There's no exact science to it, and obviously, critical acclaim plays a role. But we have a very good collective instinct inside the company when we think something is resonating with a particular part of our audience.

We're about halfway through the year, and we're well on our way or exceeding our original 2016 goals. At the same time, we've been making the necessary investments in the very best video content and the development of new and exciting distribution opportunities in order to continue driving industry-leading growth over the long term. 
In the quarter, we generated revenues of $7 billion and adjusted operating income of $1.8 billion and adjusted earnings per share grew to $1.29 per share. We also returned over $1 billion to shareholders in share repurchases and dividends. 
Our financial results continue to be fueled by creative excellence across our divisions. Since we last spoke with you, we received 148 Primetime Emmy nominations, that's more than any other company. With HBO's 94, again, setting the pace for the industry. TNT and TBS finished the second quarter as the 2 highest rated cable networks in prime time. With TNT airing cables most-viewed NBA telecast of all time and Warner's, once again, came out of the upfront as the leading supplier to the broadcast network. We expect that momentum to continue this weekend with the opening of Suicide Squad, one of the summer's most anticipated movie. 
Our results also reflect the consistent execution of our strategy that we've been discussing with you for years. A core part of that strategy is to ensure that our networks, our shows and our brands are available to consumers on a wide range of platforms and devices and an all-important bundles, both within the traditional ecosystem and outside of it, with state-of-the-art user interfaces and more and more on demand functionality. 
Now in many cases, we'll simply extend our traditional wholesale model of licensing our content and networks to third parties. But we're also investing in new services both wholly-owned and with partners that have a more direct relationship with consumers. In doing that, we're positioning ourselves to develop new revenue streams for our industry-leading brands. 
Among our initiatives to date, HBO NOW is the most significant and the second quarter was its strongest yet. But even HBO NOW is just one of many investments and initiatives in this area. HBO has launched similar services in the Nordic region and in parts of Latin America with additional launches scheduled for later this year. At Turner, we're in the process of launching an odd house film SVOD service called FilmStruck, which follows the recent launches of SVOD services by Adult Swim in Canada and Esporte Interativo in Brazil.  And those short form digital content initiatives like Great Big Story and Super Deluxe. 
And over at Warner's, the SVOD service we partnered on in China with [indiscernible] Video VIP recently passed 10 million subscribers. 
We've also enhanced our broadband distribution capabilities with acquisitions like Ice Cream Planet and DramaFever. 
This morning, we announced another exciting next step in that strategy, and that's our investment in Hulu. This investment fits our strategy like a glove.  It will increase our company's exposure to the secular growth and over-the-top services. And it will give Hulu more resources to offer consumers more shows and more choices, fostering competition and innovation among both SVOD services and among MVPD services. 
We also announced that the virtual MVPD service Hulu expects to launch early next year will include live and on-demand access to the full suite of Turner Network. 
Consumers clearly want innovative interfaces, they want more robust on-demand capabilities, and they expect a greater variety of content packages.  And we want to support services that do just that. So consistent with our strategy, our investment in Hulu lives us free to continue to support fully as we always have other traditional and broadband delivery distribution platforms.  We look forward to working closely with our existing MVPD partners and with existing and new over-the-top partners in bringing consumers more choice in how to access our best-in-class shows and network. We expect they'll be a number of additional virtual MVPDs that launch over the coming years, and we think that the increasing choices available as a result of these new services will be grateful for consumers and for our industry-leading brands. 
Speaking of brands, let me share a few more highlights from the past quarter that show how are investments in Turner's core brands are helping transform its business by driving increased engagement with audiences across both traditional and new platforms. 
Here in the U.S., Turner had 3 of the top 5 ad-supported cable network in primetime among adults 18 to 49, that's TNT, TBS and Adult Swim. 
On Adult Swim, it continues to be far and away the most watched by millennials. It attracts 60% more 18- to 34-year-olds than its nearest competitor, 60% more. 
Now we've talked before about the both programming refresh under way of both TBS and TNT, and we couldn't be happier with the initial results. We've launched 5 marked key original across TBS and TNT this year, and we've already renewed all of them. 
Together, Wrecked, Angie Tribeca, The Detour, Full Frontal with Samantha Bee and Animal Kingdom are great examples of where we're taking the TBS and TNT brands and they've also passed our expectations for initials slate of new shows. 
We're particularly pleased with the audience growth we've seen from Samantha Bee and Animal Kingdom since their launches and we're also gratified by the strong positive response that we've had from the gaming community to the launch of ELEAGUE, that's our e-sports initiative. 
The strong demand we saw on the Upfront clearly demonstrated the belief advertisers have and the direction we're moving in and in the value of our brands and that translated into double-digit CPM increases for Turner's entertainment networks. 
We also benefited from Turner's continued innovation and advertising products with our targeting analytics capabilities getting the pace for the industry. 
Demand in the Upfront was particularly strong for CNN, which has undergone nothing short of a renaissance over the past few years. 
To-date, 2016 is the most-watched year in CNN's history. And as the U.S. presidential election draws closer, CNN continues to gain momentum and take share from its peers. 
CNN was the #1 news -- let me say, this very clearly, CNN was #1 news network among adults 18 to 49 in prime time for the third consecutive quarter and CNN Digital becomes the #1 new service and multiplatform and mobile UNIX. 
During the conventions of the past 2 weeks, both conventions, CNN led all networks, broadcast and cable alike in viewership. And while CNN's in-depth news coverage continues to lead the industry, it's also building its next generation of viewers with a strong lineup of originals and leading digital products. 
We're just excited about the momentum at HBO, which, once again, proved it's without [indiscernible] when it comes to premium content. It's 94 Emmy nominations led the industry for the 16th straight year and included nominations for Game of Thrones for Outstanding Drama and both Veep and Silicon Valley for Outstanding Comedy as well as John Oliver and Bill Maher for Outstanding Variety Talk Show. 
HBO status as the gold standard for premium content was also reinforced by the response to the most recent season of Game of Thrones, which averaged over 25 million viewers per episode, that's more than 25% higher than last year's record, and it's nothing less than astounding if you consider HBO subbase. 
Much of that growth was driven by its digital platforms, where viewership nearly doubled from a year ago. Our digital platforms also contributed to double-digit growth for Veep and Silicon Valley, both of which reached series highs. 
We've been thrilled with overwhelming critical and consumer response to the limited crime series, THE NIGHT OF, which will be followed up this fall by the much anticipated sci-fi series, Westworld, from Warner Bros. and the return of Sarah Jessica Parker to HBO in Divorce. 
So we couldn't feel better about HBO's content line up. The strength of the HBO content and brands have been evident in the growth of HBO NOW, and we're looking to super serve that audience by introducing new content geared for our digital and on demand platforms. That story with the debut of Bill Simmons I Any Given Wednesday that happened in June, and we're going to follow that with the VICE News Tonight and Jon Stewart's highly original and much-anticipated new project later this year. 
Now let me turn to Warner Bros. which remains on track for another record year as it continues to take advantage of its iconic IP with a franchise-driven strategy that spans television, film and games. 
The strength of our great IP at Warner's, which evident this quarter in the performance of Warner's television, which is, once again, leading the industry. For the 2016 to '17 season, Warner TV is set to be the #1 producer of broadcast shows for the 13th time in the last 14 seasons with 31 series, 22 of which are returning. That's the highest returning series number in the company's history. Across all networks and services, Warner Bros. will produce 65 series for the upcoming year. That includes 10 shows originating in the DC comics universe underscoring the importance of the DC franchise to our television business. 
But DC is also a critical component for our video games business, which coming off a record performance last year just had its biggest LEGO launch ever. We're going to follow that up next month with Batman: The Telltale Series from our publisher Telltale Games. 
Batman is also the star of Batman Arkham VR, that's our first virtual reality game. Arkham VR will be one of the launch titles for PlayStation VR, and it's Batman like you've never seen them before because you basically are him. It's a great example of how great IP translates across many different platforms and experiences that underscores the strength of our competitive position as new platforms continue to emerge. 
On the theatrical side, we're starting to build some real momentum with the recent strength of highly profitable performers in Me Before You, Central Intelligence and Conjuring 2. 
Our Conjuring 2 has already passed 300 million of the global box office, and it's become one of the most successful horror franchises in history, and we're thrilled with the recent opening of Lights Out, that's another micro-budget horror hit from New Loft. 
Looking forward, Suicide Squad is tracking to be the biggest opening ever for an August release. 
So we're already well on our way to what we think will be a blockbuster second half performance for our theatrical business. We follow Suicide Squad with War Dogs, comedy from Todd Phillips starring Jonah Hill and Bradley Cooper that will debut later this month. And next month, we'll have the inspiring story of Sully from Clint Eastwood and starring Tom Hanks and Storks, a charming newbie from Warner animation. 
Later this year, we will all have a chance to return to the Wizarding World created by J.K. Rowling when Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them hits theaters. Months ahead of its release, excitement about the franchise is already building. 
Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, which is J.K. Rowling's first stage production, recently opened and it's already sold out through next May. The book version of the play script was released last week, and it had the most preorders of any title at Barnes and Noble since the last Harry Potter book was released in 2007. 
And the opening of the Harry Potter Hogsmeade attraction at Universal Hollywood has been really well received, driving significant increases in audience. 
That all sets the stage for the November release of Fantastic Beasts, a stunning new chapter in J.K. continuing saga. We couldn't be more excited and as Warner announced earlier today, the second installment of the series is already set for release in November 16, 2018. 
So we're in the midst of a very vibrant content cycle here across our businesses and that puts us in a great position to benefit as global demand for the best video content continues to rise. 
We're making a lot of progress, both in strengthening our position within the traditional ecosystem and building new revenue streams and capabilities outside. 
And our investment and Turner's with agreement with Hulu just another example of how we're taking advantage of new platforms to serve consumers, increased competition and further grow our business. We're seeing increased value accrue to the very strongest brands and to the very best video content. 
And along with that come new opportunities that arise from digital distribution all around the world. And that's why we're very confident about the rest of 2016 and well beyond. 
Thanks for listening. Let me turn it over to Howard the fantastic financial details to give you."

I'll begin by referring to the first slide of our presentation, which is now available on our website. Starting with consolidated results. We're pleased with our operating and financial performance to-date and we're on",1884,"Thanks, Jeff, and good morning. 
I'll begin by referring to the first slide of our presentation, which is now available on our website. 
Starting with consolidated results. We're pleased with our operating and financial performance to-date and we're on track to exceed the outlook we provided at the start of the year. 
Through the first half of the year, adjusted operating income was up 3% and adjusted EPS was up 14%. And we delivered that while making significant investments not only in our traditional businesses but also in new capabilities and revenue streams that will drive future growth. 
We knew coming into the second quarter that we faced difficult comparisons from a timing of content licensing revenue across our divisions. Last year's record gains performance at Warner's and the timing of programming investments at both Turner and HBO. So as we expected, both revenues and adjusted operating income were down in the quarter. 
Given so, we are able to keep adjusted operating income margins for the quarter steady year-over-year at 25%. That reflected our mix of revenue, a positive swing eliminations and our continued company-wide focus on limiting growth and overhead costs, which were roughly flat in the quarter. 
Adjusted EPS was up 3%, that's primarily due to lower effective tax rate and the benefit of our ongoing share repurchase program. During the second quarter, we bought back around $700 million of our shares and paid close to $320 million in dividends. And year-to-date, we returned about $2.3 billion to shareholders. So we had a strong first half, and we feel great about how this year is shaping up. 
As a result, we raised our outlook for 2016 adjusted EPS, which we now expect to be in the range of $5.35 to $5.45. I'll touch on more of the details of our outlook later in the presentation. 
Now turning to the segment highlights. I'll start at Turner with the investments we've been making in the transformation of our core brands contributed to another quarter of very strong revenue growth. Subscription revenues once again grew 11% in the quarter and that included approximately 150 basis points of headwinds from FX. 
Domestic subscription revenues were up in the low teens as we continue to benefit from the rate increases we achieved during our affiliate renewal cycle and excluding a close to 10% point drag from FX, international subscription revenue growth would have been in the high single digits. 
Advertising revenues increased a solid 6% despite approximately 100 basis points of headwinds from FX. Domestic advertising grew in the high single digits, marking the third consecutive quarter of healthy growth. That reflected another quarter of double-digit growth in both news and sports, which included the benefit from airing the NCAA National Championship game for the first time this year. 
International advertising would have been up mid-single digits, excluding a close to 10 percentage points drag from FX. 
Looking ahead to the third quarter. We expect total advertising revenue growth to be in the low single digits. The scatter market remains healthy with pricing at our domestic entertainment networks facing up well into double digits over last year's upfront. 
At the same time, we're going to air significantly fewer hours of original programming across our domestic entertainment networks, and that's partially an effort to stay out of the way at this year's Summer Olympics. 
The third quarter is also our lightest quarter for sports inventory and FX remains a headwind. 
Moving on. Content and other revenues declined 15% in the quarter that reflects lower licensing revenues due to the comparison of last year's deal with Hulu. Adjusted operating income was flat in the quarter as healthy revenue growth was balanced by continued investments in programming and marketing. Programming expenses increased to 11%, mainly due to higher sports costs, including the NCAA National Championship game I mentioned earlier and our continued investment in bold new original programming as part of the re-brands at TBS and TNT. 
Marketing costs were up mid-teen to support those new original series. 
Overall, Turner has great operating momentum and is well positioned to maintain its strong revenue trends in the second half of the year, putting it on track for another year of solid growth. We're doing that while continuing to make important investments and new initiatives like Ice Cream Planet, extending Bleacher Report and CNN's Digital Products. And together, we think the investments we're making across the business will allow Turner to deliver attractive results over the long term as well. 
Turning to HBO. We were pleased with the progress we're making as we continue to invest in the significant global opportunity and subscription video services. Domestic subscription revenue growth was in the mid-single digits in the quarter and that included a continued sequential increase in the contribution from HBO NOW, where we remain encouraged with our progress. 
Content and other revenues decreased 17% in the quarter mainly due to lower revenues from our licensing deal with Amazon. That was balanced by solid growth in international licensing revenues highlighting our ability to effectively monetize our original programming around the world. 
Across HBO's international networks, including unconsolidated JVs, revenues were up double digits, and that's a reflection of continued positive international subscriber trends, especially in Latin America and the Nordics. 
Adjusted operating income fell 5% in the quarter, and that reflects higher programming expenses, including programming charges and restructuring and severance costs. The programming charges and restructuring and severance costs totaled approximately $100 million, and that's largely related to a change in leadership on the programming front. 
Separately, after considering consumer viewing patters, including increased on demand access to HBO's content across a wide range of devices and services, we have updated our estimates for the period, over which our original programming is used. 
As a result, most of HBO's original programming will now be amortized over somewhat longer time period. That reduced amortization this quarter by approximately $95 million. 
So the combination of reduced amortization, programming charges and restructuring and severance costs did not have a material effect on adjusted operating income in the quarter. 
While there will be some impact of reduced amortization in the second half of 2016, most of this benefit was recognized in the second quarter. 
Excluding the programming charges and benefit from the reduced amortization, programming costs increased in the teens in the quarter, and that was driven primarily by increased investments in original programming. 
Looking forward, we're excited about our upcoming programming lineup and combined with the continued investments we're making in the brand and product, we think HBO is very well positioned to drive substantial growth in the years to come. 
Moving on to Warner Bros, we were also making progress on our multi-year strategy to drive growth across theatrical, television and games. 
Coming into the year, we planned for our theatrical business to be the primary driver of profit growth, and that's playing out as we expected through the first half of the year. 
Looking specifically at the second quarter, we knew we had very difficult comparisons. Last year's quarter was a record for our video games business, led by the successful releases of franchise titles Bettman Arkham Knight and Mortal Kombat X, and we had significant TV licensing revenues from the Big Bang Theory and Seinfeld. 
We also had fewer theoretical home-video releases in a very difficult comparison against American Sniper and carryover revenues from the final installment of The Hobbit. 
So as expected, both revenue and adjusted operating income declined in the quarter. 
In theatrical, we saw significant benefit from carryover revenue from Batman v Superman. We've also been really pleased with the theatrical performance of more recent releases like The Conjuring 2 and Central Intelligence. And the Legend of Tarzan has already surpassed $300 million in global box office.  So while we originally had higher hopes for the film, we do not expect to have a material impact on profits this year. 
Looking ahead, we're very optimistic about the upcoming theatrical releases of Suicide Squad and Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them as we continue to lay the groundwork for our multi-year franchise film slate. 
Combined with a healthy trends and a leading position in TV production and the opportunities at its Games business, Warner's is set up to continue delivering strong growth, both this year and well into the future. 
Turning to the next slide. Free cash flow totaled about $1.9 billion in the first half, that's up from a year ago, largely due to growth and adjusted operating income. Working capital also benefited from the payment of $280 million associated with the CME refinancing, and that was mostly offset by increased content investments, driven by higher production spending at Warner Bros. 
Given our performance to date and our expectation for strong growth in adjusted operating income, we're on track for another year of very strong free cash flow in 2016. 
Now looking at our balance sheet. Since our last call, we took advantage of favorable market conditions to strengthen our balance sheet by issuing $800 million of long-term debt at an attractive rate. And we ended the second quarter with $22 billion of net debt, up around $350 million compared to the end of 2015. That's mostly result of our ongoing commitment to direct returns to shareholders, which is a key component of our balanced approach to capital allocation. 
Looking at investments. We did a very modest amount of M&A in the first half and as Jeff noted, yesterday, we invested $583 million for a 10% stake in Hulu. That payment will hit in the third quarter. 
Our net leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was just above our target leverage ratio of around 2.75x, which were on track to return to by the end of this year. And we remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and our investment-grade credit rating. 
With that, let's move on to the final slide, which looks at our outlook for 2016. We had a solid first half of the year, and we really pleased with how we executing across our businesses, and that's reflected in our updated outlook for 2016. 
As I mentioned earlier, we raised our outlook for adjusted EPS this year to $5.35 to $5.45, and that incorporates around a $0.06 negative impact related to our equity investment in Hulu, including both our share of losses and PPA. 
Turning to the back half of the year, we expect overall revenue growth to accelerate and that should help drive a nice acceleration in adjusted operating income growth as well. 
Looking specifically at the third quarter, we anticipate elevated programming cost growth at HBO from the rollout of new original programming like THE NIGHT OF and Vice Principals and the timing of theatrical availabilities and will, again, face challenging comparisons in videogames and TV licensing at Warner Bros. 
As a result, we anticipate growth in adjusted operating income to be weighted heavily to the fourth quarter. 
So overall, we're on track for another year of very attractive growth, and we believe the significant operating momentum, positive revenue trends and continued investments we're making across the company position us to continue that growth well into the future. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Jessica at the start the Q&A."

Consumers want, and they expect, particularly for series where they pick up a series may be in its first year, maybe some other place. They want more on demand access to the series, particularly series that becomes serialized plot a long period of time. So as consumers want that, that works, and it depends, which kind of networks and how -- what kind of show. Networks increasingly want to offer more VOD rights over more episodes the cover story arts. So if you look at, for example, networks like an HBO or Showtime or lately, the Netflix and Amazons, those kind of networks with their serialized shows have had for years multiple, many episodes going back over a long periods of time so you can catch up with the show. If you go to the ad-supported networks, broadcast, cable networks, et cetera, they have been on a path to try to meet consumer demand at the extent consumers want to see their favorite show over a longer story episodes, networks increasingly ask for that. So if you take say some of the broadcast networks -- Kevin, you might want to comment on this, they've been for more demand currencies what's happened, for example, in the broadcast networks over the last year."

And, let me say, that the early results are quite encouraging. And I would repeat that it's early, and we're going to be obviously a paying close attention to this, but it's all being driven by the fact that we know that we have to have a network that has an experience that can compete with the very best consumer experiences in the world. So we reduced the number of ads, we've been engaged with -- in discussions with our agencies, with our advertisers and what we've been seeing is smaller drop off during ad parts. Meaning that we're retaining higher audience levels during advertising commercials, which means higher ratings to the network. We believe the early results indicate that there's even higher recall for the ads that are there.

How does that work or how are you thinking about virtual MVPDs and the ability to get annual affiliate fee increases especially with today's news vis-a-vis Hulu? And then just two, you made an announcement I think last week or the week before about Chuck Lorre from Warner Bros. And I'd love -- you've been kind of hesitant before to sell multicam comedies, especially Chuck Lorre's comedies to Netflix because those were the huge win opportunities that you've gotten on the syndication side such as Big Bang, and I'm curious why this was the right deal to do, to sell something like that and potentially limit your upside versus the massive syndication values you can get off of those type of comedies."

With regards to eSports, which we just concluded the championship of the tournament, we couldn't be more pleased and excited about how we hosted the first ever eSports tournament on television. We call it EOE and across the 10-week tournament between Twitch and TBS, there was almost approaching 1 billion minutes of consumption, it brought millions of new viewers to network. The age of the viewers TBS are right down the strike zone of what we were hoping for, young viewers heavily skewing now. We just announced an agreement with a new game, Overwatch.

Before we begin, there are 2 items I need to cover. First, we refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Schedules setting out reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our earnings release and trending schedules. These reconciliations are available on our website at timewarner.com. Reconciliations of expected future financial performance are also included in the business outlook release that is available on our website. 
Second, today's announcement includes certain forward-looking statements, which are based on management's current expectations. Actual results may vary materially from those expressed or implied by these statements due to various factors. These factors are discussed in detail in Time Warner's SEC filings, including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent quarterly reports on the 10-Q. Time Warner is under no obligation and, in fact, expressly disclaims any obligation to update or alter its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. 
I'll now turn the call over to Jeff Bewkes, Time Warner's Chairman and CEO, who'll be followed by Howard Averill, Time Warner's CFO. After their prepared remarks, our divisional CEOs, John Martin, Richard Plepler and Kevin Tsujihara, would join us for our Q&A session.

We're about halfway through the year, and we're well on our way to exceeding our original 2016 goals. At the same time, we've been making the necessary investments in the very best video content and the development of new and exciting distribution opportunities in order to continue driving industry-leading growth over the long term. 
In the quarter, we generated revenues of $7 billion and adjusted operating income of $1.8 billion, and adjusted earnings per share grew to $1.29 per share. We also returned over $1 billion to shareholders in share repurchases and dividends. 
Our financial results continue to be fueled by creative excellence across our divisions. Since we last spoke with you, we received 148 Primetime Emmy nominations, that's more than any other company. With HBO's 94, again, setting the pace for the industry. TNT and TBS finished the second quarter as the 2 highest rated cable networks in prime time, with TNT airing cable's most-viewed NBA telecast of all time. And Warner's, once again, came out of the upfront as the leading supplier to the broadcast network. We expect that momentum to continue this weekend with the opening of Suicide Squad, one of the summer's most anticipated movie. 
Our results also reflect the consistent execution of a strategy that we've been discussing with you for years. A core part of that strategy is to ensure that our networks, our shows and our brands are available to consumers on a wide range of platforms and devices and in all-important bundles, both within the traditional ecosystem and outside of it, with state-of-the-art user interfaces and more and more on-demand functionality. 
Now in many cases, we'll simply extend our traditional wholesale model of licensing our content and networks to third parties. But we're also investing in new services, both wholly-owned and with partners that have a more direct relationship with consumers. In doing that, we're positioning ourselves to develop new revenue streams for our industry-leading brands. 
Among our initiatives to date, HBO NOW is the most significant, and the second quarter was its strongest yet. But even HBO NOW is just one of many investments and initiatives in this area. HBO has launched similar services in the Nordic region and in parts of Latin America, with additional launches scheduled for later this year. At Turner, we're in the process of launching an odd house film SVOD service called FilmStruck, which follows the recent launches of SVOD services by Adult Swim in Canada and Esporte Interativo in Brazil. And those join short form digital content initiatives like Great Big Story and Super Deluxe. 
And over at Warner's, the SVOD service we partnered on in China with Tencent Video VIP recently passed 10 million subscribers. 
We've also enhanced our broadband distribution capabilities with acquisitions like Ice Cream Planet and DramaFever. 
This morning, we announced another exciting next step in that strategy, and that's our investment in Hulu. This investment fits our strategy like a glove. It will increase our company's exposure to the secular growth in over-the-top services, and it will give Hulu more resources to offer consumers more shows and more choices, fostering competition and innovation amongst both SVOD services and among MVPD services. 
We also announced that the virtual MVPD service Hulu expects to launch early next year will include live and on-demand access to the full suite of Turner Network. 
Consumers clearly want innovative interfaces, they want more robust on-demand capabilities and they expect a greater variety of content packages. And we want to support services that do just that. So consistent with our strategy, our investment in Hulu leaves us free to continue to support fully, as we always have, other traditional and broadband delivery distribution platforms. We look forward to working closely with our existing MVTP -- MVPD partners, and with existing and new over-the-top partners in bringing consumers more choice in how to access our best-in-class shows and networks. We expect there'll be a number of additional virtual MVPDs that launch over the coming year, and we think that the increasing choices available as a result of these new services will be grateful for consumers and for our industry-leading brands. 
Speaking of brands, let me share a few more highlights from the past quarter that show how our investments in Turner's core brands are helping transform its business by driving increased engagement with audiences across both traditional and new platforms. 
Here in the U.S., Turner had 3 of the top 5 ad-supported cable networks in primetime among adults 18 to 49, that's TNT, TBS and Adult Swim. 
On Adult Swim, it continues to be far and away the most watched by millennials. It attracts 60% more 18- to 34-year-olds than its nearest competitor, 60% more. 
Now we've talked before about the bold programming refresh underway at both TBS and TNT, and we couldn't be happier with the initial results. We've launched 5 marque originals across TBS and TNT in this year, and we've already renewed all of them. 
Together, Wrecked, Angie Tribeca, The Detour, Full Frontal with Samantha Bee and Animal Kingdom are great examples of where we're taking the TBS and TNT brands, and they've also passed our expectations for our initial slate of new shows. 
We're particularly pleased with the audience growth we've seen from Samantha Bee and Animal Kingdom since their launches and we're also gratified by the strong positive response that we've had from the gaming community to the launch of ELEAGUE, that's our e-sports initiative. 
The strong demand we saw on the Upfront clearly demonstrated the belief advertisers have in the direction we're moving in and in the value of our brands, and that translated into double-digit CPM increases for Turner's entertainment networks. 
We also benefited from Turner's continued innovation in advertising products with our targeting analytics capabilities setting the pace for the industry. 
Demand in the Upfront was particularly strong for CNN, which has undergone nothing short of a renaissance over the past few years. To-date, 2016 is the most-watched year in CNN's history. And as the U.S. presidential election draws closer, CNN continues to gain momentum and take share from its peers. 
CNN was the #1 news -- let me say this very clearly, CNN was #1 news network among adults 18 to 49 in prime time for the third consecutive quarter, and CNN Digital becomes the #1 new service in multiplatform and mobile UNIX. 
During the conventions of the past 2 weeks, both conventions, CNN led all networks, broadcast and cable alike, in viewership. And while CNN's in-depth news coverage continues to lead the industry, it's also building its next generation of viewers with a strong lineup of originals and leading digital products. 
We're just excited about the momentum at HBO, which, once again, proved it's without peer when it comes to premium content. It's 94 Emmy nominations led the industry for the 16th straight year, and included nominations for Game of Thrones for Outstanding Drama and both Veep and Silicon Valley for Outstanding Comedy as well as John Oliver and Bill Maher for Outstanding Variety Talk Show. 
HBO's status as the gold standard for premium content was also reinforced by the response to the most recent season of Game of Thrones, which averaged over 25 million viewers per episode, that's more than 25% higher than last year's record, and it's nothing less than astounding if you consider HBO's subbase. 
Much of that growth was driven by its digital platforms, where viewership nearly doubled from a year ago. Our digital platforms also contributed to double-digit growth for Veep and Silicon Valley, both of which reached series highs. 
We've been thrilled with the overwhelming critical and consumer response to the limited crime series, The Night Of, which will be followed up this fall by the much anticipated sci-fi series, Westworld, from Warner Bros. and the return of Sarah Jessica Parker to HBO in Divorce. 
So we couldn't feel better about HBO's content line up. The strength of the HBO content and brands have been evident in the growth of HBO NOW, and we're looking to super serve that audience by introducing new content geared for our digital and on demand platforms. That story, with the debut of Bill Simmons' Any Given Wednesday that happened in June, and we're going to follow that with the VICE News Tonight and Jon Stewart's highly original and much-anticipated new project later this year. 
Now let me turn to Warner Brothers which remains on track for another record year as it continues to take advantage of its iconic IP with a franchise-driven strategy that spans television, film and games. 
The strength of our great IP at Warner's was evident this quarter in the performance of Warner's television, which is, once again, leading the industry. For the 2016 to '17 season, Warner TV is set to be the #1 producer of broadcast shows for the 13th time in the last 14 seasons with 31 series, 22 of which are returning. That's the highest returning series number in the company's history. Across all networks and services, Warner Brothers will produce 65 series for the upcoming year. That includes 10 shows originating in the DC comics universe, underscoring the importance of the DC franchise to our television business. 
But DC is also a critical component for our video games business, which coming off a record performance last year, just had its biggest LEGO launch ever. We're going to follow that up next month with Batman: The Telltale Series from our publisher Telltale Games. 
Batman is also the star of Batman Arkham VR, that's our first virtual reality game. Arkham VR will be one of the launch titles for PlayStation VR, and it's Batman like you've never seen him before, because you basically are him. It's a great example of how great IP translates across many different platforms and experiences and it underscores the strength of our competitive position as new platforms continue to emerge. 
On the theatrical side, we're starting to build some real momentum with the recent string of highly profitable performers in Me Before You, Central Intelligence and Conjuring 2. 
Our Conjuring 2 has already passed 300 million at the global box office, and it's become one of the most successful horror franchises in history, and we're thrilled with the recent opening of Lights Out, that's another micro-budget horror hit from New Loft. 
Looking forward, Suicide Squad is tracking to be the biggest opening ever for an August release. 
So we're already well on our way to what we think will be a blockbuster second half performance for our theatrical business. We follow Suicide Squad with War Dogs, a comedy from Todd Phillips starring Jonah Hill and Bradley Cooper, that will debut later this month. And next month, we'll have the inspiring story of Sully from Clint Eastwood and starring Tom Hanks, and Storks, a charming newbie from Warner animation. 
Later this year, we will all have a chance to return to the Wizarding World created by J.K. Rowling when Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them hits theaters. Months ahead of its release, excitement about the franchise is already building. 
Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, which is J.K. Rowling's first stage production, recently opened and it's already sold out through next May. The book version of the play script was released last week, and it had the most preorders of any title at Barnes and Noble since the last Harry Potter book was released in 2007. And the opening of the Harry Potter Hogsmeade attraction at Universal Hollywood has been really well received, driving significant increases in audience. 
That all sets the stage for the November release of Fantastic Beasts, a stunning new chapter in J.K.'s continuing saga. We couldn't be more excited, and as Warner announced earlier today, the second installment of the series is already set for release in November 16, 2018. 
So we are in the midst of a very vibrant content cycle here across our businesses, and that puts us in a great position to benefit as global demand for the best video content continues to rise. 
We're making a lot of progress, both in strengthening our position within the traditional ecosystem and building new revenue streams and capabilities outside. 
And our investment and in Turner's with agreement with Hulu, just another example of how we're taking advantage of new platforms to serve consumers, increase competition and further grow our business. We're seeing increased value accrue to the very strongest brands and to the very best video content. 
And along with that come new opportunities that arise from digital distribution all around the world. And that's why we're very confident about the rest of 2016 and well beyond. 
Thanks for listening. Let me turn it over to Howard, who has the fantastic financial details to give you."
24689,371778736,1023120,"Time Warner Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 03, 2016",2016-08-03,"Earnings Calls","Warner Media, LLC","Executives","Thanks, Jeff, and good morning. I'll begin by referring to the first slide of our presentation, which is now available on our website. Starting with consolidated results. We're pleased with our operating and financial performance to-date, and we're on",1890,"Thanks, Jeff, and good morning. 
I'll begin by referring to the first slide of our presentation, which is now available on our website. 
Starting with consolidated results. We're pleased with our operating and financial performance to-date, and we're on track to exceed the outlook we provided at the start of the year. 
Through the first half of the year, adjusted operating income was up 3% and adjusted EPS was up 14%. And we delivered that while making significant investments not only in our traditional businesses but also in new capabilities and revenue streams that will drive future growth. 
We knew, coming into the second quarter, that we faced difficult comparisons from the timing of content licensing revenue across our divisions, last year's record gains performance at Warner's and the timing of programming investments at both Turner and HBO. So as we expected, both revenues and adjusted operating income were down in the quarter. 
Given so, we are able to keep adjusted operating income margins for the quarter steady year-over-year at 25%. That reflected our mix of revenue, a positive swing in eliminations and our continued company-wide focus on limiting growth and overhead costs, which were roughly flat in the quarter. 
Adjusted EPS was up 3%, that's primarily due to a lower effective tax rate and the benefit of our ongoing share repurchase program. During the second quarter, we bought back around $700 million of our shares and paid close to $320 million in dividends. And year-to-date, we returned about $2.3 billion to shareholders. So we had a strong first half, and we feel great about how this year is shaping up. 
As a result, we raised our outlook for 2016 adjusted EPS, which we now expect to be in the range of $5.35 to $5.45. I'll touch on more of the details of our outlook later in the presentation. 
Now turning to the segment highlights. I'll start at Turner, where the investments we've been making in the transformation of our core brands contributed to another quarter of very strong revenue growth. Subscription revenues once again grew 11% in the quarter and that included approximately 150 basis points of headwinds from FX. 
Domestic subscription revenues were up in the low teens as we continue to benefit from the rate increases we achieved during our affiliate renewal cycle, and excluding a close to 10% of point drag from FX, international subscription revenue growth would've been in the high single digits. 
Advertising revenues increased a solid 6% despite approximately 100 basis points of headwinds from FX. Domestic advertising grew in the high single digits, marking the third consecutive quarter of healthy growth. That reflected another quarter of double-digit growth in both news and sports, which included the benefit from airing the NCAA National Championship game for the first time this year. 
International advertising would have been up mid-single digits, excluding a close to 10 percentage points drag from FX. 
Looking ahead to the third quarter. We expect total advertising revenue growth to be in the low single digits. The scatter market remains healthy, with pricing at our domestic entertainment networks pacing up well into the double digits over last year's upfront. 
At the same time, we're going to air significantly fewer hours of original programming across our domestic entertainment networks, and that's partially an effort to stay out of the way of this year's Summer Olympics. 
The third quarter is also our lightest quarter for sports inventory, and FX remains a headwind. 
Moving on. Content and other revenues declined 15% in the quarter. That reflects lower licensing revenues due to the comparison of last year's deal with Hulu. Adjusted operating income was flat in the quarter as healthy revenue growth was balanced by continued investments in programming and marketing. Programming expenses increased 11%, mainly due to higher sports costs, including the NCAA National Championship game I mentioned earlier, and our continued investment in bold, new original programming as part of the re-brands at TBS and TNT. 
Marketing costs were up mid-teen to support those new original series. 
Overall, Turner has great operating momentum and is well positioned to maintain its strong revenue trends in the second half of the year, putting it on track for another year of solid growth. We're doing that while continuing to make important investments in new initiatives like Ice Cream Planet, expanding Bleacher Report and CNN's Digital Products. And together, we think the investments we're making across the business will allow Turner to deliver attractive results over the long term as well. 
Turning to HBO. We were pleased with the progress we're making as we continue to invest in the significant global opportunity in subscription video services. Domestic subscription revenue growth was in the mid-single digits in the quarter, and that included a continued sequential increase in the contribution from HBO NOW, where we remain encouraged with our progress. 
Content and other revenues decreased 17% in the quarter, mainly due to lower revenues from our licensing deal with Amazon. That was balanced by solid growth in international licensing revenues highlighting our ability to effectively monetize our original programming around the world. 
Across HBO's international networks, including unconsolidated JVs, revenues were up double digits, and that's a reflection of continued positive international subscriber trends, especially in Latin America and the Nordics. 
Adjusted operating income fell 5% in the quarter, and that reflects higher programming expenses, including programming charges and restructuring and severance costs. The programming charges and restructuring and severance costs totaled approximately $100 million, and that's largely related to a change in leadership on the programming fronts. 
Separately, after considering consumer viewing patterns, including increased on-demand access to HBO's content across a wide range of devices and services, we have updated our estimates of the period over which our original programming is used. 
As a result, most of HBO's original programming will now be amortized over a somewhat longer time period. That reduced amortization this quarter by approximately $95 million. 
So the combination of reduced amortization, programming charges and restructuring and severance costs did not have a material effect on adjusted operating income in the quarter. 
While there will be some impact from reduced amortization in the second half of 2016, most of this benefit was recognized in the second quarter. 
Excluding the programming charges and benefit from the reduced amortization, programming costs increased in the teens in the quarter, and that was driven primarily by increased investments in original programming. 
Looking forward, we're excited about our upcoming programming lineup, and combined with the continued investments we're making in the brand and product, we think HBO is very well positioned to drive substantial growth in the years to come. 
Moving on to Warner Brothers, where we're also making progress on our multi-year strategy to drive growth across theatrical, television and games. 
Coming into the year, we planned for our theatrical business to be the primary driver of profit growth, and that's playing out as we expected through the first half of the year. 
Looking specifically at the second quarter, we knew we had very difficult comparisons. Last year's quarter was a record for our video games business, led by the successful releases of franchise titles Batman Arkham Knight and Mortal Kombat X, and we had significant TV licensing revenues from the Big Bang Theory and Seinfeld. 
We also had fewer theoretical home-video releases and a very difficult comparison against American Sniper and carryover revenues from the final installment of The Hobbit. 
So as expected, both revenue and adjusted operating income declined in the quarter. 
In theatrical, we saw a significant benefit from carryover revenue from Batman v Superman. We've also been really pleased with the theatrical performance of more recent releases like The Conjuring 2 and Central Intelligence. And the Legend of Tarzan has already surpassed $300 million in global box office. So while we originally had higher hopes for the film, we do not expect it to have a material impact on profits this year. 
Looking ahead, we're very optimistic about the upcoming theatrical releases of Suicide Squad and Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them as we continue to lay the groundwork for our multi-year franchise film slate. 
Combined with the healthy trends and a leading position in TV production and the opportunities at its Games business, Warner's is set up to continue delivering strong growth, both this year and well into the future. 
Turning to the next slide. Free cash flow totaled about $1.9 billion in the first half, that's up from a year ago, largely due to growth in adjusted operating income. Working capital also benefited from the payment of $280 million associated with the CME refinancing, and that was mostly offset by increased content investments, driven by higher production spending at Warner Brothers. 
Given our performance to date and our expectation for strong growth in adjusted operating income, we're on track for another year of very strong free cash flow in 2016. 
Now looking at our balance sheet. Since our last call, we took advantage of favorable market conditions to strengthen our balance sheet by issuing $800 million of long-term debt at an attractive rate. And we ended the second quarter with $22 billion of net debt, up around $350 million compared to the end of 2015. That's mostly a result of our ongoing commitment to direct returns to shareholders, which is a key component of our balanced approach to capital allocation. 
Looking at investments. We did a very modest amount of M&A in the first half, and as Jeff noted, yesterday, we invested $583 million for a 10% stake in Hulu. That payment will hit in the third quarter. 
Our net leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was just above our target leverage ratio of around 2.75x, which we're on track to return to by the end of this year. And we remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and our investment-grade credit rating. 
With that, let's move on to the final slide, which looks at our outlook for 2016. We had a solid first half of the year, and we're really pleased with how we're executing across our businesses, and that's reflected in our updated outlook for 2016. 
As I mentioned earlier, we raised our outlook for adjusted EPS this year to $5.35 to $5.45, and that incorporates around a $0.06 negative impact related to our equity investment in Hulu, including both our share of the losses and PPA. 
Turning to the back half of the year, we expect overall revenue growth to accelerate and that should help drive a nice acceleration in adjusted operating income growth as well. 
Looking specifically at the third quarter, we anticipate elevated programming cost growth at HBO from the rollout of new original programming like The Night Of and Vice Principals and the timing of theatric availabilities, and will again face challenging comparisons in video games and TV licensing at Warner Bros. 
As a result, we anticipate growth in adjusted operating income to be weighted heavily to the fourth quarter. 
So overall, we're on track for another year of very attractive growth, and we believe the significant operating momentum, positive revenue trends and continued investments we're making across the company position us to continue that growth well into the future. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Jessica to start the Q&A."

But I'll start, and Kevin will pick it up. The CW's in a different situation than many of other networks or our cable networks in that it doesn't currently receive material carriage fees.

And therefore, in a slightly different economics than the other broadcast networks. But what we did was, actually give the CW more stacking rights by giving it exclusivity in the year. It has a lot more flexibility in its ability to be able to convey a full season or any number between a full season and 5 episodes.

Let's all look at the way this is actually works, and it's working the way it should work. Consumers want, and they expect, particularly for series where they pick up a series may be in its first year, maybe at some other place. They want more on demand access to the series, particularly series that becomes serialized plots over a long period of time. So as consumers want that, networks -- and it depends, which kind of networks and how -- what kind of show. Networks increasingly want to offer more VOD rights over more episodes to cover story arcs. So if you look at, for example, networks like an HBO or Showtime or lately, the Netflix and Amazons, they -- those kind of networks, with their serialized shows, have had for years multiple, many episodes going back over long periods of time, so you can catch up with the show. If you go to the ad-supported networks, broadcast, cable networks, et cetera, they have been on a path to try to meet consumer demand and to the extent consumers want to see their favorite show over longer story arcs of episodes, networks increasingly ask for that. So if you take say some of the broadcast networks -- Kevin, you might want to comment on this, they've been asking for more on demand.

So my question is, when you look at the growth outlook for 2017 and 2018 relative to your original $8 EPS guide that you previously had out there, other than the currency headwind impact, which should be the same $0.50-or-so carryforward, has anything else changed in your growth outlook when you think about the next couple of years for the company?"

And, let me say, that the early results are quite encouraging. And I would repeat that it's early, and we're going to be, obviously, paying close attention to this, but it's all being driven by the fact that we know that we have to have a network that has an experience that can compete with the very best consumer experiences in the world. So we reduced the number of ads, we've been engaged with -- in discussions with our agencies, with our advertisers and what we've been seeing is smaller drop off during ad parts. Meaning that we're retaining higher audience levels during advertising commercials, which means higher ratings to the network. We believe the early results indicate that there's even higher recall for the ads that are there. We're working very, very hard to make the ads more relevant with our native product and our own internal production capabilities, to make sure that the advertising is more relevant and contextual with respect to the content itself, and that was very, very helpful during the upfront and extremely, extremely well received.

With regard to eSports, in which we just concluded the championship of the tournament, we couldn't be more pleased and excited about how we hosted the first ever eSports tournament on television. We call it ELEAGUE, and across the 10-week tournament between Twitch and TBS, there was almost approaching 1 billion minutes of consumption, it's brought millions of new viewers to the network.

So if you think about consolidation, the way we think about it, I don't think you would need to see consolidation from players that don't have intellectual property merging with other players that don't have intellectual property for scale per se.

Schedules setting out reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our earnings release and trending [ph] schedules. These reconciliations are available on our website at timewarner.com. Reconciliations of expected future financial performance are also included in the business outlook release that is available on our website. 
Second, today's announcement includes certain forward-looking statements, which are based on management's current expectations. Actual results may vary materially from those expressed or implied by these statements due to various factors. These factors are discussed in detail in Time Warner's SEC filings, including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent quarterly reports on the 10-Q. Time Warner is under no obligation and is -- in fact, expressly disclaims any obligation to update or alter its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. 
I'll now turn the call over to Jeff Bewkes, Time Warner's Chairman and CEO, who'll be followed by Howard Averill, Time Warner's CFO. After their prepared remarks, our divisional CEOs, John Martin, Richard Plepler and Kevin Tsujihara, will join us for our Q&A session.

We're about halfway through the year, and we're well on our way to exceeding our original 2016 goals. At the same time, we've been making the necessary investments in the very best video content and the development of new and exciting distribution opportunities in order to continue driving industry-leading growth over the long term. 
In the quarter, we generated revenues of $7 billion and adjusted operating income of $1.8 billion, and adjusted earnings per share grew to $1.29 per share. We also returned over $1 billion to shareholders in share repurchases and dividends. 
Our financial results continue to be fueled by creative excellence across our divisions. Since we last spoke with you, we received 148 Primetime Emmy nominations, that's more than any other company. With HBO's 94, again, setting the pace for the industry. TNT and TBS finished the second quarter as the 2 highest rated cable networks in prime time, with TNT airing cable's most-viewed NBA telecast of all time. And Warner's, once again, came out of the upfront as the leading supplier to the broadcast networks. We expect that momentum to continue this weekend with the opening of Suicide Squad, one of the summer's most anticipated movies. 
Our results also reflect the consistent execution of a strategy that we've been discussing with you for years. A core part of that strategy is to ensure that our networks, our shows and our brands are available to consumers on a wide range of platforms and devices and in all-important bundles, both within the traditional ecosystem and outside of it, with state-of-the-art user interfaces and more and more on-demand functionality. 
Now in many cases, we'll simply extend our traditional wholesale model of licensing our content and networks to third parties. But we're also investing in new services, both wholly-owned and with partners that have a more direct relationship with consumers. In doing that, we're positioning ourselves to develop new revenue streams for our industry-leading brands. 
Among our initiatives to date, HBO NOW is the most significant, and the second quarter was its strongest yet. But even HBO NOW is just one of many investments and initiatives in this area. HBO has launched similar services in the Nordic region and in parts of Latin America, with additional launches scheduled for later this year. At Turner, we're in the process of launching an art house film SVOD service called FilmStruck, which follows the recent launches of SVOD services by Adult Swim in Canada and Esporte Interativo in Brazil. And those join short form digital content initiatives like Great Big Story and Super Deluxe. 
And over at Warner's, the SVOD service we partnered on in China with Tencent Video VIP recently passed 10 million subscribers. 
We've also enhanced our broadband distribution capabilities with acquisitions like Ice Cream Planet and DramaFever. 
This morning, we announced another exciting next step in that strategy, and that's our investment in Hulu. This investment fits our strategy like a glove. It will increase our company's exposure to the secular growth in over-the-top services, and it will give Hulu more resources to offer consumers more shows and more choices, fostering competition and innovation amongst both SVOD services and among MVPD services. 
We also announced that the virtual MVPD service Hulu expects to launch early next year will include live and on-demand access to the full suite of Turner Networks. 
Consumers clearly want innovative interfaces, they want more robust on-demand capabilities and they expect a greater variety of content packages. And we want to support services that do just that. So consistent with our strategy, our investment in Hulu leaves us free to continue to support fully, as we always have, other traditional and broadband delivery distribution platforms. We look forward to working closely with our existing MVTP -- MVPD partners, and with existing and new over-the-top partners in bringing consumers more choice in how to access our best-in-class shows and networks. We expect there'll be a number of additional virtual MVPDs that launch over the coming year, and we think that the increasing choices available as a result of these new services will be great for both consumers and for our industry-leading brands. 
Speaking of brands, let me share a few more highlights from the past quarter that show how our investments in Turner's core brands are helping transform its business by driving increased engagement with audiences across both traditional and new platforms. 
Here in the U.S., Turner had 3 of the top 5 ad-supported cable networks in primetime among adults 18 to 49, that's TNT, TBS and Adult Swim. 
On Adult Swim, it continues to be far and away the most watched by millennials. It attracts 60% more 18- to 34-year-olds than its nearest competitor, 60% more. 
Now we've talked before about the bold programming refresh underway at both TBS and TNT, and we couldn't be happier with the initial results. We've launched 5 marque originals across TBS and TNT in this year, and we've already renewed all of them. 
Together, Wrecked, Angie Tribeca, The Detour, Full Frontal with Samantha Bee and Animal Kingdom are great examples of where we're taking the TBS and TNT brands, and they've all surpassed our expectations for our initial slate of new shows. 
We're particularly pleased with the audience growth we've seen from Samantha Bee and Animal Kingdom since their launches and we're also gratified by the strong positive response that we've had from the gaming community to the launch of ELEAGUE, that's our e-sports initiative. 
The strong demand we saw on the Upfront clearly demonstrated the belief advertisers have in the direction we're moving in and in the value of our brands, and that translated into double-digit CPM increases for Turner's entertainment networks. 
We also benefited from Turner's continued innovation in advertising products with our targeting and analytics capabilities setting the pace for the industry. 
Demand in the Upfront was particularly strong for CNN, which has undergone nothing short of a renaissance over the past few years. To-date, 2016 is the most-watched year in CNN's history. And as the U.S. presidential election draws closer, CNN continues to gain momentum and take share from its peers. 
CNN was the #1 news -- let me say this very clearly, CNN was #1 news network among adults 18 to 49 in prime time for the third consecutive quarter, and CNN Digital becomes the #1 news service in multiplatform and mobile uniques. 
During the conventions of the past 2 weeks, both conventions, CNN led all networks, broadcast and cable alike, in viewership. And while CNN's in-depth news coverage continues to lead the industry, it's also building its next generation of viewers with a strong lineup of originals and leading digital products. 
We're just excited about the momentum at HBO, which, once again, proved it's without peer when it comes to premium content. Its 94 Emmy nominations led the industry for the 16th straight year, and included nominations for Game of Thrones for Outstanding Drama and both Veep and Silicon Valley for Outstanding Comedy as well as John Oliver and Bill Maher for Outstanding Variety Talk Show. 
HBO's status as the gold standard for premium content was also reinforced by the response to the most recent season of Game of Thrones, which averaged over 25 million viewers per episode, that's more than 25% higher than last year's record, and it's nothing less than astounding if you consider HBO's subbase. 
Much of that growth was driven by its digital platforms, where viewership nearly doubled from a year ago. Our digital platforms also contributed to double-digit growth for Veep and Silicon Valley, both of which reached series highs. 
We've been thrilled with the overwhelming critical and consumer response to the limited crime series, The Night Of, which will be followed up this fall by the much anticipated sci-fi series, Westworld, from Warner Bros. and the return of Sarah Jessica Parker to HBO in Divorce. 
So we couldn't feel better about HBO's content lineup. The strength of the HBO content and brands have been evident in the growth of HBO NOW, and we're looking to super serve that audience by introducing new content geared for our digital and on demand platforms. That story, with the debut of Bill Simmons' Any Given Wednesday that happened in June, and we're going to follow that with the VICE News Tonight and Jon Stewart's highly original and much-anticipated new project later this year. 
Now let me turn to Warner Brothers which remains on track for another record year as it continues to take advantage of its iconic IP with a franchise-driven strategy that spans television, film and games. 
The strength of our great IP at Warner's was evident this quarter in the performance of Warner's television, which is, once again, leading the industry. For the 2016 to '17 season, Warner TV is set to be the #1 producer of broadcast shows for the 13th time in the last 14 seasons with 31 series, 22 of which are returning. That's the highest returning series number in the company's history. Across all networks and services, Warner Brothers will produce 65 series for the upcoming year. That includes 10 shows originating in the DC comics universe, underscoring the importance of the DC franchise to our television business. 
But DC is also a critical component for our video games business, which coming off a record performance last year, just had its biggest LEGO launch ever. We're going to follow that up next month with Batman: The Telltale Series from our publisher Telltale Games. 
Batman is also the star of Batman: Arkham VR, that's our first virtual reality game. Arkham VR will be one of the launch titles for PlayStation VR, and it's Batman like you've never seen him before, because you basically are him. It's a great example of how great IP translates across many different platforms and experiences and it underscores the strength of our competitive position as new platforms continue to emerge. 
On the theatrical side, we're starting to build some real momentum with the recent string of highly profitable performers in Me Before You, Central Intelligence and Conjuring 2. 
Our Conjuring 2 has already passed 300 million at the global box office, and it's become one of the most successful horror franchises in history, and we're thrilled with the recent opening of Lights Out, that's another micro-budget horror hit from New Line.
Looking forward, Suicide Squad is tracking to be the biggest opening ever for an August release. 
So we're already well on our way to what we think will be a blockbuster second half performance for our theatrical business. We follow Suicide Squad with War Dogs, a raucous comedy from Todd Phillips starring Jonah Hill and Bradley Cooper, that will debut later this month. And next month, we'll have the inspiring story of Sully from Clint Eastwood and starring Tom Hanks, and Storks, a charming newbie from Warner animation. 
Later this year, we will all have a chance to return to the Wizarding World created by J.K. Rowling when Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them hits theaters. Months ahead of its release, excitement about the franchise is already building. 
Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, which is J.K. Rowling's first stage production, recently opened and it's already sold out through next May. The book version of the play's script was released last week, and it had the most preorders of any title at Barnes and Noble since the last Harry Potter book was released in 2007. And the opening of the Harry Potter Hogsmeade attraction at Universal Hollywood has been really well received, driving significant increases in audience. 
That all sets the stage for the November release of Fantastic Beasts, a stunning new chapter in J.K.'s continuing saga. We couldn't be more excited, and as Warner announced earlier today, the second installment of the series is already set for release in November 16, 2018. 
So we are in the midst of a very vibrant content cycle here across our businesses, and that puts us in a great position to benefit as global demand for the best video content continues to rise. 
We're making a lot of progress, both in strengthening our position within the traditional ecosystem and building new revenue streams and capabilities outside. 
And our investment and in Turner's with agreement with Hulu are just another example of how we're taking advantage of new platforms to serve consumers, increase competition and further grow our business. We're seeing increased value accrue to the very strongest brands and to the very best video content. 
And along with that come new opportunities that arise from digital distribution all around the world. And that's why we're very confident about the rest of 2016 and well beyond. 
Thanks for listening. Let me turn it over to Howard, who has the fantastic financial details to give you."

I'll begin by referring to the first slide of our presentation, which is now available on our website. Starting with consolidated results. We're pleased with our operating and financial performance to date, and we're on",1891,"Thanks, Jeff, and good morning. 
I'll begin by referring to the first slide of our presentation, which is now available on our website. 
Starting with consolidated results. We're pleased with our operating and financial performance to date, and we're on track to exceed the outlook we provided at the start of the year. 
Through the first half of the year, adjusted operating income was up 3% and adjusted EPS was up 14%. And we delivered that while making significant investments not only in our traditional businesses but also in new capabilities and revenue streams that will drive future growth. 
We knew, coming into the second quarter, that we faced difficult comparisons from the timing of content licensing revenue across our divisions, last year's record gains performance at Warner's and the timing of programming investments at both Turner and HBO. So as we expected, both revenues and adjusted operating income were down in the quarter. 
Even so, we are able to keep adjusted operating income margins for the quarter steady year-over-year at 25%. That reflected our mix of revenue, a positive swing in eliminations and our continued company-wide focus on limiting growth in overhead costs, which were roughly flat in the quarter. 
Adjusted EPS was up 3%, that's primarily due to a lower effective tax rate and the benefit of our ongoing share repurchase program. During the second quarter, we bought back around $700 million of our shares and paid close to $320 million in dividends. And year-to-date, we returned about $2.3 billion to shareholders. So we had a strong first half, and we feel great about how this year is shaping up. 
As a result, we raised our outlook for 2016 adjusted EPS, which we now expect to be in the range of $5.35 to $5.45. I'll touch on more of the details of our outlook later in the presentation. 
Now turning to the segment highlights. I'll start at Turner, where the investments we've been making in the transformation of our core brands contributed to another quarter of very strong revenue growth. Subscription revenues once again grew 11% in the quarter and that included approximately 150 basis points of headwinds from FX. 
Domestic subscription revenues were up in the low teens as we continue to benefit from the rate increases we achieved during our affiliate renewal cycle, and excluding a close to 10% of point drag from FX, international subscription revenue growth would've been in the high single digits. 
Advertising revenues increased a solid 6% despite approximately 100 basis points of headwinds from FX. Domestic advertising grew in the high single digits, marking the third consecutive quarter of healthy growth. That reflected another quarter of double-digit growth in both news and sports, which included the benefit from airing the NCAA National Championship game for the first time this year. 
International advertising would have been up mid-single digits, excluding a close to 10 percentage points drag from FX. 
Looking ahead to the third quarter. We expect total advertising revenue growth to be in the low single digits. The scatter market remains healthy, with pricing at our domestic entertainment networks pacing up well into the double digits over last year's upfront. 
At the same time, we're going to air significantly fewer hours of original programming across our domestic entertainment networks, and that's partially an effort to stay out of the way of this year's Summer Olympics. 
The third quarter is also our lightest quarter for sports inventory, and FX remains a headwind. 
Moving on. Content and other revenues declined 15% in the quarter. That reflects lower licensing revenues due to the comparison of last year's deal with Hulu. Adjusted operating income was flat in the quarter as healthy revenue growth was balanced by continued investments in programming and marketing. Programming expenses increased 11%, mainly due to higher sports costs, including the NCAA National Championship game I mentioned earlier, and our continued investment in bold, new original programming as part of the re-brands at TBS and TNT. 
Marketing costs were up mid-teen to support those new original series. 
Overall, Turner has great operating momentum and is well positioned to maintain its strong revenue trends in the second half of the year, putting it on track for another year of solid growth. We're doing that while continuing to make important investments in new initiatives like Ice Cream Planet, expanding Bleacher Report and CNN's Digital Products. And together, we think the investments we're making across the business will allow Turner to deliver attractive results over the long term as well. 
Turning to HBO. We were pleased with the progress we're making as we continue to invest in the significant global opportunity in subscription video services. Domestic subscription revenue growth was in the mid-single digits in the quarter, and that included a continued sequential increase in the contribution from HBO NOW, where we remain encouraged with our progress. 
Content and other revenues decreased 17% in the quarter, mainly due to lower revenues from our licensing deal with Amazon. That was balanced by solid growth in international licensing revenues highlighting our ability to effectively monetize our original programming around the world. 
Across HBO's international networks, including unconsolidated JVs, revenues were up double digits, and that's a reflection of continued positive international subscriber trends, especially in Latin America and the Nordics. 
Adjusted operating income fell 5% in the quarter, and that reflects higher programming expenses, including programming charges and restructuring and severance costs. The programming charges and restructuring and severance costs totaled approximately $100 million, and that's largely related to a change in leadership on the programming fronts. 
Separately, after considering consumer viewing patterns, including increased on-demand access to HBO's content across a wide range of devices and services, we have updated our estimates of the period over which our original programming is used. 
As a result, most of HBO's original programming will now be amortized over a somewhat longer time period. That reduced amortization this quarter by approximately $95 million. 
So the combination of reduced amortization, programming charges and restructuring and severance costs did not have a material effect on adjusted operating income in the quarter. 
While there will be some impact from reduced amortization in the second half of 2016, most of this benefit was recognized in the second quarter. 
Excluding the programming charges and benefit from the reduced amortization, programming costs increased in the teens in the quarter, and that was driven primarily by increased investments in original programming. 
Looking forward, we're excited about our upcoming programming lineup, and combined with the continued investments we're making in the brand and product, we think HBO is very well positioned to drive substantial growth in the years to come. 
Moving on to Warner Brothers, where we're also making progress on our multi-year strategy to drive growth across theatrical, television and games. 
Coming into the year, we planned for our theatrical business to be the primary driver of profit growth, and that's playing out as we expected through the first half of the year. 
Looking specifically at the second quarter, we knew we had very difficult comparisons. Last year's quarter was a record for our video games business, led by the successful releases of franchise titles Batman Arkham Knight and Mortal Kombat X, and we had significant TV licensing revenues from the Big Bang Theory and Seinfeld. 
We also had fewer theoretical home-video releases and a very difficult comparison against American Sniper and carryover revenues from the final installment of The Hobbit. 
So as expected, both revenue and adjusted operating income declined in the quarter. 
In theatrical, we saw a significant benefit from carryover revenue from Batman v Superman. We've also been really pleased with the theatrical performance of more recent releases like The Conjuring 2 and Central Intelligence. And the Legend of Tarzan has already surpassed $300 million in global box office. So while we originally had higher hopes for the film, we do not expect it to have a material impact on profits this year. 
Looking ahead, we're very optimistic about the upcoming theatrical releases of Suicide Squad and Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them as we continue to lay the groundwork for our multi-year franchise film slate. 
Combined with the healthy trends and a leading position in TV production and the opportunities at its Games business, Warner's is set up to continue delivering strong growth, both this year and well into the future. 
Turning to the next slide. Free cash flow totaled about $1.9 billion in the first half, that's up from a year ago, largely due to growth in adjusted operating income. Working capital also benefited from the payment of $280 million associated with the CME refinancing, and that was mostly offset by increased content investments, driven by higher production spending at Warner Brothers. 
Given our performance to date and our expectation for strong growth in adjusted operating income, we're on track for another year of very strong free cash flow in 2016. 
Now looking at our balance sheet. Since our last call, we took advantage of favorable market conditions to strengthen our balance sheet by issuing $800 million of long-term debt at an attractive rate. And we ended the second quarter with $22 billion of net debt, up around $350 million compared to the end of 2015. That's mostly a result of our ongoing commitment to direct returns to shareholders, which is a key component of our balanced approach to capital allocation. 
Looking at investments. We did a very modest amount of M&A in the first half, and as Jeff noted, yesterday, we invested $583 million for a 10% stake in Hulu. That payment will hit in the third quarter. 
Our net leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was just above our target leverage ratio of around 2.75x, which we're on track to return to by the end of this year. And we remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and our investment-grade credit rating. 
With that, let's move on to the final slide, which looks at our outlook for 2016. We had a solid first half of the year, and we're really pleased with how we're executing across our businesses, and that's reflected in our updated outlook for 2016. 
As I mentioned earlier, we raised our outlook for adjusted EPS this year to $5.35 to $5.45, and that incorporates around a $0.06 negative impact related to our equity investment in Hulu, including both our share of the losses and PPA. 
Turning to the back half of the year, we expect overall revenue growth to accelerate and that should help drive a nice acceleration in adjusted operating income growth as well. 
Looking specifically at the third quarter, we anticipate elevated programming cost growth at HBO from the rollout of new original programming like The Night Of and Vice Principals and the timing of theatric availabilities, and will again face challenging comparisons in video games and TV licensing at Warner Bros. 
As a result, we anticipate growth in adjusted operating income to be weighted heavily to the fourth quarter. 
So overall, we're on track for another year of very attractive growth, and we believe the significant operating momentum, positive revenue trends and continued investments we're making across the company position us to continue that growth well into the future. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Jessica to start the Q&A."

But I'll start, and Kevin will pick it up. The CW's in a different situation than many of other networks or our cable networks in that it doesn't currently receive material carriage fees. And so we made the decision this year not to have an in season digital partner, which essentially goes along with what we've been thinking, and we instead put more aggressive VOD rights and stacking rights on the CW for the current season. Let's focus on that first, Kevin, and then let's go to the follow-on years [ph]."

And therefore it has slightly different economics than the other broadcast networks. But what we did was actually give the CW more stacking rights. By giving it exclusivity in the year, it has a lot more flexibility in its ability to be able to convey a full season or any number between a full season and 5 episodes. So we can do -- it has a lot more flexibility than it has in the acquired deal, when the CW had Hulu in season deal than a Netflix out of season deal."

Let's all look at the way this is actually works, and it's working the way it should work. Consumers want, and they expect, particularly for series where they pick up a series, maybe, in its first year, maybe at some other place. They want more on demand access to the series, particularly series that becomes serialized plots over a long period of time. So as consumers want that, networks -- and it depends, which kind of networks and how -- what kind of show. Networks increasingly want to offer more VOD rights over more episodes to cover story arcs. So if you look at, for example, networks like an HBO or Showtime or lately, the Netflix and Amazons, they -- those kind of networks, with their serialized shows, have had for years multiple, many episodes going back over long periods of time, so you can catch up with the show. If you go to the ad-supported networks, broadcast, cable networks, et cetera, they have been on a path to try to meet consumer demand and to the extent consumers want to see their favorite show over longer story arcs of episodes, networks increasingly ask for that. So if you take say some of the broadcast networks -- Kevin, you might want to comment on this, they've been asking for more on demand than current season.

And then also on the live streaming product, could you maybe give us a sense of what it might look like in terms of price points, content offering and sort of availability of stacking rights and so on, that will be very helpful. And then second question just on -- for Richard, maybe on HBO. I know Jeff said that NOW had, had their strongest quarter yet. I wonder whether you could -- I could tempt you to updating us on some numbers there? And then, maybe if you could just let us know which international markets you're planning to launch that, the NOW product, in the second half?"

Jon Stewart's coming, VICE News is coming, Bill Simmons, obviously, very conducive to it. We like the momentum we're seeing, and I think it's reflected in the progress and in the numbers. Internationally, early days in Latin America, as you know, with our launch in so far in Columbia and in Mexico, and we've announced later in the year launches in Argentina, in Spain and Brazil, we're very excited about the opportunity there. So again, this just reflects our ability to go multilaterally around the world. Our networks business, OTT business, our licensing business wherever we think we have the best long-term monetization, that's what we're going to pursue.

With regard to eSports, in which we just concluded the championship of the tournament, we couldn't be more pleased and excited about how we hosted the first ever eSports tournament on television. We call it ELEAGUE, and across the 10-week tournament between Twitch and TBS, there was almost approaching 1 billion minutes of consumption, it's brought millions of new viewers to the network. The age of the viewers of TBS are right down the strike zone of what we were hoping for, young viewers heavily skewing now. We just announced an agreement with a new game, Overwatch. We're going to host that tournament beginning in the fall, and we've announced the second tournament with Counter-Strike, which will air after that. So we love the fact that we own this league in connection with WME and IMG. We think it's a huge area of secular growth. We absolutely intend to participate in a big way in this area, and we couldn't be more pleased with how the first season proceeded."

These reconciliations are available on our website at timewarner.com. Reconciliations of expected future financial performance are also included in the business outlook release that is available on our website. 
Second, today's announcement includes certain forward-looking statements, which are based on management's current expectations. Actual results may vary materially from those expressed or implied by these statements due to various factors. These factors are discussed in detail in Time Warner's SEC filings, including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent quarterly reports on the 10-Q. Time Warner is under no obligation and is -- in fact, expressly disclaims any obligation to update or alter its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

We're about halfway through the year, and we're well on our way to exceeding our original 2016 goals. At the same time, we've been making the necessary investments in the very best video content and the development of new and exciting distribution opportunities in order to continue driving industry-leading growth over the long term. 
In the quarter, we generated revenues of $7 billion and adjusted operating income of $1.8 billion, and adjusted earnings per share grew to $1.29 per share. We also returned over $1 billion to shareholders in share repurchases and dividends. 
Our financial results continue to be fueled by creative excellence across our divisions. Since we last spoke with you, we received 148 Primetime Emmy nominations, that's more than any other company. With HBO's 94, again, setting the pace for the industry. TNT and TBS finished the second quarter as the 2 highest rated cable networks in prime time, with TNT airing cable's most-viewed NBA telecast of all time. And Warner's, once again, came out of the upfront as the leading supplier to the broadcast networks. We expect that momentum to continue this weekend with the opening of Suicide Squad, one of the summer's most anticipated movies. 
Our results also reflect the consistent execution of a strategy that we've been discussing with you for years. A core part of that strategy is to ensure that our networks, our shows and our brands are available to consumers on a wide range of platforms and devices and in all-important bundles, both within the traditional ecosystem and outside of it, with state-of-the-art user interfaces and more and more on-demand functionality. 
Now in many cases, we'll simply extend our traditional wholesale model of licensing our content and networks to third parties. But we're also investing in new services, both wholly owned and with partners that have a more direct relationship with consumers. In doing that, we're positioning ourselves to develop new revenue streams for our industry-leading brands. 
Among our initiatives to date, HBO NOW is the most significant, and the second quarter was its strongest yet. But even HBO NOW is just one of many investments and initiatives in this area. HBO has launched similar services in the Nordic region and in parts of Latin America, with additional launches scheduled for later this year. At Turner, we're in the process of launching an art house film SVOD service called FilmStruck, which follows the recent launches of SVOD services by Adult Swim in Canada and Esporte Interativo in Brazil. And those join short form digital content initiatives like Great Big Story and Super Deluxe. 
And over at Warner's, the SVOD service we partnered on in China with Tencent Video VIP recently passed 10 million subscribers. 
We've also enhanced our broadband distribution capabilities with acquisitions like Ice Cream Planet and DramaFever. 
This morning, we announced another exciting next step in that strategy, and that's our investment in Hulu. This investment fits our strategy like a glove. It will increase our company's exposure to the secular growth in over-the-top services, and it will give Hulu more resources to offer consumers more shows and more choices, fostering competition and innovation amongst both SVOD services and among MVPD services. 
We also announced that the virtual MVPD service Hulu expects to launch early next year will include live and on-demand access to the full suite of Turner Networks. 
Consumers clearly want innovative interfaces, they want more robust on-demand capabilities and they expect a greater variety of content packages. And we want to support services that do just that. So consistent with our strategy, our investment in Hulu leaves us free to continue to support fully, as we always have, other traditional and broadband delivery distribution platforms. We look forward to working closely with our existing MVTP -- MVPD partners, and with existing and new over-the-top partners in bringing consumers more choice in how to access our best-in-class shows and networks. We expect there'll be a number of additional virtual MVPDs that launch over the coming year, and we think that the increasing choices available as a result of these new services will be great for both consumers and for our industry-leading brands. 
Speaking of brands, let me share a few more highlights from the past quarter that show how our investments in Turner's core brands are helping transform its business by driving increased engagement with audiences across both traditional and new platforms. 
Here in the U.S., Turner had 3 of the top 5 ad-supported cable networks in primetime among adults 18 to 49, that's TNT, TBS and Adult Swim. 
On Adult Swim, it continues to be far and away the most watched by millennials. It attracts 60% more 18- to 34-year-olds than its nearest competitor, 60% more. 
Now we've talked before about the bold programming refresh underway at both TBS and TNT, and we couldn't be happier with the initial results. We've launched 5 marque originals across TBS and TNT in this year, and we've already renewed all of them. 
Together, Wrecked, Angie Tribeca, The Detour, Full Frontal with Samantha Bee and Animal Kingdom are great examples of where we're taking the TBS and TNT brands, and they've all surpassed our expectations for our initial slate of new shows. 
We're particularly pleased with the audience growth we've seen from Samantha Bee and Animal Kingdom since their launches and we're also gratified by the strong positive response that we've had from the gaming community to the launch of ELEAGUE, that's our e-sports initiative. 
The strong demand we saw on the Upfront clearly demonstrated the belief advertisers have in the direction we're moving in and in the value of our brands, and that translated into double-digit CPM increases for Turner's entertainment networks. 
We also benefited from Turner's continued innovation in advertising products with our targeting and analytics capabilities setting the pace for the industry. 
Demand in the Upfront was particularly strong for CNN, which has undergone nothing short of a renaissance over the past few years. To-date, 2016 is the most-watched year in CNN's history. And as the U.S. presidential election draws closer, CNN continues to gain momentum and take share from its peers. 
CNN was the #1 news -- let me say this very clearly, CNN was #1 news network among adults 18 to 49 in prime time for the third consecutive quarter, and CNN Digital becomes the #1 news service in multiplatform and mobile uniques. 
During the conventions of the past 2 weeks, both conventions, CNN led all networks, broadcast and cable alike, in viewership. And while CNN's in-depth news coverage continues to lead the industry, it's also building its next generation of viewers with a strong lineup of originals and leading digital products. 
We're just excited about the momentum at HBO, which, once again, proved it's without peer when it comes to premium content. Its 94 Emmy nominations led the industry for the 16th straight year, and included nominations for Game of Thrones for Outstanding Drama and both Veep and Silicon Valley for Outstanding Comedy as well as John Oliver and Bill Maher for Outstanding Variety Talk Show. 
HBO's status as the gold standard for premium content was also reinforced by the response to the most recent season of Game of Thrones, which averaged over 25 million viewers per episode, that's more than 25% higher than last year's record, and it's nothing less than astounding if you consider HBO's subbase. 
Much of that growth was driven by its digital platforms, where viewership nearly doubled from a year ago. Our digital platforms also contributed to double-digit growth for Veep and Silicon Valley, both of which reached series highs. 
We've been thrilled with the overwhelming critical and consumer response to the limited crime series, The Night Of, which will be followed up this fall by the much anticipated sci-fi series, Westworld, from Warner Bros. and the return of Sarah Jessica Parker to HBO in Divorce. 
So we couldn't feel better about HBO's content lineup. The strength of the HBO content and brands have been evident in the growth of HBO NOW, and we're looking to super serve that audience by introducing new content geared for our digital and on demand platforms. That story, with the debut of Bill Simmons' Any Given Wednesday that happened in June, and we're going to follow that with the VICE News Tonight and Jon Stewart's highly original and much-anticipated new project later this year. 
Now let me turn to Warner Brothers which remains on track for another record year as it continues to take advantage of its iconic IP with a franchise-driven strategy that spans television, film and games. 
The strength of our great IP at Warner's was evident this quarter in the performance of Warner's television, which is, once again, leading the industry. For the 2016 to '17 season, Warner TV is set to be the #1 producer of broadcast shows for the 13th time in the last 14 seasons with 31 series, 22 of which are returning. That's the highest returning series number in the company's history. Across all networks and services, Warner Brothers will produce 65 series for the upcoming year. That includes 10 shows originating in the DC comics universe, underscoring the importance of the DC franchise to our television business. 
But DC is also a critical component for our video games business, which coming off a record performance last year, just had its biggest LEGO launch ever. We're going to follow that up next month with Batman: The Telltale Series from our publisher Telltale Games. 
Batman is also the star of Batman: Arkham VR, that's our first virtual reality game. Arkham VR will be one of the launch titles for PlayStation VR, and it's Batman like you've never seen him before, because you basically are him. It's a great example of how great IP translates across many different platforms and experiences and it underscores the strength of our competitive position as new platforms continue to emerge. 
On the theatrical side, we're starting to build some real momentum with the recent string of highly profitable performers in Me Before You, Central Intelligence and Conjuring 2. 
Our Conjuring 2 has already passed 300 million at the global box office, and it's become one of the most successful horror franchises in history, and we're thrilled with the recent opening of Lights Out, that's another micro-budget horror hit from New Line.
Looking forward, Suicide Squad is tracking to be the biggest opening ever for an August release. 
So we're already well on our way to what we think will be a blockbuster second half performance for our theatrical business. We follow Suicide Squad with War Dogs, a raucous comedy from Todd Phillips starring Jonah Hill and Bradley Cooper, that will debut later this month. And next month, we'll have the inspiring story of Sully from Clint Eastwood and starring Tom Hanks, and Storks, a charming newbie from Warner animation. 
Later this year, we will all have a chance to return to the Wizarding World created by J.K. Rowling when Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them hits theaters. Months ahead of its release, excitement about the franchise is already building. 
Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, which is J.K. Rowling's first stage production, recently opened and it's already sold out through next May. The book version of the play's script was released last week, and it had the most preorders of any title at Barnes and Noble since the last Harry Potter book was released in 2007. And the opening of the Harry Potter Hogsmeade attraction at Universal Hollywood has been really well received, driving significant increases in audience. 
That all sets the stage for the November release of Fantastic Beasts, a stunning new chapter in J.K.'s continuing saga. We couldn't be more excited, and as Warner announced earlier today, the second installment of the series is already set for release in November 16, 2018. 
So we are in the midst of a very vibrant content cycle here across our businesses, and that puts us in a great position to benefit as global demand for the best video content continues to rise. 
We're making a lot of progress, both in strengthening our position within the traditional ecosystem and building new revenue streams and capabilities outside. 
And our investment and in Turner's with agreement with Hulu are just another example of how we're taking advantage of new platforms to serve consumers, increase competition and further grow our business. We're seeing increased value accrue to the very strongest brands and to the very best video content. 
And along with that come new opportunities that arise from digital distribution all around the world. And that's why we're very confident about the rest of 2016 and well beyond. 
Thanks for listening. Let me turn it over to Howard, who has the fantastic financial details to give you."
24689,371778736,1024480,"Time Warner Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 03, 2016",2016-08-03,"Earnings Calls","Warner Media, LLC","Executives","Thanks, Jeff, and good morning. I'll begin by referring to the first slide of our presentation, which is now available on our website. Starting with consolidated results. We're pleased with our operating and financial performance to date, and we're on",1891,"Thanks, Jeff, and good morning. 
I'll begin by referring to the first slide of our presentation, which is now available on our website. 
Starting with consolidated results. We're pleased with our operating and financial performance to date, and we're on track to exceed the outlook we provided at the start of the year. 
Through the first half of the year, adjusted operating income was up 3% and adjusted EPS was up 14%. And we delivered that while making significant investments not only in our traditional businesses but also in new capabilities and revenue streams that will drive future growth. 
We knew, coming into the second quarter, that we faced difficult comparisons from the timing of content licensing revenue across our divisions, last year's record gains performance at Warner's and the timing of programming investments at both Turner and HBO. So as we expected, both revenues and adjusted operating income were down in the quarter. 
Even so, we are able to keep adjusted operating income margins for the quarter steady year-over-year at 25%. That reflected our mix of revenue, a positive swing in eliminations and our continued company-wide focus on limiting growth in overhead costs, which were roughly flat in the quarter. 
Adjusted EPS was up 3%, that's primarily due to a lower effective tax rate and the benefit of our ongoing share repurchase program. During the second quarter, we bought back around $700 million of our shares and paid close to $320 million in dividends. And year-to-date, we returned about $2.3 billion to shareholders. So we had a strong first half, and we feel great about how this year is shaping up. 
As a result, we raised our outlook for 2016 adjusted EPS, which we now expect to be in the range of $5.35 to $5.45. I'll touch on more of the details of our outlook later in the presentation. 
Now turning to the segment highlights. I'll start at Turner, where the investments we've been making in the transformation of our core brands contributed to another quarter of very strong revenue growth. Subscription revenues once again grew 11% in the quarter and that included approximately 150 basis points of headwinds from FX. 
Domestic subscription revenues were up in the low teens as we continue to benefit from the rate increases we achieved during our affiliate renewal cycle, and excluding a close to 10% of point drag from FX, international subscription revenue growth would've been in the high single digits. 
Advertising revenues increased a solid 6% despite approximately 100 basis points of headwinds from FX. Domestic advertising grew in the high single digits, marking the third consecutive quarter of healthy growth. That reflected another quarter of double-digit growth in both news and sports, which included the benefit from airing the NCAA National Championship game for the first time this year. 
International advertising would have been up mid-single digits, excluding a close to 10 percentage points drag from FX. 
Looking ahead to the third quarter. We expect total advertising revenue growth to be in the low single digits. The scatter market remains healthy, with pricing at our domestic entertainment networks pacing up well into the double digits over last year's upfront. 
At the same time, we're going to air significantly fewer hours of original programming across our domestic entertainment networks, and that's partially an effort to stay out of the way of this year's Summer Olympics. 
The third quarter is also our lightest quarter for sports inventory, and FX remains a headwind. 
Moving on. Content and other revenues declined 15% in the quarter. That reflects lower licensing revenues due to the comparison of last year's deal with Hulu. Adjusted operating income was flat in the quarter as healthy revenue growth was balanced by continued investments in programming and marketing. Programming expenses increased 11%, mainly due to higher sports costs, including the NCAA National Championship game I mentioned earlier, and our continued investment in bold, new original programming as part of the re-brands at TBS and TNT. 
Marketing costs were up mid-teen to support those new original series. 
Overall, Turner has great operating momentum and is well positioned to maintain its strong revenue trends in the second half of the year, putting it on track for another year of solid growth. We're doing that while continuing to make important investments in new initiatives like Ice Cream Planet, expanding Bleacher Report and CNN's Digital Products. And together, we think the investments we're making across the business will allow Turner to deliver attractive results over the long term as well. 
Turning to HBO. We were pleased with the progress we're making as we continue to invest in the significant global opportunity in subscription video services. Domestic subscription revenue growth was in the mid-single digits in the quarter, and that included a continued sequential increase in the contribution from HBO NOW, where we remain encouraged with our progress. 
Content and other revenues decreased 17% in the quarter, mainly due to lower revenues from our licensing deal with Amazon. That was balanced by solid growth in international licensing revenues highlighting our ability to effectively monetize our original programming around the world. 
Across HBO's international networks, including unconsolidated JVs, revenues were up double digits, and that's a reflection of continued positive international subscriber trends, especially in Latin America and the Nordics. 
Adjusted operating income fell 5% in the quarter, and that reflects higher programming expenses, including programming charges and restructuring and severance costs. The programming charges and restructuring and severance costs totaled approximately $100 million, and that's largely related to a change in leadership on the programming fronts. 
Separately, after considering consumer viewing patterns, including increased on-demand access to HBO's content across a wide range of devices and services, we have updated our estimates of the period over which our original programming is used. 
As a result, most of HBO's original programming will now be amortized over a somewhat longer time period. That reduced amortization this quarter by approximately $95 million. 
So the combination of reduced amortization, programming charges and restructuring and severance costs did not have a material effect on adjusted operating income in the quarter. 
While there will be some impact from reduced amortization in the second half of 2016, most of this benefit was recognized in the second quarter. 
Excluding the programming charges and benefit from the reduced amortization, programming costs increased in the teens in the quarter, and that was driven primarily by increased investments in original programming. 
Looking forward, we're excited about our upcoming programming lineup, and combined with the continued investments we're making in the brand and product, we think HBO is very well positioned to drive substantial growth in the years to come. 
Moving on to Warner Brothers, where we're also making progress on our multi-year strategy to drive growth across theatrical, television and games. 
Coming into the year, we planned for our theatrical business to be the primary driver of profit growth, and that's playing out as we expected through the first half of the year. 
Looking specifically at the second quarter, we knew we had very difficult comparisons. Last year's quarter was a record for our video games business, led by the successful releases of franchise titles Batman Arkham Knight and Mortal Kombat X, and we had significant TV licensing revenues from the Big Bang Theory and Seinfeld. 
We also had fewer theoretical home-video releases and a very difficult comparison against American Sniper and carryover revenues from the final installment of The Hobbit. 
So as expected, both revenue and adjusted operating income declined in the quarter. 
In theatrical, we saw a significant benefit from carryover revenue from Batman v Superman. We've also been really pleased with the theatrical performance of more recent releases like The Conjuring 2 and Central Intelligence. And the Legend of Tarzan has already surpassed $300 million in global box office. So while we originally had higher hopes for the film, we do not expect it to have a material impact on profits this year. 
Looking ahead, we're very optimistic about the upcoming theatrical releases of Suicide Squad and Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them as we continue to lay the groundwork for our multi-year franchise film slate. 
Combined with the healthy trends and a leading position in TV production and the opportunities at its Games business, Warner's is set up to continue delivering strong growth, both this year and well into the future. 
Turning to the next slide. Free cash flow totaled about $1.9 billion in the first half, that's up from a year ago, largely due to growth in adjusted operating income. Working capital also benefited from the payment of $280 million associated with the CME refinancing, and that was mostly offset by increased content investments, driven by higher production spending at Warner Brothers. 
Given our performance to date and our expectation for strong growth in adjusted operating income, we're on track for another year of very strong free cash flow in 2016. 
Now looking at our balance sheet. Since our last call, we took advantage of favorable market conditions to strengthen our balance sheet by issuing $800 million of long-term debt at an attractive rate. And we ended the second quarter with $22 billion of net debt, up around $350 million compared to the end of 2015. That's mostly a result of our ongoing commitment to direct returns to shareholders, which is a key component of our balanced approach to capital allocation. 
Looking at investments. We did a very modest amount of M&A in the first half, and as Jeff noted, yesterday, we invested $583 million for a 10% stake in Hulu. That payment will hit in the third quarter. 
Our net leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was just above our target leverage ratio of around 2.75x, which we're on track to return to by the end of this year. And we remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and our investment-grade credit rating. 
With that, let's move on to the final slide, which looks at our outlook for 2016. We had a solid first half of the year, and we're really pleased with how we're executing across our businesses, and that's reflected in our updated outlook for 2016. 
As I mentioned earlier, we raised our outlook for adjusted EPS this year to $5.35 to $5.45, and that incorporates around a $0.06 negative impact related to our equity investment in Hulu, including both our share of the losses and PPA. 
Turning to the back half of the year, we expect overall revenue growth to accelerate and that should help drive a nice acceleration in adjusted operating income growth as well. 
Looking specifically at the third quarter, we anticipate elevated programming cost growth at HBO from the rollout of new original programming like The Night Of and Vice Principals and the timing of theatric availabilities, and will again face challenging comparisons in video games and TV licensing at Warner Bros. 
As a result, we anticipate growth in adjusted operating income to be weighted heavily to the fourth quarter. 
So overall, we're on track for another year of very attractive growth, and we believe the significant operating momentum, positive revenue trends and continued investments we're making across the company position us to continue that growth well into the future. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Jessica to start the Q&A."

But I'll start, and Kevin will pick it up. The CW's in a different situation than many of other networks or our cable networks in that it doesn't currently receive material carriage fees. And so we made the decision this year not to have an in season digital partner, which essentially goes along with what we've been thinking, and we instead put more aggressive VOD rights and stacking rights on the CW for the current season. Let's focus on that first, Kevin, and then let's go to the follow-on years [ph]."

And therefore it has slightly different economics than the other broadcast networks. But what we did was actually give the CW more stacking rights. By giving it exclusivity in the year, it has a lot more flexibility in its ability to be able to convey a full season or any number between a full season and 5 episodes. So we can do -- it has a lot more flexibility than it has in the acquired deal, when the CW had Hulu in season deal than a Netflix out of season deal."

Let's all look at the way this is actually works, and it's working the way it should work. Consumers want, and they expect, particularly for series where they pick up a series, maybe, in its first year, maybe at some other place. They want more on demand access to the series, particularly series that becomes serialized plots over a long period of time. So as consumers want that, networks -- and it depends, which kind of networks and how -- what kind of show. Networks increasingly want to offer more VOD rights over more episodes to cover story arcs. So if you look at, for example, networks like an HBO or Showtime or lately, the Netflix and Amazons, they -- those kind of networks, with their serialized shows, have had for years multiple, many episodes going back over long periods of time, so you can catch up with the show. If you go to the ad-supported networks, broadcast, cable networks, et cetera, they have been on a path to try to meet consumer demand and to the extent consumers want to see their favorite show over longer story arcs of episodes, networks increasingly ask for that. So if you take say some of the broadcast networks -- Kevin, you might want to comment on this, they've been asking for more on demand than current season.

And, let me say, that the early results are quite encouraging. And I would repeat that it's early, and we're going to be, obviously, paying close attention to this, but it's all being driven by the fact that we know that we have to have a network that has an experience that can compete with the very best consumer experiences in the world. So we reduced the number of ads, we've been engaged with -- in discussions with our agencies, with our advertisers and what we've been seeing is smaller drop off during ad parts [ph]. Meaning that we're retaining higher audience levels during advertising commercials, which means higher ratings to the network. We believe the early results indicate that there's even higher recall for the ads that are there. We're working very, very hard to make the ads more relevant with our native product and our own internal production capabilities, to make sure that the advertising is more relevant and contextual with respect to the content itself, and that was very, very helpful during the upfront and extremely, extremely well received.

With regard to eSports, in which we just concluded the championship of the tournament, we couldn't be more pleased and excited about how we hosted the first ever eSports tournament on television. We call it ELEAGUE, and across the 10-week tournament between Twitch and TBS, there was almost approaching 1 billion minutes of consumption, it's brought millions of new viewers to the network.

This morning, we issued 2 press releases, 1 detailing our results for the third quarter and one updating our 2016 full year business outlook. 
Before we begin, there are 2 items I need to cover. First, we refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Schedules setting out reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our earnings release and trending schedules. These reconciliations are available on our website at www.timewarner.com/investors. Reconciliations of our expected future financial performance are also included in the business outlook release that is available on our website. 
Second, today's announcement includes certain forward-looking statements, which are based on management's current expectations. Actual results may vary materially from those expressed or implied by these statements due to various factors. These factors are discussed in detail on Time Warner's SEC filings, including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. Time Warner is under no obligation and, in fact, expressly disclaims any obligation to update or alter its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. 
I'll now turn the call over to Jeff Bewkes, Time Warner's Chairman and CEO, who will be followed by Howard Averill, Time Warner's CFO. After their prepared remarks, our divisional CEOs, John Martin, Richard Plepler and Kevin Tsujihara, and our General Counsel, Paul Cappuccio, will join us for our Q&A session. Jeff?"

As you know, on October 22, we announced our agreement to be acquired by AT&T for $107.50 per share of Time Warner, and that will be half in cash and half in AT&T stock. That represents a premium of more than 35% over our trading price on October 19. This transaction is an excellent outcome for our shareholders and it's an excellent opportunity to drive long-term value into the future. We believe combining with AT&T is the natural next step in the evolution of our business and its one that allows us to significantly accelerate our most important strategy. We believe that putting these supplementary businesses together will drive innovation and accelerate the transition of the ecosystem to more and better choices for consumers. We anticipate the transaction will close by the end of 2017, if not sooner. 
Turning to our results. We had another strong quarter, and we remain on track to exceed our original outlook. We've delivered these results while making investments to capitalize on the growing consumption of video across both traditional and new platforms all over the world, which we're confident positions us for continued industry-leading growth over the long term. 
In the quarter, our revenues grew 9% to $7.2 billion, and adjusted operating income increased 12% to $2.1 billion. And we saw growth at all our divisions. Adjusted EPS grew to $1.83 a share, and we also returned over $1 billion to shareholders in share repurchases and dividends. 
Echoing what we've seen, not only through this year but also for the past several years, our performance was propelled this quarter by creative excellence from across every one of our divisions. We're in an environment where leading brands with distinctive content that engages audiences stands apart. It's also an environment of unprecedented consumer choice and control. And as we'd outlined for you before, we're committed not just to being the home to the world's best content, but to generating new revenue streams by leading the evolution of how and where a content is consumed and experienced. This is where we see enormous opportunity from joining forces with AT&T because it brings us closer to consumers and allows us to go where they're going. And that is increasingly mobile, it's increasingly multiplatform, increasingly on demand, and it's increasingly through new services and packages, be a direct consumer relationships over broadband. 
As you've all heard from Randall Stephenson on AT&T, we're really focused on the growth opportunities of this combination. We think we can innovate new services in forms of content and experiences faster and better together, and that will benefit not just us, but all our business partners and consumers all over the world. 
If you look at our third quarter, the strength and breadth of our premium content was underscored at this year's Primetime Emmy Awards, where HBO, again, took on more awards than any other network for the 15th consecutive year. All told, across our networks and studio, Time Warner's divisions won 40 Emmys, that's more than any other company. 
More recently, we've just seen the powerful return of the DC Entertainment-based TV slate on the CW and CNN's continued standout performance on the final stretch of the election race, and the thrilling start to HBO's newest original series, Westworld, produced by Warner Bros. More than 13 million viewers have tuned into the premiere episodes of Westworld so far, and that exceeds the first episodes of Game of Thrones and True Detective. 
In film, Warner had a terrific quarter, led by the latest DC installment, Suicide Squad and Clint Eastwood's Sully. Sully is our sixth release this year to do over $100 million in domestic box. 
At the same time, we continue to make progress on our initiatives to develop new revenue streams outside the traditional TV ecosystem. iStreamPlanet, which Turner acquired a majority stake in last year, demonstrated that power when it used this technology to make the live streaming of the Rio Olympics a reality for NBC. And Turner just debuted its first direct-to-consumer offering in the U.S., FilmStruck, that's an art house film SVOD service. 
Over at Warner's, our SVOD partnership with Tencent, Tencent Video VIP, continues to exhibit tremendous subscriber growth, and it's currently the second largest SVOD service in China. 
And HBO continues to make progress in its streaming strategy, both here and around the world. HBO NOW is building momentum while HBO's OTT business in the Nordics has shown accelerating growth. And we're on track to launch in more international territories before the end of the year. 
These are just early examples of the kinds of vibrant new services and capabilities we're working on, and we plan to accelerate these as part of AT&T. 
Now let me spend a little time highlighting what each of our divisions accomplished in the past quarter. At Turner, we've been investing on our leading portfolio of entertainment, news, sports and kids to make these brands even more engaging and essential to audiences. And those investments are driving real momentum across its businesses. During the third quarter, Turner had 3 of the top 6 ad-supported cable networks in prime time among adults 18 to 49, namely Adult Swim, TBS and TNT. And Adult Swim was the #1 ad-supported cable network in total day among adults 18 to 34 for the 34th consecutive quarter. 
At TBS and TNT, we're very encouraged by the brand refreshes underway and the distinctive programming that we've been rolling out. At TBS, Full Frontal with Samantha Bee has already overtaken The Daily Show in just its first season. And Sam has emerged as a distinctive voice this election, which is saying something, giving some of the voices this election. And on Monday, we debuted People of Earth, a Warner's production and we'll follow that with Search Party, premiering November 21. 
Over TNT, the refreshes are in early-stage, but we're excited about Good Behavior starting Michelle Dockery of Downton Abbey fame. And that premieres on November 15. 
And we have a very strong pipeline of originals for 2017. We also announced this quarter that TBS and TNT have reached a deal with Disney to be the cable home for the entire Canada Star Wars movies, and a similar deal with Warner Bros. for its DC theatrical types. And that's adding to an already strong movie lineup that also includes Disney's Marvel movies and the Hunger Games franchise. This aligns perfectly with the younger audiences these brands are drawing. 
Let's all turn to CNN, which continues to win over audiences with its mixture of indispensable news and election coverage, along with innovative original series. CNN was #1 news network among adults 18 to 49 in prime time for the fourth consecutive quarter. And CNN had its most watched quarter in 8 years among total viewers and among adults 25 to 54. And CNN's coverage of the second U.S. Presidential debate, co-hosted by our own Anderson Cooper, was its most-watched general election debate ever, making CNN #1 among all cable networks for that night. And CNN Digital continued its streak as the #1 news destination, outpacing all news and information competitors with more mobile unique visitors, more multiplatform views, more video starts and more video minutes than any other news outlet. 
Let's turn to HBO, which continues to raise the bar and define the word premium for our industry. As I mentioned, its 22 Primetime Emmy Awards were the most of any network for the 15th consecutive year. And they included Outstanding Drama Series for Game of Thrones, Outstanding Comedy Series for Veep, Outstanding Variety Talk Series for Last Week Tonight with John Oliver. In fact, Game of Thrones received 12 awards and has now earned 38 Emmys, more than any single scripted series in television history. Never want to rest on its laurels, HBO is aggressively expanding its contents as well for. In addition to Westworld, it recently introduced Insecure, High Maintenance, Divorce and the new nightly newscast from Vice.
What you're seeing at HBO is our ongoing strategy to provide consumers with a steady flow of the very best content in order to drive demand across both traditional distributors and with HBO NOW. 
Speaking of NOW, we remain very pleased with its progress. And in late September, we further expanded its reach with the announcement that HBO NOW, along with HBO and Cinemax, are now available on Sony's PlayStation platforms. 
Looking at Warner Bros.' strong performance during the quarter underscores its global leadership position in the production of film and television, and it remains on track for another record year. 
Our theatrical business is setting the pace with a number of standout performers over the last few months, including The Conjuring 2, Central Intelligence, The Legend of Tarzan and Lights Out. But our blockbuster for the quarter for us was Suicide Squad, which not only had the biggest August opening ever, but it's gone on to generate nearly $750 million in worldwide box office. 
And that's just the most recent example of how we're tapping growing potential of our DC Entertainment IP. We've only just begun our ambitious slate for DC theatrically. Next year's much anticipated releases include Wonder Woman and Justice League as well as Lego Batman, a fun feature that builds on the franchise we started with 2014 skit, The Lego Movie. 
We also have an unprecedented 10 television series airing this season based on DC characters, with DC's TV business now generating more than $1 billion a year in revenue going up. 
And I want to highlight the excitement we're seeing for these iconic brands digitally in consumer products and even in print. Our DC Super Hero Girls partnership with Mattel has action figures flying off the shelves. And since May, DC has shipped a record 18 million comic books based on the new Rebirth series concept, spearheaded by Geoff Johns, the renowned comic book writer here who knows how to pronounce it, who's also actively helping shape our DC films. 
In the near term, we're very excited about Fantastic Beasts, a brand new story based on The Wizarding World of Harry Potter that, we think, will be a global hit, not just at the box office, but in consumer products and across all platforms. 
Jo Rowling has already written a script for the second film that's set for release on November 16, 2018, and the third will follow in 2020. And as Jo herself recently announced, the story is so rich that she now plans to tell it in 5 films, giving fans even more to look forward to. 
Warner's great franchises like DC, The Wizarding World of Harry Potter, Looney Tunes, Hanna Barbera are also the driving force behind our consumer products business, which is also enjoying a record year. 
As we continue to roll out our franchise films and develop more kids content as part of the kids friendship between Warner and Turner, we think this business can be an important growth driver going forward. 
You can see we're heading into the fourth quarter with a lot of momentum. And as I said upfront, we positioned ourselves to benefit from the growing opportunities we see worldwide for the best video content. We're moving aggressively to strengthen our position within the traditional ecosystem, while also building new revenue streams outside of it. 
As we look at the fourth quarter of 2016 and beyond, we remain very confident about our ability to continue to execute on our plans. And we're even more excited about what we can accomplish given the combination with AT&T and what that will enable us to do as one company, uniquely focused on delivering great content and a great consumer experience across platforms. 
Thanks for listening. Let me turn it over to Howard."

We had another great quarter with growth across all of our businesses, fueled by t",1697,"Thanks, Jeff, and good morning. I'll begin by referring to the first slide of our presentation, which is now available on our website. 
Starting with consolidated results. We had another great quarter with growth across all of our businesses, fueled by the positive trends we've seen throughout the year. And we feel very good about how we're positioned to close out 2016 and as we head into 2017. 
In the third quarter, revenues were up 9% and adjusted operating income grew a very strong 12% to a quarterly record of $2.1 billion. Margins expanded about 100 basis points in the quarter despite continuing investments across the company in content and digital initiatives. That was partly due to limiting growth in SG&A to the low single digits. 
Adjusted EPS was up 46% to $1.83 and included a $0.28 net tax benefit related to a tax accounting method change. Excluding the tax benefit, adjusted EPS would have increased a healthy 24% to $1.55 as we benefited from great operating results, a lower effective tax rate and fewer shares outstanding as a result of our share repurchase program. 
During the third quarter, we repurchased over $700 million of our shares and paid $315 million in dividends. And year-to-date, we've returned nearly $3.3 billion to shareholders. 
So we're very pleased with our strong operational performance so far this year and when combined with the tax benefit, we raised our outlook for 2016 adjusted EPS to $5.73 to $5.83 or $5.45 to $5.55 when excluding the $0.28 tax benefit I just mentioned. I'll touch more on our outlook throughout my presentation. 
Now turning to the segment highlights. I'll start at Turner, where our revenue trends remain robust and translated into solid double-digit growth in adjusted operating income. 
Subscription revenues increased 12% in the quarter, and that included 100 basis points of FX headwinds. Domestic subscription revenues grew 15% as we continue to benefit from the rate increases we achieved during our affiliate renewal cycle. That puts us right on track to deliver the growth for the year we've discussed with you. And we expect another year of solid double-digit growth in 2017. International subscription revenue was up in the low single digits, and that included a more than 5 percentage points drag from FX. 
Advertising revenue was up 2%, in line with our expectations coming into the quarter, and that included about 100 basis points of negative impact from FX. Domestic advertising increased from low single digits, led by solid double-digit growth across our linear and digital news properties. That was somewhat balanced by the impact of our decision to air significantly less original programming at our domestic entertainment networks in part to avoid competing with the Olympics. International advertising was essentially flat in the quarter, but up high single digits when excluding an 8 percentage point FX drag. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter. We expect total advertising revenue growth to be approximately flat. The scatter market remains healthy with pricing at our domestic entertainment networks pacing up double digits already upfront. 
At the same time, we face very difficult comparisons to last year's record Major League Baseball playoff performance, and we aired 3 fewer playoff games this year. 
We'll also have fewer hours of original programming as the content refresh at TNT will accelerate more in 2017. And based on current rates, we expect FX to have a similar impact as in the third quarter. 
Moving on. Content and other revenues were up 33% in the quarter. That reflects higher international licensing revenues as we're seeing healthy demand for our original programming abroad. 
Adjusted operating income was up 12% in the quarter, and margins expanded 140 basis points. That was despite higher programming costs, which increased 5%, mainly reflecting CNN's election coverage. 
So Turner's executing really well and is on track to deliver another year of strong growth in adjusted operating income. And we think the investments we're making in great content as part of the TNT and TBS re-brands as well as the new capabilities and businesses position Turner to carry this momentum into 2017 and beyond. 
Turning now to HBO, where we continue to invest in the business and lay the groundwork for accelerating revenue trends over the next few years. Consistent with the first half of the year, domestic subscription revenue grew in the mid-single digits. We continue to see a sequential increase in the contribution from HBO NOW as we benefit from the strong subscriber growth so far this year. 
On the other hand, similar to the last couple of years, we continue to experience headwinds related to subscriber mix. 
Looking ahead, we expect HBO subscription revenue growth to accelerate in the fourth quarter and in 2017. We're currently in the midst of our affiliate renewals, so the timing of when deals close and their implementation will determine the pace of the acceleration. 
Content and other revenues were down slightly in the quarter. Last year's quarter included the domestic licensing of a library series, and that was mostly offset by increased international licensing revenue as the global demand for our original programming remains robust. 
Across HBO's international networks, including unconsolidated JVs, revenues, once again, were up double digits when excluding FX, and that primarily reflects continued positive trend in LatAm and the Nordics. 
Adjusted operating income was up 2% in the quarter as programming cost increased mid-teens. That reflected investments in new original series like The Night Of and Vice Principals as well as the timing of theatrical availabilities. 
Overall, we're very pleased with the performance of HBO's programming lineup and excited about the strong pipeline of new series slated for the next few years. And we're confident the investments we're making in the business and the robust consumer demand premium content around the world will contribute a significant growth in the years to come. 
Moving on to Warner Bros., where despite difficult comparisons in TV and video games, we delivered strong results with revenue up 7% and adjusted operating income increasing 12%. Warner's theatrical business led the way, with revenues growing a robust 45% as we benefit from the great box office performance of our film slate. That included our most recent franchise release, Suicide Squad, which has grossed close to $750 million at the global box office. 
The diversity of our slate was also on display this quarter with the success of Sully, The Legend of Tarzan and the most recent release in our very profitable horror slate, Lights Out. 
In television, we faced difficult licensing comparisons due to the syndication of 2 Broke Girls and Person of Interest in last year's quarter. However, TV revenues only declined modestly as Warner's benefited from increased production with the start of the new TV season, including Warner's continued expansion in cable with shows like Westworld on HBO and Animal Kingdom on TNT. 
Across theatrical and TV, home entertainment revenues were flat in the quarter. Digital trends remain encouraging though with ESP revenue up 25%. And we expect improved revenue trends as our strong theatrical slate continues to move into the home entertainment window over the next few quarters. 
So Warner Bros. had great momentum and is on pace for another record year in adjusted operating income. And the initial success of this year's franchise movies gives us even more confidence in the exciting franchise-led slate we have for the next several years. So combined with the attractive growth opportunities in TV and games, Warner's is well positioned to continue delivering solid financial results over the long term. 
Turning to the next slide. Free cash flow totaled $3.3 billion through the third quarter. That's up 15% from a year ago, largely due to the growth in adjusted operating income. Year-to-date, working capital has improved due to the CME refinancing payment we received in the second quarter. So we remain on track for another year of very healthy free cash flow in 2016. 
Now looking at our balance sheet. We ended the third quarter with $22 billion of net debt. Looking forward, as we move through the approval process for the AT&T transaction, we expect to continue to pay our regular quarterly dividend. However, we have discontinued repurchasing our stock. 
We've done about $750 million year-to-date in M&A, largely related to the investment in Hulu in August. 
Our net leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was just above our target leverage ratio of 2.75x, and we expect to end the year slightly below that target as a result of discontinuing share repurchases. 
With that, let's move on to the final slide, which looks at our outlook for 2016. We're very pleased with how we're operating across the company and with our solid financial performance year-to-date. And that's reflected in our outlook for adjusted EPS for 2016, which we increased to $5.73 to $5.83, or $5.45 to $5.55 when excluding the $0.28 tax benefit we recognized this quarter. The midpoint of that range implies mid-teens growth in adjusted EPS, putting us on track for our eighth consecutive year of double-digit earnings growth. 
Looking at the fourth quarter. We expect Warner's to be the primary growth driver, led by its strong theatrical slate, including the first installment in the Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them franchise. 
Meanwhile, we continue to invest significantly in programming across our networks. HBO already premiered 4 new original programs in the fourth quarter. And at Turner, our new NBA contract at TNT kicks in, and CNN will continue to have elevated cost related to its election coverage. So we expect programming cost at both HBO and Turner to be up double digits in the fourth quarter when excluding last year's programming charges. 
In addition, we anticipate our effective tax rate will be in the low 30% range, and we expect that to be a sustainable level going forward. 
Overall, we have great operating momentum across our businesses. And we think the investments we're making, both inside and outside the traditional TV ecosystem, we're very well positioned to continue this momentum and deliver strong financial results for many years to come. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Jessica to start the Q&A."

So whether it's John, Kevin and Richard and all the teams they lead and then think of our creative partners, not just our programming development execs inside the company, but all of our very, very important mostly creative input comes from outside the company, in partnership with us. That's the essence of Time Warner. And if you listen to Randall and I've talked with him and all his top management for quite some time now, they are very understanding of the need to keep this company excelling and growing and doesn't just mean the ongoing momentum of all of our execs and the Time Warner people, it seems continuing to be the leading place, which we think we are at Warner, at Turner and at HBO for creative partners outside the company who know that if you come here, we not only have a culture to make the best out of your project, but we have the resources and the distribution ability and now with AT&T and enhance ability to innovate, bring them new forms and even stronger platform to fuel all these innovations. You're looking at a new world of more mobile products, more short form products, virtual reality, all kinds of exciting developments. That's why we're doing this merger, and that's why creative partners are going to find us an even more attractive place to come in the future."

So we basically saw that this was a fairly unique complementary way to take all the initiatives that certainly on our side we were doing and accelerating and making them stronger. And we figured that together we could drive more innovation and the key to having innovative things adopted is consumers finding a better value, whether that's more choice, whether it's better pricing on their packages, whether it's more effective and less intrusive advertising, that will determine success.

And in terms of advertising, we're still in the very early stages of essentially nothing short of reinventing the ad model for TV. But the early, early examples that we've done because we have done limited commercials in some of the new originals is we are seeing some really positive results. We're seeing -- because of TV's unparalleled reach in engagement, we're seeing advertising response has been extremely positive. We're seeing improved ratings because there's less dislocation going into the advertising pod and coming out. And we've seen higher consumer satisfaction and higher brand recall.

It's been lower than that over the last several years. Next year, principally because of the NBA rights renewal, we expect programming cost to accelerate and will likely be double digits, but that's not going to be a sustainable trend they'll moderate then after that. And I think, yes, the way that the rights fees work, there'll be this for portion it amount in the latter part of the season. With regard to revenue opportunities, this deal has given us more games. We are launching a Monday night franchise as a result of that.

If you combine the unparalleled reach and engagement of television with more ability in direct platform in terms of -- whether it's mobile, whether it's broadband delivered, that can really give you a step-up in the efficiency of advertising the value of advertising. That has tremendous benefits for consumers because it can shift cost from subscription payments to advertising payment. It has great benefits for advertisers because it gives them more effective advertising. And it gives them more competition and advertising. I think we've all seen, and you all know this, an increasing concentration in digital advertising and just a couple of company, and it's basically good for the market, consumers and advertising clients if we have a broader number of competitors in the ad business, particularly the digital ad business. So John, you want to add any specific on Turner?"

Look, what we're trying to do is we're trying to curate the best content for the best value and make it as available to as many consumers as possible and as many ways as possible.

And if you continue to look at the usage, it goes up 92%, for example of HBO subscribers watch a movie at least once a month. When you then migrate over to original programming, I said this before, it's absolutely true, more isn't better, only better is better. We're not trying to just spend money, we try to spend money thoughtfully, to differentiate high-quality programming and build more consumers and build more annex across our subscriber base. I like to think that our track record is pretty good at doing that over the last decade, and I think if you look out our programming line of going forward, you'll see that we have every confidence that we're going to continue to do that. So I like our mix, I like our investments and I think what we're putting together in terms of the value proposition is extraordinary."

That represents a premium of more than 35% over our trading price on October 19. This transaction is an excellent outcome for our shareholders and it's an excellent opportunity to drive long-term value into the future. We believe combining with AT&T is the natural next step in the evolution of our business and its one that allows us to significantly accelerate our most important strategy. We believe that putting these supplementary businesses together will drive innovation and accelerate the transition of the ecosystem to more and better choices for consumers. We anticipate the transaction will close by the end of 2017, if not sooner. 
Turning to our results. We had another strong quarter, and we remain on track to exceed our original outlook. We've delivered these results while making investments to capitalize on the growing consumption of video across both traditional and new platforms all over the world, which we're confident positions us for continued industry-leading growth over the long term. 
In the quarter, our revenues grew 9% to $7.2 billion, and adjusted operating income increased 12% to $2.1 billion. And we saw growth at all our divisions. Adjusted EPS grew to $1.83 a share, and we also returned over $1 billion to shareholders in share repurchases and dividends. 
Echoing what we've seen, not only through this year but also for the past several years, our performance was propelled this quarter by creative excellence from across every one of our divisions. We're in an environment where leading brands with distinctive content that engages audiences stands apart. It's also an environment of unprecedented consumer choice and control. And as we'd outlined for you before, we're committed not just to being the home to the world's best content, but to generating new revenue streams by leading the evolution of how and where a content is consumed and experienced. This is where we see enormous opportunity from joining forces with AT&T because it brings us closer to consumers and allows us to go where they're going. And that is increasingly mobile, it's increasingly multi-platform, increasingly on demand, and it's increasingly through new services and packages, be a direct consumer relationships over broadband. 
As you've all heard from Randall Stephenson on AT&T, we're really focused on the growth opportunities of this combination. We think we can innovate new services in forms of content and experiences faster and better together, and that will benefit not just us, but all our business partners and consumers all over the world. 
If you look at our third quarter, the strength and breadth of our premium content was underscored at this year's Primetime Emmy Awards, where HBO, again, took on more awards than any other network for the 15th consecutive year. All told, across our networks and studio, Time Warner's divisions won 40 Emmys, that's more than any other company. 
More recently, we've just seen the powerful return of the DC Entertainment-based TV slate on the CW and CNN's continued standout performance on the final stretch of the election race, and the thrilling start to HBO's newest original series, Westworld, produced by Warner Bros. More than 13 million viewers have tuned into the premiere episodes of Westworld so far, and that exceeds the first episodes of Game of Thrones and True Detective. 
In film, Warner had a terrific quarter, led by the latest DC installment, Suicide Squad and Clint Eastwood's Sully. Sully is our sixth release this year to do over $100 million in domestic box. 
At the same time, we continue to make progress on our initiatives to develop new revenue streams outside the traditional TV ecosystem. iStreamPlanet, which Turner acquired a majority stake in last year, demonstrated that power when it used this technology to make the live streaming of the Rio Olympics a reality for NBC. And Turner just debuted its first direct-to-consumer offering in the U.S., FilmStruck, that's an art house film SVOD service. 
Over at Warner's, our SVOD partnership with Tencent, Tencent Video VIP, continues to exhibit tremendous subscriber growth, and it's currently the second largest SVOD service in China. 
And HBO continues to make progress in its streaming strategy, both here and around the world. HBO NOW is building momentum while HBO's OTT business in the Nordics has shown accelerating growth. And we're on track to launch in more international territories before the end of the year. 
These are just early examples of the kinds of vibrant new services and capabilities we're working on, and we plan to accelerate these as part of AT&T. 
Now let me spend a little time highlighting what each of our divisions accomplished in the past quarter. At Turner, we've been investing on our leading portfolio of entertainment, news, sports and kids to make these brands even more engaging and essential to audiences. And those investments are driving real momentum across its businesses. During the third quarter, Turner had 3 of the top 6 ad-supported cable networks in prime time among adults 18 to 49, namely Adult Swim, TBS and TNT. And Adult Swim was the #1 ad-supported cable network in total day among adults 18 to 34 for the 34th consecutive quarter. 
At TBS and TNT, we're very encouraged by the brand refreshes underway and the distinctive programming that we've been rolling out. At TBS, Full Frontal with Samantha Bee has already overtaken The Daily Show in just its first season. And Sam has emerged as a distinctive voice this election, which is saying something, giving some of the voices this election. And on Monday, we debuted People of Earth, a Warner's production and we'll follow that with Search Party, premiering November 21. 
Over TNT, the refreshes are in early-stage, but we're excited about Good Behavior starting Michelle Dockery of Downton Abbey fame. And that premieres on November 15. 
And we have a very strong pipeline of originals for 2017. We also announced this quarter that TBS and TNT have reached a deal with Disney to be the cable home for the entire Canada Star Wars movies, and a similar deal with Warner Bros. for its DC theatrical types. And that's adding to an already strong movie lineup that also includes Disney's Marvel movies and the Hunger Games franchise. This aligns perfectly with the younger audiences these brands are drawing. 
Let's all turn to CNN, which continues to win over audiences with its mixture of indispensable news and election coverage, along with innovative original series. CNN was #1 news network among adults 18 to 49 in prime time for the fourth consecutive quarter. And CNN had its most watched quarter in 8 years among total viewers and among adults 25 to 54. And CNN's coverage of the second U.S. Presidential debate, co-hosted by our own Anderson Cooper, was its most-watched general election debate ever, making CNN #1 among all cable networks for that night. And CNN Digital continued its streak as the #1 news destination, outpacing all news and information competitors with more mobile unique visitors, more multi-platform views, more video starts and more video minutes than any other news outlet. 
Let's turn to HBO, which continues to raise the bar and define the word premium for our industry. As I mentioned, its 22 Primetime Emmy Awards were the most of any network for the 15th consecutive year. And they included Outstanding Drama Series for Game of Thrones, Outstanding Comedy Series for Veep, Outstanding Variety Talk Series for Last Week Tonight with John Oliver. In fact, Game of Thrones received 12 awards and has now earned 38 Emmys, more than any single scripted series in television history. Never want to rest on its laurels, HBO is aggressively expanding its contents as well for. In addition to Westworld, it recently introduced Insecure, High Maintenance, Divorce and the new nightly newscast from Vice.
What you're seeing at HBO is our ongoing strategy to provide consumers with a steady flow of the very best content in order to drive demand across both traditional distributors and with HBO NOW. 
Speaking of NOW, we remain very pleased with its progress. And in late September, we further expanded its reach with the announcement that HBO NOW, along with HBO and Cinemax, are now available on Sony's PlayStation platforms. 
Looking at Warner Bros.' strong performance during the quarter underscores its global leadership position in the production of film and television, and it remains on track for another record year. 
Our theatrical business is setting the pace with a number of standout performers over the last few months, including The Conjuring 2, Central Intelligence, The Legend of Tarzan and Lights Out. But our blockbuster for the quarter for us was Suicide Squad, which not only had the biggest August opening ever, but it's gone on to generate nearly $750 million in worldwide box office. 
And that's just the most recent example of how we're tapping growing potential of our DC Entertainment IP. We've only just begun our ambitious slate for DC theatrically. Next year's much anticipated releases include Wonder Woman and Justice League as well as Lego Batman, a fun feature that builds on the franchise we started with 2014 skit, The Lego Movie. 
We also have an unprecedented 10 television series airing this season based on DC characters, with DC's TV business now generating more than $1 billion a year in revenue going up. 
And I want to highlight the excitement we're seeing for these iconic brands digitally in consumer products and even in print. Our DC Super Hero Girls partnership with Mattel has action figures flying off the shelves. And since May, DC has shipped a record 18 million comic books based on the new Rebirth series concept, spearheaded by Geoff Johns, the renowned comic book writer here who knows how to pronounce it, who's also actively helping shape our DC films. 
In the near term, we're very excited about Fantastic Beasts, a brand new story based on The Wizarding World of Harry Potter that, we think, will be a global hit, not just at the box office, but in consumer products and across all platforms. 
Jo Rowling has already written a script for the second film that's set for release on November 16, 2018, and the third will follow in 2020. And as Jo herself recently announced, the story is so rich that she now plans to tell it in 5 films, giving fans even more to look forward to. 
Warner's great franchises like DC, The Wizarding World of Harry Potter, Looney Tunes, Hanna-Barbera, are also the driving force behind our consumer products business, which is also enjoying a record year. 
As we continue to roll out our franchise films and develop more kids content as part of the kids friendship between Warner and Turner, we think this business can be an important growth driver going forward. 
You can see we're heading into the fourth quarter with a lot of momentum. And as I said upfront, we positioned ourselves to benefit from the growing opportunities we see worldwide for the best video content. We're moving aggressively to strengthen our position within the traditional ecosystem, while also building new revenue streams outside of it. 
As we look at the fourth quarter of 2016 and beyond, we remain very confident about our ability to continue to execute on our plans. And we're even more excited about what we can accomplish given the combination with AT&T and what that will enable us to do as one company, uniquely focused on delivering great content and a great consumer experience across platforms. 
Thanks for listening. Let me turn it over to Howard."

I'll begin by referring to the first slide of our presentation, which is now available on our website. Starting with consolidated results. We had another great quarter with growth across all of our businesses, fueled by t",1697,"Thanks, Jeff, and good morning. I'll begin by referring to the first slide of our presentation, which is now available on our website. 
Starting with consolidated results. We had another great quarter with growth across all of our businesses, fueled by the positive trends we've seen throughout the year. And we feel very good about how we're positioned to close out 2016 and as we head into 2017. 
In the third quarter, revenues were up 9% and adjusted operating income grew a very strong 12% to a quarterly record of $2.1 billion. Margins expanded about 100 basis points in the quarter despite continuing investments across the company in content and digital initiatives. That was partly due to limiting growth in SG&A to the low single digits. 
Adjusted EPS was up 46% to $1.83 and included a $0.28 net tax benefit related to a tax accounting method change. Excluding the tax benefit, adjusted EPS would have increased a healthy 24% to $1.55 as we benefited from great operating results, a lower effective tax rate and fewer shares outstanding as a result of our share repurchase program. 
During the third quarter, we repurchased over $700 million of our shares and paid $315 million in dividends. And year-to-date, we've returned nearly $3.3 billion to shareholders. 
So we're very pleased with our strong operational performance so far this year and when combined with the tax benefit, we raised our outlook for 2016 adjusted EPS to $5.73 to $5.83 or $5.45 to $5.55 when excluding the $0.28 tax benefit I just mentioned. I'll touch more on our outlook throughout my presentation. 
Now turning to the segment highlights. I'll start at Turner, where our revenue trends remain robust and translated into solid double-digit growth in adjusted operating income. 
Subscription revenues increased 12% in the quarter, and that included 100 basis points of FX headwinds. Domestic subscription revenues grew 15% as we continue to benefit from the rate increases we achieved during our affiliate renewal cycle. That puts us right on track to deliver the growth for the year we've discussed with you. And we expect another year of solid double-digit growth in 2017. International subscription revenue was up in the low single digits, and that included a more than 5 percentage points drag from FX. 
Advertising revenue was up 2%, in line with our expectations coming into the quarter, and that included about 100 basis points of negative impact from FX. Domestic advertising increased from low single digits, led by solid double-digit growth across our linear and digital news properties. That was somewhat balanced by the impact of our decision to air significantly less original programming at our domestic entertainment networks in part to avoid competing with the Olympics. International advertising was essentially flat in the quarter, but up high single digits when excluding an 8 percentage point FX drag. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter. We expect total advertising revenue growth to be approximately flat. The scatter market remains healthy with pricing at our domestic entertainment networks pacing up double digits already upfront. 
At the same time, we face very difficult comparisons to last year's record Major League Baseball playoff performance, and we aired 3 fewer playoff games this year. 
We'll also have fewer hours of original programming as the content refresh at TNT will accelerate more in 2017. And based on current rates, we expect FX to have a similar impact as in the third quarter. 
Moving on. Content and other revenues were up 33% in the quarter. That reflects higher international licensing revenues as we're seeing healthy demand for our original programming abroad. 
Adjusted operating income was up 12% in the quarter, and margins expanded 140 basis points. That was despite higher programming costs, which increased 5%, mainly reflecting CNN's election coverage. 
So Turner's executing really well and is on track to deliver another year of strong growth in adjusted operating income. And we think the investments we're making in great content as part of the TNT and TBS re-brands as well as the new capabilities and businesses position Turner to carry this momentum into 2017 and beyond. 
Turning now to HBO, where we continue to invest in the business and lay the groundwork for accelerating revenue trends over the next few years. Consistent with the first half of the year, domestic subscription revenue grew in the mid-single digits. We continue to see a sequential increase in the contribution from HBO NOW as we benefit from the strong subscriber growth so far this year. 
On the other hand, similar to the last couple of years, we continue to experience headwinds related to subscriber mix. 
Looking ahead, we expect HBO subscription revenue growth to accelerate in the fourth quarter and in 2017. We're currently in the midst of our affiliate renewals, so the timing of when deals close and their implementation will determine the pace of the acceleration. 
Content and other revenues were down slightly in the quarter. Last year's quarter included the domestic licensing of a library series, and that was mostly offset by increased international licensing revenue as the global demand for our original programming remains robust. 
Across HBO's international networks, including unconsolidated JVs, revenues, once again, were up double digits when excluding FX, and that primarily reflects continued positive trend in LatAm and the Nordics. 
Adjusted operating income was up 2% in the quarter as programming cost increased mid-teens. That reflected investments in new original series like The Night Of and Vice Principals as well as the timing of theatrical availabilities. 
Overall, we're very pleased with the performance of HBO's programming lineup and excited about the strong pipeline of new series slated for the next few years. And we're confident the investments we're making in the business and the robust consumer demand premium content around the world will contribute a significant growth in the years to come. 
Moving on to Warner Bros., where despite difficult comparisons in TV and video games, we delivered strong results with revenue up 7% and adjusted operating income increasing 12%. Warner's theatrical business led the way, with revenues growing a robust 45% as we benefit from the great box office performance of our film slate. That included our most recent franchise release, Suicide Squad, which has grossed close to $750 million at the global box office. 
The diversity of our slate was also on display this quarter with the success of Sully, The Legend of Tarzan and the most recent release in our very profitable horror slate, Lights Out. 
In television, we faced difficult licensing comparisons due to the syndication of 2 Broke Girls and Person of Interest in last year's quarter. However, TV revenues only declined modestly as Warner's benefited from increased production with the start of the new TV season, including Warner's continued expansion in cable with shows like Westworld on HBO and Animal Kingdom on TNT. 
Across theatrical and TV, home entertainment revenues were flat in the quarter. Digital trends remain encouraging though with ESP revenue up 25%. And we expect improved revenue trends as our strong theatrical slate continues to move into the home entertainment window over the next few quarters. 
So Warner Bros. had great momentum and is on pace for another record year in adjusted operating income. And the initial success of this year's franchise movies gives us even more confidence in the exciting franchise-led slate we have for the next several years. So combined with the attractive growth opportunities in TV and games, Warner's is well positioned to continue delivering solid financial results over the long term. 
Turning to the next slide. Free cash flow totaled $3.3 billion through the third quarter. That's up 15% from a year ago, largely due to the growth in adjusted operating income. Year-to-date, working capital has improved due to the CME refinancing payment we received in the second quarter. So we remain on track for another year of very healthy free cash flow in 2016. 
Now looking at our balance sheet. We ended the third quarter with $22 billion of net debt. Looking forward, as we move through the approval process for the AT&T transaction, we expect to continue to pay our regular quarterly dividend. However, we have discontinued repurchasing our stock. 
We've done about $750 million year-to-date in M&A, largely related to the investment in Hulu in August. 
Our net leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was just above our target leverage ratio of 2.75x, and we expect to end the year slightly below that target as a result of discontinuing share repurchases. 
With that, let's move on to the final slide, which looks at our outlook for 2016. We're very pleased with how we're operating across the company and with our solid financial performance year-to-date. And that's reflected in our outlook for adjusted EPS for 2016, which we increased to $5.73 to $5.83, or $5.45 to $5.55 when excluding the $0.28 tax benefit we recognized this quarter. The midpoint of that range implies mid-teens growth in adjusted EPS, putting us on track for our eighth consecutive year of double-digit earnings growth. 
Looking at the fourth quarter. We expect Warner's to be the primary growth driver, led by its strong theatrical slate, including the first installment in the Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them franchise. 
Meanwhile, we continue to invest significantly in programming across our networks. HBO already premiered 4 new original programs in the fourth quarter. And at Turner, our new NBA contract at TNT kicks in, and CNN will continue to have elevated cost related to its election coverage. So we expect programming cost at both HBO and Turner to be up double digits in the fourth quarter when excluding last year's programming charges. 
In addition, we anticipate our effective tax rate will be in the low 30% range, and we expect that to be a sustainable level going forward. 
Overall, we have great operating momentum across our businesses. And we think the investments we're making, both inside and outside the traditional TV ecosystem, we're very well positioned to continue this momentum and deliver strong financial results for many years to come. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Jessica to start the Q&A."

Listen, with regards to the NBA, the fourth quarter, as I think Howard alluded to in his remarks, will be the first quarter that we'll begin to recognize the step-up in license fee. And it's one of the reasons why our programming costs will accelerate in the fourth quarter. Just take a half a step back though. We've been saying for a number of years that at Turner, our goal and our full expectation is to be able to manage our overall programming cost growth to be no higher than high single digits over a multi-year period. It's been lower than that over the last several years. Next year, principally, because of the NBA rights renewal, we expect programming cost to accelerate and will likely be double digits. But that's not going to be a sustainable trend. They'll moderate then after that. And I think, yes, the way that the rights fees work, there'll be a disproportionate amount recognized in the latter part of the season. With regard to revenue opportunities, this deal has is giving us more games. We're launching a Monday night franchise as a result of that. We have more digital rights. We're working really collaboratively with the NBA to try to dramatically accelerate the digital part of the business and digital profits as we continue to see more and more consumption happening on NBA digital. So we -- and by the way, just in the current environment, we're very pleased with how the season has started, with what ratings look like and inventory has been extremely tight. And there's been huge demands for our NBA properties. So I feel really good about advertising going into next year."

When you combine Turner's digital ad sales efforts with the subscriber and credit card data that AT&T has, what does that addressable advertisement opportunity look like? Did that accelerate it? And how does it allow you potentially to compete with Facebook and Google in digital? And then question back to HBO. Just around long-term [indiscernible] levels, you guys talked about investing significantly in HBO, programming cost being up double digits next quarter. Netflix is going to spend over $5 billion this year, Amazon probably over $3.5 billion. I think HBO is on track to spend roughly $2.2 billion this year, correct me if I'm wrong. But what's the right level of programming investment for HBO over the next couple of years? Do you need to ramp that spend more quickly? And how would the merger change that trajectory, if at all? And then -- sorry, just a quick follow-up on the merger. Maybe this is for Paul. I have a question about the reverse termination fee, the $500 million. There are some investors who think that relative to the deal value and given the regulatory risk here that the fee seems low.

And concerning that, John, you want to bring real facts to it? But remember what you've got in -- as a result of this is you're going to have more competition on the subscriber offering side about more packages and more essentially distribution alternatives for consumers. You're already seeing some new packages and even more affordable price points that are beginning to come out of this. So that's one on the subscriber side. If you go to advertising, it's very important. And John, you can fill in more. But we're developing some innovative products already at Turner that focus on data analytics, targeting and return on investment for clients, so they can really value and measure what they're doing and what the results are. If you combine the unparalleled reach and engagement of television with more ability in direct platform in terms of -- whether it's mobile, whether it's broadband delivered, that can really give you a step-up in the efficiency of advertising and the value of advertising. That has tremendous benefits for consumers because it can shift cost from subscription payment to advertising payment. It has great benefits for advertisers because it gives them more effective advertising. And it gives them more competition in advertising. I think we've all seen, and you all know this, an increasing concentration in digital advertising in just a couple of company, and it's basically good for the market, consumers and advertising clients, if we have a broader number of competitors in the ad business, particularly the digital ad business.

When you then migrate over to original programming, I've said this before, it's absolutely true. More isn't better, only better is better. We're not trying to just spend money. We're trying to spend money thoughtfully, to differentiate high-quality programming and build more consumers and build more annex across our subscriber base. I like to think that our track record is pretty good at doing that over the last decade. And I think if you look out at our programming lineup going forward, you'll see that we have every confidence that we're going to continue to do that. So I like our mix. I like our investments.

Schedules setting out reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our earnings release and trending schedules. These reconciliations are available on our website at www.timewarner.com/investors. Reconciliations of our expected future financial performance are also included in the business outlook release that is available on our website. 
Second, today's announcement includes certain forward-looking statements, which are based on management's current expectations. Actual results may vary materially from those expressed or implied by these statements due to various factors. These factors are discussed in detail on Time Warner's SEC filings, including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. Time Warner is under no obligation and, in fact, expressly disclaims any obligation to update or alter its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

That represents a premium of more than 35% over our trading price on October 19. This transaction is an excellent outcome for our shareholders and it's an excellent opportunity to drive long-term value into the future. We believe combining with AT&T is the natural next step in the evolution of our business and its one that allows us to significantly accelerate our most important strategy. We believe that putting these complementary businesses together will drive innovation and accelerate the transition of the ecosystem to more and better choices for consumers. We anticipate the transaction will close by the end of 2017, if not sooner. 
Turning to our results. We had another strong quarter, and we remain on track to exceed our original outlook. We've delivered these results while making investments to capitalize on the growing consumption of video across both traditional and new platforms all over the world, which we're confident positions us for continued industry-leading growth over the long term. 
In the quarter, our revenues grew 9% to $7.2 billion, and adjusted operating income increased 12% to $2.1 billion. And we saw growth at all our divisions. Adjusted EPS grew to $1.83 a share, and we also returned over $1 billion to shareholders in share repurchases and dividends. 
Echoing what we've seen not only through this year but also for the past several years, our performance was propelled this quarter by creative excellence from across every one of our divisions. We're in an environment where leading brands with distinctive content that engages audiences stands apart. It's also an environment of unprecedented consumer choice and control. And as we'd outlined for you before, we're committed not just to being the home to the world's best content, but to generating new revenue streams by leading the evolution of how and where content is consumed and experienced. This is where we see enormous opportunity from joining forces with AT&T because it brings us closer to consumers and allows us to go where they're going. And that is increasingly mobile, it's increasingly multi-platform, increasingly on demand, and it's increasingly through new services and packages via direct consumer relationships over broadband. 
As you've all heard from Randall Stephenson on AT&T, we're really focused on the growth opportunities of this combination. We think we can innovate new services in forms of content and experiences faster and better together, and that will benefit not just us, but all our business partners and consumers all over the world. 
If you look at our third quarter, the strength and breadth of our premium content was underscored at this year's Primetime Emmy Awards, where HBO, again, took on more awards than any other network for the 15th consecutive year. All told, across our networks and studio, Time Warner's divisions won 40 Emmys -- that's more than any other company. 
More recently, we've just seen the powerful return of the DC Entertainment-based TV slate on the CW and CNN's continued standout performance on the final stretch of the election race, and the thrilling start to HBO's newest original series, Westworld, produced by Warner Bros. More than 13 million viewers have tuned into the premiere episodes of Westworld so far, and that exceeds the first episodes of Game of Thrones and True Detective. 
In film, Warner had a terrific quarter, led by the latest DC installment, Suicide Squad and Clint Eastwood's Sully. Sully is our sixth release this year to do over $100 million in domestic box. 
At the same time, we continue to make progress on our initiatives to develop new revenue streams outside the traditional TV ecosystem. iStreamPlanet, which Turner acquired a majority stake in last year, demonstrated that power when it used this technology to make the live streaming of the Rio Olympics a reality for NBC. And Turner just debuted its first direct-to-consumer offering in the U.S., FilmStruck, that's an art house film SVOD service. 
Over at Warner's, our SVOD partnership with Tencent, Tencent Video VIP, continues to exhibit tremendous subscriber growth, and it's currently the second largest SVOD service in China. 
And HBO continues to make progress in its streaming strategy, both here and around the world. HBO NOW is building momentum while HBO's OTT business in the Nordics has shown accelerating growth. And we're on track to launch in more international territories before the end of the year. 
These are just early examples of the kinds of vibrant new services and capabilities we're working on, and we plan to accelerate these as part of AT&T. 
Now let me spend a little time highlighting what each of our divisions accomplished in the past quarter. At Turner, we've been investing in our leading portfolio of entertainment, news, sports and kids to make these brands even more engaging and essential to audiences. And those investments are driving real momentum across its businesses. During the third quarter, Turner had 3 of the top 6 ad-supported cable networks in prime time among adults 18 to 49, namely Adult Swim, TBS and TNT. And Adult Swim was the #1 ad-supported cable network in total day among adults 18 to 34 for the 34th consecutive quarter. 
At TBS and TNT, we're very encouraged by the brand refreshes underway and the distinctive programming that we've been rolling out. At TBS, Full Frontal with Samantha Bee has already overtaken The Daily Show in just its first season. And Sam has emerged as a distinctive voice this election, which is saying something, given some of the voices this election. And on Monday, we debuted People of Earth, a Warner's production and we'll follow that with Search Party, premiering November 21. 
Over TNT, the refreshes are in an earlier stage, but we're excited about Good Behavior, starring Michelle Dockery of Downton Abbey fame. And that premieres on November 15. 
And we have a very strong pipeline of originals for 2017. We also announced this quarter that TBS and TNT have reached a deal with Disney to be the cable home for the entire Canada Star Wars movies, and a similar deal with Warner Bros. for its DC theatrical types. And that's adding to an already strong movie lineup that also includes Disney's Marvel movies and the Hunger Games franchise. This aligns perfectly with the younger audiences these brands are drawing. 
Let's all turn to CNN, which continues to win over audiences with its mixture of indispensable news and election coverage, along with innovative original series. CNN was #1 news network among adults 18 to 49 in prime time for the fourth consecutive quarter. And CNN had its most watched quarter in 8 years among total viewers and among adults 25 to 54. And CNN's coverage of the second U.S. Presidential debate, co-hosted by our own Anderson Cooper, was its most-watched general election debate ever, making CNN #1 among all cable networks for that night. And CNN Digital continued its streak as the #1 news destination, outpacing all news and information competitors with more mobile unique visitors, more multi-platform views, more video starts and more video minutes than any other news outlet. 
Let's turn to HBO, which continues to raise the bar and define the word premium for our industry. As I mentioned, its 22 Primetime Emmy Awards were the most of any network for the 15th consecutive year. And they included Outstanding Drama Series for Game of Thrones, Outstanding Comedy Series for Veep, Outstanding Variety Talk Series for Last Week Tonight with John Oliver. In fact, Game of Thrones received 12 awards and has now earned 38 Emmys, more than any single scripted series in television history. Never one to rest on its laurels, HBO is aggressively expanding its contents as well for. In addition to Westworld, it recently introduced Insecure, High Maintenance, Divorce and the new nightly newscast from Vice.
What you're seeing at HBO is our ongoing strategy to provide consumers with a steady flow of the very best content in order to drive demand across both traditional distributors and with HBO NOW. 
Speaking of NOW, we remain very pleased with its progress. And in late September, we further expanded its reach with the announcement that HBO NOW, along with HBO and Cinemax, are now available on Sony's PlayStation platforms. 
Looking at Warner Bros.' strong performance during the quarter underscores its global leadership position in the production of film and television, and it remains on track for another record year. 
Our theatrical business is setting the pace with a number of standout performers over the last few months, including The Conjuring 2, Central Intelligence, The Legend of Tarzan and Lights Out. But our blockbuster for the quarter for us was Suicide Squad, which not only had the biggest August opening ever, but it's gone on to generate nearly $750 million in worldwide box office. 
And that's just the most recent example of how we're tapping growing potential of our DC Entertainment IP. We've only just begun our ambitious slate for DC theatrically. Next year's much anticipated releases include Wonder Woman and Justice League as well as Lego Batman, a fun feature that builds on the franchise we started with 2014's hit, The Lego Movie. 
We also have an unprecedented 10 television series airing this season based on DC characters, with DC's TV business now generating more than $1 billion a year in revenue going up. 
And I want to highlight the excitement we're seeing for these iconic brands digitally in consumer products and even in print. Our DC Super Hero Girls partnership with Mattel has action figures flying off the shelves. And since May, DC has shipped a record 18 million comic books based on the new Rebirth series concept, spearheaded by Geoff Johns, the renowned comic book writer here who knows how to pronounce it, who's also actively helping shape our DC films. 
In the near term, we're very excited about Fantastic Beasts, a brand new story based on The Wizarding World of Harry Potter that we think will be a global hit, not just at the box office, but in consumer products and across all platforms. 
Jo Rowling has already written a script for the second film that's set for release on November 16, 2018, and the third will follow in 2020. And as Jo herself recently announced, the story is so rich that she now plans to tell it in 5 films, giving fans even more to look forward to. 
Warner's great franchises like DC, The Wizarding World of Harry Potter, Looney Tunes, Hanna-Barbera, are also the driving force behind our consumer products business, which is also enjoying a record year. 
As we continue to roll out our franchise films and develop more kids' content as part of the kids friendship between Warner and Turner, we think this business can be an important growth driver going forward. 
You can see we're heading into the fourth quarter with a lot of momentum. And as I said upfront, we positioned ourselves to benefit from the growing opportunities we see worldwide for the best video content. We're moving aggressively to strengthen our position within the traditional ecosystem, while also building new revenue streams outside of it. 
As we look at the fourth quarter of 2016 and beyond, we remain very confident about our ability to continue to execute on our plans. And we're even more excited about what we can accomplish given the combination with AT&T and what that will enable us to do as one company, uniquely focused on delivering great content and a great consumer experience across platforms. 
Thanks for listening. Let me turn it over to Howard."

I'll begin by referring to the first slide of our presentation, which is now available on our website. 
Starting with consolidated results. We had another great quarter with growth across all of our businesses, fueled by the positive trends we've seen throughout the year. And we feel very good about how we're positioned to close out 2016 and as we head into 2017. 
In the third quarter, revenues were up 9% and adjusted operating income grew a very strong 12% to a quarterly record of $2.1 billion. Margins expanded about 100 basis points in the quarter despite continuing investments across the company in content and digital initiatives. That was partly due to limiting growth in SG&A to the low single digits. 
Adjusted EPS was up 46% to $1.83 and included a $0.28 net tax benefit related to a tax accounting method change. Excluding the tax benefit, adjusted EPS would have increased a healthy 24% to $1.55 as we benefited from great operating results, a lower effective tax rate and fewer shares outstanding as a result of our share repurchase program. 
During the third quarter, we repurchased over $700 million of our shares and paid $315 million in dividends. And year-to-date, we've returned nearly $3.3 billion to shareholders. 
So we're very pleased with our strong operational performance so far this year and when combined with the tax benefit, we raised our outlook for 2016 adjusted EPS to $5.73 to $5.83 or $5.45 to $5.55 when excluding the $0.28 tax benefit I just mentioned. I'll touch more on our outlook throughout my presentation. 
Now turning to the segment highlights. I'll start at Turner, where our revenue trends remain robust and translated into solid double-digit growth in adjusted operating income. 
Subscription revenues increased 12% in the quarter, and that included 100 basis points of FX headwinds. Domestic subscription revenues grew 15% as we continued to benefit from the rate increases we achieved during our affiliate renewal cycle. That puts us right on track to deliver the growth for the year we've discussed with you. And we expect another year of solid double-digit growth in 2017. International subscription revenue was up in the low single digits, and that included a more than 5 percentage points drag from FX. 
Advertising revenue was up 2%, in line with our expectations coming into the quarter, and that included about 100 basis points of negative impact from FX. Domestic advertising increased from the low single digits, led by solid double-digit growth across our linear and digital news properties. That was somewhat balanced by the impact of our decision to air significantly less original programming at our domestic entertainment networks, in part to avoid competing with the Olympics. International advertising was essentially flat in the quarter, but up high single digits when excluding an 8 percentage point FX drag. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect total advertising revenue growth to be approximately flat. The scatter market remains healthy with pricing at our domestic entertainment networks pacing up double digits already upfront. 
At the same time, we face very difficult comparisons to last year's record Major League Baseball playoff performance, and we aired 3 fewer playoff games this year. 
We'll also have fewer hours of original programming as the content refresh at TNT will accelerate more in 2017. And based on current rates, we expect FX to have a similar impact as in the third quarter. 
Moving on. Content and other revenues were up 33% in the quarter. That reflects higher international licensing revenues as we're seeing healthy demand for our original programming abroad. 
Adjusted operating income was up 12% in the quarter, and margins expanded 140 basis points. That was despite higher programming costs, which increased 5%, mainly reflecting CNN's election coverage. 
So Turner's executing really well and is on track to deliver another year of strong growth in adjusted operating income. And we think the investments we're making in great content as part of the TNT and TBS re-brands as well as the new capabilities and businesses position Turner to carry this momentum into 2017 and beyond. 
Turning now to HBO, where we continue to invest in the business and lay the groundwork for accelerating revenue trends over the next few years. Consistent with the first half of the year, domestic subscription revenue grew in the mid-single digits. We continue to see a sequential increase in the contribution from HBO NOW as we benefit from the strong subscriber growth so far this year. 
On the other hand, similar to the last couple of years, we continue to experience headwinds related to subscriber mix. 
Looking ahead, we expect HBO subscription revenue growth to accelerate in the fourth quarter and in 2017. We're currently in the midst of our affiliate renewals, so the timing of when deals close and their implementations will determine the pace of the acceleration. 
Content and other revenues were down slightly in the quarter. Last year's quarter included the domestic licensing of a library series, and that was mostly offset by increased international licensing revenue as the global demand for our original programming remains robust. 
Across HBO's international networks, including unconsolidated JVs, revenues, once again, were up double digits when excluding FX, and that primarily reflects continued positive trend in LatAm and the Nordics. 
Adjusted operating income was up 2% in the quarter as programming cost increased mid-teens. That reflected investments in new original series like The Night Of and Vice Principals as well as the timing of theatrical availabilities. 
Overall, we're very pleased with the performance of HBO's programming lineup and excited about the strong pipeline of new series slated for the next few years. And we're confident the investments we're making in the business and the robust consumer demand premium content around the world will contribute a significant growth in the years to come. 
Moving on to Warner Bros., where despite difficult comparisons in TV and video games, we delivered strong results with revenue up 7% and adjusted operating income increasing 12%. Warner's theatrical business led the way, with revenues growing a robust 45% as we benefit from the great box office performance of our film slate. That included our most recent franchise release, Suicide Squad, which has grossed close to $750 million at the global box office. 
The diversity of our slate was also on display this quarter with the success of Sully, The Legend of Tarzan and the most recent release in our very profitable horror slate, Lights Out. 
In television, we faced difficult licensing comparisons due to the syndication of 2 Broke Girls and Person of Interest in last year's quarter. However, TV revenues only declined modestly as Warner's benefited from increased production with the start of the new TV season, including Warner's continued expansion in cable with shows like Westworld on HBO and Animal Kingdom on TNT. 
Across theatrical and TV, home entertainment revenues were flat in the quarter. Digital trends remain encouraging though, with ESP revenue up 25%. And we expect improved revenue trends as our strong theatrical slate continues to move into the home entertainment window over the next few quarters. 
So Warner Bros. has great momentum and is on pace for another record year in adjusted operating income. And the initial success of this year's franchise movies gives us even more confidence in the exciting franchise-led slate we have for the next several years. So combined with the attractive growth opportunities in TV and games, Warner's is well positioned to continue delivering solid financial results over the long term. 
Turning to the next slide. Free cash flow totaled $3.3 billion through the third quarter. That's up 15% from a year ago, largely due to the growth in adjusted operating income. Year-to-date, working capital has improved due to the CME refinancing payment we received in the second quarter. So we remain on track for another year of very healthy free cash flow in 2016. 
Now looking at our balance sheet. We ended the third quarter with $22 billion of net debt. Looking forward, as we move through the approval process for the AT&T transaction, we expect to continue to pay our regular quarterly dividend. However, we have discontinued repurchasing our stock. 
We've done about $750 million year-to-date in M&A, largely related to the investment in Hulu in August. 
Our net leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was just above our target leverage ratio of 2.75x, and we expect to end the year slightly below that target as a result of discontinuing share repurchases. 
With that, let's move on to the final slide, which looks at our outlook for 2016. We're very pleased with how we're operating across the company and with our solid financial performance year-to-date. And that's reflected in our outlook for adjusted EPS for 2016, which we increased to $5.73 to $5.83, or $5.45 to $5.55 when excluding the $0.28 tax benefit we recognized this quarter. The midpoint of that range implies mid-teens growth in adjusted EPS, putting us on track for our eighth consecutive year of double-digit earnings growth. 
Looking at the fourth quarter. We expect Warner's to be the primary growth driver, led by its strong theatrical slate, including the first installment in the Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them franchises. 
Meanwhile, we continue to invest significantly in programming across our networks. HBO already premiered 4 new original programs in the fourth quarter. And at Turner, our new NBA contract at TNT kicks in, and CNN will continue to have elevated cost related to its election coverage. So we expect programming cost at both HBO and Turner to be up double digits in the fourth quarter when excluding last year's programming charges. 
In addition, we anticipate our effective tax rate will be in the low 30% range, and we expect that to be a sustainable level going forward. 
Overall, we have great operating momentum across our businesses. And we think the investments we're making, both inside and outside the traditional TV ecosystem, we're very well positioned to continue this momentum and deliver strong financial results for many years to come. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Jessica to start the Q&A."

And obviously, CNN is just killing it this year and it's going to have a great year next year. And in terms of advertising, we're still in the very early stages of essentially nothing short of reinventing the ad model for TV. But the early, early examples that we've done, because we have done limited commercials in some of the new originals, is we are seeing some really positive results. We're seeing -- because of TV's unparalleled reach in engagement, we're seeing advertiser response has been extremely positive. We're seeing improved ratings because there's less dislocation going into the advertising pod and coming out. And we've seen higher consumer satisfaction and higher brand recall.

Richard, you recently spoke at an industry conference and I think you indicated that the new AT&T, DIRECTV deal that you had signed enables far more flexible or unique packaging than you've had in the past. And I think you even talked about how HBO NOW could be bundled in with wireless only bundles and this was even before the AT&T transaction was announced. Just wondering how do you think about those opportunities of what you've laid out in the new AT&T deal on the programming side or packaging side and how that impacts your sub revenue growth going forward. And then I have a question on the deal for after."

And it's one of the reasons why our programming costs will accelerate in the fourth quarter. Just to take a half a step back though. We've been saying for a number of years that at Turner, our goal and our full expectation is to be able to manage our overall programming cost growth to be no higher than the high single digits over a multi-year period. It's been lower than that over the last several years. Next year, principally because of the NBA rights renewal, we expect programming cost to accelerate and will likely be double digits. But that's not going to be a sustainable trend. They'll moderate then after that. And I think, yes, the way that the rights fees work, there'll be a disproportionate amount recognized in the latter part of the season. With regard to revenue opportunities, this deal is giving us more games. We're launching a Monday night franchise as a result of that. We have more digital rights. We're working really collaboratively with the NBA to try to dramatically accelerate the digital part of the business and digital profits as we continue to see more and more consumption happening on NBA digital. So we -- and by the way, just in the current environment, we're very pleased with how the season has started, with what ratings look like and inventory has been extremely tight. And there's been huge demands for our NBA properties. So I feel really good about advertising going into next year."

And how does it allow you potentially to compete with Facebook and Google in digital? And then question back to HBO. Just around long-term investment levels, you guys talked about investing significantly in HBO, programming costs being up double digits next quarter. Netflix is going to spend over $5 billion this year, Amazon probably over $3.5 billion. I think HBO is on track to spend roughly $2.2 billion this year, correct me if I'm wrong. But what's the right level of programming investment for HBO over the next couple of years? Do you need to ramp that spend more quickly? And how would the merger change that trajectory, if at all? And then -- sorry, just a quick follow-up on the merger. Maybe this is for Paul. I have a question about the reverse termination fee, the $500 million.

You're already seeing some new packages and even more affordable price points that are beginning to come out of this. So that's one on the subscriber side. If you go to advertising, it's very important. And John, you can fill in more. But we're developing some innovative products already at Turner that focus on data analytics, targeting and return on investment for clients, so they can really value and measure what they're doing and what the results are. If you combine the unparalleled reach and engagement of television with more ability in direct platform in terms of -- whether it's mobile, whether it's broadband delivered, that can really give you a step-up in the efficiency of advertising and the value of advertising. That has tremendous benefit for consumers because it can shift cost from subscription payment to advertising payment. It has great benefits for advertisers because it gives them more effective advertising. And it gives them more competition in advertising. I think we've all seen, and you all know this, an increasing concentration in digital advertising in just a couple of companies, and it's basically good for the market, consumers and advertising clients if we have a broader number of competitors in the ad business, particularly the digital ad business.

When you then migrate over to original programming, I've said this before, it's absolutely true. More isn't better, only better is better. We're not trying to just spend money. We're trying to spend money thoughtfully, to differentiate high-quality programming and build more consumers and build more annex across our subscriber base.

Schedules setting out reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our earnings release and trending schedules. These reconciliations are available on our website at www.timewarner.com/investors.

Second, today's announcement includes certain forward-looking statements, which are based on management's current expectations. Actual results may vary materially from those expressed or implied by these statements due to various factors. These factors are discussed in detail on Time Warner's SEC filings, including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. Time Warner is under no obligation and, in fact, expressly disclaims any obligation to update or alter its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

As you know, on October 22, we announced our agreement to be acquired by AT&T for $107.50 per share of Time Warner, and that will be half in cash and half in AT&T stock. That represents a premium of more than 35% over our trading price on October 19. This transaction is an excellent outcome for our shareholders and it's an excellent opportunity to drive long-term value into the future. We believe combining with AT&T is the natural next step in the evolution of our business and its one that allows us to significantly accelerate our most important strategy. We believe that putting these complementary businesses together will drive innovation and accelerate the transition of the ecosystem to more and better choices for consumers. We anticipate the transaction will close by the end of 2017, if not sooner. 
Turning to our results. We had another strong quarter, and we remain on track to exceed our original outlook. We've delivered these results while making investments to capitalize on the growing consumption of video across both traditional and new platforms all over the world, which we're confident positions us for continued industry-leading growth over the long term. 
In the quarter, our revenues grew 9% to $7.2 billion, and adjusted operating income increased 12% to $2.1 billion. And we saw growth at all our divisions. Adjusted EPS grew to $1.83 a share, and we also returned over $1 billion to shareholders in share repurchases and dividends. 
Echoing what we've seen not only through this year but also for the past several years, our performance was propelled this quarter by creative excellence from across every one of our divisions. We're in an environment where leading brands with distinctive content that engages audiences stands apart. It's also an environment of unprecedented consumer choice and control. And as we'd outlined for you before, we're committed not just to being the home to the world's best content, but to generating new revenue streams by leading the evolution of how and where content is consumed and experienced. This is where we see enormous opportunity from joining forces with AT&T because it brings us closer to consumers and allows us to go where they're going. And that is increasingly mobile, it's increasingly multi-platform, increasingly on demand, and it's increasingly through new services and packages via direct consumer relationships over broadband. 
As you've all heard from Randall Stephenson on AT&T, we're really focused on the growth opportunities of this combination. We think we can innovate new services in forms of content and experiences faster and better together, and that will benefit not just us, but all our business partners and consumers all over the world. 
If you look at our third quarter, the strength and breadth of our premium content was underscored at this year's Primetime Emmy Awards, where HBO, again, took on more awards than any other network for the 15th consecutive year. All told, across our networks and studio, Time Warner's divisions won 40 Emmys -- that's more than any other company. 
More recently, we've just seen the powerful return of the DC Entertainment-based TV slate on the CW and CNN's continued standout performance on the final stretch of the election race, and the thrilling start to HBO's newest original series, Westworld, produced by Warner Bros. More than 13 million viewers have tuned into the premiere episodes of Westworld so far, and that exceeds the first episodes of Game of Thrones and True Detective. 
In film, Warner had a terrific quarter, led by the latest DC installment, Suicide Squad and Clint Eastwood's Sully. Sully is our sixth release this year to do over $100 million in domestic box. 
At the same time, we continue to make progress on our initiatives to develop new revenue streams outside the traditional TV ecosystem. iStreamPlanet, which Turner acquired a majority stake in last year, demonstrated that power when it used this technology to make the live streaming of the Rio Olympics a reality for NBC. And Turner just debuted its first direct-to-consumer offering in the U.S., FilmStruck, that's an art house film SVOD service. 
Over at Warner's, our SVOD partnership with Tencent, Tencent Video VIP, continues to exhibit tremendous subscriber growth, and it's currently the second largest SVOD service in China. 
And HBO continues to make progress in its streaming strategy, both here and around the world. HBO NOW is building momentum while HBO's OTT business in the Nordics has shown accelerating growth. And we're on track to launch in more international territories before the end of the year. 
These are just early examples of the kinds of vibrant new services and capabilities we're working on, and we plan to accelerate these as part of AT&T. 
Now let me spend a little time highlighting what each of our divisions accomplished in the past quarter. At Turner, we've been investing in our leading portfolio of entertainment, news, sports and kids to make these brands even more engaging and essential to audiences. And those investments are driving real momentum across its businesses. During the third quarter, Turner had 3 of the top 6 ad-supported cable networks in prime time among adults 18 to 49, namely Adult Swim, TBS and TNT. And Adult Swim was the #1 ad-supported cable network in total day among adults 18 to 34 for the 34th consecutive quarter. 
At TBS and TNT, we're very encouraged by the brand refreshes underway and the distinctive programming that we've been rolling out. At TBS, Full Frontal with Samantha Bee has already overtaken The Daily Show in just its first season. And Sam has emerged as a distinctive voice this election, which is saying something, given some of the voices this election. And on Monday, we debuted People of Earth, a Warner's production and we'll follow that with Search Party, premiering November 21. 
Over TNT, the refreshes are in an earlier stage, but we're excited about Good Behavior, starring Michelle Dockery of Downton Abbey fame. And that premieres on November 15. 
And we have a very strong pipeline of originals for 2017. We also announced this quarter that TBS and TNT have reached a deal with Disney to be the cable home for the entire Canada Star Wars movies, and a similar deal with Warner Bros. for its DC theatrical types. And that's adding to an already strong movie lineup that also includes Disney's Marvel movies and the Hunger Games franchise. This aligns perfectly with the younger audiences these brands are drawing. 
Let's all turn to CNN, which continues to win over audiences with its mixture of indispensable news and election coverage, along with innovative original series. CNN was #1 news network among adults 18 to 49 in prime time for the fourth consecutive quarter. And CNN had its most watched quarter in 8 years among total viewers and among adults 25 to 54. And CNN's coverage of the second U.S. Presidential debate, co-hosted by our own Anderson Cooper, was its most-watched general election debate ever, making CNN #1 among all cable networks for that night. And CNN Digital continued its streak as the #1 news destination, outpacing all news and information competitors with more mobile unique visitors, more multi-platform views, more video starts and more video minutes than any other news outlet. 
Let's turn to HBO, which continues to raise the bar and define the word premium for our industry. As I mentioned, its 22 Primetime Emmy Awards were the most of any network for the 15th consecutive year. And they included Outstanding Drama Series for Game of Thrones, Outstanding Comedy Series for Veep, Outstanding Variety Talk Series for Last Week Tonight with John Oliver. In fact, Game of Thrones received 12 awards and has now earned 38 Emmys, more than any single scripted series in television history. Never one to rest on its laurels, HBO is aggressively expanding its contents as well for. In addition to Westworld, it recently introduced Insecure, High Maintenance, Divorce and the new nightly newscast from Vice.
What you're seeing at HBO is our ongoing strategy to provide consumers with a steady flow of the very best content in order to drive demand across both traditional distributors and with HBO NOW. 
Speaking of NOW, we remain very pleased with its progress. And in late September, we further expanded its reach with the announcement that HBO NOW, along with HBO and Cinemax, are now available on Sony's PlayStation platforms. 
Looking at Warner Bros.' strong performance during the quarter underscores its global leadership position in the production of film and television, and it remains on track for another record year. 
Our theatrical business is setting the pace with a number of standout performers over the last few months, including The Conjuring 2, Central Intelligence, The Legend of Tarzan and Lights Out. But our blockbuster for the quarter for us was Suicide Squad, which not only had the biggest August opening ever, but it's gone on to generate nearly $750 million in worldwide box office. 
And that's just the most recent example of how we're tapping growing potential of our DC Entertainment IP. We've only just begun our ambitious slate for DC theatrically. Next year's much anticipated releases include Wonder Woman and Justice League as well as Lego Batman, a fun feature that builds on the franchise we started with 2014's hit, The Lego Movie. 
We also have an unprecedented 10 television series airing this season based on DC characters, with DC's TV business now generating more than $1 billion a year in revenue going up. 
And I want to highlight the excitement we're seeing for these iconic brands digitally in consumer products and even in print. Our DC Super Hero Girls partnership with Mattel has action figures flying off the shelves. And since May, DC has shipped a record 18 million comic books based on the new Rebirth series concept, spearheaded by Geoff Johns, the renowned comic book writer here who knows how to pronounce it, who's also actively helping shape our DC films. 
In the near term, we're very excited about Fantastic Beasts, a brand new story based on The Wizarding World of Harry Potter that we think will be a global hit, not just at the box office, but in consumer products and across all platforms. 
Jo Rowling has already written a script for the second film that's set for release on November 16, 2018, and the third will follow in 2020. And as Jo herself recently announced, the story is so rich that she now plans to tell it in 5 films, giving fans even more to look forward to. 
Warner's great franchises like DC, The Wizarding World of Harry Potter, Looney Tunes, Hanna-Barbera, are also the driving force behind our consumer products business, which is also enjoying a record year. 
As we continue to roll out our franchise films and develop more kids' content as part of the kids friendship between Warner and Turner, we think this business can be an important growth driver going forward. 
You can see we're heading into the fourth quarter with a lot of momentum. And as I said upfront, we positioned ourselves to benefit from the growing opportunities we see worldwide for the best video content. We're moving aggressively to strengthen our position within the traditional ecosystem, while also building new revenue streams outside of it. 
As we look at the fourth quarter of 2016 and beyond, we remain very confident about our ability to continue to execute on our plans. And we're even more excited about what we can accomplish given the combination with AT&T and what that will enable us to do as one company, uniquely focused on delivering great content and a great consumer experience across platforms. 
Thanks for listening. Let me turn it over to Howard."
24689,402468348,1072370,"Time Warner Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2016",2016-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Warner Media, LLC","Executives","Thanks, Jeff, and good morning.

We had another great quarter with growth across all of our businesses, fueled by t",1698,"Thanks, Jeff, and good morning. I'll begin by referring to the first slide of our presentation, which is now available on our website. 
Starting with consolidated results. We had another great quarter with growth across all of our businesses, fueled by the positive trends we've seen throughout the year. And we feel very good about how we're positioned to close out 2016 and as we head into 2017. 
In the third quarter, revenues were up 9% and adjusted operating income grew a very strong 12% to a quarterly record of $2.1 billion. Margins expanded about 100 basis points in the quarter despite continuing investments across the company in content and digital initiatives. That was partly due to limiting growth in SG&A to the low single digits. 
Adjusted EPS was up 46% to $1.83 and included a $0.28 net tax benefit related to a tax accounting method change. Excluding the tax benefit, adjusted EPS would have increased a healthy 24% to $1.55 as we benefited from great operating results, a lower effective tax rate and fewer shares outstanding as a result of our share repurchase program. 
During the third quarter, we repurchased over $700 million of our shares and paid $315 million in dividends. And year-to-date, we've returned nearly $3.3 billion to shareholders. 
So we're very pleased with our strong operational performance so far this year and when combined with the tax benefit, we raised our outlook for 2016 adjusted EPS to $5.73 to $5.83 or $5.45 to $5.55 when excluding the $0.28 tax benefit I just mentioned. I'll touch more on our outlook throughout my presentation. 
Now turning to the segment highlights. I'll start at Turner, where our revenue trends remain robust and translated into solid double-digit growth in adjusted operating income. 
Subscription revenues increased 12% in the quarter, and that included 100 basis points of FX headwinds. Domestic subscription revenues grew 15% as we continued to benefit from the rate increases we achieved during our affiliate renewal cycle. That puts us right on track to deliver the growth for the year we've discussed with you. And we expect another year of solid double-digit growth in 2017. International subscription revenue was up in the low single digits, and that included a more than 5 percentage points drag from FX. 
Advertising revenue was up 2%, in line with our expectations coming into the quarter, and that included about 100 basis points of negative impact from FX. Domestic advertising increased from the low single digits, led by solid double-digit growth across our linear and digital news properties. That was somewhat balanced by the impact of our decision to air significantly less original programming at our domestic entertainment networks, in part to avoid competing with the Olympics. International advertising was essentially flat in the quarter, but up high single digits when excluding an 8 percentage point FX drag. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect total advertising revenue growth to be approximately flat. The scatter market remains healthy with pricing at our domestic entertainment networks pacing up double digits already upfront. 
At the same time, we face very difficult comparisons to last year's record Major League Baseball playoff performance, and we aired 3 fewer playoff games this year. 
We'll also have fewer hours of original programming as the content refresh at TNT will accelerate more in 2017. And based on current rates, we expect FX to have a similar impact as in the third quarter. 
Moving on. Content and other revenues were up 33% in the quarter. That reflects higher international licensing revenues as we're seeing healthy demand for our original programming abroad. 
Adjusted operating income was up 12% in the quarter, and margins expanded 140 basis points. That was despite higher programming costs, which increased 5%, mainly reflecting CNN's election coverage. 
So Turner's executing really well and is on track to deliver another year of strong growth in adjusted operating income. And we think the investments we're making in great content as part of the TNT and TBS re-brands as well as the new capabilities and businesses position Turner to carry this momentum into 2017 and beyond. 
Turning now to HBO, where we continue to invest in the business and lay the groundwork for accelerating revenue trends over the next few years. Consistent with the first half of the year, domestic subscription revenue grew in the mid-single digits. We continue to see a sequential increase in the contribution from HBO NOW as we benefit from the strong subscriber growth so far this year. 
On the other hand, similar to the last couple of years, we continue to experience headwinds related to subscriber mix. 
Looking ahead, we expect HBO subscription revenue growth to accelerate in the fourth quarter and in 2017. We're currently in the midst of our affiliate renewals, so the timing of when deals close and their implementations will determine the pace of the acceleration. 
Content and other revenues were down slightly in the quarter. Last year's quarter included the domestic licensing of a library series, and that was mostly offset by increased international licensing revenue as the global demand for our original programming remains robust. 
Across HBO's international networks, including unconsolidated JVs, revenues, once again, were up double digits when excluding FX, and that primarily reflects continued positive trend in LatAm and the Nordics. 
Adjusted operating income was up 2% in the quarter as programming cost increased mid-teens. That reflected investments in new original series like The Night Of and Vice Principals as well as the timing of theatrical availabilities. 
Overall, we're very pleased with the performance of HBO's programming lineup and excited about the strong pipeline of new series slated for the next few years. And we're confident the investments we're making in the business and the robust consumer demand premium content around the world will contribute a significant growth in the years to come. 
Moving on to Warner Bros., where despite difficult comparisons in TV and video games, we delivered strong results with revenue up 7% and adjusted operating income increasing 12%. Warner's theatrical business led the way, with revenues growing a robust 45% as we benefit from the great box office performance of our film slate. That included our most recent franchise release, Suicide Squad, which has grossed close to $750 million at the global box office. 
The diversity of our slate was also on display this quarter with the success of Sully, The Legend of Tarzan and the most recent release in our very profitable horror slate, Lights Out. 
In television, we faced difficult licensing comparisons due to the syndication of 2 Broke Girls and Person of Interest in last year's quarter. However, TV revenues only declined modestly as Warner's benefited from increased production with the start of the new TV season, including Warner's continued expansion in cable with shows like Westworld on HBO and Animal Kingdom on TNT. 
Across theatrical and TV, home entertainment revenues were flat in the quarter. Digital trends remain encouraging though, with ESP revenue up 25%. And we expect improved revenue trends as our strong theatrical slate continues to move into the home entertainment window over the next few quarters. 
So Warner Bros. has great momentum and is on pace for another record year in adjusted operating income. And the initial success of this year's franchise movies gives us even more confidence in the exciting franchise-led slate we have for the next several years. So combined with the attractive growth opportunities in TV and games, Warner's is well positioned to continue delivering solid financial results over the long term. 
Turning to the next slide. Free cash flow totaled $3.3 billion through the third quarter. That's up 15% from a year ago, largely due to the growth in adjusted operating income. Year-to-date, working capital has improved due to the CME refinancing payment we received in the second quarter. So we remain on track for another year of very healthy free cash flow in 2016. 
Now looking at our balance sheet. We ended the third quarter with $22 billion of net debt. Looking forward, as we move through the approval process for the AT&T transaction, we expect to continue to pay our regular quarterly dividend. However, we have discontinued repurchasing our stock. 
We've done about $750 million year-to-date in M&A, largely related to the investment in Hulu in August. 
Our net leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was just above our target leverage ratio of 2.75x, and we expect to end the year slightly below that target as a result of discontinuing share repurchases. 
With that, let's move on to the final slide, which looks at our outlook for 2016. We're very pleased with how we're operating across the company and with our solid financial performance year-to-date. And that's reflected in our outlook for adjusted EPS for 2016, which we increased to $5.73 to $5.83, or $5.45 to $5.55 when excluding the $0.28 tax benefit we recognized this quarter. The midpoint of that range implies mid-teens growth in adjusted EPS, putting us on track for our eighth consecutive year of double-digit earnings growth. 
Looking at the fourth quarter. We expect Warner's to be the primary growth driver, led by its strong theatrical slate, including the first installment in the Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them franchises. 
Meanwhile, we continue to invest significantly in programming across our networks. HBO already premiered 4 new original programs in the fourth quarter. And at Turner, our new NBA contract at TNT kicks in, and CNN will continue to have elevated cost related to its election coverage. So we expect programming cost at both HBO and Turner to be up double digits in the fourth quarter when excluding last year's programming charges. 
In addition, we anticipate our effective tax rate will be in the low 30% range, and we expect that to be a sustainable level going forward. 
Overall, we have great operating momentum across our businesses. And we think the investments we're making, both inside and outside the traditional TV ecosystem, we're very well positioned to continue this momentum and deliver strong financial results for many years to come. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Jessica to start the Q&A."

And obviously, CNN is just killing it this year and it's going to have a great year next year. And in terms of advertising, we're still in the very early stages of essentially nothing short of reinventing the ad model for TV. But the early, early examples that we've done, because we have done limited commercials in some of the new originals, is we are seeing some really positive results. We're seeing -- because of TV's unparalleled reach in engagement, we're seeing advertiser response has been extremely positive. We're seeing improved ratings because there's less dislocation going into the advertising pod and coming out. And we've seen higher consumer satisfaction and higher brand recall.

And it's one of the reasons why our programming costs will accelerate in the fourth quarter. Just to take a half a step back though. We've been saying for a number of years that at Turner, our goal and our full expectation is to be able to manage our overall programming cost growth to be no higher than the high single digits over a multi-year period. It's been lower than that over the last several years. Next year, principally because of the NBA rights renewal, we expect programming cost to accelerate and will likely be double digits. But that's not going to be a sustainable trend. They'll moderate then after that. And I think, yes, the way that the rights fees work, there'll be a disproportionate amount recognized in the latter part of the season. With regard to revenue opportunities, this deal is giving us more games. We're launching a Monday night franchise as a result of that. We have more digital rights. We're working really collaboratively with the NBA to try to dramatically accelerate the digital part of the business and digital profits as we continue to see more and more consumption happening on NBA digital. So we -- and by the way, just in the current environment, we're very pleased with how the season has started, with what ratings look like and inventory has been extremely tight.

Just around long-term investment levels, you guys talked about investing significantly in HBO, programming costs being up double digits next quarter. Netflix is going to spend over $5 billion this year, Amazon probably over $3.5 billion. I think HBO is on track to spend roughly $2.2 billion this year, correct me if I'm wrong.

But we're developing some innovative products already at Turner that focus on data analytics, targeting and return on investment for clients, so they can really value and measure what they're doing and what the results are. If you combine the unparalleled reach and engagement of television with more ability in direct platform in terms of -- whether it's mobile, whether it's broadband delivered, that can really give you a step-up in the efficiency of advertising and the value of advertising. That has tremendous benefit for consumers because it can shift cost from subscription payment to advertising payment. It has great benefits for advertisers because it gives them more effective advertising. And it gives them more competition in advertising.
