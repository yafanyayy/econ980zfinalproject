I'd like to make a few opening comments before Gino takes us through the results and outlook. But first, Q4 was actually a good quarter in terms of margin expansion and cash flow generation. Managed and Support Services grew 7% adjusted for currency and North America also outperformed our expectations against the difficult prior-year compare, and we saw solid growth in Asia-Pac. Second, when I think of the full year, 2015 was a year of transformation and achievement that positions us well going forward. We delivered $830 million of free cash flow, took out over $210 million of operating costs, returned $3.5 billion in capital to shareholders, increased our quarterly dividend by 21% and improved the efficiency of our capital structure. And finally, last Friday, we announced the close of the Airwave acquisition, which is a strong and important addition to our Services franchise. Airwave owns and operates one of the largest Public Safety radio networks in the world and will provide a platform to expand our Managed Services business on a global basis. This business has significant Managed Services infrastructure and operational assets that could be leveraged for future growth opportunities in this space. The addition of Airwave increases our recurring revenue streams by 50%, adds geographic diversification, delivers another source of robust free cash flow and the transaction is cash and earnings accretive in year 1. 
I'll now turn the call over to Gino to provide additional details on Q4 results and outlook before returning to provide some closing thoughts."

Key Q4 highlights include revenue of $1.7 billion, down 8% versus last year and down 5% in constant currency.

Key Q4 highlights include revenue of $1.7 billion, down 8% versus last year and down 5% in constant currency. The primary drivers of the decline were currency and economic headwinds in Latin America and Eastern Europe. In addition, the Norway nationwide network transition from systems integration to Managed Services contributed to lower revenue. Ending backlog was up $698 million versus last year and up $486 million sequentially. Multiyear managed and support contracts continue to drive backlog growth. 
GAAP operating earnings were $389 million. Non-GAAP operating earnings were $458 million or 27% of sales, representing a 70 basis point improvement from the prior year. GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.56 compared to a loss of $4.02 in the fourth quarter of 2014 due to pension restructuring. Non-EPS -- non-GAAP EPS of $1.58 was up 26% year-over-year. The EPS growth was driven primarily by cost reductions and lower share count due to repurchases. For the remainder of the call, we will reference non-GAAP financial measures, including those in our outlook, unless otherwise noted. 
For the full year, revenue declined 3%, but was flat in constant currency. EBITDA grew 6% to $1.3 billion. Operating earnings increased 230 basis points to 20.5% of sales. Earnings per share grew 29% to $3.33 per share. Free cash flow was $830 million and free cash flow per share was $4.11, which has grown double digits since operation in 2011. 
Moving to Product segment results for the quarter. Q4 product sales were $1.1 billion, down 10% versus the prior year and down 7% in constant currency. The decline is attributable primarily to FX and economic headwinds in Latin America and Eastern Europe. Q4 product operating income was $340 million or 30% of sales. Ending Product segment backlog was $1.2 billion, up $40 million versus last year. The year-over-year backlog increase reflects growth in Asia-Pac, the Middle East and North America, offset by declines in Europe and Latin America. 
Turning to Services. Q4 Services revenue was $557 million, down 3%. Excluding currency impact in iDEN, the Services business grew 2%. Managed and Support Services grew 7% in constant currency, with growth in every region. Services operating income was $118 million or 21% of revenue, up 21 -- $29 million from last year. Services operating margin were up 580 basis points, an improved gross margin and OpEx reductions. As expected, margin improvement was driven by the completion of several large systems installation, including the Norway project. Services backlog ended at $5.2 billion, up $658 million versus last year and up $601 million sequentially. Customers continue to sign long-term Services contract to upgrade, maintain and manage their networks. $340 million of this backlog increase was driven by a recent Public Safety LTE contract win in the United Kingdom. Backlog was up solidly in all regions, except Latin America. 
Moving to Q4 operating expenses. Total OpEx from continuing operations was $386 million, down $45 million or 10% from the year-ago quarter, driven primarily by continued cost-reduction activities and a stronger dollar. For the year, OpEx is down $212 million or 12%. The largest drivers of the decline include employee reductions in G&A, pension expense and favorability from currency. We have now taken out over $550 million of OpEx in the last 3 years. Q4 other income and expense was up $12 million to $51 million compared to the year-ago quarter. The increase was due to additional interest expense. 
Looking at taxes. The Q4 effective tax rate was 31%. Full year 2015 effective tax rate was 33%. Our cash tax rate was 11% for 2015, and we continue to expect our cash tax rate to remain at approximately 15% through 2019. 
Turning to cash flow. Q4 operating cash flow was $414 million and free cash flow was $370 million. These results were driven by aggressive OpEx reductions and improved working capital efficiency. We ended Q4 in a net debt position of $2.4 billion. We also repurchased $179 million of stock at $69.23. The lower buyback levels for the quarter were due to blackout restrictions for the Airwave transaction, which was pending at the time. Total capital return for the quarter was $239 million, inclusive of dividends. We also increased the dividend by 21% during Q4 to $0.41 per share. Program to date, we have repurchased $11 billion or 49% of our shares outstanding at an average price of $57.06 per share. 
I'll now provide our outlook for both Q1 and the full year, inclusive of Airwave. Looking at Q1, we expect Q1 sales to decline 4% to 6% including currency, which is expected to be $20 million of translational headwind. This outlook includes approximately $55 million of revenue from Airwave. The decline in Q1 is driven by 3 items: The Norway contract transition finishing the systems integration phase; continued weakness in Latin America; and currency headwinds. We expect non-GAAP EPS between $0.37 and $0.42 per share. For the full year, we expect total company sales for 2016 to increase 5% to 7%, including approximately $450 million of revenue associated with Airwave. We expect operating expenses to be $1.45 billion, down another $120 million versus 2015, inclusive of Airwave or $150 million in savings in the core business. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $1.62 billion to $1.66 billion, an increase of approximately 25%. We expect EPS in the range of $4.45 to $4.65 per share, an increase of approximately 30% versus 2015. This EPS outlook reflects an average diluted share count of 170 million to 175 million shares. We expect operating cash flow of $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion and free cash flow of $825 million to $900 million, resulting in free cash flow per share in the range of $4.75 to $5 per share. 
Moving to Q4 regional results with comments on both Q4 and 2016. North America in Q4 was down 1% and flat in constant currency. Services in North America grew 2% for the quarter. For full year 2015, North America posted 3% growth. We're pleased to finish 2015 with continued execution and expect 2016 sales growth to once again be in the low single-digits as we improve sales coverage and capture value for new features and services. In Q4, Latin America was down due to continued economic weakness, a stronger dollar and a decline in iDEN. Revenue declined $58 million or 42%, with Brazil representing the largest decline. Although we expect Latin America to be down in 2016, our outlook is for the decline to be much more concentrated in the first half of the year. In Q4, Europe and Africa was down 21%, excluding FX, sales were down 14%. The Norway transitioned to Managed Services and continued weakness in Eastern Europe were the primary contributors to this decline. In 2016, we expect this region to grow due to the addition of Airwave, while the underlying business will see some headwinds in the first half as a result of the Norway integration completion, Eastern Europe weakness and currency. Asia-Pac revenue declined 2% for the quarter, but grew 6% in constant currency. This region demonstrated signs of stabilization in the second half of 2015. We expect revenue to be approximately flat for 2016 due to difficult prior-year compare and economic volatility in China. The Middle East region was down $2 million due to timing of systems integration of the major LTE business. We expect strong growth in 2016 similar to 2015, with ongoing LTE deployments. Moving forward, the Middle East region will be incorporated into a new EMEA region. 
I'll close with a few segment highlights. Our Product segment continues to innovate, improve time-to-market and optimize costs. Our optimization and simplification results include successfully outsourcing our pending manufacturing operations to and successfully reducing our SKU count at year-end by approximately 40%. We launched new products and extended our technology leadership in Q4, including new devices, which are purpose built for commercial customers and hazardous locations, upgraded infrastructure software that improves capability to sell software features and licensing applications, which will be an important source of growth moving forward. In parallel, the Services segment continues to demonstrate solid growth on a constant currency basis. In addition, our Managed and Support Services business continued to win significant new business that is building multiyear backlog and recurring revenue streams. Our primary services growth areas of Managed and Support Services grew 7% in constant currency, which reflects growth in every region. We expect another year of solid growth in 2016. The Smart Public Safety business continues to grow with new wins and deployments led by our emergency CallWorks suite of software and services. We extended our Public Safety LTE leadership with a countrywide Public Safety LTE win in the U.K. with an award value of $430 million, excluding any potential devices and we've successfully demonstrated Public Safety LTE trials in several regions. And in Q1, we closed the acquisition of Airwave, which adds significant capabilities to our Managed Services business by providing a platform, people, systems and tools, enabling the support of both LMR and LTE networks. This transaction was funded with $675 million of additional debt as well as the use of foreign cash for the balance of the purchase price. And finally, the business is expected to continue to generate very attractive EBITDA and free cash flow for this foreseeable future. 
I'd now like to turn the call back over to Greg."

Let me close with a few thoughts. First, despite headwinds presented by a stronger dollar and areas of macroeconomic weakness, we delivered solid growth in several areas for the year, including North America, Asia-Pac and the Middle East as well as our Managed and Support Services business. Second, we plan on over 30% EPS growth this year. We expect to build on our momentum in North America, add strategic capabilities to our Services franchise with the addition of Airwave and continue to drive backlog with large state and nationwide deals. And at the same time, we plan on driving further operational efficiency with another $120 million in cost savings this year. And finally, I believe we are uniquely positioned to bridge the complementary aspects of Public Safety LTE data with mission-critical LMR voice. Our LMR market-leading franchise remains rock solid as we continue to win major awards and build multiyear backlog in Services, while at the same time, we won the 4 largest Public Safety LTE awards valued at over $800 million. We continue to make the required investments in people and capabilities as we incorporate more services and software into our business that will enable us to deliver the right solutions at the right time for our customers. I feel confident that we're building a stronger and a more competitive company with durable earnings and cash generation that is well positioned for the future.

A touch below kind of what we were looking for, I think also The Street. I'm a little unclear on how The Street handled the Airwave numbers, certainly, but can you kind of walk through the step down we're seeing in Q1? Is it just seasonality? Or are there other things kind of driving that? And also I wanted to ask about Airwave. You're looking for $450 million in sales for 2016. I thought Airwave was running about $600 million a year? And obviously, we can adjust for the closing of the deal on February 19, but it sounds like you're still looking for a little bit less on Airwave than we were thinking the run rate was previously?

So in terms of the headwinds, Latin America will be down about $40 million, that's inclusive of iDEN for Q1; Europe we expect to be down approximately $40 million, primarily driven by Norway as the largest contract we've ever had transitions off of the systems integration phase; and the third one, as we've articulated, is FX of about $20 million based on the spot rates today. So think of about $100 million of headwind that tailwind is $55 million of Airwave, which represents the stub period of closing last Friday on February 19. So that's how I would think about it.

As we talked about it, about $450 million of revenue this year. I think probably the most important element is that as part of the negotiation, we've resolved all disputes and all contracts have been extended through the end of 2019. So when we now think about the predictability and financial visibility and commensurate earnings in cash as it relates to that acquisition, it's substantial and represents just under $2 billion in backlog through the extension of those contracts through the end of 2019. We worked very closely with the U.K. home office. They've been great in this engagement in working with us to successfully close the Airwave tetra network where all contracts are extended through '19 and also, we are, to your point, the beneficiaries of the ESN award of $430 million, which we view also we're well positioned to pursue. So we will work very closely with the home office customer as we transition. And I think for a long time, have complementary networks coexist.

So we're very pleased with North America. Latin America is distressed. It's been consistently distressed from last year. I think it will probably decline at rates comparable to last year. I think it's worth noting that the majority of the decline in Latin America, which we expect to be down, will likely most -- likely to occur in the first half of this year and then we would normalize through the balance of the year. We expect EMEA to be up with Airwave. Without Airwave, it would be down, primarily driven by the roll off of Norway. And Asia-Pac, roughly, we expect to be about flat. We'll grow in certain areas we would expect given the nature of some of the macroeconomic items in China as well as some of the dynamics of the Chinese marketplace. We would expect to be down in China. So all in, North America, up low single-digits. Latin America, down pretty markedly at levels in '16 comparable to '15.

I'd like to make a few opening comments before Gino takes us through the results and outlook. But first, Q4 was actually a good quarter in terms of margin expansion and cash flow generation. Managed & Support services grew 7% adjusted for currency and North America also outperformed our expectations against the difficult prior year compare and we saw solid growth in Asia Pac. Second, when I think of the full year, 2015 was a year of transformation and achievement that positions us well going forward. We delivered $830 million of free cash flow, took out over $210 million of operating costs, returned $3.5 billion in capital to shareholders, increased our quarterly dividend by 21% and improved the efficiency of our capital structure. And finally, last Friday, we announced the close of the Airwave acquisition, which is a strong and important addition to our Services franchise. Airwave owns and operates one of the largest public safety radio networks in the world and will provide a platform to expand our Managed Services business on a global basis. This business has significant Managed Services infrastructure and operational assets that could be leveraged for future growth opportunities in this space. The addition of Airwave increases our recurring revenue streams by 50%, adds geographic diversification, delivers another source of robust free cash flow and the transaction is cash- and earnings-accretive in year 1. 
I'll now turn the call over to Gino to provide additional details on Q4 results and outlook before returning to provide some closing thoughts."
99186,324560149,937706,"Motorola Solutions, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 22, 2016",2016-02-22,"Earnings Calls","Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Greg. Good afternoon, everyone. Key Q4 highlights include revenue of $1.7 billion, down 8% versus last year and down 5% in constant currency. The primary drivers of the decline were currency and economic headwinds in Latin America and Eastern E",1577,"Thank you, Greg. Good afternoon, everyone. Key Q4 highlights include revenue of $1.7 billion, down 8% versus last year and down 5% in constant currency. The primary drivers of the decline were currency and economic headwinds in Latin America and Eastern Europe. In addition, the Norway nationwide network transition from systems integration to Managed Services contributed to lower revenues. Ending backlog was up $698 million versus last year and up $486 million sequentially. Multiyear Managed & Support contracts continued to drive backlog growth. 
GAAP operating earnings were $389 million. Non-GAAP operating earnings were $458 million or 27% of sales, representing a 70 basis-point improvement from the prior year. GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.56 compared to a loss of $4.02 in the fourth quarter of 2014 due to pension restructuring. Non-EPS -- non-GAAP EPS of $1.58 was up 26% year-over-year. The EPS growth was driven primarily by cost reductions and lower share count due to repurchases. For the remainder of the call, we will reference non-GAAP financial measures, including those in our outlook, unless otherwise noted. 
For the full year, revenue declined 3% but was flat in constant currency. EBITDA grew 6% to $1.3 billion. Operating earnings increased 230 basis points to 20.5% of sales. Earnings per share grew 29% to $3.33 per share. Free cash flow was $830 million, and free cash flow per share was $4.11, which has grown double digits since separation in 2011. 
Moving to Product segment results for the quarter. Q4 Product sales were $1.1 billion, down 10% versus the prior year and down 7% in constant currency. The decline is attributable primarily to FX and economic headwinds in Latin America and Eastern Europe. Q4 Product operating income was $340 million or 30% of sales. Ending Product segment backlog was $1.2 billion, up $40 million versus last year. The year-over-year backlog increase reflects growth in Asia Pac, the Middle East and North America, offset by declines in Europe and Latin America. 
Turning to Services. Q4 Services revenue was $557 million, down 3%. Excluding currency impact and iDEN, the Services business grew 2%. Managed & Support Services grew 7% in constant currency, with growth in every region. Services operating income was $118 million or 21% of revenue, up 21 -- $29 million from last year. Services operating margin were up 580 basis points and improved gross margin and OpEx reductions. As expected, margin improvement was driven by the completion of several large systems installations, including the Norway project. Services backlog ended at $5.2 billion, up $658 million versus last year and up $601 million sequentially. Customers continue to sign long-term Services contracts to upgrade, maintain and manage their networks. $340 million of this backlog increase was driven by our recent Public Safety LTE contract win in the United Kingdom. Backlog was up solidly in all regions, except Latin America. 
Moving to Q4 operating expenses. Total OpEx from continuing operations was $386 million, down $45 million or 10% from the year-ago quarter, driven primarily by continued cost-reduction activities and a stronger dollar. For the year, OpEx is down $212 million or 12%. The largest drivers of the decline include employee reductions in G&A, pension expense and favorability from currency. We have now taken out over $550 million of OpEx in the last 3 years. Q4 other income and expense was up $12 million to $51 million compared to the year-ago quarter. The increase was due to additional interest expense. 
Looking at taxes. The Q4 effective tax rate was 31%. Full year 2015 effective tax rate was 33%. Our cash tax rate was 11% for 2015, and we continue to expect our cash tax rate to remain at approximately 15% through 2019. 
Turning to cash flow. Q4 operating cash flow was $414 million and free cash flow was $370 million. These results were driven by aggressive OpEx reductions and improved working capital efficiency. We ended Q4 in a net debt position of $2.4 billion. We also repurchased $179 million of stock at $69.23. The lower buyback levels for the quarter were due to blackout restrictions for the Airwave transaction, which was pending at the time. Total capital return for the quarter was $239 million, inclusive of dividends. We also increased the dividend by 21% during Q4 to $0.41 per share. Program to date, we have repurchased $11 billion or 49% of our shares outstanding at an average price of $57.06 a share. 
I'll now provide our outlook for both Q1 and the full year, inclusive of Airwave. Looking at Q1, we expect Q1 sales to decline 4% to 6%, including currency, which is expected to be $20 million of translational headwind. This outlook includes approximately $55 million of revenue from Airwave. The decline in Q1 is driven by 3 items: the Norway contract transition finishing the systems integration phase; continued weakness in Latin America; and currency headwinds. We expect non-GAAP EPS between $0.37 and $0.42 per share. For the full year, we expect total company sales for 2016 to increase 5% to 7%, including approximately $450 million of revenue associated with Airwave. We expect operating expenses to be $1.45 billion, down another $120 million versus 2015, inclusive of Airwave, or $150 million in savings in the core business. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $1.62 billion to $1.66 billion, an increase of approximately 25%. We expect EPS in the range of $4.45 to $4.65 per share, an increase of approximately 30% versus 2015. This EPS outlook reflects an average diluted share count of 170 million to 175 million shares. We expect operating cash flow of $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion and free cash flow of $825 million to $900 million, resulting in free cash flow per share in the range of $4.75 to $5 per share. 
Moving to Q4 regional results with comments on both Q4 and 2016. North America in Q4 was down 1% and flat in constant currency. Services in North America grew 2% for the quarter. For full year 2015, North America posted 3% growth. We're pleased to finish 2015 with continued execution and expect 2016 sales growth to once again be in the low single digits as we improve sales coverage and capture value for new features and services. In Q4, Latin America was down due to continued economic weakness, a stronger dollar and a decline in iDEN. Revenue declined $58 million or 42%, with Brazil representing the largest decline. Although we expect Latin America to be down in 2016, our outlook is for the decline to be much more concentrated in the first half of the year. 
In Q4, Europe and Africa was down 21%. Excluding FX, sales were down 14%. The Norway transition to Managed Services and continued weakness in Eastern Europe were the primary contributors to this decline. In 2016, we expect this region to grow due to the addition of Airwave, while the underlying business will see some headwinds in the first half as a result of the Norway integration completion, Eastern Europe weakness and currency. Asia Pac revenue declined 2% for the quarter but grew 6% in constant currency. This region demonstrated signs of stabilization in the second half of 2015. We expect revenue to be approximately flat for 2016 due to difficult prior year compare and economic volatility in China. The Middle East region was down $2 million due to timing of systems integration of the major LTE business. We expect strong growth in 2016 similar to 2015, with ongoing LTE deployments. Moving forward, the Middle East region will be incorporated into a new EMEA region. 
I'll close with a few segment highlights. Our Product segment continues to innovate, improve time-to-market and optimize costs. Our optimization and simplification results include successfully outsourcing our Penang manufacturing operations to Sanmina and successfully reducing our SKU count at year-end by approximately 40%. We launched new products and extended our technology leadership in Q4, including new devices, which are purpose-built for commercial customers in hazardous locations, upgraded infrastructure software that improves the capability to sell software features and licensing applications, which will be an important source of growth moving forward. In parallel, the Services segment continues to demonstrate solid growth on a constant currency basis. In addition, our Managed & Support services business continues to win significant new business that is building multiyear backlog and recurring revenue streams. Our primary services growth areas of Managed & Support services grew 7% in constant currency, which reflects growth in every region. We expect another year of solid growth in 2016. 
The Smart Public Safety business continues to grow, with new wins and deployments led by our Emergency CallWorks suite of software and services. We extended our Public Safety LTE leadership with a countrywide Public Safety LTE win in the U.K., with an award value of $430 million, excluding any potential devices, and we've successfully demonstrated Public Safety LTE trials in several regions. And in Q1, we closed the acquisition of Airwave, which adds significant capabilities to our Managed Services business by providing a platform, people, systems and tools, enabling the support of both LMR and LTE networks. This transaction was funded with $675 million of additional debt as well as the use of foreign cash for the balance of the purchase price. 
And finally, the business is expected to continue to generate very attractive EBITDA and free cash flow for this foreseeable future. 
I'd now like to turn the call back over to Greg."

Let me close with a few thoughts. The first, despite headwinds presented by a stronger dollar and areas of macroeconomic weakness, we delivered solid growth in several areas for the year, including North America, Asia Pac and the Middle East as well as our Managed & Support services business. Second, we plan on over 30% EPS growth this year. We expect to build on our momentum in North America, add strategic capabilities to our Services franchise with the addition of Airwave and continue to drive backlog with large state and nationwide deals. And at the same time, we plan on driving further operational efficiency with another $120 million in cost savings this year. 
Finally, I believe we are uniquely positioned to bridge the complementary aspects of Public Safety LTE data with mission-critical LMR voice. Our LMR market-leading franchise remains rock solid as we continue to win major awards and build multiyear backlog in Services, while at the same time, we've won the 4 largest Public Safety LTE awards valued at over $800 million. We continue to make the required investments in people and capabilities as we incorporate more services and software into our business that will enable us to deliver the right solutions at the right time for our customers. I feel confident that we're building a stronger and a more competitive company with durable earnings and cash generation that is well positioned for the future.

A touch below kind of what we were looking for, I think also The Street. I'm a little unclear on how The Street handled the Airwave numbers, certainly, but can you kind of walk through the step-down we're seeing in Q1? Is it just seasonality? Or are there other things kind of driving that? And also, I wanted to ask about Airwave. You're looking for $450 million in sales for 2016. I thought Airwave was running about $600 million a year? And obviously, we can adjust for the closing of the deal on February 19, but it sounds like you're still looking for a little bit less on Airwave than we were thinking the run rate was previously? So those are my questions."

So in terms of the headwinds, Latin America will be down about $40 million, that's inclusive of iDEN for Q1. Europe we expect to be down approximately $40 million, primarily driven by Norway as the largest contract we've ever had transitions off of the systems integration phase. And the third one, as we've articulated, is FX of about $20 million, based on the spot rates today. So think of about $100 million of headwind. The tailwind is $55 million of Airwave, which represents the stub period of closing last Friday on February 19. So that's how I would think about it. The $450 million of Airwave on an annual basis also represents a partial year. We haven't guided yet obviously and won't signal yet on the full year fiscal 2017 for top line."

We're thrilled with the acquisition of Airwave, both strategically and financially. As we talked about it, about $450 million of revenue this year. I think probably the most important element is that as part of the negotiation, we've resolved all disputes and all contracts have been extended through the end of 2019. So when we now think about the predictability and financial visibility and commensurate earnings in cash as it relates to that acquisition, it's substantial and represents just under $2 billion in backlog through the extension of those contracts through the end of 2019. We've worked very closely with the U.K. home office. They've been great in this engagement in working with us to successfully close the Airwave TETRA network, where all contracts are extended through '19, and also, we are, to your point, the beneficiaries of the ESN award of $430 million, which we view -- also we're well positioned to pursue.

I'd like to make a few opening comments before Gino takes us through the results and outlook. But first, Q4 was actually a good quarter in terms of margin expansion and cash flow generation. Managed & Support services grew 7% adjusted for currency and North America also outperformed our expectations against the difficult prior year compare and we saw solid growth in Asia Pac. 
Second, when I think of the full year, 2015 was a year of transformation and achievement that positions us well going forward. We delivered $830 million of free cash flow, took out over $210 million of operating costs, returned $3.5 billion in capital to shareholders, increased our quarterly dividend by 21% and improved the efficiency of our capital structure. And finally, last Friday, we announced the close of the Airwave acquisition, which is a strong and important addition to our Services franchise. Airwave owns and operates one of the largest public safety radio networks in the world and will provide a platform to expand our Managed Services business on a global basis. This business has significant Managed Services infrastructure and operational assets that could be leveraged for future growth opportunities in this space. The addition of Airwave increases our recurring revenue streams by 50%, adds geographic diversification, delivers another source of robust free cash flow and the transaction is cash- and earnings-accretive in year 1. 
I'll now turn the call over to Gino to provide additional details on Q4 results and outlook before returning to provide some closing thoughts."
99186,324560149,937738,"Motorola Solutions, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 22, 2016",2016-02-22,"Earnings Calls","Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Greg. Good afternoon, everyone. Key Q4 highlights include revenue of $1.7 billion, down 8% versus last year and down 5% in constant currency.

Key Q4 highlights include revenue of $1.7 billion, down 8% versus last year and down 5% in constant currency. The primary drivers of the decline were currency and economic headwinds in Latin America and Eastern Europe. In addition, the Norway nationwide network transition from systems integration to Managed Services contributed to lower revenues. Ending backlog was up $698 million versus last year and up $486 million sequentially. Multiyear Managed & Support contracts continued to drive backlog growth. 
GAAP operating earnings were $389 million. Non-GAAP operating earnings were $458 million or 27% of sales, representing a 70 basis-point improvement from the prior year. GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.56 compared to a loss of $4.02 in the fourth quarter of 2014 due to pension restructuring. Non-EPS -- non-GAAP EPS of $1.58 was up 26% year-over-year. The EPS growth was driven primarily by cost reductions and lower share count due to repurchases. For the remainder of the call, we will reference non-GAAP financial measures, including those in our outlook, unless otherwise noted.  For the full year, revenue declined 3% but was flat in constant currency. EBITDA grew 6% to $1.3 billion. Operating earnings increased 230 basis points to 20.5% of sales. Earnings per share grew 29% to $3.33 per share. Free cash flow was $830 million, and free cash flow per share was $4.11, which has grown double digits since separation in 2011. 
Moving to Product segment results for the quarter. Q4 Product sales were $1.1 billion, down 10% versus the prior year and down 7% in constant currency. The decline is attributable primarily to FX and economic headwinds in Latin America and Eastern Europe. Q4 Product operating income was $340 million or 30% of sales. Ending Product segment backlog was $1.2 billion, up $40 million versus last year. The year-over-year backlog increase reflects growth in Asia Pac, the Middle East and North America, offset by declines in Europe and Latin America. 
Turning to Services. Q4 Services revenue was $557 million, down 3%. Excluding currency impact and iDEN, the Services business grew 2%. Managed & Support Services grew 7% in constant currency, with growth in every region. Services operating income was $118 million or 21% of revenue, up 21 -- $29 million from last year. Services operating margin were up 580 basis points on improved gross margin and OpEx reductions. As expected, margin improvement was driven by the completion of several large systems installations, including the Norway project. Services backlog ended at $5.2 billion, up $658 million versus last year and up $601 million sequentially. Customers continue to sign long-term Services contracts to upgrade, maintain and manage their networks. $340 million of this backlog increase was driven by our recent Public Safety LTE contract win in the United Kingdom. Backlog was up solidly in all regions, except Latin America. 
Moving to Q4 operating expenses. Total OpEx from continuing operations was $386 million, down $45 million or 10% from the year-ago quarter, driven primarily by continued cost-reduction activities and a stronger dollar. For the year, OpEx is down $212 million or 12%. The largest drivers of the decline include employee reductions in G&A, pension expense and favorability from currency. We have now taken out over $550 million of OpEx in the last 3 years. Q4 other income and expense was up $12 million to $51 million compared to the year-ago quarter. The increase was due to additional interest expense. 
Looking at taxes. The Q4 effective tax rate was 31%. Full year 2015 effective tax rate was 33%. Our cash tax rate was 11% for 2015, and we continue to expect our cash tax rate to remain at approximately 15% through 2019. 
Turning to cash flow. Q4 operating cash flow was $414 million and free cash flow was $370 million. These results were driven by aggressive OpEx reductions and improved working capital efficiency. We ended Q4 in a net debt position of $2.4 billion. We also repurchased $179 million of stock at $69.23. The lower buyback levels for the quarter were due to blackout restrictions for the Airwave transaction, which was pending at the time. Total capital return for the quarter was $239 million, inclusive of dividends. We also increased the dividend by 21% during Q4 to $0.41 per share. Program to date, we have repurchased $11 billion or 49% of our shares outstanding at an average price of $57.06 a share. 
I'll now provide our outlook for both Q1 and the full year, inclusive of Airwave. Looking at Q1, we expect Q1 sales to decline 4% to 6%, including currency, which is expected to be $20 million of translational headwind. This outlook includes approximately $55 million of revenue from Airwave. The decline in Q1 is driven by 3 items: the Norway contract transition finishing the systems integration phase, continued weakness in Latin America and currency headwinds. We expect non-GAAP EPS between $0.37 and $0.42 per share. For the full year, we expect total company sales for 2016 to increase 5% to 7%, including approximately $450 million of revenue associated with Airwave. We expect operating expenses to be $1.45 billion, down another $120 million versus 2015, inclusive of Airwave, or $150 million in savings in the core business. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $1.62 billion to $1.66 billion, an increase of approximately 25%. We expect EPS in the range of $4.45 to $4.65 per share, an increase of approximately 30% versus 2015. This EPS outlook reflects an average diluted share count of 170 million to 175 million shares. We expect operating cash flow of $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion and free cash flow of $825 million to $900 million, resulting in free cash flow per share in the range of $4.75 to $5 per share. 
Moving to Q4 regional results with comments on both Q4 and 2016. North America in Q4 was down 1% and flat in constant currency. Services in North America grew 2% for the quarter. For full year 2015, North America posted 3% growth. We're pleased to finish 2015 with continued execution and expect 2016 sales growth to once again be in the low single digits as we improve sales coverage and capture value for new features and services. In Q4, Latin America was down due to continued economic weakness, a stronger dollar and a decline in iDEN. Revenue declined $58 million or 42%, with Brazil representing the largest decline. Although we expect Latin America to be down in 2016, our outlook is for the decline to be much more concentrated in the first half of the year. 
In Q4, Europe and Africa was down 21%. Excluding FX, sales were down 14%. The Norway transition to Managed Services and continued weakness in Eastern Europe were the primary contributors to this decline. In 2016, we expect this region to grow due to the addition of Airwave, while the underlying business will see some headwinds in the first half as a result of the Norway integration completion, Eastern Europe weakness and currency. Asia Pac revenue declined 2% for the quarter but grew 6% in constant currency. This region demonstrated signs of stabilization in the second half of 2015. We expect revenue to be approximately flat for 2016 due to difficult prior year compare and economic volatility in China. The Middle East region was down $2 million due to timing of systems integration of the major LTE business. We expect strong growth in 2016 similar to 2015, with ongoing LTE deployments. Moving forward, the Middle East region will be incorporated into a new EMEA region. 
I'll close with a few segment highlights. Our Product segment continues to innovate, improve time-to-market and optimize cost. Our optimization and simplification results include successfully outsourcing our Penang manufacturing operations to Sanmina and successfully reducing our SKU count at year-end by approximately 40%. We launched new products and extended our technology leadership in Q4, including new devices, which are purpose-built for commercial customers in hazardous locations, upgraded infrastructure software that improves the capability to sell software features and licensing applications, which will be an important source of growth moving forward. In parallel, the Services segment continues to demonstrate solid growth on a constant currency basis. In addition, our Managed & Support services business continues to win significant new business that is building multiyear backlog and recurring revenue streams. Our primary services growth areas of Managed & Support services grew 7% in constant currency, which reflects growth in every region. We expect another year of solid growth in 2016. 
The Smart Public Safety business continues to grow, with new wins and deployments led by our Emergency CallWorks suite of software and services. We extended our Public Safety LTE leadership with a countrywide Public Safety LTE win in the U.K., with an award value of $430 million, excluding any potential devices, and we've successfully demonstrated Public Safety LTE trials in several regions. And in Q1, we closed the acquisition of Airwave, which adds significant capabilities to our Managed Services business by providing a platform, people, systems and tools, enabling the support of both LMR and LTE networks. This transaction was funded with $675 million of additional debt as well as the use of foreign cash for the balance of the purchase price.  And finally, the business is expected to continue to generate very attractive EBITDA and free cash flow for this foreseeable future. 
I'd now like to turn the call back over to Greg."

Let me close with a few thoughts. The first, despite headwinds presented by a stronger dollar and areas of macroeconomic weakness, we delivered solid growth in several areas for the year, including North America, Asia Pac and the Middle East as well as our Managed & Support services business. Second, we plan on over 30% EPS growth this year. We expect to build on our momentum in North America, add strategic capabilities to our Services franchise with the addition of Airwave and continue to drive backlog with large state and nationwide deals. And at the same time, we plan on driving further operational efficiency with another $120 million in cost savings this year. 
Finally, I believe we are uniquely positioned to bridge the complementary aspects of Public Safety LTE data with mission-critical LMR voice. Our LMR market-leading franchise remains rock solid as we continue to win major awards and build multiyear backlog in Services, while at the same time, we've won the 4 largest Public Safety LTE awards valued at over $800 million. We continue to make the required investments in people and capabilities as we incorporate more services and software into our business that will enable us to deliver the right solutions at the right time for our customers. I feel confident that we're building a stronger and a more competitive company with durable earnings and cash generation that is well positioned for the future.

I'm a little unclear on how The Street handled the Airwave numbers, certainly, but can you kind of walk through the step-down we're seeing in Q1? Is it just seasonality? Or are there other things kind of driving that? And also, I wanted to ask about Airwave. You're looking for $450 million in sales for 2016. I thought Airwave was running about $600 million a year?

And the third one, as we've articulated, is FX of about $20 million, based on the spot rates today. So think of about $100 million of headwind. The tailwind is $55 million of Airwave, which represents the stub period of closing last Friday on February 19. So that's how I would think about it.

I think probably the most important element is that as part of the negotiation, we've resolved all disputes and all contracts have been extended through the end of 2019. So when we now think about the predictability and financial visibility and commensurate earnings and cash as it relates to that acquisition, it's substantial and represents just under $2 billion in backlog through the extension of those contracts through the end of 2019. We've worked very closely with the U.K. home office. They've been great in this engagement in working with us to successfully close the Airwave TETRA network, where all contracts are extended through '19, and also, we are, to your point, the beneficiaries of the ESN award of $430 million, which we view -- also we're well positioned to pursue.

We continue to add multiyear service contracts in North America. We continue to build backlog in North America with LMR. So I think given our incumbency and our Public Safety expertise and our ability, I think an ideal position to provide interoperability between LMR and over time, Public Safety LTE in North America, I think we're very, very well-positioned.

I'd like to make a few opening comments about the first quarter and the overall business before Gino takes us through the results and the outlook. 
First, Q1 was a good quarter relative to our sales and earnings expectations. North America continues to execute well with growth of 2%, including increases in both products and services sales, along with encouraging order activity. 
Second, our focus around growing the Managed & Support services franchise continues to build momentum. We grew Managed & Support services 6% organically in Q1, closed airwave, added $1.8 billion to our backlog position and made significant progress in streamlining and packaging our services and support offerings. 
And last, we continued to build a leaner and more agile organization as we drive further operational efficiency. There are a number of examples that illustrate this change, including the completed sale of our Malaysian manufacturing facility, a 40% reduction in product SKUs in a little over a year and a targeted  shift in R&D to strategic growth areas.
I'll now turn the call over to Gino to provide additional details on Q1 results and outlook before returning to provide some closing thoughts."
99186,330417437,974619,"Motorola Solutions, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 05, 2016",2016-05-05,"Earnings Calls","Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Greg. Key Q1 results include revenue of $1.2 billion, down 2% versus last year and down 1% in constant currency. Airwave revenue was $61 million. GAAP operating earnings were $100 million. Non-GAAP operating earnings were $166 million or 13",1159,"Thank you, Greg. 
Key Q1 results include revenue of $1.2 billion, down 2% versus last year and down 1% in constant currency. 
Airwave revenue was $61 million. GAAP operating earnings were $100 million. Non-GAAP operating earnings were $166 million or 13.9% of sales, representing a 110-basis-point improvement from the year-ago quarter. 
EBITDA grew $20 million to $215 million. GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.10 compared to $0.40 in the first quarter of 2015. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.52, which represents a 37% year-over-year increase. This earnings growth was driven partly by ongoing cost-reduction and further optimizing our capital structure. 
And in backlog is up $2.5 billion versus last year and up $1.9 billion sequentially. 
Of the $2.5 billion year-on-year increase, airwave accounts for $1.8 billion -- excuse me, Managed & Support services backlog is up $700 million and product is up $30 million. The $1.9 billion sequential increase was primarily due to airwave, Managed & Support services and a $32 million increase in product. 
For the remainder of the call, we will reference non-GAAP financial results, including those in our outlook unless otherwise noted. 
Moving to the Product segment. Q1 product sales were $702 million, down 7% versus the prior year. The decline was primarily due to weakness in Latin America and Europe as well as currency headwind. 
Q1 Product segment operating income was $84 million or 12% of sales, up 10 basis points versus last year as a result of the ongoing cost reduction actions. 
Product segment backlog ended the quarter at $1.3 billion, up $30 million versus last year and up $32 million sequentially, driven by North America.  Product backlog has grown in 7 of the past 8 quarters. 
Turning to Services. Q1 Service revenue was $491 million, up 6%, excluding the $61 million of Airwave sales. Services declined 8%, primarily on systems integration related to Norway as well as a decline in iDEN. The focus growth area of Managed & Support services grew 6% organically. Inclusive of Airwave, Managed & Support services now represents approximately 25% of our total revenue.
Services operating income was $82 million or 16.7% of revenue, up $16 million from the prior year. Operating margins increased 250 basis points on improved gross margin and lower CapEx -- OpEx. 
Services backlog ended at $7.1 billion, up $2.5 billion versus last year and up $1.8 billion sequentially. The $2.5 billion of backlog growth versus last year is attributable to $1.8 billion of Airwave in EMEA and $500 million of Managed & Support services in North America.
Moving to operating expenses. Total OpEx from continuing operations was $354 million, down $43 million or 11% from the year-ago quarter, driven primarily by continued cost-reduction activities. 
For the year, we continue to expect savings of approximately $120 million, including the addition of the OpEx related to Airwave.
Other income and expense in Q1 was $42 million compared to $37 million in the year-ago quarter. Net interest expense was $49 million in Q1 compared to $40 million last year.
Moving to taxes. The Q1 effective tax rate was 26%. We continue to expect the full year 2016 effective tax rate to be approximately 33%.
Turning to cash flow. Q1 operating cash flow was $13 million, a decrease of $143 million. Free cash flow was a use of $38 million. The lower operating cash flow was the result of higher incentive payment and higher tax payment, while working capital was a smaller source of cash than last year. We remain on track for approximately $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion of operating cash flow and $4.75 to $5 of free cash flow per share for the full year.
We ended Q1 in a net debt position of $3.1 billion. During the quarter, we repurchased $64 million of stock at $71.41. The lower buyback levels in Q1 were primarily due to the Airwave transaction. 
In total, we have repurchased $11 billion of shares at an average price of $57.13 and have approximately 1 billion remaining on our current authorization.  Finally, dividend payments were $71 million for the quarter. 
Now turning to the outlook. We expect Q2 sales growth of 1% to 3%. Airwave revenue is expected to be approximately $130 million. We expect Q2 non-GAAP EPS between $0.82 and $0.88 our view of the 4 -- of full year 2016 outlook remains unchanged at 5% to 7% sales growth.
We also expect non-GAAP EPS of $4.45 to $4.65. 
Airwave is expected to be approximately $450 million in revenue. 
Moving to regional results. North America grew 2%, driven by both product and services demand. Demand for both Managed & Support services as well as Apex device sales were key growth drivers in North America. Backlog growth was once again a very strong in services with an increase of approximately $500 million from last year. Additionally, product backlog was up $23 million sequentially. We remain on track for growth for the year.
Latin America was down 42% and continued challenging macroeconomic conditions, the impact of a stronger dollar and iDEN decline. While the macro environment has clearly impacted the channel business and demand for large systems, our overall margins within the region remains solid. We have adjusted sales coverage in key accounts and continued to support our partners and customers during the downturn.
EMEA was up 1%, inclusive of $61 million of Airwave revenue, offset by declines associated with the Norway project, pockets of channel weakness and currency headwinds. 
Asia Pac declined by 4% on currency headwinds and expect the softness in China. Excluding currency, Asia Pac grew 1% with a strong quarter of Managed & Support services revenue growth. 
I'd also like to share some brief segment highlights. In our Products segment, some of the notable awards one during the quarter include a $42 million contract with Montgomery County Maryland to upgrade their P25 network at the latest release, a $23 million contract in Central Africa for a nationwide P25 system, a $25 million order with a North African nation for our latest Moto Turbo tracking solutions. And we won another Public Safety LTE contract with the United Nations for a deployable LTE system and devices. 
Highlights from our Services business include the award of a significant and strategic contract in the U.K. to provide Wave 7000 interoperability between the existing Airwave LMR network and the new ESN LTE network went operational. We won a large multi-year maintenance and software upgrade contract with the large U.S. utility customer that utilizes our full suite of services. 
And finally, our Smart Public Safety momentum continues with strong double-digit revenue growth and continued innovation. New offerings include command central software to help public safety and the command-and-control center with realtime operational views, a situational awareness in the field and improved decision-making.
New wins in Smart Public Safety include several Emergency CallWorks awards that bring next-generation 911 capability and public safety answering. I would now like to turn the call back over to Greg."

Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us today. I'd like to make a few opening comments about the first quarter and the overall business before Gino takes us through the results and the outlook.
First, Q1 was a good quarter relative to our sales and earnings expectations. North America continues to execute well with growth of 2%, including increases in both products and services sales, along with encouraging order activity.
Second, our focus around growing the Managed & Support services franchise continues to build momentum. We grew Managed & Support services 6% organically in Q1, closed Airwave, added $1.8 billion to our backlog position and made significant progress in streamlining and packaging our Services and Support offerings.
And last, we continued to build a leaner and more agile organization as we drive further operational efficiency. There are a number of examples that illustrate this change, including the completed sale of our Malaysian manufacturing facility, a 40% reduction in product SKUs in a little over a year and a targeted shift in R&D to strategic growth areas.
I'll now turn the call over to Gino to provide additional details on Q1 results and outlook before returning to provide some closing thoughts."

GAAP operating earnings were $100 million. Non-GAAP operating earnings were $166 million or 13.9",1157,"Thank you, Greg.
Key Q1 results include revenue of $1.2 billion, down 2% versus last year and down 1% in constant currency.
Airwave revenue was $61 million. GAAP operating earnings were $100 million. Non-GAAP operating earnings were $166 million or 13.9% of sales, representing a 110-basis-point improvement from the year-ago quarter.
EBITDA grew $20 million to $215 million. GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.10 compared to $0.40 in the first quarter of 2015. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.52, which represents a 37% year-over-year increase. This earnings growth was driven primarily by ongoing cost-reduction and further optimizing to our capital structure.
Ending backlog is up $2.5 billion versus last year and up $1.9 billion sequentially. Of the $2.5 billion year-on-year increase, Airwave accounts for $1.8 billion -- excuse me. Managed & Support services backlog is up $700 million and Product is up $30 million. The $1.9 billion sequential increase was primarily due to Airwave, Managed & Support services and a $32 million increase in Products.
For the remainder of the call, we will reference non-GAAP financial results, including those in our outlook unless otherwise noted.
Moving to the Products segment. Q1 Products sales were $702 million, down 7% versus the prior year. The decline was primarily due to weakness in Latin America and Europe as well as currency headwind.
Q1 Products segment operating income was $84 million or 12% of sales, up 10 basis points versus last year as a result of the ongoing cost reduction actions.
Products segment backlog ended the quarter at $1.3 billion, up $30 million versus last year and up $32 million sequentially, driven by North America. Product backlog has grown in 7 of the past 8 quarters.
Turning to Services. Q1 Service revenue was $491 million, up 6%, excluding the $61 million of Airwave sales. Services declined 8%, primarily on systems integration related to Norway as well as a decline in iDEN. The focus growth area of Managed & Support services grew 6% organically. Inclusive of Airwave, Managed & Support services now represents approximately 25% of our total revenue.
Services operating income was $82 million or 16.7% of revenue, up $16 million from the prior year. Operating margins increased 250 basis points on improved gross margin and lower CapEx -- OpEx.
Services backlog ended at $7.1 billion, up $2.5 billion versus last year and up $1.8 billion sequentially. The $2.5 billion of backlog growth versus last year is attributable to $1.8 billion of Airwave in EMEA and $500 million of Managed & Support services in North America.
Moving to operating expenses. Total OpEx from continuing operations was $354 million, down $43 million or 11% from the year-ago quarter, driven primarily by continued cost-reduction activities.
For the year, we continue to expect savings of approximately $120 million, including the addition of the OpEx related to Airwave.
Other income and expense in Q1 was $42 million compared to $37 million in the year-ago quarter. Net interest expense was $49 million in Q1 compared to $40 million last year.
Moving to taxes. The Q1 effective tax rate was 26%. We continue to expect the full year 2016 effective tax rate to be approximately 33%.
Turning to cash flow. Q1 operating cash flow was $13 million, a decrease of $143 million. Free cash flow was the use of $38 million. The lower operating cash flow was the result of higher incentive payment and higher tax payment, while working capital was a smaller source of cash than last year. We remain on track for approximately $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion of operating cash flow and $4.75 to $5 of free cash flow per share for the full year.
We ended Q1 in a net debt position of $3.1 billion. During the quarter, we repurchased $64 million of stock at $71.41. The lower buyback levels in Q1 were primarily due to the Airwave transaction.
In total, we have repurchased $11 billion of shares at an average price of $57.13 and have approximately $1 billion remaining on our current authorization. Finally, dividend payments were $71 million for the quarter.
Now turning to the outlook. We expect Q2 sales growth of 1% to 3%. Airwave revenue is expected to be approximately $130 million. We expect Q2 non-GAAP EPS between $0.82 and $0.88. Our view of the full -- of full year 2016 outlook remains unchanged at 5% to 7% sales growth. We also expect non-GAAP EPS of $4.45 to $4.65. Airwave is expected to be approximately $450 million in revenue.
Moving to regional results. North America grew 2%, driven by both product and services demand. Demand for both Managed & Support services as well as APX device sales were key growth drivers in North America. Backlog growth was once again very strong in services, with an increase of approximately $500 million from last year. Additionally, product backlog was up $23 million sequentially. We remain on track for growth for the year.
Latin America was down 42% and continued challenging macroeconomic conditions, the impact of a stronger dollar and iDEN decline. While the macro environment has clearly impacted the channel business and demand for large systems, our overall margins within the region remain solid. We have adjusted sales coverage in key accounts and continue to support our partners and customers during the downturn.
EMEA was up 1%, inclusive of $61 million of Airwave revenue, offset by declines associated with the Norway project, pockets of channel weakness and currency headwinds.
Asia Pac declined by 4% on currency headwinds and expected softness in China. Excluding currency, Asia Pac grew 1%, with a strong quarter of Managed & Support services revenue growth.
I'd also like to share some brief segment highlights. In our Products segment, some of the notable awards won during the quarter include: a $42 million contract with Montgomery County, Maryland to upgrade their P25 network to the latest release; a $23 million contract in Central Africa for a nationwide P25 system; a $25 million order with a North African nation for our latest MOTOTRBO trunking solutions; and we won another Public Safety LTE contract with the United Nations for a deployable LTE system and devices.
Highlights from our Services business include the award of a significant and strategic contract in the U.K. to provide Wave 7000 interoperability between the existing Airwave LMR network and the new ESN LTE network when operational. We won a large multi-year maintenance and software upgrade contract with a large U.S. utility customer that utilizes our full suite of services.
And finally, our Smart Public Safety momentum continues with strong double-digit revenue growth and continued innovation. New offerings include CommandCentral software to help public safety in the command and control center with realtime operational views, situational awareness in the field and improved decision-making.
New wins in Smart Public Safety include several Emergency CallWorks awards that bring next-generation 911 capabilities to public safety answering points.
I would now like to turn the call back over to Greg."

It was driven by higher incentive payments for '15 performance versus '14 variable pay payments that the majority of which are paid out in Q1 and higher tax payments and working capital. Working capital was a source of cash in Q1 '16, just not as large of a source as it was in Q1 of '15. As a matter of fact, if you -- from a cash conversion cycle, we improved 4 days in the quarter.

Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us today. I'd like to make a few opening comments about the first quarter and the overall business before Gino takes us through the results and the outlook.
First, Q1 was a good quarter relative to our sales and earnings expectations. North America continues to execute well with growth of 2%, including increases in both products and services sales, along with encouraging order activity.
Second, our focus around growing the Managed & Support services franchise continues to build momentum. We grew Managed & Support services 6% organically in Q1, closed Airwave, added $1.8 billion to our backlog position and made significant progress in streamlining and packaging our Services and Support offerings.
And last, we continue to build a leaner and more agile organization as we drive further operational efficiency. There are a number of examples that illustrate this change, including the completed sale of our Malaysian manufacturing facility, a 40% reduction in product SKUs in a little over a year and a targeted shift in R&D to strategic growth areas.
I'll now turn the call over to Gino to provide additional details on Q1 results and outlook before returning to provide some closing thoughts."

GAAP operating earnings were $100 million. Non-GAAP operating earnings were $166 million or 13.9",1157,"Thank you, Greg.
Key Q1 results include revenue of $1.2 billion, down 2% versus last year and down 1% in constant currency.
Airwave revenue was $61 million. GAAP operating earnings were $100 million. Non-GAAP operating earnings were $166 million or 13.9% of sales, representing a 110-basis-point improvement from the year-ago quarter.
EBITDA grew $20 million to $215 million. GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.10 compared to $0.40 in the first quarter of 2015. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.52, which represents a 37% year-over-year increase. This earnings growth was driven primarily by ongoing cost-reduction and further optimizing to our capital structure.
Ending backlog is up $2.5 billion versus last year and up $1.9 billion sequentially. Of the $2.5 billion year-on-year increase, Airwave accounts for $1.8 billion -- excuse me. Managed & Support services backlog is up $700 million and Product is up $30 million. The $1.9 billion sequential increase was primarily due to Airwave, Managed & Support services and a $32 million increase in Products.
For the remainder of the call, we will reference non-GAAP financial results, including those in our outlook unless otherwise noted.
Moving to the Products segment. Q1 Products sales were $702 million, down 7% versus the prior year. The decline was primarily due to weakness in Latin America and Europe as well as currency headwind.
Q1 Products segment operating income was $84 million or 12% of sales, up 10 basis points versus last year as a result of the ongoing cost reduction actions.
Products segment backlog ended the quarter at $1.3 billion, up $30 million versus last year and up $32 million sequentially, driven by North America. Product backlog has grown in 7 of the past 8 quarters.
Turning to Services. Q1 Service revenue was $491 million, up 6%, excluding the $61 million of Airwave sales. Services declined 8%, primarily on systems integration related to Norway as well as a decline in iDEN. The focus growth area of Managed & Support services grew 6% organically. Inclusive of Airwave, Managed & Support services now represents approximately 25% of our total revenue.
Services operating income was $82 million or 16.7% of revenue, up $16 million from the prior year. Operating margins increased 250 basis points on improved gross margin and lower CapEx -- OpEx.
Services backlog ended at $7.1 billion, up $2.5 billion versus last year and up $1.8 billion sequentially. The $2.5 billion of backlog growth versus last year is attributable to $1.8 billion of Airwave in EMEA and $500 million of Managed & Support services in North America.
Moving to operating expenses. Total OpEx from continuing operations was $354 million, down $43 million or 11% from the year-ago quarter, driven primarily by continued cost-reduction activities.
For the year, we continue to expect savings of approximately $120 million, including the addition of the OpEx related to Airwave.
Other income and expense in Q1 was $42 million compared to $37 million in the year-ago quarter. Net interest expense was $49 million in Q1 compared to $40 million last year.
Moving to taxes. The Q1 effective tax rate was 26%. We continue to expect the full year 2016 effective tax rate to be approximately 33%.
Turning to cash flow. Q1 operating cash flow was $13 million, a decrease of $143 million. Free cash flow was a use of $38 million. The lower operating cash flow was the result of higher incentive payments and higher tax payments, while working capital was a smaller source of cash than last year. We remain on track for approximately $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion of operating cash flow and $4.75 to $5 of free cash flow per share for the full year.
We ended Q1 in a net debt position of $3.1 billion. During the quarter, we repurchased $64 million of stock at $71.41. The lower buyback levels in Q1 were primarily due to the Airwave transaction.
In total, we have repurchased $11 billion of shares at an average price of $57.13 and have approximately $1 billion remaining on our current authorization. Finally, dividend payments were $71 million for the quarter.
Now turning to the outlook. We expect Q2 sales growth of 1% to 3%. Airwave revenue is expected to be approximately $130 million. We expect Q2 non-GAAP EPS between $0.82 and $0.88. Our view of the full -- of full year 2016 outlook remains unchanged at 5% to 7% sales growth. We also expect non-GAAP EPS of $4.45 to $4.65. Airwave is expected to be approximately $450 million in revenue.
Moving to regional results. North America grew 2%, driven by both product and services demand. Demand for both Managed & Support services as well as APX device sales were key growth drivers in North America. Backlog growth was once again very strong in services, with an increase of approximately $500 million from last year. Additionally, product backlog was up $23 million sequentially. We remain on track for growth for the year.
Latin America was down 42% on continued challenging macroeconomic conditions, the impact of a stronger dollar and iDEN declines. While the macro environment has clearly impacted the channel business and demand for larger systems, our overall margins within the region remain solid. We have adjusted sales coverage on key accounts and continue to support our partners and customers during the downturn.
EMEA was up 1%, inclusive of $61 million of Airwave revenue, offset by declines associated with the Norway project, pockets of channel weakness and currency headwinds.
Asia Pac declined by 4% on currency headwinds and expected softness in China. Excluding currency, Asia Pac grew 1%, with a strong quarter of Managed & Support services revenue growth.
I'd also like to share some brief segment highlights. In our Products segment, some of the notable awards won during the quarter include: a $42 million contract with Montgomery County, Maryland to upgrade their P25 network to the latest release; a $23 million contract in Central Africa for a nationwide P25 system; a $25 million order with a North African nation for our latest MOTOTRBO trunking solutions; and we won another Public Safety LTE contract with the United Nations for a deployable LTE system and devices.
Highlights from our Services business include the award of a significant and strategic contract in the U.K. to provide Wave 7000 interoperability between the existing Airwave LMR network and the new ESN LTE network when operational. We won a large multi-year maintenance and software upgrade contract with a large U.S. utility customer that utilizes our full suite of services.
And finally, our Smart Public Safety momentum continues with strong double-digit revenue growth and continued innovation. New offerings include CommandCentral software to help public safety in the command and control center with realtime operational views, situational awareness in the field and improved decision-making.
New wins in Smart Public Safety include several Emergency CallWorks awards that bring next-generation 911 capabilities to public safety answering points.
I would now like to turn the call back over to Greg."

And working capital, working capital was a source of cash in Q1 '16, just not as large of a source as it was in Q1 of '15.

I'd like to make a few opening comments about the second quarter and the year-over-year overall business before Gino takes us through the results and outlook. First, Q2 was a strong quarter of earnings, cash flow generation and backlog growth compared to last year. With a growing product backlog and healthy pipeline, we're well positioned for the second half of the year and we'll continue to focus on revenue and operational efficiency. Second, our services business continues to execute, growing 26% including Airwave, while our Managed & Support business grew 4% organically. And we're proceeding full steam ahead with the integration of Airwave after recently receiving unconditional clearance from the U.K. Competition and Markets Authority just a few weeks ago. 
And finally, today we announced the $2 billion increase to our share repurchase authorization. This follows $11.6 billion in total repurchases over the past 5 years, driving a 51% share count reduction. The steady improvement in our business and continued Managed & Support services growth will generate strong earnings and cash flow driving total shareholder return. 
I'll now turn the call over to Gino to provide additional details on our second quarter results and outlook before returning to provide some closing thoughts."

Second quarter results include revenue of $1.4 billion, up 5% versus last year including Airwave revenue of $146 million; GAAP operating earnings of $224 million; non-GAAP operating earnings of $324 million or 22.7% of sales, up 370 basis",1005,"Thank you, Greg. Second quarter results include revenue of $1.4 billion, up 5% versus last year including Airwave revenue of $146 million; GAAP operating earnings of $224 million; non-GAAP operating earnings of $324 million or 22.7% of sales, up 370 basis points from the year ago quarter. GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.61 compared to $0.72 in the second quarter of 2015. 
Non-GAAP EPS was $1.03 which represents a 51% year-over-year increase. The earnings per share growth was driven by Airwave, continued cost savings and reduced share count. Ending backlog was up $2.2 billion from a year ago. Services is up $2.1 billion on $1.6 billion from Airwave as well as Managed & Support services growth in North America. The product segment backlog was up $64 million, also driven by North America. For the remainder of the call, we will reference non-GAAP financial results including those in our outlook. 
As expected, Q2 product sales were down 8% from the prior year at $801 million. The majority of the decline was due to weakness in Latin America, parts of Europe and China. Q2 product segment operating income was $176 million or 22% of sales, up 170 basis points versus last year, driven by steady margins and a lower cost structure. Product segment backlog ended the quarter at $1.3 billion, up $64 million from last year and up $82 million sequentially. Deal flow and orders have been solid, particularly in North America, supporting our expectations for product revenue growth in the second half. 
Turning to services. Q2 services revenue was $629 million, up 26% including Airwave. In Q2, Managed & Support services comprised approximately 30% of total MSI revenue. Organically, Managed & Support services grew 4% during the quarter. Services operating income was $148 million or 23.5% of revenue, up 670 basis points from the prior year. Services backlog ended at $6.9 billion, up $2.2 billion versus last year. The backlog growth is attributed to $1.6 billion of Airwave in EMEA and an increase of over $500 million in North America. Sequentially, services backlog decreased $214 million including a $170 million FX adjustment related mostly to the British pound. 
Total OpEx from continuing operations was $362 million, down $31 million or 8% from the year ago quarter, driven primarily by continued cost reduction activities. Other income and expense was $57 million compared to $39 million in the year ago quarter. Net interest expense was $54 million compared to $39 million a year ago. 
Q2 operating cash flow was $292 million, an increase of $143 million over the prior year, driven by improved working capital and higher earnings. Free cash flow was $201 million. We ended Q2 in a net debt position of $3.5 billion. We repurchased $555 million of stock during the quarter at an average price of $68.37. And finally, we paid dividends of $72 million in the quarter. 
Turning to our outlook. We expect Q3 sales growth of 6% to 7% including $130 million from Airwave. We expect to 3 non-GAAP EPS between $1.17 and $1.22. Our view of the full year outlook remains unchanged. Revenue growth of 5% to 7% and non-GAAP EPS of $4.45 to $4.65; operating expenses of approximately $1.45 billion, a reduction of $120 million inclusive of the additional Airwave OpEx. Full year effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 33%. Operating cash flow of approximately $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion and $4.75 to $5 of free cash flow per share for the full year. 
Moving to regional results. North America for [indiscernible] as expected we revenue down slightly at 1% versus a strong quarter a year ago. Demand for our Managed & Support services continues to drive multi-year contract wins while backlog growth in both product and services supports our expectation of growth in the region in the second half and for the full year. As expected, Latin America was down 36% or $34 million on continued challenging macroeconomic conditions and item [ph] declines. While we expect the region to remain challenged, the business is stabilizing and we are encouraged with the recent large order of $28 million. 
EMEA was up 47% inclusive of Airwave. Excluding Airwave, the region was down 17% primarily related to lower Norway installation revenue and weakness in Eastern Europe. Asia Pac declined 2% on currency headwinds and a decline in China. Excluding currency, Asia Pac grew 1%, driven primarily by growth in Australia. 
I'd also like to share some brief segment highlights. In our product segment, we continue to innovate with several key product launches and customer-focused solutions including the launch of several new radios including a low-cost digital vertex radio addressing the low end of the channel as well as a new high tier TETRA radio. We also announced the addition of the Wave 7000 solution to our software portfolio. Wave 7000 software enhances workgroup communication with high-availability push-to-talk, linking users across LMR and LTE networks regardless of radio, smartphone tablet or other device. 
In our P25 [indiscernible] portfolio, we won several large systems deals including a $200 million multicounty award in the Richmond, Virginia area. We also received a $44 million order from a North America utility customer. And in July, we won a $28 million order in Latin America, the first deal in the region over $10 million in the past 6 quarters. 
In our services business, we launched WAVE Cloud Connect in Australia. This SaaS cloud-based solution leverages Wave 7000 to deliver broadband-based secure push-to-talk communications connecting LMR networks with smartphones and tablets. In our Managed & Support services business, we are proceeding with the integration of Airwave following the unconditional clearance from the U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority. We secured many large services deals including a $19 [ph] million renewal to extend services with a key customer in Australia. And in the command center, we received multiple orders in North America for software, services and application, providing customers with advanced analytics and operational intelligence. 
I would now like to turn the call back over to Greg."

But in general, to give you some regional color, North America in the second half, which is obviously our biggest region, as we said all along, North America will grow in 2016. Product pipeline, as well as services, pipeline looks strong. We talked about Latin America, and again Latin America, is less than 5% of our overall revenue, again less pressure in the second half due to comps. We also believe we've derisked a lot of large projects there. And I think on the bright side, we see Southern and Latin America improving. We see the business in Mexico stabilizing. And I think the big point there is in spite of some of the headwinds we faced in the last 12 months, we've maintained our investment in the region. And we think we've got -- we've created a good level of demand that we'll fulfill here in the future. When we think about EMEA, which I just commented on, Europe, Middle East and Africa, again, our comps ease in Europe. There is a fair level even in spite of oil in the Middle East, the business remains strong. I think one point of emphasis here will be in Africa. Africa is an area -- really what I would say is an area that we've invested in. We're investing in more significantly in go-to-market. we've shored up some lower or kind of our lower end of our portfolio of product that we think is very attractive in the African market. And then as we start to pivot to Asia Pac, Asia Pac is -- actually it's been a good new story. In constant currency last year, it grew 8%. It'll be up this year in constant currency, particularly -- and again as Gino highlighted in the opening in Australia. I will tell you, China, China is less than 3% [ph] of our company's revenue. 2016 will be a challenging year, but we've got really suppressed expectations candidly about China just due to some of the preference that I think the Chinese government has towards some of the indigenous providers. So I think that's probably a summary of the flyover as we see it regionally around the world."

It's certainly a lot slower and less material than we thought 3 years ago, just to reference a point, or even when the legislation was passed in the middle-class jobs really [indiscernible] in 2012 that was U.S.-centric. I think it's for a combination of reasons. Countries have to develop and allocate the spectrum. You've got to line up the appropriate funding. I do think, though, we're very uniquely positioned positively better than anybody, quite frankly. And I say that as a reflection of our knowledge and expertise in P25 and TETRA LMR and the complexities in customization that go with that and the interoperability and interconnection required of LMR platforms, whether they'd be P25 or TETRA, to the additive broadband network that gets deployed. I think it would span services, some applications, devices. I don't see consumer smartphones replacing mission-critical radios for a whole host of reasons around power management, spectrum, efficiency, group talk as well as things that are embedded in the 3GPP standard and so many other things that would be required for that to happen. So I think Public Safety LTE is a good opportunity for this company. I think it's additive to our LMR business. I don't think it's substitutional or cannibalizing in the future. I just don't see that, and I don't think it's a reflection of our head in the sand. I really don't because we push ourselves constantly here and challenge each other. It's a direct reflection of what we're hearing from our customers, and it's worth reminding in L.A., we are building an LMR system at the same time and updating an LMR system right now at the same time TS LTE is being deployed. That's also true in the U.K., which you know about the commitment of a multi-year fixed price contract with Airwave and the eventual migration to ESN. And we'll see how quickly that happens and in what complementary nature ultimately that gets rolled out in. And the 2 Middle East customers right as we speak are investing in LMR and Public Safety LTE, and we're getting service contracts that are multi-year, 10, 15 years-plus. So the customers are speaking and the market's speaking, and we're going to seize on both those opportunities. So Public Safety LTE is more muted, again $130 million last year comparable this year. I would guess it's comparable maybe slightly up next year as we round out those implementations. But between infrastructure, devices, applications and the interconnection to make the end-to-end system work, I think we're well positioned."

So I think about -- the second question to the projects, I think dimensionalize it 2 ways, there's 2 things. Most of these products, one -- by the way projects we are proud to have won the Richmond area we talked about. We spoke about King County last year in the state of Iowa, these are essentially multi--- we talked about, it could be hundreds of sites. And so each and every one of those sites kind of has a life story themselves, meaning civil, permitting and environmental, OSHA, those kinds of requirements that tend to have a longer duration. So we typically think of those things taken anywhere from 12 to really 2 years of revenue to get through all the revenue things. SO that's the first piece of it. And then typically within those -- also within those contracts, there's a device component, and those things are more actionable and we can work with customers to pull those in for revenue. But ultimately, each project is its own dimension. A lot of them are civil and site-related, longer duration. The second piece of it is devices. We can typically action those with customers in a quicker fashion. And then the last element of them is obviously the multi-year support. And I think it's noteworthy because it's been brought up a few times today, but every -- basically every customer in North America and typically in a lot of different countries overseas now doesn't enter into an agreement until they think about it at least 5 years and with customers have gone up to 20 years of lifecycle in Managed & Support service agreements. So those obviously have a longer duration in those revenue every year. So I think that probably answers your question."

I'd like to make a few opening comments about the second quarter and the overall business before Gino takes us through the results and outlook. First, Q2 was a strong quarter of earnings, cash flow generation and backlog growth compared to last year. With a growing product backlog and healthy pipeline, we're well positioned for the second half of the year, and we'll continue to focus on revenue and operational efficiency. Second, our services business continues to execute, growing 26% including Airwave, while our Managed & Support business grew 4% organically. And we're proceeding full steam ahead with the integration of Airwave after recently receiving unconditional clearance from the U.K. Competition and Markets Authority just a few weeks ago.
And finally, today we announced the $2 billion increase to our share repurchase authorization. This follows $11.6 billion in total repurchases over the past 5 years, driving a 51% share count reduction. The steady improvement in our business and continued Managed & Support services growth will generate strong earnings and cash flow, driving total shareholder return.
I'll now turn the call over to Gino to provide additional details on our second quarter results and outlook before returning to provide some closing thoughts."

Second quarter results include revenue of $1.4 billion, up 5% versus last year including Airwave revenue of $146 million. GAAP operating earnings of $224 million.

Second quarter results include revenue of $1.4 billion, up 5% versus last year including Airwave revenue of $146 million. GAAP operating earnings of $224 million. Non-GAAP operating earnings of $324 million or 22.7% of sales, up 370 basis points from the year ago quarter. GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.61 compared to $0.72 in the second quarter of 2015.
Non-GAAP EPS was $1.03, which represents a 51% year-over-year increase. The earnings per share growth was driven by Airwave, continued cost savings and reduced share count. Ending backlog was up $2.2 billion from a year ago. Services is up $2.1 billion on $1.6 billion from Airwave as well as Managed & Support services growth in North America. The product segment backlog was up $64 million, also driven by North America. For the remainder of the call, we will reference non-GAAP financial results including those in our outlook.
As expected, Q2 product sales were down 8% from the prior year at $801 million. The majority of the decline was due to weakness in Latin America, parts of Europe and China. Q2 product segment operating income was $176 million or 22% of sales, up 170 basis points versus last year, driven by steady margins and a lower cost structure. Product segment backlog ended the quarter at $1.3 billion, up $64 million from last year and up $82 million sequentially. Deal flow and orders had been solid, particularly in North America, supporting our expectations for product revenue growth in the second half.
Turning to services. Q2 services revenue was $629 million, up 26% including Airwave. In Q2, Managed & Support services comprised approximately 30% of total MSI revenue. Organically, Managed & Support services grew 4% during the quarter. Services operating income was $148 million or 23.5% of revenue, up 670 basis points from the prior year. Services backlog ended at $6.9 billion, up $2.2 billion versus last year. The backlog growth is attributed to $1.6 billion of Airwave in EMEA and an increase of over $500 million in North America. Sequentially, services backlog decreased $214 million including a $170 million FX adjustment related mostly to the British pound.
Total OpEx from continuing operations was $362 million, down $31 million or 8% from the year ago quarter, driven primarily by continued cost reduction activities. Other income and expense was $57 million compared to $39 million in the year ago quarter. Net interest expense was $54 million compared to $39 million a year ago.
Q2 operating cash flow was $292 million, an increase of $143 million over the prior year, driven by improved working capital and higher earnings. Free cash flow was $201 million. We ended Q2 in a net debt position of $3.5 billion. We repurchased $555 million of stock during the quarter at an average price of $68.37. And finally, we paid dividends of $72 million in the quarter.
Turning to our outlook. We expect Q3 sales growth of 6% to 7% including $130 million from Airwave. We expect Q3 non-GAAP EPS between $1.17 and $1.22. Our view of the full year outlook remains unchanged. Revenue growth of 5% to 7% and non-GAAP EPS of $4.45 to $4.65. Operating expenses of approximately $1.45 billion, a reduction of $120 million inclusive of the additional Airwave OpEx. Full year effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 33%. Operating cash flow of approximately $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion and $4.75 to $5 of free cash flow per share for the full year.
Moving to regional results. North America for [indiscernible] as expected with revenue down slightly at 1% versus a strong quarter a year ago. Demand for our Managed & Support services continues to drive multiyear contract wins, while backlog growth in both product and services supports our expectation of growth in the region in the second half and for the full year. As expected, Latin America was down 36% or $34 million on continued challenging macroeconomic conditions and heightened declines. While we expect the region to remain challenged, the business is stabilizing, and we are encouraged with the recent large order of $28 million.
EMEA was up 47% inclusive of Airwave. Excluding Airwave, the region was down 17%, primarily related to lower -- Norway installation revenue and weakness in Eastern Europe. Asia Pac declined 2% on currency headwinds and a decline in China. Excluding currency, Asia Pac grew 1%, driven primarily by growth in Australia. 
I'd also like to share some brief segment highlights. In our product segment, we continue to innovate with several key product launches and customer-focused solutions, including the launch of several new radios including a low-cost digital vertex radio addressing the low end of the channel as well as a new high-tier TETRA radio. We also announced the addition of the Wave 7000 solution to our software portfolio. Wave 7000 software enhances workgroup communication with high-availability push-to-talk, linking users across LMR and LTE networks regardless of radio, smartphone, tablet or other device.
In our P25 ASTRO portfolio, we won several large systems deals, including a $200 million multicounty award in the Richmond, Virginia area. We also received a $44 million order from a North America utility customer. And in July, we won a $28 million order in Latin America, the first deal in the region over $10 million in the past 6 quarters.
In our Services business, we launched WAVE Cloud Connect in Australia. This SaaS cloud-based solution leverages Wave 7000 to deliver broadband-based secure push-to-talk communications, connecting LMR networks with smartphones and tablets. In our Managed & Support services business, we are proceeding with the integration of Airwave following the unconditional clearance from the U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority. We secured many large services deals including a $19 million renewal to extend services with a key customer in Australia. And in the command center, we received multiple orders in North America for software, services and application, providing customers with advanced analytics and operational intelligence.
I would now like to turn the call back over to Greg."

With respect to the $146 million to $130 million, that is entirely due to the pound. There's no change to the contract. The contract is fixed. We continue to expect $450 million of revenue for the full year. The prior estimate we gave was a prudent conservative estimate based on a couple of things, uncertainty around Brexit and completion of the purchase accounting and the deferred revenue calculation. So our expectation continues to be $450 million of revenue. The contract is fixed, and $146 million to $130 million is entirely a result of the pound."

But in general, to give you some regional color, North America in the second half, which is obviously our biggest region, as we said all along, North America will grow in 2016. Product pipeline as well as Services pipeline looks strong. We talked about Latin America, and again Latin America, is less than 5% of our overall revenue, again, less pressure in the second half due to comps. We also believe we've derisked a lot of large projects there. And I think on the bright side, we see Southern and Latin America improving. We see the business in Mexico is stabilizing. And I think the big point there is in spite of some of the headwinds we faced in the last 12 months, we've maintained our investment in the region. And we think we've got -- we've created a good level of demand that we'll fulfill here in the future. When we think about EMEA, which I just commented on, Europe, Middle East and Africa, again, our comps ease in Europe. There is a fair level even in spite of oil in the Middle East, the business remains strong. I think one point of emphasis here will be in Africa. Africa is an area -- really what I would say is an area that we've invested in. We're investing in more significantly in go-to-market. we've shored up some lower end -- or kind of our lower end of our portfolio of product that we think is very attractive in the African market. And then as we start to pivot to Asia Pac, Asia Pac is -- actually it's been a good new story. In constant currency, last year, it grew 8%. It'll be up this year in constant currency, particularly -- and again as Gino highlighted in the opening in Australia. I will tell you, China, China is less than 3% of our company's revenue. 2016 will be a challenging year. But we've got really suppressed expectations candidly about China just due to some of the preference that I think the Chinese government has towards some of the indigenous providers. So I think that's probably a summary of the flyover as we see it regionally around the world."

It's certainly a lot slower and less material than we thought 3 years ago, just to reference a point, or even when the legislation was passed in the middle-class jobs really [indiscernible] in 2012 that was U.S.-centric. I think it's for a combination of reasons. Countries have to develop and allocate the spectrum. You've got to line up the appropriate funding. I do think, though, we're very uniquely positioned, positively, better than anybody, quite frankly. And I say that as a reflection of our knowledge and expertise in P25 and TETRA LMR, and the complexities in customization that go with that, and the interoperability and interconnection required of LMR platforms, whether they'd be P25 or TETRA to the additive broadband network that gets deployed. I think it would span services, some applications, devices. I don't see consumer smartphones replacing mission-critical radios for a whole host of reasons around power management, spectrum, efficiency, group talk as well as things that are embedded in the 3GPP standard, and so many other things that would be required for that to happen. So I think Public Safety LTE is a good opportunity for this company. I think it's additive to our LMR business. I don't think it's substitutional or cannibalizing in the future. I just don't see that, and I don't think it's a reflection of our head in the sand. I really don't because we push ourselves constantly here and challenge each other. It's a direct reflection of what we're hearing from our customers. And it's worth reminding in L.A., we are building an LMR system at the same time and updating an LMR system right now. At the same time, PS LTE is being deployed. That's also true in the U.K., which you know about the commitment to multiyear fixed price contract with Airwave and the eventual migration to ESN. And we'll see how quickly that happens and in what complementary nature ultimately that gets rolled out in. And the 2 Middle East customers, right as we speak, are investing in LMR and Public Safety LTE. And we're getting service contracts that are multiyear, 10, 15 years-plus. So the customers are speaking and the market's speaking, and we're going to seize on both those opportunities. So Public Safety LTE is more muted, again $130 million last year comparable this year, I would guess it's comparable maybe, maybe slightly up next year as we round out those implementations. But between infrastructure, devices, applications and the interconnection to make the end-to-end system work, I think we're well positioned."

Is there something built into that contract that it's booked and recognized this year already, so the pound movement doesn't influence it? Or is there something else that plays into that?"

The reason our guidance on Airwave revenue of $450 million is unchanged despite the contraction in the pound is the tip of the hat to [indiscernible] tell you in the finance team because as we modeled [indiscernible] and the team modeled different scenarios, right at the close of the acquisition, we knew that there was uncertainty out there with Brexit. We wanted to get the contract in hand. We wanted to get the organization integrated, so Gino and team were prudent. So even with the pound contraction of about 15%, maybe 16%, since that Airwave acquisition was done, we're not changing our revenue guidance of approximately $450 million. At this point, given the spot rate in the pound, we would expect Airwave revenue to grow next year because we have 12 months of revenue recognition versus 10."

So I think the second bend to the second question around projects, I think of -- dimensionalize it 2 ways. There's 2 things. Most of these projects, one -- by the way, projects, we are proud to have won, the Richmond area that we talked about, we spoke about King County last year in the state of Iowa. These are essentially multi -- we talked about -- they could be hundreds of sites. And so each and every one of those sites kind of has a life story themselves, meaning civil, permitting, environmental, OSHA, those kinds of requirements that tend to have longer duration. So we typically think of those things taken anywhere from 12 to really 2 years to revenue to get through all the revenuable things. That's the first piece of it. And then typically within those -- also within those contracts, there's a device component. And those things are more actionable, and we can work with customers to pull those in for revenue. But ultimately, each project has its own dimension. A lot of them are civil and site-related, longer duration. The second piece of it is devices. We can typically action those with customers in a quicker fashion. And then the last element of them is obviously the multiyear support. And I think it's noteworthy because it's been brought up a few times today, but every -- basically every customer in North America and typically in a lot of different countries overseas now doesn't enter into an agreement until they think about it at least 5 years. We've had customers that have gone up to 20 years of lifecycle in Managed & Support service agreements. So those, obviously, even have a longer duration in those revenue every year. So I think that probably answers your question."

I'd like to make a few opening comments about the second quarter and the overall business before Gino takes us through the results and outlook. First, Q2 was a strong quarter of earnings, cash flow generation and backlog growth compared to last year. With a growing product backlog and healthy pipeline, we're well positioned for the second half of the year, and we'll continue to focus on revenue and operational efficiency. Second, our services business continues to execute, growing 26% including Airwave, while our Managed & Support business grew 4% organically. And we're proceeding full steam ahead with the integration of Airwave after recently receiving unconditional clearance from the U.K. Competition and Markets Authority just a few weeks ago.
And finally, today we announced the $2 billion increase to our share repurchase authorization. This follows $11.6 billion in total repurchases over the past 5 years, driving a 51% share count reduction. The steady improvement in our business and continued Managed & Support services growth will generate strong earnings and cash flow, driving total shareholder return.
I'll now turn the call over to Gino to provide additional details on our second quarter results and outlook before returning to provide some closing thoughts."

Second quarter results include revenue of $1.4 billion, up 5% versus last year, including Airwave revenue of $146 million. GAAP operating earnings of $224 million. Non-GAAP operating earnings of $324 million or 22.7% of sales, up 370 basi",1000,"Thank you, Greg. Second quarter results include revenue of $1.4 billion, up 5% versus last year, including Airwave revenue of $146 million. GAAP operating earnings of $224 million. Non-GAAP operating earnings of $324 million or 22.7% of sales, up 370 basis points from the year ago quarter. GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.61 compared to $0.72 in the second quarter of 2015.
Non-GAAP EPS was $1.03, which represents a 51% year-over-year increase. The earnings per share growth was driven by Airwave, continued cost savings and reduced share count. Ending backlog was up $2.2 billion from a year ago. Services is up $2.1 billion on $1.6 billion from Airwave as well as Managed & Support services growth in North America. The product segment backlog was up $64 million, also driven by North America. For the remainder of the call, we will reference non-GAAP financial results including those in our outlook.
As expected, Q2 product sales were down 8% from the prior year at $801 million. The majority of the decline was due to weakness in Latin America, parts of Europe and China. Q2 product segment operating income was $176 million or 22% of sales, up 170 basis points versus last year, driven by steady margins and a lower cost structure. Product segment backlog ended the quarter at $1.3 billion, up $64 million from last year and up $82 million sequentially. Deal flow and orders had been solid, particularly in North America, supporting our expectations for product revenue growth in the second half.
Turning to services. Q2 services revenue was $629 million, up 26% including Airwave. In Q2, Managed & Support services comprised approximately 30% of total MSI revenue. Organically, Managed & Support services grew 4% during the quarter. Services operating income was $148 million or 23.5% of revenue, up 670 basis points from the prior year. Services backlog ended at $6.9 billion, up $2.2 billion versus last year. The backlog growth is attributed to $1.6 billion of Airwave in EMEA and an increase of over $500 million in North America. Sequentially, services backlog decreased $214 million including a $170 million FX adjustment related mostly to the British pound.
Total OpEx from continuing operations was $362 million, down $31 million or 8% from the year ago quarter, driven primarily by continued cost reduction activities. Other income and expense was $57 million compared to $39 million in the year ago quarter. Net interest expense was $54 million compared to $39 million a year ago.
Q2 operating cash flow was $292 million, an increase of $143 million over the prior year, driven by improved working capital and higher earnings. Free cash flow was $201 million. We ended Q2 in a net debt position of $3.5 billion. We repurchased $555 million of stock during the quarter at an average price of $68.37. And finally, we paid dividends of $72 million in the quarter.
Turning to our outlook. We expect Q3 sales growth of 6% to 7% including $130 million from Airwave. We expect Q3 non-GAAP EPS between $1.17 and $1.22. Our view of the full year outlook remains unchanged. Revenue growth of 5% to 7% and non-GAAP EPS of $4.45 to $4.65. Operating expenses of approximately $1.45 billion, a reduction of $120 million inclusive of the additional Airwave OpEx. Full year effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 33%. Operating cash flow of approximately $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion and $4.75 to $5 of free cash flow per share for the full year.
Moving to regional results. North America performed as expected with revenue down slightly at 1% versus a strong quarter a year ago. Demand for our Managed & Support services continues to drive multiyear contract wins, while backlog growth in both products and services supports our expectation of growth in the region in the second half and for the full year. As expected, Latin America was down 36% or $34 million on continued challenging macroeconomic conditions and iDEN declines. While we expect the region to remain challenged, the business is stabilizing, and we are encouraged with the recent large order of $28 million.
EMEA was up 47% inclusive of Airwave. Excluding Airwave, the region was down 17%, primarily related to lower Norway installation revenue and weakness in Eastern Europe. Asia Pac declined 2% on currency headwinds and a decline in China. Excluding currency, Asia Pac grew 1%, driven primarily by growth in Australia. 
I'd also like to share some brief segment highlights. In our product segment, we continued to innovate with several key product launches and customer-focused solutions, including the launch of several new radios including a low-cost digital vertex radio addressing the low end of the channel as well as a new high-tier TETRA radio. We also announced the addition of the Wave 7000 solution to our software portfolio. Wave 7000 software enhances workgroup communication with high-availability push-to-talk, linking users across LMR and LTE networks regardless of radio, smartphone, tablet or other device.
In our P25 ASTRO portfolio, we won several large systems deals, including a $200 million multicounty award in the Richmond, Virginia area. We also received a $44 million order from a North America utility customer. And in July, we won a $28 million order in Latin America, the first deal in the region over $10 million in the past 6 quarters.
In our Services business, we launched WAVE Cloud Connect in Australia. This SaaS cloud-based solution leverages Wave 7000 to deliver broadband-based secure push-to-talk communications, connecting LMR networks with smartphones and tablets. In our Managed & Support services business, we are proceeding with the integration of Airwave following the unconditional clearance from the U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority. We secured many large services deals including a $19 million renewal to extend services with a key customer in Australia. And in the command center, we received multiple orders in North America for software, services and application, providing customers with advanced analytics and operational intelligence.
I would now like to turn the call back over to Greg."

In composite, over the last 5 years, we have repurchased $11.6 billion, as I mentioned, a 51% reduction in share count at an average price of $57.58.

And then specifically, I guess Rivada Networks has an agreement with a number of industry players, Motorola not one of them. And what I'm wondering in that regard is given your share of embedded systems on P25, is there a conceivable way to integrate with those systems without having Motorola involved in some form or fashion?"

With respect to the $146 million to $130 million, that is entirely due to the pound. There's no change to the contract. The contract is fixed. We continue to expect $450 million of revenue for the full year. The prior estimate we gave was a prudent, conservative estimate based on a couple of things, uncertainty around Brexit and completion of the purchase accounting and the deferred revenue calculation. So our expectation continues to be $450 million of revenue. The contract is fixed, and $146 million to $130 million is entirely a result of the pound."

But in general, to give you some regional color, North America in the second half, which is obviously our biggest region, as we said all along, North America will grow in 2016. Product pipeline as well as Services pipeline looks strong. We talked about Latin America, and again Latin America, is less than 5% of our overall revenue, again, less pressure in the second half due to comps. We also believe we've derisked a lot of large projects there. And I think on the bright side, we see Southern and Latin America improving. We see the business in Mexico stabilizing. And I think the big point there is in spite of some of the headwinds we faced in the last 12 months, we've maintained our investment in the region. And we think we've got -- we've created a good level of demand that we'll fulfill here in the future. When we think about EMEA, which I just commented on, Europe, Middle East and Africa, again, our comps ease in Europe. There is a fair level even in spite of oil in the Middle East, the business remains strong. I think one point of emphasis here would be in Africa. Africa is an area -- really what I would say is an area that we've invested in. We're investing in more significantly in go-to-market. We've shored up some lower end -- or kind of our lower end of our portfolio of product that we think is very attractive in the African market. And then as we start to pivot to Asia Pac, Asia Pac is -- actually it's been a good new story. In constant currency, last year, it grew 8%. It'll be up this year in constant currency, particularly -- and again as Gino highlighted in the opening in Australia. I will tell you, China, China is less than 3% of our company's revenue. 2016 will be a challenging year. But we've got really suppressed expectations candidly about China just due to some of the preference that I think the Chinese government has towards some of the indigenous providers. So I think that's probably a summary of the flyover as we see it regionally around the world."

It's certainly a lot slower and less material than we thought 3 years ago, just to reference a point, or even when the legislation was passed in the middle-class jobs relief act in 2012 that was U.S.-centric. I think it's for a combination of reasons. Countries have to develop and allocate the spectrum. You've got to line up the appropriate funding. I do think, though, we're very uniquely positioned, positively, better than anybody, quite frankly. And I say that as a reflection of our knowledge and expertise in P25 and TETRA LMR, and the complexities in customization that go with that, and the interoperability and interconnection required of LMR platforms, whether they'd be P25 or TETRA to the additive broadband network that gets deployed. I think it would span services, some applications, devices. I don't see consumer smartphones replacing mission-critical radios for a whole host of reasons around power management, spectrum, efficiency, group talk as well as things that are embedded in the 3GPP standard, and so many other things that would be required for that to happen. So I think Public Safety LTE is a good opportunity for this company. I think it's additive to our LMR business. I don't think it's substitutional or cannibalizing in the future. I just don't see that, and I don't think it's a reflection of our head in the sand. I really don't because we push ourselves constantly here and challenge each other. It's a direct reflection of what we're hearing from our customers. And it's worth reminding in L.A., we are building an LMR system at the same time and updating an LMR system right now, at the same time PS LTE is being deployed. That's also true in the U.K., which you know about the commitment to multiyear fixed price contract with Airwave and the eventual migration to ESN. And we'll see how quickly that happens and in what complementary nature ultimately that gets rolled out in. And the 2 Middle East customers, right as we speak, are investing in LMR and Public Safety LTE. And we're getting service contracts that are multiyear, 10, 15 years-plus. So the customers are speaking and the market's speaking, and we're going to seize on both those opportunities. So Public Safety LTE is more muted, again $130 million last year, comparable this year. I would guess it's comparable maybe, maybe slightly up next year as we round out those implementations. But between infrastructure, devices, applications and the interconnection to make the end-to-end system work, I think we're well positioned."

How do you view the average duration of your contracts? Is there a pattern? Are they extending -- there has been this percentage figure you disclosed in your 10-K of the percentage of backlog that you recognized in subsequent years has actually been declining. So I'm trying to see if there's a read-through there. And then final piece, curious why Airwave revenue sees no adjustment this year, but does the adjustment in future years. Is there something built into that contract that it's booked and recognized this year already, so the pound movement doesn't influence it? Or is there something else that plays into that?"

The reason our guidance on Airwave revenue of $450 million is unchanged despite the contraction in the pound is the tip of the hat to Bonanotte and the finance team because as we modeled -- he and the team modeled different scenarios, right at the close of the acquisition, we knew that there was uncertainty out there with Brexit. We wanted to get the contract in hand. We wanted to get the organization integrated, so Gino and team were prudent. So even with the pound contraction of about 15%, maybe 16%, since that Airwave acquisition was done, we're not changing our revenue guidance of approximately $450 million. At this point, given the spot rate in the pound, we would expect Airwave revenue to grow next year because we have 12 months of revenue recognition versus 10."

So I think the second -- Ben, to the second question around projects, I think of -- dimensionalize it 2 ways. There's 2 things. Most of these projects, one -- by the way, projects we are proud to have won, the Richmond area that we talked about, we spoke about King County last year in the state of Iowa. These are essentially multi -- we talked about -- they could be hundreds of sites. And so each and every one of those sites kind of has a life story themselves, meaning civil, permitting, environmental, OSHA, those kinds of requirements that tend to have longer duration. So we typically think of those things taken anywhere from 12 to really 2 years to revenue to get through all the revenue-able things. That's the first piece of it. And then typically within those -- also within those contracts, there's a device component. And those things are more actionable, and we can work with customers to pull those in for revenue. But ultimately, each project has its own dimension. A lot of them are civil and site-related, longer duration. The second piece of it is devices. We can typically action those with customers in a quicker fashion. And then the last element of them is obviously the multiyear support. And I think it's noteworthy because it's been brought up a few times today, but every -- basically every customer in North America and typically in a lot of different countries overseas now doesn't enter into an agreement until they think about at least 5 years. We've had customers that have gone up to 20 years of lifecycle in Managed & Support service agreements. So those, obviously, even have a longer duration in those revenue every year. So I think that probably answers your question."

I'd like to make a few opening comments about the second quarter and the overall business before Gino takes us through the results and outlook. First, Q2 was a strong quarter of earnings, cash flow generation and backlog growth compared to last year. With a growing product backlog and healthy pipeline, we're well positioned for the second half of the year, and we'll continue to focus on revenue and operational efficiency. Second, our services business continues to execute, growing 26% including Airwave, while our Managed & Support business grew 4% organically. And we're proceeding full steam ahead with the integration of Airwave after recently receiving unconditional clearance from the U.K. Competition and Markets Authority just a few weeks ago.
And finally, today we announced the $2 billion increase to our share repurchase authorization. This follows $11.6 billion in total repurchases over the past 5 years, driving a 51% share count reduction. The steady improvement in our business and continued Managed & Support services growth will generate strong earnings and cash flow, driving total shareholder return.
I'll now turn the call over to Gino to provide additional details on our second quarter results and outlook before returning to provide some closing thoughts."

Second quarter results include revenue of $1.4 billion, up 5% versus last year, including Airwave revenue of $146 million. GAAP operating earnings of $224 million.

Second quarter results include revenue of $1.4 billion, up 5% versus last year, including Airwave revenue of $146 million. GAAP operating earnings of $224 million. Non-GAAP operating earnings of $324 million or 22.7% of sales, up 370 basis points from the year ago quarter. GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.61 compared to $0.72 in the second quarter of 2015.
Non-GAAP EPS was $1.03, which represents a 51% year-over-year increase. The earnings per share growth was driven by Airwave, continued cost savings and reduced share count. Ending backlog was up $2.2 billion from a year ago. Services is up $2.1 billion on $1.6 billion from Airwave as well as Managed & Support services growth in North America. The product segment backlog was up $64 million, also driven by North America. For the remainder of the call, we will reference non-GAAP financial results including those in our outlook.
As expected, Q2 product sales were down 8% from the prior year at $801 million. The majority of the decline was due to weakness in Latin America, parts of Europe and China. Q2 product segment operating income was $176 million or 22% of sales, up 170 basis points versus last year, driven by steady margins and a lower cost structure. Product segment backlog ended the quarter at $1.3 billion, up $64 million from last year and up $82 million sequentially. Deal flow and orders had been solid, particularly in North America, supporting our expectations for product revenue growth in the second half.
Turning to services. Q2 services revenue was $629 million, up 26% including Airwave. In Q2, Managed & Support services comprised approximately 30% of total MSI revenue. Organically, Managed & Support services grew 4% during the quarter. Services operating income was $148 million or 23.5% of revenue, up 670 basis points from the prior year. Services backlog ended at $6.9 billion, up $2.2 billion versus last year. The backlog growth is attributed to $1.6 billion of Airwave in EMEA and an increase of over $500 million in North America. Sequentially, services backlog decreased $214 million including a $170 million FX adjustment related mostly to the British pound.
Total OpEx from continuing operations was $362 million, down $31 million or 8% from the year ago quarter, driven primarily by continued cost reduction activities. Other income and expense was $57 million compared to $39 million in the year ago quarter. Net interest expense was $54 million compared to $39 million a year ago.
Q2 operating cash flow was $292 million, an increase of $143 million over the prior year, driven by improved working capital and higher earnings. Free cash flow was $201 million. We ended Q2 in a net debt position of $3.5 billion. We repurchased $555 million of stock during the quarter at an average price of $68.37. And finally, we paid dividends of $72 million in the quarter.
Turning to our outlook. We expect Q3 sales growth of 6% to 7% including $130 million from Airwave. We expect Q3 non-GAAP EPS between $1.17 and $1.22. Our view of the full year outlook remains unchanged. Revenue growth of 5% to 7% and non-GAAP EPS of $4.45 to $4.65. Operating expenses of approximately $1.45 billion, a reduction of $120 million inclusive of the additional Airwave OpEx. Full year effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 33%. Operating cash flow of approximately $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion and $4.75 to $5 of free cash flow per share for the full year.
Moving to regional results. North America performed as expected with revenue down slightly at 1% versus a strong quarter a year ago. Demand for our Managed & Support services continues to drive multiyear contract wins, while backlog growth in both products and services supports our expectation of growth in the region in the second half and for the full year. As expected, Latin America was down 36% or $34 million on continued challenging macroeconomic conditions and iDEN declines. While we expect the region to remain challenged, the business is stabilizing, and we are encouraged with the recent large order of $28 million.
EMEA was up 47% inclusive of Airwave. Excluding Airwave, the region was down 17%, primarily related to lower Norway installation revenue and weakness in Eastern Europe. Asia Pac declined 2% on currency headwinds and a decline in China. Excluding currency, Asia Pac grew 1%, driven primarily by growth in Australia. 
I'd also like to share some brief segment highlights. In our product segment, we continued to innovate with several key product launches and customer-focused solutions, including the launch of several new radios including a low-cost digital vertex radio addressing the low end of the channel as well as a new high-tier TETRA radio. We also announced the addition of the Wave 7000 solution to our software portfolio. Wave 7000 software enhances workgroup communication with high-availability push-to-talk, linking users across LMR and LTE networks regardless of radio, smartphone, tablet or other device.
In our P25 ASTRO portfolio, we won several large systems deals, including a $200 million multicounty award in the Richmond, Virginia area. We also received a $44 million order from a North America utility customer. And in July, we won a $28 million order in Latin America, the first deal in the region over $10 million in the past 6 quarters.
In our Services business, we launched WAVE Cloud Connect in Australia. This SaaS cloud-based solution leverages Wave 7000 to deliver broadband-based secure push-to-talk communications, connecting LMR networks with smartphones and tablets. In our Managed & Support services business, we are proceeding with the integration of Airwave following the unconditional clearance from the U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority. We secured many large services deals including a $19 million renewal to extend services with a key customer in Australia. And in the command center, we received multiple orders in North America for software, services and application, providing customers with advanced analytics and operational intelligence.
I would now like to turn the call back over to Greg."

In terms of the share repurchase authorization, we have $400 million left in the authorization. We bought back $555 million in Q2. In composite, over the last 5 years, we have repurchased $11.6 billion, as I mentioned, a 51% reduction in share count at an average price of $57.58.

First, given the decline in the pound, a couple of issues related to that. Can you talk about what product backlog trends would've been sequentially in year-over-year under a constant currency? Would that be growing sequentially and year-over-year? And also on the pound decline, is the $146 million of Airwave revenue this quarter relative to the $130 million expectation for next quarter, is that pound-related or is there variability in that revenue stream? And then second, Greg, on FirstNet, I understand kind of even the uncertainties are uncertain at this point. But I guess any color you'd like to give on that? And then specifically, I guess Rivada Networks has an agreement with a number of industry players, Motorola not one of them. And what I'm wondering in that regard is given your share of embedded systems on P25, is there a conceivable way to integrate with those systems without having Motorola involved in some form or fashion?"

We continue to expect $450 million of revenue for the full year.

Product pipeline as well as Services pipeline looks strong. We talked about Latin America, and again Latin America, is less than 5% of our overall revenue, again, less pressure in the second half due to comps. We also believe we've derisked a lot of large projects there. And I think on the bright side, we see Southern and Latin America improving. We see the business in Mexico stabilizing.

And we think we've got -- we've created a good level of demand that we'll fulfill here in the future. When we think about EMEA, which I just commented on, Europe, Middle East and Africa, again, our comps ease in Europe. There is a fair level even in spite of oil in the Middle East, the business remains strong. I think one point of emphasis here would be in Africa. Africa is an area -- really what I would say is an area that we've invested in. We're investing in more significantly in go-to-market. We've shored up some lower end -- or kind of our lower end of our portfolio of product that we think is very attractive in the African market. And then as we start to pivot to Asia Pac, Asia Pac is -- actually it's been a good new story. In constant currency, last year, it grew 8%. It'll be up this year in constant currency, particularly -- and again as Gino highlighted in the opening in Australia. I will tell you, China, China is less than 3% of our company's revenue. 2016 will be a challenging year. But we've got really suppressed expectations candidly about China just due to some of the preference that I think the Chinese government has towards some of the indigenous providers. So I think that's probably a summary of the flyover as we see it regionally around the world."

I do think, though, we're very uniquely positioned, positively, better than anybody, quite frankly. And I say that as a reflection of our knowledge and expertise in P25 and TETRA LMR, and the complexities in customization that go with that, and the interoperability and interconnection required of LMR platforms, whether they'd be P25 or TETRA to the additive broadband network that gets deployed. I think it would span services, some applications, devices. I don't see consumer smartphones replacing mission-critical radios for a whole host of reasons around power management, spectrum, efficiency, group talk as well as things that are embedded in the 3GPP standard, and so many other things that would be required for that to happen. So I think Public Safety LTE is a good opportunity for this company. I think it's additive to our LMR business. I don't think it's substitutional or cannibalizing in the future. I just don't see that, and I don't think it's a reflection of our head in the sand. I really don't because we push ourselves constantly here and challenge each other. It's a direct reflection of what we're hearing from our customers. And it's worth reminding in L.A., we are building an LMR system at the same time and updating an LMR system right now, at the same time PS LTE is being deployed. That's also true in the U.K., which you know about the commitment to multiyear fixed price contract with Airwave and the eventual migration to ESN. And we'll see how quickly that happens and in what complementary nature ultimately that gets rolled out in. And the 2 Middle East customers, right as we speak, are investing in LMR and Public Safety LTE. And we're getting service contracts that are multiyear, 10, 15 years-plus. So the customers are speaking and the market's speaking, and we're going to seize on both those opportunities. So Public Safety LTE is more muted, again $130 million last year, comparable this year. I would guess it's comparable maybe, maybe slightly up next year as we round out those implementations. But between infrastructure, devices, applications and the interconnection to make the end-to-end system work, I think we're well positioned."

How do you view the average duration of your contracts? Is there a pattern? Are they extending -- there has been this percentage figure you disclosed in your 10-K of the percentage of backlog that you recognized in subsequent years has actually been declining. So I'm trying to see if there's a read-through there. And then final piece, curious why Airwave revenue sees no adjustment this year, but does the adjustment in future years. Is there something built into that contract that it's booked and recognized this year already, so the pound movement doesn't influence it? Or is there something else that plays into that?"

The reason our guidance on Airwave revenue of $450 million is unchanged despite the contraction in the pound is the tip of the hat to Bonanotte and the finance team because as we modeled -- he and the team modeled different scenarios, right at the close of the acquisition, we knew that there was uncertainty out there with Brexit. We wanted to get the contract in hand. We wanted to get the organization integrated, so Gino and team were prudent. So even with the pound contraction of about 15%, maybe 16%, since that Airwave acquisition was done, we're not changing our revenue guidance of approximately $450 million. At this point, given the spot rate in the pound, we would expect Airwave revenue to grow next year because we have 12 months of revenue recognition versus 10."

So I think the second -- Ben, to the second question around projects, I think of -- dimensionalize it 2 ways. There's 2 things. Most of these projects, one -- by the way, projects we are proud to have won, the Richmond area that we talked about, we spoke about King County last year in the state of Iowa. These are essentially multi -- we talked about -- they could be hundreds of sites. And so each and every one of those sites kind of has a life story themselves, meaning civil, permitting, environmental, OSHA, those kinds of requirements that tend to have longer duration. So we typically think of those things taken anywhere from 12 to really 2 years to revenue to get through all the revenue-able things. That's the first piece of it. And then typically within those -- also within those contracts, there's a device component. And those things are more actionable, and we can work with customers to pull those in for revenue. But ultimately, each project has its own dimension. A lot of them are civil and site-related, longer duration. The second piece of it is devices. We can typically action those with customers in a quicker fashion. And then the last element of them is obviously the multiyear support. And I think it's noteworthy because it's been brought up a few times today, but every -- basically every customer in North America and typically in a lot of different countries overseas now doesn't enter into an agreement until they think about at least 5 years. We've had customers that have gone up to 20 years of lifecycle in Managed & Support service agreements. So those, obviously, even have a longer duration in those revenue every year. So I think that probably answers your question."

I'd like to make a few opening comments about the second quarter and the overall business before Gino takes us through the results and outlook. First, Q2 was a strong quarter of earnings, cash flow generation and backlog growth compared to last year. With a growing product backlog and healthy pipeline, we're well positioned for the second half of the year, and we'll continue to focus on revenue and operational efficiency. Second, our services business continues to execute, growing 26% including Airwave, while our Managed & Support business grew 4% organically. And we're proceeding full steam ahead with the integration of Airwave after recently receiving unconditional clearance from the U.K. Competition and Markets Authority just a few weeks ago.
And finally, today we announced the $2 billion increase to our share repurchase authorization. This follows $11.6 billion in total repurchases over the past 5 years, driving a 51% share count reduction. The steady improvement in our business and continued Managed & Support services growth will generate strong earnings and cash flow, driving total shareholder return.
I'll now turn the call over to Gino to provide additional details on our second quarter results and outlook before returning to provide some closing thoughts."

Second quarter results include revenue of $1.4 billion, up 5% versus last year, including Airwave revenue of $146 million. GAAP operating earnings of $224 million.

Second quarter results include revenue of $1.4 billion, up 5% versus last year, including Airwave revenue of $146 million. GAAP operating earnings of $224 million. Non-GAAP operating earnings of $324 million or 22.7% of sales, up 370 basis points from the year ago quarter. GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.61 compared to $0.72 in the second quarter of 2015.
Non-GAAP EPS was $1.03, which represents a 51% year-over-year increase. The earnings per share growth was driven by Airwave, continued cost savings and reduced share count. Ending backlog was up $2.2 billion from a year ago. Services is up $2.1 billion on $1.6 billion from Airwave as well as Managed & Support services growth in North America. The product segment backlog was up $64 million, also driven by North America. For the remainder of the call, we will reference non-GAAP financial results including those in our outlook.
As expected, Q2 product sales were down 8% from the prior year at $801 million. The majority of the decline was due to weakness in Latin America, parts of Europe and China. Q2 product segment operating income was $176 million or 22% of sales, up 170 basis points versus last year, driven by steady margins and a lower cost structure. Product segment backlog ended the quarter at $1.3 billion, up $64 million from last year and up $82 million sequentially. Deal flow and orders had been solid, particularly in North America, supporting our expectations for product revenue growth in the second half.
Turning to services. Q2 services revenue was $629 million, up 26% including Airwave. In Q2, Managed & Support services comprised approximately 30% of total MSI revenue. Organically, Managed & Support services grew 4% during the quarter. Services operating income was $148 million or 23.5% of revenue, up 670 basis points from the prior year. Services backlog ended at $6.9 billion, up $2.2 billion versus last year. The backlog growth is attributed to $1.6 billion of Airwave in EMEA and an increase of over $500 million in North America. Sequentially, services backlog decreased $214 million including a $170 million FX adjustment related mostly to the British pound.
Total OpEx from continuing operations was $362 million, down $31 million or 8% from the year ago quarter, driven primarily by continued cost reduction activities. Other income and expense was $57 million compared to $39 million in the year ago quarter. Net interest expense was $54 million compared to $39 million a year ago.
Q2 operating cash flow was $292 million, an increase of $143 million over the prior year, driven by improved working capital and higher earnings. Free cash flow was $201 million. We ended Q2 in a net debt position of $3.5 billion. We repurchased $555 million of stock during the quarter at an average price of $68.37. And finally, we paid dividends of $72 million in the quarter.
Turning to our outlook. We expect Q3 sales growth of 6% to 7% including $130 million from Airwave. We expect Q3 non-GAAP EPS between $1.17 and $1.22. Our view of the full year outlook remains unchanged. Revenue growth of 5% to 7% and non-GAAP EPS of $4.45 to $4.65. Operating expenses of approximately $1.45 billion, a reduction of $120 million inclusive of the additional Airwave OpEx. Full year effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 33%. Operating cash flow of approximately $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion and $4.75 to $5 of free cash flow per share for the full year.
Moving to regional results. North America performed as expected with revenue down slightly at 1% versus a strong quarter a year ago. Demand for our Managed & Support services continues to drive multiyear contract wins, while backlog growth in both products and services supports our expectation of growth in the region in the second half and for the full year. As expected, Latin America was down 36% or $34 million on continued challenging macroeconomic conditions and iDEN declines. While we expect the region to remain challenged, the business is stabilizing, and we are encouraged with the recent large order of $28 million.
EMEA was up 47% inclusive of Airwave. Excluding Airwave, the region was down 17%, primarily related to lower Norway installation revenue and weakness in Eastern Europe. Asia Pac declined 2% on currency headwinds and a decline in China. Excluding currency, Asia Pac grew 1%, driven primarily by growth in Australia. 
I'd also like to share some brief segment highlights. In our product segment, we continued to innovate with several key product launches and customer-focused solutions, including the launch of several new radios including a low-cost digital vertex radio addressing the low end of the channel as well as a new high-tier TETRA radio. We also announced the addition of the Wave 7000 solution to our software portfolio. Wave 7000 software enhances workgroup communication with high-availability push-to-talk, linking users across LMR and LTE networks regardless of radio, smartphone, tablet or other device.
In our P25 ASTRO portfolio, we won several large systems deals, including a $200 million multicounty award in the Richmond, Virginia area. We also received a $44 million order from a North America utility customer. And in July, we won a $28 million order in Latin America, the first deal in the region over $10 million in the past 6 quarters.
In our Services business, we launched WAVE Cloud Connect in Australia. This SaaS cloud-based solution leverages Wave 7000 to deliver broadband-based secure push-to-talk communications, connecting LMR networks with smartphones and tablets. In our Managed & Support services business, we are proceeding with the integration of Airwave following the unconditional clearance from the U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority. We secured many large services deals including a $19 million renewal to extend services with a key customer in Australia. And in the command center, we received multiple orders in North America for software, services and application, providing customers with advanced analytics and operational intelligence.
I would now like to turn the call back over to Greg."

In terms of the share repurchase authorization, we have $400 million left in the authorization. We bought back $555 million in Q2. In composite, over the last 5 years, we have repurchased $11.6 billion, as I mentioned, a 51% reduction in share count at an average price of $57.58.

Would that be growing sequentially and year-over-year? And also on the pound decline, is the $146 million of Airwave revenue this quarter relative to the $130 million expectation for next quarter, is that pound-related or is there variability in that revenue stream? And then second, Greg, on FirstNet, I understand kind of even the uncertainties are uncertain at this point. But I guess any color you'd like to give on that? And then specifically, I guess Rivada Networks has an agreement with a number of industry players, Motorola not one of them.

Product pipeline as well as Services pipeline looks strong. We talked about Latin America, and again Latin America, is less than 5% of our overall revenue, again, less pressure in the second half due to comps. We also believe we've derisked a lot of large projects there. And I think on the bright side, we see Southern and Latin America improving. We see the business in Mexico stabilizing. And I think the big point there is in spite of some of the headwinds we faced in the last 12 months, we've maintained our investment in the region. And we think we've got -- we've created a good level of demand that we'll fulfill here in the future. When we think about EMEA, which I just commented on, Europe, Middle East and Africa, again, our comps ease in Europe. There is a fair level even in spite of oil in the Middle East, the business remains strong. I think one point of emphasis here would be in Africa. Africa is an area -- really what I would say is an area that we've invested in. We're investing in more significantly in go-to-market. We've shored up some lower end -- or kind of our lower end of our portfolio of product that we think is very attractive in the African market. And then as we start to pivot to Asia Pac, Asia Pac is -- actually it's been a good new story. In constant currency, last year, it grew 8%. It'll be up this year in constant currency, particularly -- and again as Gino highlighted in the opening in Australia. I will tell you, China, China is less than 3% of our company's revenue. 2016 will be a challenging year. But we've got really suppressed expectations candidly about China just due to some of the preference that I think the Chinese government has towards some of the indigenous providers. So I think that's probably a summary of the flyover as we see it regionally around the world."

It's certainly a lot slower and less material than we thought 3 years ago, just to reference a point, or even when the legislation was passed in the middle-class jobs relief act in 2012 that was U.S.-centric. I think it's for a combination of reasons. Countries have to develop and allocate the spectrum. You've got to line up the appropriate funding. I do think, though, we're very uniquely positioned, positively, better than anybody, quite frankly. And I say that as a reflection of our knowledge and expertise in P25 and TETRA LMR, and the complexities in customization that go with that, and the interoperability and interconnection required of LMR platforms, whether they'd be P25 or TETRA to the additive broadband network that gets deployed. I think it would span services, some applications, devices. I don't see consumer smartphones replacing mission-critical radios for a whole host of reasons around power management, spectrum, efficiency, group talk as well as things that are embedded in the 3GPP standard, and so many other things that would be required for that to happen. So I think Public Safety LTE is a good opportunity for this company. I think it's additive to our LMR business. I don't think it's substitutional or cannibalizing in the future. I just don't see that, and I don't think it's a reflection of our head in the sand. I really don't because we push ourselves constantly here and challenge each other. It's a direct reflection of what we're hearing from our customers. And it's worth reminding in L.A., we are building an LMR system at the same time and updating an LMR system right now, at the same time PS LTE is being deployed. That's also true in the U.K., which you know about the commitment to multiyear fixed price contract with Airwave and the eventual migration to ESN. And we'll see how quickly that happens and in what complementary nature ultimately that gets rolled out in. And the 2 Middle East customers, right as we speak, are investing in LMR and Public Safety LTE. And we're getting service contracts that are multiyear, 10, 15 years-plus. So the customers are speaking and the market's speaking, and we're going to seize on both those opportunities. So Public Safety LTE is more muted, again $130 million last year, comparable this year. I would guess it's comparable maybe, maybe slightly up next year as we round out those implementations. But between infrastructure, devices, applications and the interconnection to make the end-to-end system work, I think we're well positioned."

How do you view the average duration of your contracts? Is there a pattern? Are they extending -- there has been this percentage figure you disclosed in your 10-K of the percentage of backlog that you recognized in subsequent years has actually been declining. So I'm trying to see if there's a read-through there. And then final piece, curious why Airwave revenue sees no adjustment this year, but does the adjustment in future years. Is there something built into that contract that it's booked and recognized this year already, so the pound movement doesn't influence it? Or is there something else that plays into that?"

The reason our guidance on Airwave revenue of $450 million is unchanged despite the contraction in the pound is the tip of the hat to Bonanotte and the finance team because as we modeled -- he and the team modeled different scenarios, right at the close of the acquisition, we knew that there was uncertainty out there with Brexit. We wanted to get the contract in hand. We wanted to get the organization integrated, so Gino and team were prudent. So even with the pound contraction of about 15%, maybe 16%, since that Airwave acquisition was done, we're not changing our revenue guidance of approximately $450 million. At this point, given the spot rate in the pound, we would expect Airwave revenue to grow next year because we have 12 months of revenue recognition versus 10."

So I think the second -- Ben, to the second question around projects, I think of -- dimensionalize it 2 ways. There's 2 things. Most of these projects, one -- by the way, projects we are proud to have won, the Richmond area that we talked about, we spoke about King County last year in the state of Iowa. These are essentially multi -- we talked about -- they could be hundreds of sites. And so each and every one of those sites kind of has a life story themselves, meaning civil, permitting, environmental, OSHA, those kinds of requirements that tend to have longer duration. So we typically think of those things taken anywhere from 12 to really 2 years to revenue to get through all the revenue-able things. That's the first piece of it. And then typically within those -- also within those contracts, there's a device component. And those things are more actionable, and we can work with customers to pull those in for revenue. But ultimately, each project has its own dimension. A lot of them are civil and site-related, longer duration. The second piece of it is devices. We can typically action those with customers in a quicker fashion. And then the last element of them is obviously the multiyear support. And I think it's noteworthy because it's been brought up a few times today, but every -- basically every customer in North America and typically in a lot of different countries overseas now doesn't enter into an agreement until they think about at least 5 years. We've had customers that have gone up to 20 years of lifecycle in Managed & Support service agreements. So those, obviously, even have a longer duration in those revenue every year. So I think that probably answers your question."

I'd like to make a few opening comments about the second quarter and the overall business before Gino takes us through the results and outlook. First, Q2 was a strong quarter of earnings, cash flow generation and backlog growth compared to last year. With a growing product backlog and healthy pipeline, we're well positioned for the second half of the year, and we'll continue to focus on revenue and operational efficiency. Second, our services business continues to execute, growing 26% including Airwave, while our Managed & Support business grew 4% organically. And we're proceeding full steam ahead with the integration of Airwave after recently receiving unconditional clearance from the U.K. Competition and Markets Authority just a few weeks ago.
And finally, today we announced the $2 billion increase to our share repurchase authorization. This follows $11.6 billion in total repurchases over the past 5 years, driving a 51% share count reduction. The steady improvement in our business and continued Managed & Support services growth will generate strong earnings and cash flow, driving total shareholder return.
I'll now turn the call over to Gino to provide additional details on our second quarter results and outlook before returning to provide some closing thoughts."

Second quarter results include revenue of $1.4 billion, up 5% versus last year, including Airwave revenue of $146 million. GAAP operating earnings of $224 million.

Second quarter results include revenue of $1.4 billion, up 5% versus last year, including Airwave revenue of $146 million. GAAP operating earnings of $224 million. Non-GAAP operating earnings of $324 million or 22.7% of sales, up 370 basis points from the year ago quarter. GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.61 compared to $0.72 in the second quarter of 2015.
Non-GAAP EPS was $1.03, which represents a 51% year-over-year increase. The earnings per share growth was driven by Airwave, continued cost savings and reduced share count. Ending backlog was up $2.2 billion from a year ago. Services is up $2.1 billion on $1.6 billion from Airwave as well as Managed & Support services growth in North America. The product segment backlog was up $64 million, also driven by North America. For the remainder of the call, we will reference non-GAAP financial results including those in our outlook.
As expected, Q2 product sales were down 8% from the prior year at $801 million. The majority of the decline was due to weakness in Latin America, parts of Europe and China. Q2 product segment operating income was $176 million or 22% of sales, up 170 basis points versus last year, driven by steady margins and a lower cost structure. Product segment backlog ended the quarter at $1.3 billion, up $64 million from last year and up $82 million sequentially. Deal flow and orders had been solid, particularly in North America, supporting our expectations for product revenue growth in the second half.
Turning to services. Q2 services revenue was $629 million, up 26% including Airwave. In Q2, Managed & Support services comprised approximately 30% of total MSI revenue. Organically, Managed & Support services grew 4% during the quarter. Services operating income was $148 million or 23.5% of revenue, up 670 basis points from the prior year. Services backlog ended at $6.9 billion, up $2.2 billion versus last year. The backlog growth is attributed to $1.6 billion of Airwave in EMEA and an increase of over $500 million in North America. Sequentially, services backlog decreased $214 million including a $170 million FX adjustment related mostly to the British pound.
Total OpEx from continuing operations was $362 million, down $31 million or 8% from the year ago quarter, driven primarily by continued cost reduction activities. Other income and expense was $57 million compared to $39 million in the year ago quarter. Net interest expense was $54 million compared to $39 million a year ago.
Q2 operating cash flow was $292 million, an increase of $143 million over the prior year, driven by improved working capital and higher earnings. Free cash flow was $201 million. We ended Q2 in a net debt position of $3.5 billion. We repurchased $555 million of stock during the quarter at an average price of $68.37. And finally, we paid dividends of $72 million in the quarter.
Turning to our outlook. We expect Q3 sales growth of 6% to 7% including $130 million from Airwave. We expect Q3 non-GAAP EPS between $1.17 and $1.22. Our view of the full year outlook remains unchanged. Revenue growth of 5% to 7% and non-GAAP EPS of $4.45 to $4.65. Operating expenses of approximately $1.45 billion, a reduction of $120 million inclusive of the additional Airwave OpEx. Full year effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 33%. Operating cash flow of approximately $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion and $4.75 to $5 of free cash flow per share for the full year.
Moving to regional results. North America performed as expected with revenue down slightly at 1% versus a strong quarter a year ago. Demand for our Managed & Support services continues to drive multiyear contract wins, while backlog growth in both products and services supports our expectation of growth in the region in the second half and for the full year. As expected, Latin America was down 36% or $34 million on continued challenging macroeconomic conditions and iDEN declines. While we expect the region to remain challenged, the business is stabilizing, and we are encouraged with the recent large order of $28 million.
EMEA was up 47% inclusive of Airwave. Excluding Airwave, the region was down 17%, primarily related to lower Norway installation revenue and weakness in Eastern Europe. Asia Pac declined 2% on currency headwinds and a decline in China. Excluding currency, Asia Pac grew 1%, driven primarily by growth in Australia. 
I'd also like to share some brief segment highlights. In our product segment, we continued to innovate with several key product launches and customer-focused solutions, including the launch of several new radios including a low-cost digital vertex radio addressing the low end of the channel as well as a new high-tier TETRA radio. We also announced the addition of the Wave 7000 solution to our software portfolio. Wave 7000 software enhances workgroup communication with high-availability push-to-talk, linking users across LMR and LTE networks regardless of radio, smartphone, tablet or other device.
In our P25 ASTRO portfolio, we won several large systems deals, including a $200 million multicounty award in the Richmond, Virginia area. We also received a $44 million order from a North America utility customer. And in July, we won a $28 million order in Latin America, the first deal in the region over $10 million in the past 6 quarters.
In our Services business, we launched WAVE Cloud Connect in Australia. This SaaS cloud-based solution leverages Wave 7000 to deliver broadband-based secure push-to-talk communications, connecting LMR networks with smartphones and tablets. In our Managed & Support services business, we are proceeding with the integration of Airwave following the unconditional clearance from the U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority. We secured many large services deals including a $19 million renewal to extend services with a key customer in Australia. And in the command center, we received multiple orders in North America for software, services and application, providing customers with advanced analytics and operational intelligence.
I would now like to turn the call back over to Greg."

Would that be growing sequentially and year-over-year? And also on the pound decline, is the $146 million of Airwave revenue this quarter relative to the $130 million expectation for next quarter, is that pound-related or is there variability in that revenue stream? And then second, Greg, on FirstNet, I understand kind of even the uncertainties are uncertain at this point. But I guess any color you'd like to give on that? And then specifically, I guess Rivada Networks has an agreement with a number of industry players, Motorola not one of them.

Product pipeline as well as Services pipeline looks strong. We talked about Latin America, and again Latin America, is less than 5% of our overall revenue, again, less pressure in the second half due to comps. We also believe we've derisked a lot of large projects there. And I think on the bright side, we see Southern and Latin America improving. We see the business in Mexico stabilizing.

And we think we've got -- we've created a good level of demand that we'll fulfill here in the future. When we think about EMEA, which I just commented on, Europe, Middle East and Africa, again, our comps ease in Europe. There is a fair level even in spite of oil in the Middle East, the business remains strong. I think one point of emphasis here would be in Africa. Africa is an area -- really what I would say is an area that we've invested in. We're investing in more significantly in go-to-market. We've shored up some lower end -- or kind of our lower end of our portfolio of product that we think is very attractive in the African market. And then as we start to pivot to Asia Pac, Asia Pac is -- actually it's been a good new story. In constant currency, last year, it grew 8%. It'll be up this year in constant currency, particularly -- and again as Gino highlighted in the opening in Australia. I will tell you, China, China is less than 3% of our company's revenue. 2016 will be a challenging year. But we've got really suppressed expectations candidly about China just due to some of the preference that I think the Chinese government has towards some of the indigenous providers. So I think that's probably a summary of the flyover as we see it regionally around the world."

Specifically, the volatility has been around the pound, and again, we haven't changed our view of full year revenue for Airwave at $450 million, despite the movement in the pound.

It's certainly a lot slower and less material than we thought 3 years ago, just to reference a point, or even when the legislation was passed in the middle-class jobs relief act in 2012 that was U.S.-centric. I think it's for a combination of reasons. Countries have to develop and allocate the spectrum. You've got to line up the appropriate funding. I do think, though, we're very uniquely positioned, positively, better than anybody, quite frankly. And I say that as a reflection of our knowledge and expertise in P25 and TETRA LMR, and the complexities in customization that go with that, and the interoperability and interconnection required of LMR platforms, whether they'd be P25 or TETRA to the additive broadband network that gets deployed. I think it would span services, some applications, devices. I don't see consumer smartphones replacing mission-critical radios for a whole host of reasons around power management, spectrum, efficiency, group talk as well as things that are embedded in the 3GPP standard, and so many other things that would be required for that to happen. So I think Public Safety LTE is a good opportunity for this company. I think it's additive to our LMR business. I don't think it's substitutional or cannibalizing in the future. I just don't see that, and I don't think it's a reflection of our head in the sand. I really don't because we push ourselves constantly here and challenge each other. It's a direct reflection of what we're hearing from our customers. And it's worth reminding in L.A., we are building an LMR system at the same time and updating an LMR system right now, at the same time PS LTE is being deployed. That's also true in the U.K., which you know about the commitment to multiyear fixed price contract with Airwave and the eventual migration to ESN. And we'll see how quickly that happens and in what complementary nature ultimately that gets rolled out in. And the 2 Middle East customers, right as we speak, are investing in LMR and Public Safety LTE. And we're getting service contracts that are multiyear, 10, 15 years-plus. So the customers are speaking and the market's speaking, and we're going to seize on both those opportunities. So Public Safety LTE is more muted, again $130 million last year, comparable this year. I would guess it's comparable maybe, maybe slightly up next year as we round out those implementations. But between infrastructure, devices, applications and the interconnection to make the end-to-end system work, I think we're well positioned."

How do you view the average duration of your contracts? Is there a pattern? Are they extending -- there has been this percentage figure you disclosed in your 10-K of the percentage of backlog that you recognized in subsequent years has actually been declining. So I'm trying to see if there's a read-through there. And then final piece, curious why Airwave revenue sees no adjustment this year, but does the adjustment in future years. Is there something built into that contract that it's booked and recognized this year already, so the pound movement doesn't influence it? Or is there something else that plays into that?"

We wanted to get the contract in hand. We wanted to get the organization integrated, so Gino and team were prudent. So even with the pound contraction of about 15%, maybe 16%, since that Airwave acquisition was done, we're not changing our revenue guidance of approximately $450 million. At this point, given the spot rate in the pound, we would expect Airwave revenue to grow next year because we have 12 months of revenue recognition versus 10."

So I think the second -- Ben, to the second question around projects, I think of -- dimensionalize it 2 ways. There's 2 things. Most of these projects, one -- by the way, projects we are proud to have won, the Richmond area that we talked about, we spoke about King County last year in the state of Iowa. These are essentially multi -- we talked about -- they could be hundreds of sites. And so each and every one of those sites kind of has a life story themselves, meaning civil, permitting, environmental, OSHA, those kinds of requirements that tend to have longer duration. So we typically think of those things taken anywhere from 12 to really 2 years to revenue to get through all the revenue-able things. That's the first piece of it. And then typically within those -- also within those contracts, there's a device component. And those things are more actionable, and we can work with customers to pull those in for revenue. But ultimately, each project has its own dimension. A lot of them are civil and site-related, longer duration. The second piece of it is devices. We can typically action those with customers in a quicker fashion. And then the last element of them is obviously the multiyear support. And I think it's noteworthy because it's been brought up a few times today, but every -- basically every customer in North America and typically in a lot of different countries overseas now doesn't enter into an agreement until they think about at least 5 years. We've had customers that have gone up to 20 years of lifecycle in Managed & Support service agreements. So those, obviously, even have a longer duration in those revenue every year. So I think that probably answers your question."

We're particularly excited to be delivering this call from our new corporate headquarters in Chicago and home of the world champion, Chicago Cubs, pretty special. Having said that, I'd like to share a few thoughts about the overall basis before Gino takes us through the results and outlook. 
First, Q3 was an excellent quarter. Our operational execution and solid financial results were anchored by strength in North America and our growing management support services business. We grew revenue 8% along with significant growth in earnings and $348 million of operating cash flow. 
Second, we continue to invest in developing our software and services portfolio including the recently announced Spillman Technologies acquisition. Spillman's command center software is an important complementary addition to our existing software portfolio. 
And finally, I'm pleased to announce that we're raising our full year guidance for earnings and also raising the dividend by 15%. And as I look to next year, we remain committed to growing revenue and cash flow with an efficient cost structure while driving even more innovation. 
So at this point, I'll turn the call over to Gino to provide additional details on Q3 and outlook before returning to provide some closing thoughts."

Q3 results include revenue of $1.5 billion, up 8%; versus last year including Airwave revenue of $131 million, GAAP operating earnings of $341 million, non-GAAP operating earnings of $396 million or 25.8% of sales, up 530 basis points fro",991,"Thank you, Greg. Q3 results include revenue of $1.5 billion, up 8%; versus last year including Airwave revenue of $131 million, GAAP operating earnings of $341 million, non-GAAP operating earnings of $396 million or 25.8% of sales, up 530 basis points from the year ago quarter. GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.13 compared to $0.63 in the third quarter of 2015. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.37 versus $0.82 in the year ago quarter, a 67% year-over-year increase. 
Ending backlog is up $2.1 billion versus last year, $1.4 billion from Airwave, $600 million from Managed & Support services primarily driven by North America and $62 million from products. For the remainder of the call, we will reference non-GAAP financial results including those in our outlook unless otherwise noted. 
Q3 product sales were $920 million, down 1% versus last year a solid North America performance, offset by a large P25 project in Africa last year and China softness. Q3 product segment operating income was $243 million or 26.4% of sales, up 250 basis points versus last year driven by lower OpEx. Product segment backlog ended the quarter at $1.4 billion, up 5% or $62 million versus last year, driven by North America. Sequentially, product backlog was up $63 million with growth in North America, Latin America and EMEA. 
Turning to services. Q3 services revenue was $612 million, up 23% including Airwave. Excluding Airwave, Managed & Support services grew 5%. Services operating income was $153 million, up $82 million from the prior year. Operating margins increased from 14.3% to 25% of revenue on Airwave contributions and improved gross margin. Services backlog ended at $6.7 billion, up $2.1 billion versus last year. Of the $2.1 billion increase, Airwave was $1.4 billion and organic Managed & Support services was up over $600 million. Sequentially, services backlog is down $136 million due to currency adjustments related to the British pound and Airwave backlog conversion to revenue against the fixed contract. 
Moving to operating expenses. Total OpEx from continuing operations was $369 million, down $27 million or 7% from the year ago quarter, driven by continued cost reduction activities. Other income and expense was $48 million compared to $34 million in the year ago quarter, driven primarily by higher interest expense. The Q3 effective tax rate was 33%. 
Q3 operating cash flow was $348 million, an increase of $47 million, driven by higher earnings. Free cash flow was $280 million, an increase of $29 million versus last year. We ended Q3 with cash of $1.7 billion and a net debt position of $3.4 billion. During the quarter, we purchased $109 million of stock at an average price of $73.11 and we paid dividends of $70 million. 
Turning to our outlook. We expect Q4 sales growth of 9% to 10% including $120 million from Airwave. We expect Q4 non-GAAP EPS between $1.82 and $1.87. For the full year 2016, we expect revenue growth of 5% to 6%, and we now expect non-GAAP EPS of $4.67 to $4.72 versus the prior outlook of $4.45 to $4.65. This assumes a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 173 million shares. Full year operating expenses are expected to be down approximately $120 million versus 2015. We expect the full year 2016 effective tax rate to be approximately 32%. Operating cash flow is still expected to be approximately $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion and free cash flow of approximately $800 million to $900 million. Finally, share repurchases are expected to be in the range of $800 million to $900 million. 
Looking briefly at 2017, I'd like to make a few points. First, we now expect Airwave to be approximately flat given the current foreign exchange rates, and we expect iDEN to decline by $50 million next year. That said, we continue to expect overall growth in 2017 and we'll provide a full outlook on our next call. 
Moving to regional results. North America had another strong quarter with 4% growth, driven by both products and services. The pipeline in backlog remain healthy, particularly for multi-year services. North America remains on track for low single-digit growth for the full year. 
As expected, Latin America was down $15 million or 17% on continued challenging macroeconomic conditions and a $9 million iDEN decline. While this market remains challenged, we do see some signs of stabilization. 
EMEA was up 34% including Airwave. Excluding Airwave, EMEA was down 20% as expected, driven by difficult comps including the Norway installation completion and a large P25 order last year. Asia Pac grew 2%, led by services growth, which was partially offset by continued softness in China. 
Finally, I'd like to end with some notable segment highlights. In our products segment, we announced several new products including the Apex 8500, P25 all-band mobile radio. This device provides unlimited interoperability across public safety LMR networks as well as the ability to interface with 4G LTE carrier networks and over secure Wi-Fi networks. We also won several notable deals that include a $37 million award to expand a nationwide TETRA network in Africa, $34 million for 2 P25 contracts with the U.S. federal government and a $20 million award for a P25 network with a large U.S. utility customer. In our services segment, we opened a new network operations center in Pennang to deliver mission-critical support services to customers in the Asia Pacific region. We also have been demonstrating our vision for the command center of the future using a combination of virtual reality and I interaction technologies to immerse the public safety command supervisor in an incident scene. This focus on the command center underlines the recent Spillman Technologies acquisition which adds important software solutions to our command center software offerings. We expect these investments and market traction to continue as exemplified by our recent $12 million award from the Los Angeles Police Department for a command center upgrade. 
I'd now like to turn the call back over to Greg."

So on Spillman Technologies, we're not going to dimensionalize yet the revenue until the deal closes which we would expect to be sometime between now and end of the year. The way to think about it is it's right in the sweet spot of what we talked around deploying capital in command center software. So we have a high-end CAD offering, a Tier 1 offering, if you will, for large cities and CAD that we've been selling for several years. Spillman complements that nicely with Tier 2 and Tier 3. So it rounds out the portfolio around CAD. And consistent with the software in command centers that we said was critical to marry with the incident management and situational awareness of our radio communications offerings, we'll be able to dimensionalize it more specifically after it closes. I would, though, just say -- I think I would describe it as a small tuck-in, so I wouldn't want you to think of significant materiality in changing our expectations for 2017. As it relates to 2017, as Gino talked about, the way to think about it is Airwave being flat -- I have to say Airwave's performed absolutely consistent to our expectations. The contract is unchanged. Obviously, we've had pressure from the pound from the time that we acquired it, but year-over-year, expect Airwave to be flat at about $460 million. iDEN, as expected and pretty much almost done, winds down another $50 million in 2017. But even with those ingredients, we still expect growth overall. And assumed in that overall growth is, obviously, organic growth overall. But beyond that, we would then finish Q4 and specify the actual numbers on the next call."

As we think about it, even though we're not guiding for 2017, in terms of that area of opportunity, I would say it's comparable to maybe slightly up.

Pivot to the federal market, extremely proud, as Gino and Greg alluded to earlier, of not only North America, but I think in particular, the federal team, we had a very strong close to the fiscal close which was at the end of September, which you're aware of, it's a $500 million approximately business for us.

It has been up in backlog for a number of quarters consecutively and we're pleased with the trends on that but wouldn't get out yet talking about that segment for 2017. I think on the kind of next-generation public safety area, software and services, if you want to describe it that way, I'm pretty pleased with it. I think we're measured in our investments. It's not large, as you know, but it's important. If you think about services as an example, 40% of our revenue, 40% of the company's revenue is services and 25% of the company's revenue is recurring. So as we build traction and expand multi-year services backlog, that's a great thing. And again, it represents the confidence our customers have in the efficacy and the performance of LMR and the longevity of it, and then we layer on additional applications, intelligent middleware, command center software, analytics and other things that we think could position us well with value-added services and software in the command center that are on top of our typical infrastructure or mission-critical communications product business. So I'm pleased with it, and I think that there will continue to be some opportunities for inorganic as well within the envelope of the capital allocation model that we've talked about on a normalized basis. So we've always talked 50-30-20. 50% of our operating cash flow would be used for share repurchase or M&A, 30% for CapEx and 20% for dividend, and I think we'll continue to operate in that envelope -- 30% actually dividend, 20% CapEx. So I'm dyslexic on that, sorry, but I think we have a good balance sheet and a good position to be able to pursue these."

We're particularly excited to be delivering this call from our new corporate headquarters in Chicago and home of the world champion, Chicago Cubs, pretty special. Having said that, I'd like to share a few thoughts about the overall business before Gino takes us through the results and outlook. 
First, Q3 was an excellent quarter. Our operational execution and solid financial results were anchored by strength in North America and our growing management support services business. We grew revenue 8%, along with significant growth in earnings and $348 million of operating cash flow. 
Second, we continue to invest in developing our software and services portfolio, including the recently announced Spillman Technologies acquisition. Spillman's command center software is an important complementary addition to our existing software portfolio. 
And finally, I'm pleased to announce that we're raising our full year guidance for earnings and also raising the dividend by 15%. And as I look to next year, we remain committed to growing revenue and cash flow with an efficient cost structure while driving even more innovation. 
So at this point, I'll turn the call over to Gino to provide additional details on Q3 and outlook before returning to provide some closing thoughts."

Q3 results include revenue of $1.5 billion, up 8% versus last year including Airwave revenue of $131 million; GAAP operating earnings of $341 million; non-GAAP operating earnings of $396 million or 25.8% of sales, up 530 basis points fr",991,"Thank you, Greg. 
Q3 results include revenue of $1.5 billion, up 8% versus last year including Airwave revenue of $131 million; GAAP operating earnings of $341 million; non-GAAP operating earnings of $396 million or 25.8% of sales, up 530 basis points from the year ago quarter. GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.13 compared to $0.63 in the third quarter of 2015. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.37 versus $0.82 in the year ago quarter, a 67% year-over-year increase. 
Ending backlog is up $2.1 billion versus last year, $1.4 billion from Airwave; $600 million from Managed & Support services, primarily driven by North America; and $62 million from products. For the remainder of the call, we will reference non-GAAP financial results including those in our outlook unless otherwise noted. 
Q3 product sales were $920 million, down 1% versus last year on solid North America performance, offset by a large P25 project in Africa last year and China's softness. Q3 product segment operating income was $243 million or 26.4% of sales, up 250 basis points versus last year, driven by lower OpEx. Product segment backlog ended the quarter at $1.4 billion, up 5% or $62 million versus last year, driven by North America. Sequentially, product backlog was up $63 million with growth in North America, Latin America and EMEA. 
Turning to services. Q3 services revenue was $612 million, up 23% including Airwave. Excluding Airwave, Managed & Support services grew 5%. Services operating income was $153 million, up $82 million from the prior year. Operating margins increased from 14.3% to 25% of revenue on Airwave contributions and improved gross margin. Services backlog ended at $6.7 billion, up $2.1 billion versus last year. Of the $2.1 billion increase, Airwave was $1.4 billion and organic Managed & Support services was up over $600 million. Sequentially, services backlog is down $136 million, due to currency adjustments related to the British pound and Airwave backlog conversion to revenue against the fixed contract. 
Moving to operating expenses. Total OpEx from continuing operations was $369 million, down $27 million or 7% from the year ago quarter, driven by continued cost reduction activities. Other income and expense was $48 million compared to $34 million in the year ago quarter, driven primarily by higher interest expense. The Q3 effective tax rate was 33%. 
Q3 operating cash flow was $348 million, an increase of $47 million, driven by higher earnings. Free cash flow was $280 million, an increase of $29 million versus last year. We ended Q3 with cash of $1.7 billion and a net debt position of $3.4 billion. During the quarter, we repurchased $109 million of stock at an average price of $73.11, and we paid dividends of $70 million. 
Turning to our outlook. We expect Q4 sales growth of 9% to 10% including $120 million from Airwave. We expect Q4 non-GAAP EPS between $1.82 and $1.87. For the full year 2016, we expect revenue growth of 5% to 6%, and we now expect non-GAAP EPS of $4.67 to $4.72 versus the prior outlook of $4.45 to $4.65. This assumes a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 173 million shares. Full year operating expenses are expected to be down approximately $120 million versus 2015. We expect the full year 2016 effective tax rate to be approximately 32%. Operating cash flow is still expected to be approximately $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion and free cash flow of approximately $800 million to $900 million. Finally, share repurchases are expected to be in the range of $800 million to $900 million. 
Looking briefly at 2017, I'd like to make a few points. First, we now expect Airwave to be approximately flat given the current foreign exchange rates, and we expect iDEN to decline by $50 million next year. That said, we continue to expect overall growth in 2017, and we'll provide a full outlook on our next call. 
Moving to regional results. North America had another strong quarter with 4% growth, driven by both products and services. The pipeline in backlog remain healthy, particularly for multi-year services. North America remains on track for low single-digit growth for the full year. 
As expected, Latin America was down $15 million or 17% on continued challenging macroeconomic conditions and a $9 million iDEN decline. While this market remains challenged, we do see some signs of stabilization. 
EMEA was up 34% including Airwave. Excluding Airwave, EMEA was down 20% as expected, driven by difficult comps including the Norway installation completion and a large P25 order last year. 
Asia Pac grew 2%, led by services growth, which was partially offset by continued softness in China. 
Finally, I'd like to end with some notable segment highlights. In our products segment, we announced several new products including the APX 8500, P25 all-band mobile radio. This device provides unlimited interoperability across public safety LMR networks as well as the ability to interface with 4G/LTE carrier networks and over secure Wi-Fi networks. We also won several notable deals that include a $37 million award to expand a nationwide TETRA network in Africa, $34 million for 2 P25 contracts with the U.S. federal government and a $20 million award for a P25 network with a large U.S. utility customer. 
In our services segment, we opened a new network operations center in Penang to deliver mission-critical support services to customers in the Asia Pacific region. 
We also have been demonstrating our vision for the command center of the future using a combination of virtual reality and eye interaction technologies to immerse the public safety command center supervisor in an incident scene. This focus on the command center underlines the recent Spillman Technology acquisition, which adds important software solutions to our command center software offerings. We expect these investments and market traction to continue as exemplified by our recent $12 million award from the Los Angeles Police Department for a command center upgrade. 
I'd now like to turn the call back over to Greg."

And finally, looking to 2017, I like our path and our momentum towards continued revenue growth, earnings expansion and strong cash flow generation.

I was wondering what gives you that confidence. So if I look at North America, organically, it's up low single digit today. Do you expect continued growth there? Or should you expect -- do you have confidence in growth in '17 because you think you will see the beginning of a rebound in market that had been badly hurt this year like South America, China and Europe has still the difficult comps? And then of course, a quick follow-up. If you could give us a couple of comments on the Spillman acquisition. How much do you think it contributes to growth next year? And what's the business mix? And how would you see the integration of the business in MSI, in particular, which is like to fairly match your business? Is that the right way to think about it to match your business, which you're going to generate synergies? Or is that a business you can grow?"

On Spillman Technologies, we're not going to dimensionalize yet here the revenue until the deal closes, which we would expect to be sometime between now and the end of the year. The way to think about it is it's right",291,"So let me take the second one first. On Spillman Technologies, we're not going to dimensionalize yet here the revenue until the deal closes, which we would expect to be sometime between now and the end of the year. The way to think about it is it's right in the sweet spot of what we talked around deploying capital in command center software. So we have a high-end CAD offering, a Tier 1 offering, if you will, for large cities and CAD that we've been selling for several years. Spillman complements that nicely with Tier 2 and Tier 3. So it rounds out the portfolio around CAD, and consistent with the software in command centers that we said was critical to marry with the incident management and situational awareness of our radio communications offerings. We'll be able to dimensionalize it more specifically after it closes. I would, though, just say -- I think I would describe it as a small tuck-in, so I wouldn't want you to think of a significant materiality in changing our expectations for 2017. As it relates to 2017, as Gino talked about, the way to think about it is Airwave being flat -- I have to say Airwave's performed absolutely consistent to our expectations. The contract is unchanged. Obviously, we've had pressure from the pound from the time that we acquired it. But year-over-year, expect Airwave to be flat at about $460 million. iDEN, as expected and pretty much almost done, winds down another $50 million in 2017. But even with those ingredients, we still expect growth overall. And assumed in that overall growth is, obviously, organic growth overall. But beyond that, we would then finish Q4 and specify the actual numbers on the next call."

As we think about it, even though we're not guiding for 2017, in terms of that area of opportunity, I would say it's comparable to maybe slightly up.

Pivot to the federal market, extremely proud, as Gino and Greg alluded to earlier, of not only North America, but I think in particular the federal team. We had a very strong close to the fiscal close, which was at the end of September, which you're aware of. It's a $500 million approximately business for us.

But if we're looking at the different moving parts between products and services, it feels like product revenue growth would be up for the first time in 4 years heading into 2017. How should we think about that? And as part of that, can you also discuss just the general trends in some of your businesses related to software command and control? How quickly are those areas ramping of segments that you previously called next-generation public safety, or if I got the terminology wrong, but I think that was close enough there?"

And we're pleased with the trends on that, but wouldn't get out yet talking about that segment for 2017. I think on the kind of next-generation public safety area, software and services, if you want to describe it that way, I'm pretty pleased with it. I think we're measured in our investments. It's not large, as you know, but it's important. If you think about services as an example, 40% of our revenue, 40% of the company's revenue is services, and 25% of the company's revenue is recurring. So as we build traction and expand multi-year services backlog, that's a great thing. And again, it represents the confidence our customers have in the efficacy and the performance of LMR and the longevity of it. And then we layer on additional applications, intelligent middleware, command center software, analytics and other things that we think could position us well with value-added services and software in the command center that are on top of our typical infrastructure or mission-critical communications product business. So I'm pleased with it, and I think there'll continue to be some opportunities for inorganic as well within the envelope of the capital allocation model that we've talked about on a normalized basis. So we've always talked 50-30-20: 50% of our operating cash flow would be used for share repurchase or M&A, 30% for CapEx, and 20% for dividend. And I think we'll continue to operate in that envelope -- 30% actually dividend, 20% CapEx. I always -- I'm dyslexic on that, sorry. But I think we have a good balance sheet and a good position to be able to pursue these."

We're particularly excited to be delivering this call from our new corporate headquarters in Chicago and home of the world champion Chicago Cubs, pretty special. Having said that, I'd like to share a few thoughts about the overall business before Gino takes us through the results and outlook. 
First, Q3 was an excellent quarter. Our operational execution and solid financial results were anchored by strength in North America and our growing Managed & Support services business. We grew revenue 8%, along with significant growth in earnings and $348 million of operating cash flow. 
Second, we continue to invest in developing our software and services portfolio, including the recently announced Spillman Technologies acquisition. Spillman's command center software is an important complementary addition to our existing software portfolio. 
And finally, I'm pleased to announce that we're raising our full year guidance for earnings and also raising the dividend by 15%. And as I look to next year, we remain committed to growing revenue and cash flow with an efficient cost structure while driving even more innovation. 
So at this point, I'll turn the call over to Gino to provide additional details on Q3 and outlook before returning to provide some closing thoughts."

Q3 results include revenue of $1.5 billion, up 8% versus last year, including Airwave revenue of $131 million; GAAP operating earnings of $341 million; non-GAAP operating earnings of $396 million or 25.8% of sales, up 530 basis points f",988,"Thank you, Greg. 
Q3 results include revenue of $1.5 billion, up 8% versus last year, including Airwave revenue of $131 million; GAAP operating earnings of $341 million; non-GAAP operating earnings of $396 million or 25.8% of sales, up 530 basis points from the year-ago quarter. GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.13 compared to $0.63 in the third quarter of 2015. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.37 versus $0.82 in the year ago quarter, a 67% year-over-year increase. 
Ending backlog is up $2.1 billion versus last year, $1.4 billion from Airwave; $600 million from Managed & Support services, primarily driven by North America; and $62 million from Products. For the remainder of the call, we will reference non-GAAP financial results, including those in our outlook, unless otherwise noted. 
Q3 product sales were $920 million, down 1% versus last year on solid North America performance, offset by a large P25 project in Africa last year and China softness. Q3 product segment operating income was $243 million or 26.4% of sales, up 250 basis points versus last year, driven by lower OpEx. Product segment backlog ended the quarter at $1.4 billion, up 5% or $62 million versus last year, driven by North America. Sequentially, product backlog was up $63 million with growth in North America, Latin America and EMEA. 
Turning to Services. Q3 Services revenue was $612 million, up 23% including Airwave. Excluding Airwave, Managed & Support services grew 5%. Services operating income was $153 million, up $82 million from the prior year. Operating margins increased from 14.3% to 25% of revenue on Airwave contributions and improved gross margin. Services backlog ended at $6.7 billion, up $2.1 billion versus last year. Of the $2.1 billion increase, Airwave was $1.4 billion and organic Managed & Support services was up over $600 million. Sequentially, Services backlog is down $136 million due to currency adjustments related to the British pound and Airwave backlog conversion to revenue against the fixed contract. 
Moving to operating expenses. Total OpEx from continuing operations was $369 million, down $27 million or 7% from the year-ago quarter, driven by continued cost reduction activities. Other income and expense was $48 million compared to $34 million in the year-ago quarter, driven primarily by higher interest expense. The Q3 effective tax rate was 33%. 
Q3 operating cash flow was $348 million, an increase of $47 million, driven by higher earnings. Free cash flow was $280 million, an increase of $29 million versus last year. We ended Q3 with cash of $1.7 billion and a net debt position of $3.4 billion. During the quarter, we repurchased $109 million of stock at an average price of $73.11, and we paid dividends of $70 million. 
Turning to our outlook. We expect Q4 sales growth of 9% to 10%, including $120 million from Airwave. We expect Q4 non-GAAP EPS between $1.82 and $1.87. For the full year 2016, we expect revenue growth of 5% to 6%, and we now expect non-GAAP EPS of $4.67 to $4.72 versus the prior outlook of $4.45 to $4.65. This assumes a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 173 million shares. Full year operating expenses are expected to be down approximately $120 million versus 2015. We expect the full year 2016 effective tax rate to be approximately 32%. Operating cash flow is still expected to be approximately $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion and free cash flow of approximately $800 million to $900 million. Finally, share repurchases are expected to be in the range of $800 million to $900 million. 
Looking briefly at 2017, I'd like to make a few points. First, we now expect Airwave to be approximately flat given the current foreign exchange rates, and we expect iDEN to decline by $50 million next year. That said, we continue to expect overall growth in 2017, and we'll provide a full outlook on our next call. 
Moving to regional results. North America had another strong quarter with 4% growth, driven by both Products and Services. The pipeline and backlog remain healthy, particularly for multi-year services. North America remains on track for low single-digit growth for the full year. 
As expected, Latin America was down $15 million or 17% on continued challenging macroeconomic conditions and a $9 million iDEN decline. While this market remains challenged, we do see some signs of stabilization. 
EMEA was up 34%, including Airwave. Excluding Airwave, EMEA was down 20% as expected, driven by difficult comps including the Norway installation completion and a large P25 order last year. 
Asia Pac grew 2%, led by Services growth, which was partially offset by continued softness in China. 
Finally, I'd like to end with some notable segment highlights. In our Products segment, we announced several new products including the APX 8500, P25 all-band mobile radio. This device provides unlimited interoperability across public safety LMR networks as well as the ability to interface with 4G/LTE carrier networks and over secure Wi-Fi networks. We also won several notable deals that include a $37 million award to expand a nationwide TETRA network in Africa, $34 million for 2 P25 contracts with the U.S. federal government and a $20 million award for a P25 network with a large U.S. utility customer. 
In our Services segment, we opened a new network operations center in Penang to deliver mission-critical support services to customers in the Asia Pacific region. 
We also have been demonstrating our vision for the command center of the future using a combination of virtual reality and eye interaction technologies to immerse the public safety command center supervisor in an incident scene. This focus on the command center underlines the recent Spillman Technology acquisition, which adds important software solutions to our command center software offerings. We expect these investments and market traction to continue, as exemplified by our recent $12 million award from the Los Angeles Police Department for a command center upgrade. 
I'd now like to turn the call back over to Greg."

And then, Greg, if I could ask a quick follow-up on a product announcement this month. I think you announced or SouthernLINC announced that LTE push-to-talk deployment. Is that the first LTE push-to-talk that you guys have done? Or have you done any prior to that?"

And for 2017, early, we'll give further guidance on our next call, but the expectation should be high 40s. The margins have moved, as you indicated. There's a couple of things driving it. We'll start with Services. And within Services, clearly, Airwave margin has impacted our gross margins as well as the Norway project roll-off. Remember, over the past several quarters, we've talked about margins returning for Services in the mid-30s after the roll-off of systems integration. So those were 2 primary drivers on the Services side. On the Products side, comparable to the prior year in Q3. And mix to North America drove the margin profile in Q3."

On Spillman Technologies, we're not going to dimensionalize yet here the revenue until the deal closes, which we would expect to be sometime between now and the end of the year. The way to think about it is it's right in the sweet spot of what we talked around deploying capital in command center software. So we have a high-end CAD offering, a Tier 1 offering, if you will, for large cities in CAD that we've been selling for several years. Spillman complements that nicely with Tier 2 and Tier 3. So it rounds out the portfolio around CAD, and consistent with the software in command centers that we said was critical to marry with the incident management and situational awareness of our radio communications offerings. We'll be able to dimensionalize it more specifically after it closes. I would, though, just say -- I think I would describe it as a small tuck-in, so I wouldn't want you to think of a significant materiality in changing our expectations for 2017. As it relates to 2017, as Gino talked about, the way to think about it is Airwave being flat -- I have to say Airwave's performed absolutely consistent to our expectations. The contract is unchanged. Obviously, we've had pressure from the pound from the time that we acquired it. But year-over-year, expect Airwave to be flat at about $460 million. iDEN, as expected and pretty much almost done, winds down another $50 million in 2017. But even with those ingredients, we still expect growth overall. And assumed in that overall growth is, obviously, organic growth overall. But beyond that, we would then finish Q4 and specify the actual numbers on the next call."

And we're pleased with the trends on that, but wouldn't get out yet talking about that segment for 2017. I think on the kind of next-generation public safety area, software and services, if you want to describe it that way, I'm pretty pleased with it. I think we're measured in our investments. It's not large, as you know, but it's important. If you think about Services as an example, 40% of our revenue, 40% of the company's revenue is Services, and 25% of the company's revenue is recurring. So as we build traction and expand multi-year Services backlog, that's a great thing. And again, it represents the confidence our customers have in the efficacy and the performance of LMR and the longevity of it. And then we layer on additional applications, intelligent middleware, command center software, analytics and other things that we think could position us well with value-added services and software in the command center that are on top of our typical infrastructure or mission-critical communications product business. So I'm pleased with it, and I think there'll continue to be some opportunities for inorganic as well within the envelope of the capital allocation model that we've talked about on a normalized basis. So we've always talked 50-30-20: 50% of our operating cash flow would be used for share repurchase or M&A, 30% for CapEx, and 20% for dividend.

We're particularly excited to be delivering this call from our new corporate headquarters in Chicago and home of the world champion Chicago Cubs, pretty special. Having said that, I'd like to share a few thoughts about the overall business before Gino takes us through the results and outlook. 
First, Q3 was an excellent quarter. Our operational execution and solid financial results were anchored by strength in North America and our growing Managed & Support services business. We grew revenue 8%, along with significant growth in earnings and $348 million of operating cash flow. 
Second, we continue to invest in developing our software and services portfolio, including the recently announced Spillman Technologies acquisition. Spillman's command center software is an important complementary addition to our existing software portfolio. 
And finally, I'm pleased to announce that we're raising our full year guidance for earnings and also raising the dividend by 15%. And as I look to next year, we remain committed to growing revenue and cash flow with an efficient cost structure while driving even more innovation. 
So at this point, I'll turn the call over to Gino to provide additional details on Q3 and outlook before returning to provide some closing thoughts."

Q3 results include revenue of $1.5 billion, up 8% versus last year, including Airwave revenue of $131 million; GAAP operating earnings of $341 million; non-GAAP operating earnings of $396 million or 25.8% of sales, up 530 basis points f",988,"Thank you, Greg. 
Q3 results include revenue of $1.5 billion, up 8% versus last year, including Airwave revenue of $131 million; GAAP operating earnings of $341 million; non-GAAP operating earnings of $396 million or 25.8% of sales, up 530 basis points from the year-ago quarter. GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.13 compared to $0.63 in the third quarter of 2015. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.37 versus $0.82 in the year ago quarter, a 67% year-over-year increase. 
Ending backlog is up $2.1 billion versus last year, $1.4 billion from Airwave; $600 million from Managed & Support services, primarily driven by North America; and $62 million from Products. For the remainder of the call, we will reference non-GAAP financial results, including those in our outlook, unless otherwise noted. 
Q3 product sales were $920 million, down 1% versus last year on solid North America performance, offset by a large P25 project in Africa last year and China softness. Q3 product segment operating income was $243 million or 26.4% of sales, up 250 basis points versus last year, driven by lower OpEx. Product segment backlog ended the quarter at $1.4 billion, up 5% or $62 million versus last year, driven by North America. Sequentially, product backlog was up $63 million with growth in North America, Latin America and EMEA. 
Turning to Services. Q3 Services revenue was $612 million, up 23% including Airwave. Excluding Airwave, Managed & Support services grew 5%. Services operating income was $153 million, up $82 million from the prior year. Operating margins increased from 14.3% to 25% of revenue on Airwave contributions and improved gross margin. Services backlog ended at $6.7 billion, up $2.1 billion versus last year. Of the $2.1 billion increase, Airwave was $1.4 billion and organic Managed & Support services was up over $600 million. Sequentially, Services backlog is down $136 million due to currency adjustments related to the British pound and Airwave backlog conversion to revenue against the fixed contract. 
Moving to operating expenses. Total OpEx from continuing operations was $369 million, down $27 million or 7% from the year-ago quarter, driven by continued cost reduction activities. Other income and expense was $48 million compared to $34 million in the year-ago quarter, driven primarily by higher interest expense. The Q3 effective tax rate was 33%. 
Q3 operating cash flow was $348 million, an increase of $47 million, driven by higher earnings. Free cash flow was $280 million, an increase of $29 million versus last year. We ended Q3 with cash of $1.7 billion and a net debt position of $3.4 billion. During the quarter, we repurchased $109 million of stock at an average price of $73.11, and we paid dividends of $70 million. 
Turning to our outlook. We expect Q4 sales growth of 9% to 10%, including $120 million from Airwave. We expect Q4 non-GAAP EPS between $1.82 and $1.87. For the full year 2016, we expect revenue growth of 5% to 6%, and we now expect non-GAAP EPS of $4.67 to $4.72 versus the prior outlook of $4.45 to $4.65. This assumes a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 173 million shares. Full year operating expenses are expected to be down approximately $120 million versus 2015. We expect the full year 2016 effective tax rate to be approximately 32%. Operating cash flow is still expected to be approximately $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion and free cash flow of approximately $800 million to $900 million. Finally, share repurchases are expected to be in the range of $800 million to $900 million. 
Looking briefly at 2017, I'd like to make a few points. First, we now expect Airwave to be approximately flat given the current foreign exchange rates, and we expect iDEN to decline by $50 million next year. That said, we continue to expect overall growth in 2017, and we'll provide a full outlook on our next call. 
Moving to regional results. North America had another strong quarter with 4% growth, driven by both Products and Services. The pipeline and backlog remain healthy, particularly for multi-year services. North America remains on track for low single-digit growth for the full year. 
As expected, Latin America was down $15 million or 17% on continued challenging macroeconomic conditions and a $9 million iDEN decline. While this market remains challenged, we do see some signs of stabilization. 
EMEA was up 34%, including Airwave. Excluding Airwave, EMEA was down 20% as expected, driven by difficult comps including the Norway installation completion and a large P25 order last year. 
Asia Pac grew 2%, led by Services growth, which was partially offset by continued softness in China. 
Finally, I'd like to end with some notable segment highlights. In our Products segment, we announced several new products including the APX 8500, P25 all-band mobile radio. This device provides unlimited interoperability across public safety LMR networks as well as the ability to interface with 4G/LTE carrier networks and over secure Wi-Fi networks. We also won several notable deals that include a $37 million award to expand a nationwide TETRA network in Africa, $34 million for 2 P25 contracts with the U.S. federal government and a $20 million award for a P25 network with a large U.S. utility customer. 
In our Services segment, we opened a new network operations center in Penang to deliver mission-critical support services to customers in the Asia Pacific region. 
We also have been demonstrating our vision for the command center of the future using a combination of virtual reality and eye interaction technologies to immerse the public safety command center supervisor in an incident scene. This focus on the command center underlines the recent Spillman Technology acquisition, which adds important software solutions to our command center software offerings. We expect these investments and market traction to continue, as exemplified by our recent $12 million award from the Los Angeles Police Department for a command center upgrade. 
I'd now like to turn the call back over to Greg."

Let me just close with a few thoughts. First, I was pleased with our performance in Q3. We grew revenue and improved earnings and cash flow. We made investments and performed well in a number of key areas, including continued growth in our Managed & Support services business and strong results in North America. Additionally, the $600 million of organic backlog growth in Managed & Support services, I think, is a strong indication of the confidence expressed by our customers in the ongoing criticality and longevity of LMR into the future. 
And finally, looking to 2017, I like our path and our momentum towards continued revenue growth, earnings expansion and strong cash flow generation. 
And now I'll turn it back over to Chris."

We'll start with Services. And within Services, clearly, Airwave margin has impacted our gross margins as well as the Norway project roll-off. Remember, over the past several quarters, we've talked about margins returning for Services in the mid-30s after the roll-off of systems integration. So those were 2 primary drivers on the Services side. On the Products side, comparable to the prior year in Q3. And mix to North America drove the margin profile in Q3."

On Spillman Technologies, we're not going to dimensionalize yet here the revenue until the deal closes, which we would expect to be sometime between now and the end of the year. The way to think about it is it's right in the sweet spot of what we talked around deploying capital in command center software. So we have a high-end CAD offering, a Tier 1 offering, if you will, for large cities in CAD that we've been selling for several years. Spillman complements that nicely with Tier 2 and Tier 3. So it rounds out the portfolio around CAD, and consistent with the software in command centers that we said was critical to marry with the incident management and situational awareness of our radio communications offerings. We'll be able to dimensionalize it more specifically after it closes. I would, though, just say -- I think I would describe it as a small tuck-in, so I wouldn't want you to think of a significant materiality in changing our expectations for 2017. As it relates to 2017, as Gino talked about, the way to think about it is Airwave being flat -- I have to say Airwave's performed absolutely consistent to our expectations. The contract is unchanged. Obviously, we've had pressure from the pound from the time that we acquired it. But year-over-year, expect Airwave to be flat at about $460 million. iDEN, as expected and pretty much almost done, winds down another $50 million in 2017. But even with those ingredients, we still expect growth overall. And assumed in that overall growth is, obviously, organic growth overall. But beyond that, we would then finish Q4 and specify the actual numbers on the next call."

Pivot to the federal market, extremely proud, as Gino and Greg alluded to earlier, of not only North America, but I think in particular the federal team. We had a very strong close to the fiscal close, which was at the end of September, which you're aware of. It's a $500 million approximately business for us.

Think of them in 3 buckets: the command center software, which we announced with Spillman, look to close that between now and the end of the year; the Managed Services business, we obviously closed Airwave in February; and there are a few opportunities of what I would characterize as mini Airwaves, a lot more mini Airwaves, nothing of that size. But if there's opportunities where we could get a healthy return on invested capital by taking over the management of a public safety network either domestically or internationally, we'll evaluate it and consider it. And lastly, just areas that reinforce our durability in the public safety platform business, we'll give consideration as well. But it's consistent with what we've talked about, primarily with a focus around software and services."

Number one, the core business returns to organic growth in Q4. Really important. We stated that as our intention, and we anticipate fulfilling that. So that's obviously a significant key component. Second, Product backlog has grown both sequentially and year-on-year, also important as we are almost midway through Q4 from a momentum standpoint. Third, overall backlog growth is up in North America, EMEA and Latin America. And as Gino referenced a few minutes ago, aged backlog overall is up year-on-year as well. So those are nice trends to kind of run through the take -- through Q3 and positions us very well, I think, for performance that's incorporated into the way we thought about the guidance for Q4."

And we're pleased with the trends on that, but wouldn't get out yet talking about that segment for 2017. I think on the kind of next-generation public safety area, software and services, if you want to describe it that way, I'm pretty pleased with it. I think we're measured in our investments. It's not large, as you know, but it's important. If you think about Services as an example, 40% of our revenue, 40% of the company's revenue is Services, and 25% of the company's revenue is recurring. So as we build traction and expand multi-year Services backlog, that's a great thing. And again, it represents the confidence our customers have in the efficacy and the performance of LMR and the longevity of it. And then we layer on additional applications, intelligent middleware, command center software, analytics and other things that we think could position us well with value-added services and software in the command center that are on top of our typical infrastructure or mission-critical communications product business. So I'm pleased with it, and I think there'll continue to be some opportunities for inorganic as well within the envelope of the capital allocation model that we've talked about on a normalized basis. So we've always talked 50-30-20: 50% of our operating cash flow would be used for share repurchase or M&A, 30% for CapEx, and 20% for dividend. And I think we'll continue to operate in that envelope -- 30% actually dividend, 20% CapEx. I always -- I'm dyslexic on that, sorry.
