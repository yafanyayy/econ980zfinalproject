Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We're very pleased to finish 2015 with another strong quarter. As I'm sure you've seen, we reported operating income of $886 million or $2.90 per share in operating return on eq",878,"Thank you, Gabby. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We're very pleased to finish 2015 with another strong quarter. As I'm sure you've seen, we reported operating income of $886 million or $2.90 per share in operating return on equity of 15.8%. That caps off another terrific year with operating income of just over $3.4 billion, operating income per diluted share of a record-high $10.87 and operating return on equity of 15.2%. 
Our underwriting results across the board remain strong as you can see from our combined ratio of 86.6% for the quarter and 88.3% for the year. In domestic business insurance, consistent with our market place objectives, we achieved a record level of retention in the quarter with positive renewal rate change. In bond and specialty insurance, we generated an all-time best underlying combined ratio of 80.1% for the year. Broadly speaking, the market dynamics in the commercial insurance marketplace continue to be remarkably stable. 
In personal alliance, Quantum Auto 2.0 continues to meet our expectations. In Agency Auto, we had year-over-year policy in-force growth of 8% in the fourth quarter. And as you can see in the webcast, that's the sixth consecutive potential quarter of increasing discount. Those of you who have been following our Agency Auto story know what a success it has been. We're also pleased to be seeing an impact from the success of Quantum Auto 2.0 on our Homeowners's business, and you will hear more about that from Doreen.
Jay Benet will have more to say about our current investment results, but I'll just note that we have delivered pretty exceptional returns on equity for quite some time, notwithstanding all the headwinds in the investment arena. Historically though, interest rates, the decline in energy prices and the volatility in the equity markets are just some examples for this quarter. This speaks to volumes about our ability to select and price underwriting risk and the strength of our insurance franchises. 
Just as a data point, our after-tax net investment income is about $1 billion lower in 2015 as compared to its high in 2007. On the other hand, our aftertax underlying margin is about $1 billion higher in 2015 than it is in its low in 2011. Particularly to the extent that fixed income yields remain low, and that seems like the outlook for at least some time, and with capital finding its way into the largest end of this business, expertise in generating underwriting returns and having strong franchises in the small and middle market places with meaningful barriers to entry will really matter. 
Turning to capital management, consistent with our ongoing capital management strategy, we returned nearly $1.2 billion of capital to our shareholders in the quarter and nearly $4 billion during the year.
The long time consistent strength of our results sits behind our capital management strategy. Just as we have for nearly a decade, we will continue to right size capital and invest thoughtfully in the business. Thanks to that strategy, we've now returned close to $35  billion of capital to shareholders since the middle of 2006 when we started our share repurchase program. 
Let me take just a minute to comment on the leadership transition. What I suspect many of you want to hear from me is where do we go from here? As I've explained to our leadership team, our challenge is this: To take today's summit and make it tomorrow's base count. I'm confident that we already have the right strategy in place to do that and we've got the right team to execute it. We've been executing you, we understand it and have been remarkably successful. It's this team's strategy, delivering superior returns over time will continue to be our Northstar. We'll do that by investing in and leveraging our competitive advantages, delivering industry-leading products and services and making sure this is a great place to work for the best talent in this industry. That's not to say that we won't challenge ourselves constantly to make sure that both the strategy and the way we're executing on it remains relevant. It's critical that we reassess all the time and we will continue to be a leader in evolving and integrating, particularly given the potential for change around us. Among other things, we'll continue to refine our Data & Analytics to make sure that we lead in risk selection and pricing. We'll continue to innovate on the product side and in our claim and risk control organizations to sure that we're delivering at the forefront for our agents, brokers and customers. And we'll continue to build on our leading position with our distribution partners to make sure that we're a partner of choice for them. 
We've always understood the value of size and scale, and we're well positioned in that regard. Just as in the past, we'll seek opportunities to grow thoughtfully in ways that contribute to shareholder value. And as always, we'll manage our expenses thoughtfully. 
All of that is business as usual for us. Our confidence in our strategy and our track record in executing on it gives us confidence in our ability to continue to deliver for our shareholders. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Jay Benet."

Net income per diluted share of $2.83, operating income per diluted share of $2.90 and an operating are we of 15.8%. These results were driven by the continuation of our very strong current accident year underwriting performance as evidenced by an underlying combined ratio of 90.7% despite relatively high non-cat weather-related losses in the quarter. 
Net favorable prior year reserve development was very strong at $292 million pretax and cat losses were relatively modest at $46 million pretax. That said, as shown on Page 4 of the webcast, current quarter results were lower than our very strong fourth quarter 2014 results, mostly due to the impact of low interest rates in private equity returns for our net investment income and an even higher amount of net favorable prior year reserve development in the prior year quarter. 
Underlying underwriting margins were pretty much the same in both quarters. Fixed income NII of $422 million aftertax was down $31 million from the prior year quarter, principally due to what we've been saying for many years. Securities that had higher book yields and runoff during the past 12 months and have been replaced with securities having lower yields due to the current low interest rate environment. 
Another contributing factor to lower fixed income NII was the modest reduction in average investments that resulted in part from the company's $579 million first quarter 2015 payment to settle the asbestos direct action litigation. 
Looking forward, based on the current interest rate environment, we would expect that the impact of lower reinvestment yields and the lower level of fixed maturity investment could in 2016 result in approximately $20 million to $25 million of lower aftertax NII on a quarterly basis when compared to the corresponding period of 2015.
Non-fixed income NII of $25 million aftertax was down $42 million from the prior-year quarter, primarily due to lower private equity returns. Private equities essentially broke even this quarter as compared to earnings $30 million aftertax in the prior year quarter due to lower valuations for energy-related investments.
Each of our business segments continue to benefit from net favorable prior year reserve development. In Business and International Insurance, net favorable development of $176 million pretax primarily resulted from better-than-expected loss experienced in workers' comp for accident years 2006 and prior and accident years 2014. In general, liability for both primary and excess coverages for accident years 2012 and prior and in the company's operations in Canada. 
In Bond & Specialty Insurance, net favorable development of $80 million pretax primarily resulted from better-than-expected loss experienced in fidelity and surety for accident years 2012 through 2014. And in Personal Insurance, net favorable development of $36 million pretax primarily resulted from better-than-expected loss experienced in Auto liability for accident years 2013 and '14, and in Homeowners and other liability for accident year 2014. 
As I've done in the past, I'd also like to provide you with some insight as to what our combined 2015 Schedule P is expected to show and it's filed on May 1.
On a combined stat basis for all of our U.S. subs, all accident years in the aggregate across all product lines are expected to develop favorably, and all but one product line on Schedule P are expected to develop either favorably or show very modest or de minimis unfavorable development. The product line that is expected to develop unfavorably by approximately $50 million pretax is products liability occurrence, but another product line, other liability occurrence, will have an offsetting amount of favorable development as we refined our allocation of IDNR between these 2 components of general liability based upon how losses such as those related to construction defect have been developing by coverage type.
In total, our general liabilities reserves were not affected by these actions. 
Returning to GAAP, for the year, we had net favorable development of $941 million pretax with approximately $840 million coming from our U.S. ops and a little over $100 million coming from our Canadian and U.K. operations. 
There are 2 additional topics I'd like to update you on. As shown on Page 21 of the webcast, we renewed our corporate that aggregate XOL Treaty effective January 1. The treaty provides coverage for both single cat events and an accumulation of losses from multiple cat events with similar terms in the prior but at a lower cost. The treaty continues to provide $1.5 billion of coverage, part of $2 billion excess of $3 billion after a $100 million deductible per occurrence. It keeps the same broad parallel and geographic coverage in the same positioning of the coverage layer, providing a significant buffer between earnings and capital. The treaty has a single limit with no reinstatement provisions, and please note that the total cost of this treaty, and therefore, the reduction in costs are quite small in relation to our operating income. 
The second topic relates to the recent drop in oil prices. Page 22 of the webcast contains updated information showing the magnitude of our investments in below investment grade energy bonds and energy-related equities. And as you can see, the sum of these investments is relatively small and the exposure is quite manageable.
Operating cash flows remains strong at $760 million in the fourth quarter after making a $100 million discretionary contribution to our qualified pension plan, bringing total operating cash flows to over $3.4 billion for the year.  We continue to generate much more capital than we need to support our businesses and consistent with our ongoing capital management strategy as you heard from Alan, we returned almost $1.2 billion of excess capital to our shareholders this quarter through dividends of $183 million and common share repurchases of a little over $1 billion.
For the full year, we returned almost $4 billion of excess capital to our shareholders through dividends of $744 million and common share repurchases of over $3.2 billion.
Holding company liquidity ended the year at $1.6 billion, well above our target level, and our debt-to-total capital ratio, which was 23% at the beginning of the quarter, slightly elevated due to our having issued $400 million of debt in the third quarter to prefund $400 million of debt that was maturing in the fourth quarter, has come back down to 22.1%, well within its target range with the retirement of that debt. 
Net unless investment gains were almost $2 billion pretax or $1.3 billion after-tax, which was down from $3 billion and $2 billion, respectively, at the beginning of the year due to an increase in interest rates and spreads. 
Book value per share of $79.75 grew 3% from the beginning of the year, and importantly, adjusted book value per share of $75.39, which eliminates the aftertax impact of net unrealized investment gains grew by 6% this year. 
So with that, let me turn the microphone over to Brian."

Business in International Insurance results for both the fourth quarter and the full year were strong. We continue to generate excellent returns for the full year combined ratio of 92.1% and our retention throughout the year was very strong and reached a record level this quarter in our domestic business. Pricing trends remained relatively consistent, with renewal rate change still slightly positive at the end of the year, while new business volume in our domestic business saw a modest increase. 
Turning to the quarter's financial results, operating income was $566 million, with a very strong combined ratio of $89.6 million. The underlying combined ratio, which excludes the impact of cats in prior year reserve development was $94.4 million, up half a point compared to the fourth quarter of 2014, primarily due to a higher level of noncat weather-related losses. 
Looking at the top line, net written premiums for the quarter were down about 1.5 points compared to the fourth quarter of 2014 with domestic business insurance premium up about a point. 
In domestic business insurance, we remain pleased with the continued execution of our pricing strategy. As we've been saying for some time, given the attractive returns that we are generating in this business, our focus continues to be on retention, and accordingly, we are very pleased that retention improved to a record 85% in the quarter.
Renewal premium change came in at 2.4 points, while renewal rate change remain positive, but down slightly versus the third quarter. New business of $476 million was up compared to both the prior year and the third quarter. 
Looking at each of our individual domestic businesses, beginning with Select, rate and renewal premium change were inline with recent quarters, while retention remained strong at 82%, demonstrating continued stability in this segment of the market. 
In the middle market, we achieved record retention of 88%, overall rate change was about flat and reflected a decline of about a point from the third quarter.
As we've always said, the execution below the headline numbers is what matters, and we continue to feel great about the granular results. Retention for our best performing business was just over 90%, with an average rate decline of less than 2% on those accounts. While for our poor performing business, we continued to get rate in excess of loss trend. 
In terms of exposure, the quarter's results includes a drag of about a point from our oil and gas business, resulting from reduced economic activity due to lower energy prices. Just as a reference point, our oil and gas business makes up only about 3% of domestic business insurance written premium. 
Middle Market new business of $254 million was up from the third quarter and in line with the prior year.
In other Business Insurance, retention was strong at 80%, renewal rate change was about flat even after being negatively impacted by our National Property business. As I mentioned last quarter, although National Property is seeing the largest rate declines of any business in our portfolio, we are pleased with the overall performance of this business. Returns and retention remains strong and pricing trends are stable. Excluding National Property, renewal rate change for other Business Insurance remains positive and was relatively stable with the third quarter.
Turning to International. Net written premiums were down about 16% for the quarter and 14% for the full year, primarily due to the adverse impact of foreign exchange rates. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, net written premiums for the fourth quarter were down about 6%, largely driven by declines in retention in Canada and, to a lesser extent, at Lloyds.
International retention was down in the quarter to 79%, however, renewal premium change was slightly positive and renewal business for the quarter -- and new business for the quarter was very strong at $80 million, up 18% year-over-year.
In Canada, a competitive renewal environment adversely impacted retention across our book. However, in June, we launched Optima, our new strategic insurance platform in Canada for Personal Insurance. Optima was modeled after our U.S.-based Quantum Auto 2.0 product. During the early days of the rollout, we're pleased with the initial response as we are seeing a significant increase in new business volume. 
In Lloyds, we continue to see a challenging market resulting from global economic conditions, particularly in our Marine business. Offsetting this pressure, our 2 new business products that we've recently launched, focused on renewable energy and global construction and early returns, are encouraging. So all in for the segment, it was a terrific 2015, with strong financial results and what we see as a remarkably stable environment, one where our competitive advantages really matter to our customers and agents. 
Before I turn it over to Doreen, I want to make one comment on our outlook for operating margins, which we include in our quarterly filings. Since our 10-K won't be filed for a few weeks, I would note that we expect our 2016 underlying underwriting margin for the segment will be broadly consistent with 2015. This is subject to the usual caveats and forward-looking statement disclaimers. With that, let me turn it over to  Doreen."
392856,311922521,919779,"The Travelers Companies, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 21, 2016",2016-01-21,"Earnings Calls","The Travelers Companies, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Brian, and good morning, everyone.

Bond & Specialty Insurance finished 2015 with another quarter of exceptional financial results. Operating income for the quarter was $162 million, down from the fourth quarter of 2014 due to lower net favorable prior year reserve development, but overall, still a great result. The underlying combined ratio of 80.7 was 3.4 points better than the prior year quarter due primarily to 2 factors: A modest increase in the lots ratio in the prior year quarter that resulted from the reestimation of the first three quarters of 2014; and secondly, the impact of certain customer-related intangible assets, which became fully amortized during the second quarter of 2015.
Underlying underwriting results continue to run well within our long-term target ranges. And as Alan mentioned, the full year underlying combined ratio of 80.1 was an all-time best. We obviously don't think these results come by accident. We pride ourselves on maintaining the underwriting discipline, aggressive management of risks and limits, strong account and agency relationships and claims management that drive these results. 
As we look ahead to 2016 for this segment, we expect underlying underwriting margin to remain broadly consistent with 2015. 
As for tax line, net written premiums in the aggregate were down 4% from the fourth quarter of 2014, primarily due to a decline in Surety volume, driven by lower bonding needs for our account particularly as compared to the strong production in the fourth quarter of 2014, specifically quarter-over-quarter number, based on the number, size and timing of bonded construction projects awarded to our customers. 
We have a strong portfolio of Surety clients and believe we really remained well-positioned to capitalize on increased bonding needs that might result from an improved economy. 
Across our Management Liability businesses, retention remained strong at 85%, while new business premium was up 17% from the fourth quarter of 2014. Renewal premium change trended down due to lower rates being partially offset by an increase in other RPC, which includes changes in the size of insured exposure, limits written, attachment point and policy generation. The lower rate was as expected and is consistent with the strong profitability of our portfolio. So all in all, another great quarter closing a strong year for Bond & Specialty Insurance.
I'll turn now to Personal Insurance, where we close out the year with another quarter of exceptional underwriting results. For the segment, operating income for the quarter were $222 million and the underlying combined ratio was 86.2%. Great results. And as we move forward, this segment remains positioned to perform inline with our long-term return goal. I'll touch on the quarterly results for Agency Auto and Agency Property in a moment. But first, I'd like to share with you some thoughts on how we view the underlying results of these businesses.
First, for Auto. I'll start by saying how pleased we are with the vibrancy of our Auto business. The market response from both agents and consumers to Quantum Auto 2.0 remains incredibly strong, and the portfolio is positioned to generate financial returns within our long-term target range. 
In the Agency channel, we added 167,000 policies during 2015, an 8% increase from the end of 2014. As always, there remains competition in Auto, and we remain committed to keeping our products priced accordingly through disciplined expense management and superior pricing and underwriting segmentation. As we look ahead to 2016, we expect the Auto business to continue to grow in both policy count and premium volume, although at a more moderated percentage than 2015 as the portfolio grows.
As for agency Auto profitability, we've mentioned on several occasions that we are comfortable with where our margins are given the current market environment. That still remains the case today. 
With full year underlying Agency combined ratio of just under 97% was inline with our expectations for the year and the result we are pleased with the. This combined ratio is somewhat higher than our long-term goal, driven particularly by the amount of new business that we've added over the past 2 years. 
Quantum Auto 2.0 is priced to our long-term target returns. But as you all know, the relatively higher combined ratio of new business improves over time. As we look into 2016, the significant volume of new business we've added will drive a slightly higher calendar year combined ratio compared to 2015. So far, the profitability of Quantum Auto 2.0 is maturing in line with our expectations. With this return profile, we continue to seek more new business as it should be accretive to long-term returns. 
On Homeowners the financial returns generated in the last couple of years has been exceptional and well within our target range. As you recall, we made significant improvements in the risk profile of this business over the last few years, including changes in deductibles, other terms and conditions and tightened underwriting guidelines. Of course, this is a more volatile business that will always have a weather dynamics to it. The weather in the last couple of years were somewhat lower than our model suggested, but we know that won't always be the case. 
As we look ahead to 2016 with respect to profitability, we do expect underlying underwriting margins in Agency Homeowners and Others to be lower than 2015, reflecting more normalized levels of loss activity. As Alan mentioned, we're also very pleased with the improvements we've seen in Homeowners production. This is attributable in part to account rounding, along with making some localized pricing and process adjustments, and certainly the turnaround benefited from the momentum in agent engagements from the rollout of Quantum Auto 2.0. At this point, the business has leveled off from the policies in-force perspective, and we expect modest growth in 2016. 
Now I'll just highlight a couple of things specific to the quarter. Looking at Agency Auto, new business premium was up 32% and net premium was up 12% from fourth quarter 2014 level, and we've added 51,000 policies during the quarter. The combined ratio for the quarter was 98.1 and included over 2 points of favorable prior year reserve development. 
The underlying combined ratio was 100.2, up from the prior-year due predominantly to adverse weather in this year's quarter and the benefit in the prior year quarter of 2.5 points favorable reestimation of losses related to the first three quarters of 2014. As for loss trend in Auto, our view of normalized frequency and severity remains consistent with recent quarters at around 3% in aggregate. There continues to be a lot of discussion about trend, particularly increasing frequency. From our vantage point, while we may observe normal fluctuations in any particular period due to things like weather, we see a stable and unchanged long-term frequency trend. 
As always, we continue to monitor external information in our own date the closely using our extensive analytic capability. 
Turning to Agency Homeowners and other for the quarter, we once again had strong financial results despite relatively active weather in the month of December. The underlying combined ratio of 69.5 was slightly higher than the exceptionally favorable prior-year quarter. As for production, new business premiums were up 27% from the prior year quarter and continue to trend favorably, while retention remained strong at 85%.
Policies in-force were up slightly both sequentially from last quarter and from the fourth quarter of 2014. So to sum up Personal Insurance, we're exceptionally proud of the year we've had and look forward to more of the same in 2016. 
With that, I'll turn the call back to Gabby."

But even with those better accounts, the conversation starts somewhere with trying to renew with that at a modest decline or flat. Obviously, if the average is less than 2%, there are still some that were positive. The thing that we're doing probably a little different than we were a year or 2 ago is we're really trying to get out as early as possible frequently at least 3, if not 6 months ahead of time, have conversations with the broker and the account. I think we do have a strong franchise with a valued product and valued services, and fortunately, most of those companies start by wanting to stay with us. And then I think the other key point is really being able to have the data and analytics, where our front-line people can see and really segment their portfolio in the middle market, account by account, look at how they're performing. And then there are issues either in that account, in that line or in that class of business, being able to have an informed conversation with the broker about what those are and why we're trying to do what we're doing on the account really, really makes a difference.

That was a ratio that was used at a time when rating agencies and regulators didn't have the sophisticated models they have today. So as I've said on previous calls, we deal with each one of the models, whether it's our internal models, the regulatory models or the rating agency models to come to a place where given the profile of our business as it relates to each quarter, what is the capital that we think we need in the operating entities that we manage to support a AA rating and support a solid AA rating, not one where when the wind blows, we're worried about our ratings going down. That's always the starting point. And given the size of our book, it doesn't change very much from quarter-to-quarter. But what this change is the profitability in each quarter. So there are some quarters where the profitability, whether it's for favorable development or some other things that take place is higher than our expectations. Keeping in mind that we have a flow of moneys out of the operating companies, up to the holding company each quarter based on expectations. So to the extent we earn more, we bring some more up probably a little later than that. I think if you go back over time and you go past 2 years ago to an earlier period and start adding up the earnings versus the share repurchases, you see that there's a very, very strong correlation to that. So I wouldn't read into anything that says one year we've done a little more than earnings, another year, we've done less. It's really just as Alan said earlier, the timing. And the premium to surplus ratio goes up a little bit, I kind of ignore that. What I look at is in our supplement, we talk about specifically on a quarterly basis what the stat surplus is, and I think you can see that that moves cannot probably in a pretty narrowband."

And again, it's not just rate, it's price, which includes exposure change and does offset some of the trends. So when we look at the arithmetic of earned rate versus loss trend, we come up with a very modest, about a half a point of loss ratio compression into 2016. And that, of course, is based on our assumption of loss trend, which is, as we said, running right now at about 4% and looking at a relatively stable orderly marketplace. And then that's offset by a variety of other factors, you can think of weather large losses, mix change, underwriting actions, et cetera. But the real starting point is that, that compression from the rate loss trend dynamic, price loss trend dynamic, is a pretty modest number in how we're looking at it."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We're very pleased to finish 2015 with another strong quarter. As I'm sure you've seen, we reported operating income of $886 million or $2.90 per share and operating return on e",880,"Thank you, Gabby. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We're very pleased to finish 2015 with another strong quarter. As I'm sure you've seen, we reported operating income of $886 million or $2.90 per share and operating return on equity of 15.8%. That caps off another terrific year with operating income of just over $3.4 billion, operating income per diluted share of a record-high $10.87 and operating return on equity of 15.2%.
Our underwriting results across the board remain strong as you can see from our combined ratio of 86.6% for the quarter and 88.3% for the year. In domestic Business Insurance, consistent with our market place objectives, we achieved a record level of retention in the quarter with positive renewal rate change. In Bond & Specialty Insurance, we generated an all-time best underlying combined ratio of 80.1% for the year. Broadly speaking, the market dynamics in the commercial insurance marketplace continue to be remarkably stable.
In personal alliance, Quantum Auto 2.0 continues to meet our expectations. In Agency Auto, we had year-over-year policies in force growth of 8% in the fourth quarter. And as you can see in the webcast, that's the sixth consecutive sequential quarter of increasing discount. Those of you who have been following our Agency Auto story know what a success it has been. We're also pleased to be seeing an impact from the success of Quantum Auto 2.0 in our Homeowners business, and you will hear more about that from Doreen.
Jay Benet will have more to say about our current investment results, but I'll just note that we have delivered pretty exceptional returns on equity for quite some time, notwithstanding all the headwinds in the investment arena. Historically though, interest rates, the decline in energy prices and volatility in the equity markets are just some examples for this quarter. This speaks to volumes about our ability to select and price underwriting risk and the strength of our insurance franchises.
Just as a data point, our after-tax net investment income is about $1 billion lower in 2015 as compared to its high in 2007. On the other hand, our aftertax underlying -- underwriting margin is about $1 billion higher in 2015 than it was its low in 2011. Particularly to the extent that fixed income yields remained low, and that seems like the outlook for at least some time, and with capital finding its way into the largest end of this business, expertise in generating underwriting returns and having strong franchises in the small and middle market places with meaningful barriers to entry will really matter.
Turning to capital management, consistent with our ongoing capital management strategy, we returned nearly $1.2 billion of capital to our shareholders in the quarter and nearly $4 billion during the year.
The long time consistent strength of our results sits behind our capital management strategy. Just as we have for nearly a decade, we will continue to right-size capital and invest thoughtfully in the business. Thanks to that strategy, we've now returned close to $35 billion of capital to shareholders since the middle of 2006 when we started our share repurchase program.
Let me take just a minute to comment on the leadership transition. What I suspect many of you want to hear from me is where do we go from here? As I've explained to our leadership team, our challenge is this: To take today's summit and make it tomorrow's base camp. I'm confident that we already have the right strategy in place to do that and we've got the right team to execute it. We've been executing it, we understand it and have been remarkably successful. It's this team's strategy, delivering superior returns over time will continue to be our Northstar. We'll do that by investing in and leveraging our competitive advantages, delivering industry-leading products and services and making sure this is a great place to work for the best talent in this industry.
That's not to say that we won't challenge ourselves constantly to make sure that both the strategy and the way we're executing on it remains relevant. It's critical that we reassess all the time. And we will continue to be a leader in evolving and innovating, particularly given the potential for change around us.
Among other things, we'll continue to refine our Data & Analytics to make sure that we lead in risk selection and pricing. We'll continue to innovate on the product side and in our claim and risk control organizations to make sure that we're delivering at the forefront for our agents, brokers and customers. And we'll continue to build on our leading position with our distribution partners to make sure that we're a partner of choice for them.
We've always understood the value of size and scale, and we're well positioned in that regard. Just as in the past, we'll seek opportunities to grow thoughtfully and in ways that contribute to shareholder value. And as always, we'll manage our expenses thoughtfully.
All of that is business as usual for us. Our confidence in our strategy and our track record in executing on it gives us confidence in our ability to continue to deliver for our shareholders.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Jay Benet."

Net income per diluted share of $2.83, operating income per diluted share of $2.90 and an operating ROE of 15.8%. These results were driven by the continuation of our very strong current accident year underwriting performance as evidenced by an underlying combined ratio of 90.7%, despite relatively high non-cat weather-related losses in the quarter.
Net favorable prior year reserve development was very strong at $292 million pretax and cat losses were relatively modest at $46 million pretax. That said, as shown on Page 4 of the webcast, current quarter results were lower than our very strong fourth quarter 2014 results, mostly due to the impact of low interest rates in private equity returns on net investment income and an even higher amount of net favorable prior year reserve development in the prior year quarter.
Underlying -- underwriting margins were pretty much the same in both quarters. Fixed income NII of $422 million aftertax was down $31 million from the prior year quarter, principally due to what we've been saying for many years. Securities that had higher book yields have runoff during the past 12 months and have been replaced with securities having lower yields due to the current low interest rate environment.
Another contributing factor to lower fixed income NII was the modest reduction in average investments that resulted in part from the company's $579 million first quarter 2015 payment to settle the Asbestos Direct Action Litigation. 
Looking forward, based on the current interest rate environment, we would expect that the impact of lower reinvestment yields and a lower level of fixed maturity investments could in 2016 result in approximately $20 million to $25 million of lower aftertax NII on a quarterly basis when compared to the corresponding period of 2015.
Non-fixed income NII of $25 million aftertax was down $42 million from the prior-year quarter, primarily due to lower private equity returns. Private equities essentially broke even this quarter as compared to earnings $30 million aftertax in the prior year quarter due to lower valuations for energy-related investments.
Each of our business segments continue to benefit from net favorable prior year reserve development. In Business and International Insurance, net favorable development of $176 million pretax primarily resulted from better-than-expected loss experienced in workers' comp for accident years 2006 and prior and accident year 2014. In general, liability for both primary and excess coverages for accident years 2012 and prior and in the company's operations in Canada.
In Bond & Specialty Insurance, net favorable development of $80 million pretax primarily resulted from better-than-expected loss experienced in fidelity and surety for accident years 2012 through 2014. And in Personal Insurance, net favorable development of $36 million pretax primarily resulted from better-than-expected loss experienced in Auto liability for accident years 2013 and '14, and in Homeowners and other liability for accident year 2014.
As I've done in the past, I'd also like to provide you with some insight into what our combined 2015 Schedule P is expected to show and it's filed on May 1.
On a combined stat basis for all of our U.S. subs, all accident years in the aggregate across all product lines are expected to develop favorably, and all but one product line on Schedule P are expected to develop either favorably or show very modest or de minimis unfavorable development. The product line that is expected to develop unfavorably by approximately $50 million pretax is products liability occurrence, but in another product line, other liability occurrence, will have an offsetting amount of favorable development as we refined our allocation of IBNR between these 2 components of general liability, but based upon how losses such as those related to construction defect have been developing by coverage type.
In total, our general liabilities were not -- general liability reserves were not affected by these actions.
Returning to GAAP, for the year, we had net favorable development of $941 million pretax with approximately $840 million coming from our U.S. ops and a little over $100 million coming from our Canadian and U.K. operations.
There are 2 additional topics I'd like to update you on. As shown on Page 21 of the webcast, we renewed our corporate cat aggregate XOL Treaty effective January 1. The treaty provides coverage for both single cat events and an accumulation of losses from multiple cat events with similar terms as in the prior but at a lower cost. The treaty continues to provide $1.5 billion of coverage, part of $2 billion excess of $3 billion after a $100 million deductible per occurrence. It keeps the same broad parallel and geographic coverage in the same positioning of the coverage layer, providing a significant buffer between earnings and capital. The treaty has a single limit with no reinstatement provisions, and please note that the total cost of this treaty, and therefore, the reduction in costs are quite small in relation to our operating income.
The second topic relates to the recent drop in oil prices. Page 22 of the webcast contains updated information showing the magnitude of our investments in below investment grade energy bonds and energy-related equities. And as you can see, the sum of these investments is relatively small and the exposure is quite manageable.
Operating cash flows remains strong at $760 million in the fourth quarter after making a $100 million discretionary contribution to our qualified pension plan, bringing total operating cash flows to over $3.4 billion for the year. We continue to generate much more capital than we need to support our businesses and consistent with our ongoing capital management strategy as you heard from Alan, we returned almost $1.2 billion of excess capital to our shareholders this quarter through dividends of $183 million and common share repurchases of a little over $1 billion.
For the full year, we returned almost $4 billion of excess capital to our shareholders through dividends of $744 million and common share repurchases of over $3.2 billion.
Holding company liquidity ended the year at $1.6 billion, well above our target level, and our debt-to-total capital ratio, which was 23% at the beginning of the quarter, slightly elevated due to our having issued $400 million of debt in the third quarter to prefund $400 million of debt that was maturing in the fourth quarter, has come back down to 22.1%, well within its target range with the retirement of that debt.
Net unrealized investment gains were almost $2 billion pretax or $1.3 billion after-tax, which was down from $3 billion and $2 billion, respectively, at the beginning of the year due to an increase in interest rates and spreads.
Book value per share of $79.75 grew 3% from the beginning of the year, and importantly, adjusted book value per share of $75.39, which eliminates the aftertax impact of net unrealized investment gains grew by 6% this year.
So with that, let me turn the microphone over to Brian."

Business in International Insurance results for both the fourth quarter and the full year were strong. We continue to generate excellent returns for the full year combined ratio of 92.1% and our retention throughout the year was very strong and reached a record level this quarter in our domestic business. Pricing trends remained relatively consistent, with renewal rate change still slightly positive at the end of the year, while new business volume in our domestic business saw a modest increase.
Turning to the quarter's financial results, operating income was $566 million, with a very strong combined ratio of $89.6 million. The underlying combined ratio, which excludes the impact of cats in prior year reserve development was $94.4 million, up half a point compared to the fourth quarter of 2014, primarily due to a higher level of noncat weather-related losses. 
Looking at the top line, net written premiums for the quarter were down about 1.5 points compared to the fourth quarter of 2014 with domestic business insurance premium up about a point.
In domestic business insurance, we remain pleased with the continued execution of our pricing strategy. As we've been saying for some time, given the attractive returns that we are generating in this business, our focus continues to be on retention, and accordingly, we are very pleased that retention improved to a record 85% in the quarter.
Renewal premium change came in at 2.4 points, while renewal rate change remained positive, but down slightly versus the third quarter. New business of $476 million was up compared to both the prior year and the third quarter.
Looking at each of our individual domestic businesses, beginning with Select, rate and renewal premium change were inline with recent quarters, while retention remained strong at 82%, demonstrating continued stability in this segment of the market.
In the middle market, we achieved record retention of 88%, overall rate change was about flat and reflected a decline of about a point from the third quarter.
As we've always said, the execution below the headline numbers is what matters, and we continue to feel great about the granular results. Retention for our best performing business was just over 90%, with an average rate decline of less than 2% on those accounts. While for our poor performing business, we continued to get rate in excess of loss trend.
In terms of exposure, the quarter's results includes a drag of about a point from our oil and gas business, resulting from reduced economic activity due to lower energy prices. Just as a reference point, our oil and gas business makes up only about 3% of domestic business insurance written premium.
Middle Market new business of $254 million was up from the third quarter and in line with the prior year.
In other Business Insurance, retention was strong at 80%, renewal rate change was about flat even after being negatively impacted by our National Property business. As I mentioned last quarter, although National Property is seeing the largest rate declines of any business in our portfolio, we are pleased with the overall performance of this business. Returns and retention remains strong and pricing trends are stable. Excluding National Property, renewal rate change for other Business Insurance remains positive and was relatively stable with the third quarter.
Turning to International. Net written premiums were down about 16% for the quarter and 14% for the full year, primarily due to the adverse impact of foreign exchange rates. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, net written premiums for the fourth quarter were down about 6%, largely driven by declines in retention in Canada and, to a lesser extent, at Lloyds.
International retention was down in the quarter to 79%, however, renewal premium change was slightly positive and renewal business for the quarter -- and new business for the quarter was very strong at $80 million, up 18% year-over-year.
In Canada, a competitive renewal environment adversely impacted retention across our book. However, in June, we launched Optima, our new strategic insurance platform in Canada for Personal Insurance. Optima was modeled after our U.S.-based Quantum Auto 2.0 product. During the early days of the rollout, we're pleased with the initial response as we are seeing a significant increase in new business volume.
In Lloyds, we continue to see a challenging market resulting from global economic conditions, particularly in our Marine business. Offsetting this pressure, our 2 new business products that we've recently launched, focused on renewable energy and global construction and early returns, are encouraging. So all in for the segment, it was a terrific 2015, with strong financial results and what we see as a remarkably stable environment, one where our competitive advantages really matter to our customers and agents.
Before I turn it over to Doreen, I want to make one comment on our outlook for operating margins, which we include in our quarterly filings. Since our 10-K won't be filed for a few weeks, I would note that we expect our 2016 underlying underwriting margin for the segment will be broadly consistent with 2015. This is subject to the usual caveats and forward-looking statement disclaimers.
With that, let me turn it over to Doreen."
392856,311922521,919937,"The Travelers Companies, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 21, 2016",2016-01-21,"Earnings Calls","The Travelers Companies, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Brian, and good morning, everyone.

Bond & Specialty Insurance finished 2015 with another quarter of exceptional financial results. Operating income for the quarter was $162 million, down from the fourth quarter of 2014 due to lower net favorable prior year reserve development, but overall, still a great result. The underlying combined ratio of 80.7% was 3.4 points better than the prior year quarter due primarily to 2 factors: a modest increase in the loss ratio in the prior year quarter that resulted from the reestimation of the first three quarters of 2014; and secondly, the impact of certain customer-related intangible assets, which became fully amortized during the second quarter of 2015.
Underlying underwriting results continue to run well within our long-term target ranges. And as Alan mentioned, the full year underlying combined ratio of 80.1% was an all-time best. We obviously don't think these results come by accident. We pride ourselves on maintaining the underwriting discipline, aggressive management of risk and limits, strong account and agency relationships, analytics and claims management that drive these results.
As we look ahead to 2016 for this segment, we expect underlying underwriting margin to remain broadly consistent with 2015.
As for tax line, net written premiums in the aggregate were down 4% from the fourth quarter of 2014, primarily due to a decline in Surety volume, driven by lower bonding needs for our account particularly as compared to the strong production in the fourth quarter of 2014, specifically quarter-over-quarter, based on the number, size and timing of bonded construction projects awarded to our customers.
We have a strong portfolio of Surety clients and believe we really remain well-positioned to capitalize on increased bonding needs that might result from an improved economy.
Across our Management Liability businesses, retention remained strong at 85%, while new business premium was up 17% from the fourth quarter of 2014. Renewal premium change trended down due to lower rates being partially offset by an increase in other RPC, which includes changes in the size of insured exposure, limits written, attachment point and policy duration. The lower rate was as expected and is consistent with the strong profitability of our portfolio. So all in all, another great quarter closing a strong year for Bond & Specialty Insurance.
I'll turn now to Personal Insurance, where we close out the year with another quarter of exceptional underwriting results. For the segment, operating income for the quarter were $222 million and the underlying combined ratio was 86.2%. Great results. And as we move forward, this segment remains positioned to perform inline with our long-term return goal. I'll touch on the quarterly results for Agency Auto and Agency Property in a moment. But first, I'd like to share with you some thoughts on how we view the underlying results of these businesses.
First, for Auto. I'll start by saying how pleased we are with the vibrancy of our Auto business. The market response from both agents and consumers to Quantum Auto 2.0 remains incredibly strong, and the portfolio is positioned to generate financial returns within our long-term target range.
In the Agency channel, we added 167,000 policies during 2015, an 8% increase from the end of 2014. As always, there remains competition in Auto. And we remain committed to keeping our products priced accordingly through disciplined expense management and superior pricing and underwriting segmentation. As we look ahead to 2016, we expect the Auto business to continue to grow in both policy count and premium volume, although at a more moderated percentage than 2015 as the portfolio grows.
As for agency Auto profitability, we've mentioned on several occasions that we are comfortable with where our margins are given the current market environment. That still remains the case today.
With full year underlying Agency combined ratio of just under 97% was inline with our expectations for the year and the result we are pleased with. This combined ratio is somewhat higher than our long-term goal, driven particularly by the amount of new business that we've added over the past 2 years. 
Quantum Auto 2.0 is priced to our long-term target returns. But as you all know, the relatively higher combined ratio of new business improves over time. As we look into 2016, the significant volume of new business we've added will drive a slightly higher calendar year combined ratio compared to 2015. So far, the profitability of Quantum Auto 2.0 is maturing in line with our expectations. With this return profile, we continue to seek more new business as it should be accretive to long-term returns.
On Homeowners the financial returns generated in the last couple of years has been exceptional and well within our target range. As you recall, we made significant improvements in the risk profile of this business over the last few years, including changes in deductibles, other terms and conditions and tightened underwriting guidelines. Of course, this is a more volatile business that will always have a weather dynamics to it. The weather in the last couple of years has been somewhat lower than our model suggested, but we know that won't always be the case.
As we look ahead to 2016 with respect to profitability, we do expect underlying underwriting margins in Agency Homeowners and Others to be lower than 2015, reflecting more normalized levels of loss activity. As Alan mentioned, we're also very pleased with the improvements we've seen in Homeowners production. This is attributable in part to account rounding, along with making some localized pricing and process adjustments, and certainly the turnaround benefited from the momentum in agent engagements from the rollout of Quantum Auto 2.0. At this point, the business has leveled off from the policies in-force perspective, and we expect modest growth in 2016.
Now I'll just highlight a couple of things specific to the quarter. Looking at Agency Auto, new business premium was up 32% and net premium was up 12% from fourth quarter 2014 level, and we've added 51,000 policies during the quarter. The combined ratio for the quarter was 98.1% and included over 2 points of favorable prior year reserve development. 
The underlying combined ratio was 100.2%, up from the prior-year due predominantly to adverse weather in this year's quarter and the benefit in the prior year quarter of 2.5 points favorable reestimation of losses related to the first three quarters of 2014. As for loss trend in Auto, our view of normalized frequency and severity remains consistent with recent quarters at around 3% in aggregate. There continues to be a lot of discussion about trend, particularly increasing frequency. From our vantage point, while we may observe normal fluctuations in any particular period due to things like weather, we see a stable and unchanged long-term frequency trend.
As always, we continue to monitor external information in our own data closely using our extensive analytic capability.
Turning to Agency Homeowners and Other for the quarter, we once again had strong financial results despite relatively active weather in the month of December. The underlying combined ratio of 69.5% was slightly higher than the exceptionally favorable prior-year quarter. As for production, new business premiums were up 27% from the prior year quarter and continue to trend favorably, while retention remained strong at 85%.
Policies in-force were up slightly both sequentially from last quarter and from the fourth quarter of 2014. So to sum up Personal Insurance, we're exceptionally proud of the year we've had and look forward to more of the same in 2016. 
With that, I'll turn the call back to Gabby."

But we said that in a year or 2 ago that our level of buybacks would be tied to our level of income. And so we'll have a level of earnings. We'll do what we need to do with it, whether that's making pension contributions or investments in the business and we'll take what's left and return that to shareholders and that -- there will be a perfect correlation between earnings in a year and share buybacks in a year.

We've got a deep understanding of risk and reward. And the quality of our underlying business, the results you see this quarter and this year, we've got no distractions. So we are starting from a really good point as we think about and engage on all of those issues. And without taking one by one, for the most part, and maybe all in, we see more opportunity than we do risk.

But even with those better accounts, the conversation starts somewhere with trying to renew it at a modest decline or a flat. Obviously, if the average is less than 2%, there are still some that were positive. The thing that we're doing probably a little different than we were a year or 2 ago is we're really trying to get out as early as possible frequently, at least 3, if not 6 months ahead of time, have conversations with the broker and the account. I think we do have a strong franchise with a valued product and valued services, and fortunately, most of those companies start by wanting to stay with us. And then I think the other key point is really being able to have the data and analytics, where our frontline people can see and really segment their portfolio and in the middle market, account by account, look at how they're performing. And when there are issues either in that account, in that line or in that class of business, being able to have an informed conversation with the broker about what those are and why we're trying to do what we're doing on the account really, really makes a difference. So I'd say the big change is getting out early and having a kind of granular conversation on the performance of that line in that business."

The premium to surplus ratio, I would view is not relevant at all. I mean that was a ratio that was used at a time when rating agencies and regulators didn't have the sophisticated models they have today. So as I've said on previous calls, we deal with each one of the models, whether it's our internal models, the regulatory models or the rating agency models to come to a place where given the profile of our business as it relates to each quarter, what is the capital that we think we need in the operating entities that we manage to support a AA rating and support a solid AA rating, not one where if the wind blows, we're worried about our ratings going down. So that's always the starting point. And given the size of our book, it doesn't change very much from quarter-to-quarter. But what does change is the profitability in each quarter. So there are some quarters where the profitability, whether it's for favorable development or some other things that take place is higher than our expectations, keeping in mind that we have a flow of monies out of the operating companies, up to the holding company each quarter based on expectations. So to the extent we earn more, we bring some more up probably a little later than that. I think if you go back over time and you go past 2 years ago to an earlier period and start adding up the earnings versus the share repurchases, you see that there's a very, very strong correlation to that. So I wouldn't read into anything that says one year we've done a little more than earnings, another year, we've did less. It's really just, as Alan said earlier, the timing. And the premium to surplus ratio goes up a little bit, I kind of ignore that. What I'd look at is in our supplement, we talk about specifically on a quarterly basis what the stat surplus is, and I think you can see that, that moves around probably in a pretty narrow band."

And that, of course, is based on our assumption of loss trend, which is, as we've said, running right now at about 4% and looking at a relatively stable, orderly marketplace. And then that's offset by a variety of other factors, you can think of weather large losses, mix change, underwriting actions, et cetera.

When you're dealing with a long-tail line, you have 2 components to how you're going to look at the reserves. One is what has developed in terms of the loss activity. And you're absolutely right. On a short period of time, you're not going to really see a great deal of activity. On the other hand, what you've done is you've established a starting point for what you think the loss activity is going to be. And we refer to that as the loss pick. So just imagine, on January 1, you're trying to predict what the losses are going to be for the entire period of time, if those workers' comp policy will be out there. And we come up with a loss pick. And then the example I'm going to use, I'm just making up a number, let's say it's 60% based on what you've seen historically, all right? And you're looking at the historical data then for earlier accident years and evaluating that against that initial loss pick that you had for a current year. And there are times when you see loss activity in prior years that you say that really has no bearing whatsoever on how I thought about the starting point for the current year, and then there were times when you look at it and say, no, actually, this really does change the bar for the starting point. So usually, on a long-tail line of business, when you see us do what we've done here, it's based on what we refer to as base year movement, looking at the history and just saying that the initial loss pick was a little on the high side."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We're very pleased to finish 2015 with another strong quarter.

We're very pleased to finish 2015 with another strong quarter. As I'm sure you've seen, we reported operating income of $886 million or $2.90 per share and operating return on equity of 15.8%. That caps off another terrific year with operating income of just over $3.4 billion, operating income per diluted share of a record-high $10.87 and operating return on equity of 15.2%.
Our underwriting results across the board remain strong as you can see from our combined ratio of 86.6% for the quarter and 88.3% for the year. In domestic Business Insurance, consistent with our marketplace objectives, we achieved a record level of retention in the quarter with positive renewal rate change. In Bond & Specialty Insurance, we generated an all-time best underlying combined ratio of 80.1% for the year. Broadly speaking, the market dynamics in the commercial insurance marketplace continue to be remarkably stable.
In personal lines, Quantum Auto 2.0 continues to meet our expectations. In Agency Auto, we had year-over-year policy-in-force growth of 8% in the fourth quarter. And as you can see in the webcast, that's the sixth consecutive sequential quarter of increasing PIF count. Those of you who have been following our Agency Auto story know what a success it has been. We're also pleased to be seeing an impact from the success of Quantum Auto 2.0 on our Homeowners business, and you will hear more about that from Doreen.
Jay Benet will have more to say about our current investment results, but I'll just note that we have delivered pretty exceptional returns on equity for quite some time, notwithstanding all the headwinds in the investment arena: Historically low interest rates, the decline in energy prices and volatility in the equity markets, just as examples from this quarter. This speaks volumes about our ability to select and price underwriting risk and the strength of our insurance franchises.
Just as a data point, our after-tax net investment income is about $1 billion lower in 2015 as compared to its high in 2007. On the other hand, our aftertax underlying underwriting margin is about $1 billion higher in 2015 than it was its low in 2011. Particularly to the extent that fixed income yields remain low, and that seems like the outlook for at least some time, and with capital finding its way into the largest end of this business, expertise in generating underwriting returns and having strong franchises in the small and middle market places with meaningful barriers to entry will really matter.
Turning to capital management, consistent with our ongoing capital management strategy, we returned nearly $1.2 billion of capital to our shareholders in the quarter and nearly $4 billion during the year.
The long time consistent strength of our results sits behind our capital management strategy. Just as we have for nearly a decade, we will continue to right-size capital and invest thoughtfully in the business. Thanks to that strategy, we've now returned close to $35  billion of capital to shareholders since the middle of 2006 when we started our share repurchase program.
Let me take just a minute to comment on the leadership transition. What I suspect many of you want to hear from me is where do we go from here? As I've explained to our leadership team, our challenge is this: To take today's summit and make it tomorrow's base camp. I'm confident that we already have the right strategy in place to do that and we've got the right team to execute it. We've been executing it, we understand it and it has been remarkably successful. It's this team's strategy, delivering superior returns over time will continue to be our North Star. We'll do that by investing in and leveraging our competitive advantages, delivering industry-leading products and services and making sure this is a great place to work for the best talent in this industry.
That's not to say that we won't challenge ourselves constantly to make sure that both the strategy and the way we're executing on it remains relevant. It's critical that we reassess all the time. And we will continue to be a leader in evolving and innovating, particularly given the potential for change around us.
Among other things, we'll continue to refine our Data & Analytics to make sure that we lead in risk selection and pricing. We'll continue to innovate on the product side and in our claim and risk control organizations to make sure that we're delivering at the forefront for our agents, brokers and customers. And we'll continue to build on our leading position with our distribution partners to make sure that we're a partner of choice for them.
We've always understood the value of size and scale, and we're well positioned in that regard. Just as in the past, we'll seek opportunities to grow thoughtfully and in ways that contribute to shareholder value. And as always, we'll manage our expenses thoughtfully.
All of that is business as usual for us. Our confidence in our strategy and our track record in executing on it give us confidence in our ability to continue to deliver for our shareholders.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Jay Benet."

Net income per diluted share of $2.83, operating income per diluted share of $2.90 and an operating ROE of 15.8%. These results were driven by the continuation of our very strong current accident year underwriting performance as evidenced by an underlying combined ratio of 90.7%, despite relatively high non-cat weather-related losses in the quarter.
Net favorable prior year reserve development was very strong at $292 million pretax and cat losses were relatively modest at $46 million pretax. That said, as shown on Page 4 of the webcast, current quarter results were lower than our very strong fourth quarter 2014 results, mostly due to the impact of low interest rates in private equity returns on net investment income and an even higher amount of net favorable prior year reserve development in the prior year quarter.
Underlying underwriting margins were pretty much the same in both quarters. Fixed income NII of $422 million after tax was down $31 million from the prior year quarter, principally due to what we've been saying for many years. Securities that had higher book yields have run off during the past 12 months and have been replaced with securities having lower yields due to the current low interest rate environment.
Another contributing factor to lower fixed income NII was the modest reduction in average investments that resulted in part from the company's $579 million first quarter 2015 payment to settle the Asbestos Direct Action Litigation. 
Looking forward, based on the current interest rate environment, we would expect that the impact of lower reinvestment yields and a lower level of fixed maturity investments could, in 2016, result in approximately $20 million to $25 million of lower aftertax NII on a quarterly basis when compared to the corresponding periods of 2015.
Non-fixed income NII of $25 million after tax was down $42 million from the prior-year quarter, primarily due to lower private equity returns. Private equities essentially broke even this quarter as compared to earnings $30 million after tax in the prior year quarter due to lower valuations for energy-related investments.
Each of our business segments continue to benefit from net favorable prior year reserve development. In Business and International Insurance, net favorable development of $176 million pretax primarily resulted from better-than-expected loss experienced in workers' comp for accident years 2006 and prior and accident year 2014. In general, liability for both primary and excess coverages for accident years 2012 and prior and in the company's operations in Canada.
In Bond & Specialty Insurance, net favorable development of $80 million pretax primarily resulted from better-than-expected loss experienced in fidelity and surety for accident years 2012 through 2014. And in Personal Insurance, net favorable development of $36 million pretax primarily resulted from better-than-expected loss experience in Auto liability for accident years 2013 and '14, and in Homeowners and other liability for accident year 2014.
As I've done in the past, I'd also like to provide you with some insight into what our combined 2015 Schedule P is expected to show when it's filed on May 1.
On a combined stat basis for all of our U.S. subs, all accident years in the aggregate across all product lines are expected to develop favorably, and all but one product line on Schedule P are expected to develop either favorably or show very modest or de minimis unfavorable development. The product line that is expected to develop unfavorably by approximately $50 million pretax is products liability occurrence, but another product line, other liability occurrence, will have an offsetting amount of favorable development as we've refined our allocation of IBNR between these 2 components of general liability, based upon how losses such as those related to construction defect have been developing by coverage type.
In total, our general liabilities were not -- general liability reserves were not affected by this action.
Returning to GAAP, for the year, we had net favorable development of $941 million pretax with approximately $840 million coming from our U.S. ops and a little over $100 million coming from our Canadian and U.K. operations.
There are 2 additional topics I'd like to update you on. As shown on Page 21 of the webcast, we renewed our Corporate Cat Aggregate XOL Treaty effective January 1. The treaty provides coverage for both single cat events and an accumulation of losses from multiple cat events with similar terms as in the prior but at a lower cost. The treaty continues to provide $1.5 billion of coverage, part of $2 billion excess of $3 billion after a $100 million deductible per occurrence. It keeps the same broad peril and geographic coverage in the same positioning of the coverage layer, providing a significant buffer between earnings and capital. The treaty has a single limit with no reinstatement provisions, and please note that the total costs of this treaty, and therefore, the reduction in costs are quite small in relation to our operating income.
The second topic relates to the recent drop in oil prices. Page 22 of the webcast contains updated information showing the magnitude of our investments in below investment grade energy bonds and energy-related equities. And as you can see, the sum of these investments is relatively small and the exposure is quite manageable.
Operating cash flows remains strong, $760 million in the fourth quarter after making a $100 million discretionary contribution to our qualified pension plan, bringing total operating cash flows to over $3.4 billion for the year.  We continue to generate much more capital than we need to support our businesses and consistent with our ongoing capital management strategy as you heard from Alan, we returned almost $1.2 billion of excess capital to our shareholders this quarter through dividends of $183 million and common share repurchases of a little over $1 billion.
For the full year, we returned almost $4 billion of excess capital to our shareholders through dividends of $744 million and common share repurchases of over $3.2 billion.
Holding company liquidity ended the year at $1.6 billion, well above our target level, and our debt-to-total capital ratio, which was 23% at the beginning of the quarter, slightly elevated due to our having issued $400 million of debt in the third quarter to prefund $400 million of debt that was maturing in the fourth quarter, has come back down to 22.1%, well within its target range with the retirement of that debt.
Net unrealized investment gains were almost $2 billion pretax or $1.3 billion after-tax, which was down from $3 billion and $2 billion, respectively, at the beginning of the year due to an increase in interest rates and spreads.
Book value per share of $79.75 grew 3% from the beginning of the year, and importantly, adjusted book value per share of $75.39, which eliminates the aftertax impact of net unrealized investment gains, grew by 6% this year.
So with that, let me turn the microphone over to Brian."

Business in International Insurance results for both the fourth quarter and the full year were strong. We continued to generate excellent returns with a full year combined ratio of 92.1% and our retention throughout the year was very strong and reached a record level this quarter in our domestic business. Pricing trends remained relatively consistent, with renewal rate change still slightly positive at the end of the year, while new business volume in our domestic business saw a modest increase.
Turning to the quarter's financial results, operating income was $566 million, with a very strong combined ratio of 89.6% . The underlying combined ratio, which excludes the impact of cats and prior year reserve development was 94.4%, up 0.5 point compared to the fourth quarter of 2014, primarily due to a higher level of noncat weather-related losses. 
Looking at the top line, net written premiums for the quarter were down about 1.5 points compared to the fourth quarter of 2014 with domestic business insurance premium up about 1 point.
In domestic business insurance, we remain pleased with the continued execution of our pricing strategy. As we've been saying for some time, given the attractive returns that we are generating in this business, our focus continues to be on retention, and accordingly, we are very pleased that retention improved to a record 85% in the quarter.
Renewal premium change came in at 2.4 points, while renewal rate change remained positive, but down slightly versus the third quarter. New business of $476 million was up compared to both the prior year and the third quarter.
Looking at each of our individual domestic businesses, beginning with Select, rate and renewal premium change were inline with recent quarters, while retention remains strong at 82%, demonstrating continued stability in this segment of the market.
In the middle market, we achieved record retention of 88%, overall rate change was about flat and reflected a decline of about 1 point from the third quarter.
As we've always said, the execution below the headline numbers is what matters, and we continue to feel great about the granular results. Retention for our best performing business was just over 90%, with an average rate decline of less than 2% on those accounts. While for our poorer performing business, we continued to get rate in excess of loss trend.
In terms of exposure, the quarter's results includes a drag of about 1 point from our oil and gas business, resulting from reduced economic activity due to lower energy prices. Just as a reference point, our oil and gas business makes up only about 3% of domestic business insurance written premium.
Middle Market new business of $254 million was up from the third quarter and in line with the prior year.
In other Business Insurance, retention was strong at 80%, renewal rate change was about flat even after being negatively impacted by our National Property business. As I mentioned last quarter, although National Property is seeing the largest rate declines of any business in our portfolio, we are pleased with the overall performance of this business. Returns and retention remains strong and pricing trends are stable. Excluding National Property, renewal rate change for other Business Insurance remains positive and was relatively stable with the third quarter.
Turning to International. Net written premiums were down about 16% for the quarter and 14% for the full year, primarily due to the adverse impact of foreign exchange rates. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, net written premiums for the fourth quarter were down about 6%, largely driven by declines in retention in Canada and, to a lesser extent, at Lloyds.
International retention was down in the quarter to 79%, however, renewal premium change was slightly positive and renewal business for the quarter -- and new business for the quarter was very strong at $80 million, up 18% year-over-year.
In Canada, a competitive renewal environment adversely impacted retention across our book. However, in June, we launched Optima, our new strategic insurance platform in Canada for Personal Insurance. Optima was modeled after our U.S.-based Quantum Auto 2.0 product. We're in the early days of the rollout but are pleased with the initial response as we are seeing a significant increase in new business volume.
In Lloyds, we continue to see a challenging market resulting from global economic conditions, particularly in our Marine business. Offsetting this pressure are 2 new business products that we've recently launched, focused on renewable energy and global construction, and early returns, are encouraging. So all in for the segment, it was a terrific 2015, with strong financial results in what we see as a remarkably stable environment, one where our competitive advantages really matter to our customers and agents.
Before I turn it over to Doreen, I want to make one comment on our outlook for operating margins, which we include in our quarterly filings. Since our 10-K won't be filed for a few weeks, I would note that we expect our 2016 underlying underwriting margin for the segment will be broadly consistent with 2015. This is subject to the usual caveats and forward-looking statement disclaimers.
With that, let me turn it over to  Doreen."

Bond & Specialty Insurance finished 2015 with another quarter of exceptional financial results. Operating income for the quarter was $162 million, down from the fourth quarter of 2014 due to lower net favorable prior year reserve development, but overall, still a great result. The underlying combined ratio of 80.7% was 3.4 points better than the prior year quarter due primarily to 2 factors: a modest increase in the loss ratio in the prior year quarter that resulted from a reestimation of the first three quarters of 2014; and secondly, the impact of certain customer-related intangible assets, which became fully amortized during the second quarter of 2015.
Underlying underwriting results continue to run well within our long-term target ranges. And as Alan mentioned, the full year underlying combined ratio of 80.1% was an all-time best. We obviously don't think these results come by accident. We pride ourselves on maintaining the underwriting discipline, aggressive management of risk and limits, strong account and agency relationships, analytics and claims management that drive these results.
As we look ahead to 2016 for this segment, we expect underlying underwriting margin to remain broadly consistent with 2015.
As for tax line, net written premiums in the aggregate were down 4% from the fourth quarter of 2014, primarily due to a decline in Surety volume, driven by lower bonding needs for our accounts particularly as compared to the strong production in the fourth quarter of 2014, significantly [ph] quarter-over-quarter based on the number, size and timing of bonded construction projects awarded to our customers.
We have a strong portfolio of Surety clients and believe we really remain well-positioned to capitalize on increased bonding needs that might result from an improved economy.
Across our Management Liability businesses, retention remains strong at 85%, while new business premium was up 17% from the fourth quarter of 2014. Renewal premium change trended down with lower rates being partially offset by an increase in other RPC, which includes changes in the size of insured exposure, limits written, attachment points and policy duration. The lower rate was as expected and is consistent with the strong profitability of our portfolio. So all in all, another great quarter closing a strong year for Bond & Specialty Insurance.
I'll turn now to Personal Insurance, where we closed out the year with another quarter of exceptional underwriting results. For the segment, operating income for the quarter was $222 million and the underlying combined ratio was 86.2%. Great results. And as we move forward, this segment remains positioned to perform inline with our long-term return goal. I'll touch on the quarterly results for Agency Auto and Agency Property in a moment. But first, I'd like to share with you some thoughts on how we view the underlying health of these businesses.
First, for Auto. I'll start by saying how pleased we are with the vibrancy of our Auto business. The market response from both agents and consumers to Quantum Auto 2.0 remains incredibly strong, and the portfolio is positioned to generate financial returns within our long-term target range.
In the Agency channel, we added 167,000 policies during 2015, an 8% increase from the end of 2014. As always, there remains competition in Auto. And we remain committed to keeping our products priced accordingly through disciplined expense management and superior pricing and underwriting segmentation. As we look ahead to 2016, we expect the Auto business to continue to grow in both policy count and premium volume, although at a more moderated percentage than 2015 as the portfolio grows.
As for agency Auto profitability, we've mentioned on several occasions that we are comfortable with where our margins are given the current market environment. That still remains the case today.
The full year underlying Agency combined ratio of just under 97% was in line with our expectations for the year and a result we are pleased with. This combined ratio is somewhat higher than our long-term goal, driven particularly by the amount of new business that we've added over the past 2 years. 
Quantum Auto 2.0 is priced to our long-term target returns. But as you all know, the relatively higher combined ratio of new business improves over time. As we look into 2016, the significant volume of new business we've added will drive a slightly higher calendar year combined ratio compared to 2015. So far, the profitability of Quantum Auto 2.0 is maturing in line with our expectations. With this return profile, we continue to seek more new business as it should be accretive to long-term returns.
On Homeowners the financial returns generated in the last couple of years have been exceptional and well within our target range. As you recall, we made significant improvements in the risk profile of this business over the last few years, including changes in deductibles, other terms and conditions and tightened underwriting guidelines. Of course, this is a more volatile business that will always have a weather dynamic to it. The weather in the last couple of years has been somewhat lower than our models suggested, but we know that won't always be the case.
As we look ahead to 2016 with respect to profitability, we do expect underlying underwriting margins in Agency Homeowners and Others to be lower than 2015, reflecting more normalized levels of loss activity. As Alan mentioned, we're also very pleased with the improvements we've seen in Homeowners production. This is attributable in part to account rounding, along with making some localized pricing and process adjustments, and certainly the turnaround benefited from the momentum in agent engagements from the rollout of Quantum Auto 2.0. At this point, the business has leveled off from a policies-in-force perspective, and we expect modest growth in 2016.
Now I'll just highlight a couple of things specific to the quarter. Looking at Agency Auto, new business premium was up 32% and net premium was up 12% from fourth quarter 2014 level, and we've added 51,000 policies during the quarter. The combined ratio for the quarter was 98.1% and included over 2 points of favorable prior year reserve development. 
The underlying combined ratio was 100.2%, up from the prior-year due predominantly to adverse weather in this year's quarter and the benefit in the prior year quarter of a 2.5 point favorable reestimation of losses related to the first three quarters of 2014. As for loss trend in Auto, our view of normalized frequency and severity remains consistent with recent quarters at around 3% in aggregate. There continues to be a lot of discussion about trend, particularly increasing frequency. From our vantage point, while we may observe normal fluctuations in any particular period due to things like weather, we see a stable and unchanged long-term frequency trend.
As always, we continue to monitor external information and our own data closely using our extensive analytic capability.
Turning to Agency Homeowners and Other for the quarter, we once again had strong financial results despite relatively active weather in the month of December. The underlying combined ratio of 69.5% was slightly higher than the exceptionally favorable prior-year quarter. As for production, new business premiums were up 27% from the prior year quarter and continue to trend favorably, while retention remains strong at 85%.
Policies-in-force were up slightly both sequentially from last quarter and from the fourth quarter of 2014. So to sum up Personal Insurance, we're exceptionally proud of the year we've had and look forward to more of the same in 2016. 
With that, I'll turn the call back to Gabby."

We've had excess capital in past years and we made that very clear that we were sort of adding that to our annual income to buy back stock. But we said, I don't know, 1 year or 2 ago that our level of buybacks would be tied to our level of income. And so we'll have a level of earnings. We'll do what we need to do with it, whether that's making pension contributions or investments in the business and we'll take what's left and return that to shareholders and that -- there won't be a perfect correlation between earnings in a year and share buybacks in a year. There's some timing differences, but I think, as we've said pretty consistently recently, share buybacks going forward will be tied to earnings."

But even with those better accounts, the conversation starts somewhere with trying to renew it at a modest decline or flat. Obviously, if the average is less than 2%, there are still some that are positive. The thing that we're doing probably a little different than we were a year or 2 ago is we're really trying to get out as early as possible, frequently, at least 3, if not 6 months ahead of time, have conversations with the broker and the account. I think we do have a strong franchise with a valued product and valued services, and fortunately, most of those companies start by wanting to stay with us. And then I think the other key point is really being able to have the data and analytics where our frontline people can see and really segment their portfolio and in the middle market, account by account, look at how they're performing. And when there are issues either in that account, in that line or in that class of business, being able to have an informed conversation with the broker about what those are and why we're trying to do what we're doing on the account really, really makes a difference. So I'd say the big change is getting out early and having a kind of granular conversation on the performance of that line and that business."

The premium to surplus ratio, I would view as not being relevant at all. I mean that was a ratio that was used at a time when rating agencies and regulators didn't have the sophisticated models they have today. So as I've said on previous calls, we deal with each one of the models, whether it's our internal models, the regulatory models or the rating agency models to come to a place where given the profile of our business as it relates to each quarter, what is the capital that we think we need in the operating entities that we manage to support a AA rating and support a solid AA rating, not one where if the wind blows we're worried about our ratings going down. So that's always the starting point. And given the size of our book, it doesn't change very much from quarter-to-quarter. But what does change is the profitability in each quarter. So there are some quarters where the profitability, whether it's for favorable development or some other things that take place is higher than our expectations, keeping in mind that we have a flow of monies out of the operating companies, up to the holding company each quarter based on expectations. So to the extent we earn more, we bring some more up probably a little later than that. I think if you go back over time and you go past 2 years ago to an earlier period and start adding up the earnings versus the share repurchases, you see that there's a very, very strong correlation to that. So I wouldn't read into anything that says one year we've done a little more than earnings, another year, we've did less. It's really just, as Alan said earlier, the timing. And if the premium to surplus ratio goes up a little bit, I'd kind of ignore that. What I'd look at is in our supplement, we talk about specifically on a quarterly basis what the stat surplus is, and I think you can see that, that moves around probably in a pretty narrow band."

So when we look at the arithmetic of earned rate versus loss trend, we come up with a very modest, about 0.5 point of loss ratio compression into 2016. And that, of course, is based on our assumption of loss trend, which is, as we've said, running right now at about 4% and looking at a relatively stable, orderly marketplace. And then that's offset by a variety of other factors, you can think of weather, large losses, mix change, underwriting actions, et cetera. But the real starting point is that, that compression from the rate loss trend dynamic, price loss trend dynamic, is a pretty modest number in how we're looking at it."

Especially in light of a relatively high lev",721,"Thank you, Gabby. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. This morning, we reported first quarter operating income of $698 million or $2.33 per share, an operating return on equity of 12.5%. Especially in light of a relatively high level of catastrophe losses in the quarter, our underwriting results across the board remain strong, as reflected in our combined ratio of 92.3%. 
To put the weather in some context, our catastrophe losses were about $100 million after-tax higher in the quarter than they were last year and these are the highest first quarter cat losses we have since 2010.
The timing of catastrophes is, of course, unpredictable, but this level of weather volatility is certainly within our playbook. We're confident in our ability to model and manage our exposures and that the pricing appropriate for the risk.
In this case, it just so happens that by design we have a healthy market share in the Dallas-Fort Worth net reflex, where severe were concentrated. Doreen have more to say about the severity and about our claim analytics.
The real story this quarter is about our execution in the marketplace and across all of our businesses we couldn't be more pleased. In our commercial businesses, we continue to be successful in our efforts to maximize retentions on our best performing accounts and improve profitability on poor-performing business.
Retentions in the quarter were again at very high levels by historical standards and renewal premium change was positive. We believe this productions is also right on target given our review product returns, but as we explained before, we don't manage the business on an aggregate basis. We execute deliberately account by account or class by class, and you can see this on Slide 13 of the webcast, which displays a distribution of rate changes for a Middle Market accounts in the first quarter.
As you can see from slide, most accounts received a single-digit increase, and there were a number of accounts had a increase of greater than 5 or even 10%. So even now with the headline change just slightly negative, we continue to achieve rate gains in excess of loss trend on our poor-performing business. The real take away from this slide is that the aggregate number is simply an average of thousands of individual account actions. And that success is this business is not about the aggregate rate number, it's about taking the right action on each account and generating an appropriate return over time.
Our execution in the quarter also benefited from a commercial lines pricing environment that from our advantage point continues to be remarkably stable. The outlook that we provided this morning in our 10-Q for our BII and BSI segments suggest more of the same continued high levels of retention and broadly consistent underlying underwriting markets.
In terms of execution, we were just a successful in insurance business with strong retentions in higher pit counts in both agency auto and agency Homeowners.
Importantly, Quantum Auto 2.0 continues to meet our expectations on all fronts. The successful execution across all of our businesses resulted in consolidated net written premiums that were about 5% higher in the quarter than they were in the prior year. Both new business levels and historically high levels of retention, particularly, in the middle market business contributed significantly to the top line growth. The quality and brother for our products and services are extraordinary talent in the field and strength of the relationship that we have with our agent and broker partners put us in a great position to win.
In addition to that, we believed we benefited in the quarter both in terms of new and renewable businesses from the stability and consistency we provide in the marketplace compared to some of our competitors who're experiencing degrees of disruption.
Turning to capital management, because the reflection of the confident that we have in our business, today our Board of Directors declared an approximate 10% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.67 per share, the 12 consecutive year of dividend increases, improving the compound annual growth rate of the dividend almost 10% over that time.
All in all, despite an active quarter from a catastrophe perspective, a great start to the year.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Jay Benet."

I'll start by saying that we work with our first quarter results operating income of $698 million and operating return on equity of 12.5%, despite they're being lower than prior year quarter. As Page 4, the webcast indicates, the $129 millio",701,"Thanks, Alan. I'll start by saying that we work with our first quarter results operating income of $698 million and operating return on equity of 12.5%, despite they're being lower than prior year quarter. As Page 4, the webcast indicates, the $129 million decrease in operating income from last year's first quarter did not come about due to lower underlying underwriting results.
Our consolidated underlying combined ratios is 90% this quarter, 30 basis points better than the prior year quarter. Rather the decrease in operating income along with the decrease in operating ROE resulted from 2 items: cat losses that were $101 million higher on an after-tax basis than those in the first quarter of 2015, and as we anticipated the outlook section of our 2015 10-K, a $24 million after-tax reduction in fixed income net investment income that was driven by the continuing low interest rate environment.
Page 4 also provides an analysis as to how our reported results compared to analysts' estimates, as best we can tell, analysts' estimates for cat losses were significantly lower than what actually occurred, which more than accounts for the difference. Our net investment income was $439 million after-tax this quarter, which was $39 million lower than the prior year quarter. In addition to the lower fixed income returns, non-fixed income NII was down $15 million after-tax due to lower hedge fund returns that resulted from the more challenging capital market conditions in recent months.
Each of our business segments once again contributed to net favorable prior year reserved development, which totaled $180 million on a pre-tax basis. In Business and International Insurance, net favorable development of $93 million resulted from better-than-expected loss experience in Workers' Comp excess coverages for accident years 2006 and prior; and general liability, primarily for excess coverages for accident years 2011 and 2013; and commercial auto for accident years 2010 and prior in our European and Canadian operations. In Bond & Specialty Insurance, net favorable development of $60 million resulted from better-than-expected loss experience and surety for accident years 2012 through 2014; and in Personal Insurance, net favorable development of $27 million resulted from better-than-expected loss experience in Homeowners and others for liability coverages for accident year 2014 and an auto for accident year 2014.
On a combined stat basis, for all of our U.S. subs, all accident years developed favorably other than the 2015 accident year, which is currently showing $65 million of unfavorable development due to a few large property losses that occurred late in 2015 and a decision we made to rebalance Personal Insurance reserves among various accident years.
In addition, other than commercial multiple all product lines either developed favorably or had to minimus unfavorable development this quarter. All CMP developed unfavorably by $35 million. There was offsetting favorable development in the property product line as Middle Market property losses that had been recorded in the property line at year-end 2015 with subsequently determined to be CMP related.
Operating cash flows of $850 million remained very strong, and we ended the quarter with holding company liquidity of over $1.7 billion. All of our capital ratios were at or better than their target levels. Net unrealized investment gains were approximately $2.7 million pre-tax or $1.8 billion after-tax, up from $2 billion and $1.3 million, respectively, at the beginning of the year, while book value per share of $82.65 and adjusted book value per share of $76.63, increased 4% and 2%, respectively, from the beginning of the year.
We continue to generate much more capital than we need to support our business, allowing us to return $790 million of excess capital to our shareholders this quarter. We paid dividends of $181 million and repurchased $609 million of our common shares this quarter, including $550 million under our publicly announced share repurchase program consistent with our ongoing capital management strategy and $59 million to partially offset shares issued under employee incentive plans, mostly to cover employee withholding taxes due upon investing any payout of performance and restricted stock awards. And now -- and as Alan said, the board raised our quarterly dividend from $0.61 to $0.67 per share.
So with that, let me turn the over to Brian."

In Business and International Insurance, operating income was $476 million with a combined ratio of 94.8. The underlying combined ratio, which excludes the impact of the cats and prior year reserved development, was 93.3, up about 0.5 point compared to the first quarter of 2015, reflecting a typical level of quarterly fluctuations within both the loss and expense ratios. This resulted in line with expectations and we continue to feel very good about our underlying results.
Net written premiums for the quarter were up 3% year-over-year with domestic business insurance premiums up about 5%, driven by the strong production results across all our businesses. In domestic business insurance, we remained pleased with the continued execution of our pricing strategy. Given the attractive returns that we're generating in this business, our focus continues to be on retention, and accordingly, we're very pleased that retention is at a historical high of 85% for the quarter.
Renewal premium change came in at 2.2 points, while renewal rate change was down slightly in the quarter and about flat overall. New business increased to $575 million reflecting strong results across all our businesses.
Turning to the individual businesses, beginning with Select, we achieved strong retention of 81% and renewal premium change of nearly 7%. Rate change was down about 1 point versus the fourth quarter of 2015, driven a large part by recently filed rate changes in Workers' Compensation. We generated new business of $103 million, up slightly year-over-year.
In Middle Market, retention reached a historic high of 88% with renewal premium changes of 1 point in-line with the fourth quarter of 2015. Importantly, retention of our best performing business was approximately 90%, while for are poor-performing accounts, we achieved rate gains in excess of loss trends.
New business of $321 million was up 8% year-over-year, doing large part to strong results in our construction business. In other business insurance, retention of 82% was up both year-over-year and compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. Renewal premium change of about a point was in line with recent quarters, while new business of $151 million was up 24% versus the prior year, driven by Marine, boiler and transportation lines of business.
So across domestic business insurance, we achieved strong retention and so increased level of new business opportunities in the marketplace. As Allen mention, our agents and brokers view us as a stable market with industry-leading products and services, which we believe had a favorable impact on both retention and new business, particularly, in this environment where several significant competitors are experiencing some degree of disruption.
Turning to International, net written premiums for the first quarter were down about 10% year-over-year, primarily, due to the adverse impact of foreign exchange rates. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, net written premiums were down about 4% driven by disciplined underwriting in the face of highly competitive market conditions in the property lines at 
Retention for the quarter was strong at 82%. Renewal premium change was slightly negative, but above recent quarters. And new business of $76 million was up more than 30% year-over-year, driven primarily by Optima, our new strategic personal lines auto product in Canada. This product was modeled after our U.S.-based Quantum Auto 2.0 product, and while we're still in the early days of the rollout we're encouraged by the response as we continue to see a significant increase in new business volume.
In summary, in the segment we achieved strong underlying underwriting and production results, a great start to 2016.
And with that, let me turn it over to Doreen."

Bond & Specialty Insurance started 2016 with a strong first quarter, and we remain exceptionally pleased with the financial returns in this segment. For the quarter, operating income was $144 million, up from the first quarter of 2015, due primarily to a higher level of net favorable prior year reserve development also improved underlying underwriting results.
The underlying combined ratio of 81.1% was almost 2 points better than the prior year, driven by 2 items: one, the favorable expense impact of certain customer-related intangible assets, which became fully amortized during the second quarter of 2015; and second, lower loss levels in certain management liability businesses.
Underlined returns in this segment were once again very strong and remain well within our target level. Results like this do not happen by accident. Insights provided by our industry expertise and analytics along with disciplined execution of long-term strategies, have positioned us to successfully navigate a rising economic challenges, the most recent being the disruption in the coal and broader energy sectors.
As for top line, we generated higher net written premiums for the quarter as compared to 2015, in both our Management Liability and Surety businesses. The increase Surety production reflected higher contract bond activity from midsized construction accounts. Across our Management Liability businesses, retention remain strong at 87%, new business premium was up more than 20% from the first quarter of 2015 and renewable premium change was up from recent quarters driven by the non-rate components of including slight increases in policy duration and insured exposures.
These results reflect the execution of our strategy to retain our best account and write more business in our return adequate product segments. In strong top and bottom line results with Bond & Specialty and we continue to feel great about this segment's performance.
I'll now turn to Personal Insurance. Operating income for the quarter was $139 million, down $113 million from the prior year quarter, due to $69 million in higher tax and $68 million in lower net favorable prior year reserve development. The segment's underlying combined ratio for the quarter was 86.1%, 1.4 points better than the 2015 quarter. This improvement was driven by a lower expense ratio, which was due in large part to higher premium volume. We continue to be pleased with production results and underlying financial returns in both agency auto and agency Homeowners and other.
Looking at agency auto, we once again generated strong topline results and the loss experience of Quantum Auto 2.0 continues to perform in line with expectations. The combined ratio of 95.2% for the quarter was 5 points higher than the prior year quarter, due primarily to higher cap and lower level of net favorable prior year reserve development.
The underlying combined ratio of 94% was up 1 point from last year, in line with our expectations for the quarter. As we discussed before, the significant levels of new business we in the last couple of years will result in a higher calendar year loss ratio in the early years and improve over time. Quantum Auto 2.0 is priced to our long-term target return and is maturing in line with our expectations. As for our overall view of loss trend's, blended and severity remains unchanged at around 3%.
Production result continue to be exceptional as the agency auto with net written premiums up 13% year-over-year driven by higher new business premium and strong retention. We continue to grow policy which increased 55,000 during the quarter.
Turning to Agency Homeowners and other, we generated a combined ratio of 90.4%, even including catastrophes of 16 points. When cats were higher this quarter, the underlying combined ratio of 76.2% improved more than 3 points from the prior year quarter, driven by favorable non-cap weather.
As you all know, weather will be volatile from period-to-period. As Alan mentioned, this quarter was particularly, impacted by severe hailstorm in the greater Dallas-Fort Worth area. Slide 20 one of the webcast is an extract from our which many of you will recognize from our Investor Day.
This view is Cat 21, the most substantial event in the quarter and shows you how much of it was impacted by 2 and even 3 each This demonstrates our proprietary capability to get real-time data about size and duration, as well as potentially impacted policies.
Using this information facilitates a more respective claim response and fits up in estimating losses.
Using these tools, as well as our on-site work in the area, we identified this as a significant event early on and we're somewhat surprised that how well the industry estimates were. As more information has become public, it would appear that industry estimates for this event will rise.
Notwithstanding the weather volatility, we remain very pleased with the underlying financial returns were generating in this business as we continue to execute our disciplined underwriting and pricing strategies.
As for production, in Agency Homeowners and other, we continue to make good progress in line with our expectations. New business premium was up more than 30% from the prior year quarter, retention remained strong at 85% and we had a 26,000 policies during the quarter. So even with the significant cash during the quarter, a great start to the year for Personal Insurance.
With that, I'll turn the call back to Gabby."

And then, this discount for connected homes. And if you think about it, similar to what we would do for someone who has an alarm or something of that sort, but we do have both of our claims, both of our homes of that claim connected home, so we can study how the data comes in. We can study what that changes about the underwriting process and the claim process.

Some have commented that they are seeing higher frequency, some have not commented at all. So we don't feel like it's the thing that's ripping through the industry. It's affecting very specific companies. And the most important thing for us is where you're starting from. What assumptions have you made. So we have not assumed frequency for a number of years that's been 0.5. The other thing talked about last quarter, so I apologize if it is repetitive, but in '14, there were some observations that frequency was dropping. We analyzed that very carefully and really didn't think that it was systemic or sustainable. And so at that point, while we recognize the financial impact of that lower frequency for '14, we went into '15 assuming that trend was going to go back to where it was and it did. And so the half a point remains unchanged, the trend remains unchanged, and it really goes back where we start from."

This morning, we reported first quarter operating income of $698 million or $2.33 per share and operating return on equity of 12.5%. Especially in light of a relatively high level of catastrophe losses in the quarter, our underwriting results across the board remained strong, as reflected in our combined ratio of 92.3%. 
To put the weather in some context, our catastrophe losses were about $100 million, after tax, higher in the quarter than they were last year, and these are the highest first quarter cat losses we've had since 2010. The timing of catastrophes is, of course, unpredictable, but this level of weather volatility is certainly within our playbook. We're confident in our ability to model and manage our exposures and that we're pricing appropriately for the risk.
In this case, it just so happens that by design, we have a healthy market share in the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex, where severe hailstorms were concentrated. Doreen will have more to say about the severity and about our claim analytics.
The real story this quarter is about our execution in the marketplace, and across all our businesses, we couldn't be more pleased. In our commercial businesses, we continue to be successful in our efforts to maximize retentions on our best-performing accounts and improve profitability on poor-performing business. Retentions in the quarter were again at very high levels by historical standards, and renewal premium change was positive. We believe these production results are right on target given our view of product returns, but as we've explained before, we don't manage the business on an aggregate basis. We execute deliberately account by account or class by class, and you can see this on Slide 13 of the webcast, which displays the distribution of rate changes for our Middle Market accounts in the first quarter.
As you can see from the slide, most accounts received a single-digit rate increase, and there were a number of accounts that had a rate increase of greater than 5% or even 10%. So even now with the headline pure rate change just slightly negative, we continue to achieve rate gains in excess of loss trend on our poor-performing business. The real takeaway from this slide is that the aggregate rate number is simply an average of thousands of individual account actions and that success in this business is not about the aggregate rate number. It's about taking the right action on each account and generating an appropriate return over time.
Our execution in the quarter also benefited from a commercial lines pricing environment that, from our vantage point, continues to be remarkably stable. The outlook that we provided this morning in our 10-Q for our BII and BSI segments suggest more of the same: continued high levels of retention and broadly consistent underlying underwriting margins.
In terms of execution, we were just as successful in our Personal Insurance business, with strong retentions and higher PIF counts in both the Agency Auto and Agency Homeowners. Importantly, Quantum Auto 2.0 continues to meet our expectations on all fronts. The successful execution across all our businesses resulted in consolidated net written premiums that were about 5% higher in the quarter than they were in the prior year. Both new business levels and historically high levels of retention, particularly in our Middle Market business, contributed significantly to the top line growth. 
The quality and breadth of our products and services, our extraordinary talent in the field and the strength of the relationships that we have with our agent and broker partners put us in a great position to win. In addition to that, we believe that we benefited in the quarter, both in terms of new and renewal business, from the stability and consistency we provide in the marketplace compared to some of our competitors who are experiencing varying degrees of disruption.
Turning to capital management. As a reflection of the confidence that we have in our business, today, our Board of Directors declared an approximately 10% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.67 per share, the 12th consecutive year of dividend increases and bringing the compound annual growth rate of the dividend to almost 10% over that time.
All in all, despite an active quarter from a catastrophe perspective, a great start to the year.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Jay Benet."
392856,311922492,961014,"The Travelers Companies, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2016",2016-04-21,"Earnings Calls","The Travelers Companies, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Alan. I'll start by saying that we were pleased with our first quarter results, operating income of $698 million and operating return on equity of 12.5%, despite their being lower than the prior year quarter. As Page 4 of the webcast indicates,",707,"Thanks, Alan. I'll start by saying that we were pleased with our first quarter results, operating income of $698 million and operating return on equity of 12.5%, despite their being lower than the prior year quarter. 
As Page 4 of the webcast indicates, the $129 million decrease in operating income from last year's first quarter did not come about due to lower underlying underwriting results. Our consolidated underlying combined ratio is 90% this quarter, 30 basis points better than the prior year quarter. Rather, the decrease in operating income, along with the decrease in operating ROE, resulted from 2 items: cat losses that were $101 million higher on an after-tax basis than those in the first quarter of 2015; and as we anticipated in the outlook section of our 2015 10-K, a $24 million after-tax reduction in fixed income net investment income that was driven by the continuing low interest rate environment.
Page 4 also provides an analysis as to how our reported results compared to analysts' estimates. As best we can tell, analysts' estimates for cat losses were significantly lower than what actually occurred, which more than accounts for the difference. Our net investment income was $439 million after tax this quarter, which was $39 million lower than the prior year quarter. In addition to the lower fixed income returns, non-fixed income NII was down $15 million after tax due to lower hedge fund returns that resulted from the more challenging capital market conditions in recent months.
Each of our business segments once again contributed to net favorable prior year reserve development, which totaled $180 million on a pre-tax basis. In Business and International Insurance, net favorable development of $93 million resulted from better-than-expected loss experience in workers' comp excess coverages for accident years 2006 and prior; in general liability, primarily for excess coverages for accident years 2011 and 2013; in commercial auto for accident years 2010 and prior; and in our European and Canadian operations. In Bond & Specialty Insurance, net favorable development of $60 million resulted from better-than-expected loss experience in surety for accident years 2012 through 2014. And in Personal Insurance, net favorable development of $27 million resulted from better-than-expected loss experience in Homeowners & Other for liability coverages for accident year 2014 and in Auto for accident year 2014.
On a combined stat basis, for all of our U.S. subs, all accident years developed favorably other than the 2015 accident year, which is currently showing $65 million of unfavorable development due to a few large property losses that occurred late in 2015 and a decision we made to rebalance Personal Insurance reserves among various accident years.  In addition, other than commercial multi-peril, all product lines either developed favorably or had de minimis unfavorable development this quarter. While CMP developed unfavorably by $35 million, there was offsetting favorable development in the property product line as Middle Market property losses that had been recorded in the property line at year-end 2015 were subsequently determined to be CMP-related.
Operating cash flows of $850 million remained very strong, and we ended the quarter with holding company liquidity of over $1.7 billion. All of our capital ratios were at or better than their target levels. Net unrealized investment gains were approximately $2.7 billion pretax or $1.8 billion after tax, up from $2 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively, at the beginning of the year. While book value per share of $82.65 and adjusted book value per share of $76.63 increased 4% and 2%, respectively, from the beginning of the year.
We continue to generate much more capital than we need to support our businesses, allowing us to return $790 million of excess capital to our shareholders this quarter. We paid dividends of $181 million and repurchased $609 million of our common shares this quarter, including $550 million under our publicly announced share repurchase program, consistent with our ongoing capital management strategy, and $59 million to partially offset shares issued under employee incentive plans, mostly to cover employee withholding taxes due upon the vesting and payout of performance and restricted stock awards. And as Alan said, the board raised our quarterly dividend from $0.61 to $0.67 per share.
So with that, let me turn the mic over to Brian."

Net written premiums for the quarter were up 3% year-over-year, with domestic business insurance premiums up about 5%, driven by the strong production results across all our businesses. In domestic business insurance, we remain pleased with the continued execution of our pricing strategy. Given the attractive returns that we are generating in this business, our focus continues to be on retention, and accordingly, we're very pleased that retention is at a historical high of 85% for the quarter. Renewal premium change came in at 2.2 points, while renewal rate change was down slightly in the quarter and about flat overall. New business increased to $575 million, reflecting strong results across all our businesses.
Turning to the individual businesses, beginning with Select. We achieved strong retention of 81% and renewal premium change of nearly 7%. Rate change was down about 1 point versus the fourth quarter of 2015, driven in large part by recently filed rate changes in workers' compensation. We generated new business of $103 million, up slightly year-over-year.
In Middle Market, retention reached a historic high of 88%, with renewal premium change of 1 point, in line with the fourth quarter of 2015. Importantly, retention of our best-performing business was approximately 90%, while for our poor-performing accounts, we achieved rate gains in excess of loss trend.
New business of $321 million was up 8% year-over-year, due in large part to strong results in our construction business. In Other Business Insurance, retention of 82% was up both year-over-year and compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. Renewal premium change of about 1 point was in line with recent quarters, while new business of $151 million was up 24% versus the prior year, driven by inland marine, boiler and transportation lines of business.
So across domestic business insurance, we achieved strong retention and saw an increased level of new business opportunities in the marketplace. As Alan mentioned, our agents and brokers view us as a stable market with industry-leading products and services, which we believe had a favorable impact on both retention and new business, particularly in this environment where several significant competitors are experiencing some degree of disruption.
Turning to International. Net written premiums for the first quarter were down about 10% year-over-year primarily due to the adverse impact of foreign exchange rates. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, net written premiums were down about 4%, driven by disciplined underwriting in the face of highly competitive market conditions in the property lines at Lloyd's.
Retention for the quarter was strong at 82%. Renewal premium change was slightly negative but above recent quarters. And new business of $76 million was up more than 30% year-over-year, driven primarily by Optima, our new strategic personal lines auto product in Canada. This product was modeled after our U.S.-based Quantum Auto 2.0 product, and while we're still in the early days of the rollout, we're encouraged by the response as we continue to see a significant increase in new business volume. In summary, in the segment, we achieved strong underlying underwriting and production results, a great start to 2016.
And with that, let me turn it over to Doreen."
392856,311922492,961014,"The Travelers Companies, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2016",2016-04-21,"Earnings Calls","The Travelers Companies, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Brian, and good morning, everyone. Bond & Specialty Insurance started 2016 with a strong first quarter, and we remain exceptionally pleased with the financial returns in this segment. For the quarter, operating income was $144 million, up from",905,"Thank you, Brian, and good morning, everyone. Bond & Specialty Insurance started 2016 with a strong first quarter, and we remain exceptionally pleased with the financial returns in this segment. For the quarter, operating income was $144 million, up from the first quarter of 2015 due primarily to a higher level of net favorable prior year reserve development but also improved underlying underwriting results.
The underlying combined ratio of 81.1% was almost 2 points better than the prior year, driven by 2 items: one, the favorable expense impact of certain customer-related intangible assets, which became fully amortized during second quarter of 2015; and second, lower loss levels in certain Management Liability businesses.
Underlying returns in this segment were once again very strong and remain well within our target level. Results like these do not happen by accident. Insights provided by our deep industry expertise and analytics, along with disciplined execution of long-term strategies, have positioned us to successfully navigate rising economic challenges, the most recent being the disruption in the coal and broader energy sectors.
As for top line, we generated higher net written premiums for the quarter as compared to 2015 in both our Management Liability and Surety businesses. The increased Surety production reflected higher contract bond activity from midsize construction accounts. Across our Management Liability businesses, retention remains strong at 87%. New business premium was up more than 20% from the first quarter of 2015. And renewal premium change was up from recent quarters, driven by the non-rate components of RPC, including slight increases in average policy duration and in surety exposures.
These results reflect the execution of our strategy to retain our best accounts and write more business in our return-adequate product segments. In sum, strong top and bottom line results for Bond & Specialty, and we continue to feel great about this segment's performance.
I'll now turn to Personal Insurance. Operating income for the quarter was $139 million, down $113 million from the prior year quarter due to $69 million in higher cats and $68 million in lower net favorable prior year reserve development. The segment's underlying combined ratio for the quarter was 86.1%, 1.4 points better than the 2015 quarter. This improvement was driven by a lower expense ratio, which was due in large part to higher premium volume. We continue to be pleased with production results and underlying financial returns in both Agency Auto and Agency Homeowners & Other.
Looking at Agency Auto, we once again generated strong top line results, and the loss experience of Quantum Auto 2.0 continues to perform in line with expectations. The combined ratio of 95.2% for the quarter was 5 points higher than the prior year quarter due primarily to higher cats and a lower level of net favorable prior year reserve development.
The underlying combined ratio of 94% was up 1 point from last year, in line with our expectations for the quarter. As we've discussed before, the significant levels of new business we've added in the last couple of years will result in a higher calendar year loss ratio in the early years and improve over time. Quantum Auto 2.0 is priced to our long-term target return and is maturing in line with our expectation. As for our overall view of loss trend, blended frequency and severity remains unchanged at around 3%.
Production results continue to be exceptional at Agency Auto, with net written premiums up 13% year-over-year, driven by higher new business premium and strong retention. We continue to grow policies in force, which increased 55,000 during the quarter.
Turning to Agency Homeowners & Other. We generated a combined ratio of 90.4%, even including catastrophes of 16 points. While cats were higher this quarter, the underlying combined ratio of 76.2% improved more than 3 points from the prior year quarter, driven by favorable non-cat weather.  As you all know, weather will be volatile from period to period. As Alan mentioned, this quarter was particularly impacted by severe hailstorms in the greater Dallas-Fort Worth area. Slide 21 of the webcast is an extract from our hail dashboard, which many of you will recognize from our Investor Day.
This view is CAT 21, the most substantial event in the quarter, and shows you how much of the area was impacted by 2- and even 3-inch hail. This demonstrates our proprietary capability to get near real-time data about hail size and duration as well as potentially impacted policies. Using this information facilitates a more effective claim response and assists us in estimating losses.
Using these tools, as well as our on-site work in the area, we identified this as a significant event early on, and we're somewhat surprised at how low the industry estimates were. As more information has become public, it would appear that industry estimates for this event will rise.
Notwithstanding the weather volatility, we remain very pleased with the underlying financial returns we're generating in this business as we continue to execute our disciplined underwriting and pricing strategies.
As for production, in Agency Homeowners & Other, we continue to make good progress, in line with our expectations. New business premium was up more than 30% from the prior year quarter. Retention remained strong at 85%, and we added 26,000 policies during the quarter. So even with the significant cats during the quarter, a great start to the year for Personal Insurance.
With that, I'll turn the call back to Gabby."

Some have not commented at all. So we don't feel like it's the thing that's just ripping through the industry. It's affecting very specific companies. And the most important thing for us is where you're starting from, what assumptions have you made. So we have not assumed flat frequency. For a number of years, it's been 0.5 point. The other thing I'll -- and we may have talked about this last quarter, so I apologize if it's repetitive. But in '14, there were some observations that frequency was dropping. We analyzed that very, very carefully and really didn't think it was systemic or sustainable. And so at that point, while we recognize the financial impact of that lower frequency for '14, we went into '15 assuming that trend was going to go back to where it was, and it did.

Think about what we've done in Business Insurance going back to 2010, when you look at the -- we went back, then we looked at the outlook for returns and realized that we had to do some things differently. So your perspective that it might fall off beyond where we're giving guidance for suggests purely current course and speed, and I would say that we're at current course and speed now because we like product returns.

Especially in light of a relatively high lev",735,"Thank you, Gabby. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. This morning, we reported first quarter operating income of $698 million or $2.33 per share and operating return on equity of 12.5%. Especially in light of a relatively high level of catastrophe losses in the quarter, our underwriting results across the board remained strong, as reflected in our combined ratio of 92.3%. 
To put the weather in some context, our catastrophe losses were about $100 million after tax higher in the quarter than they were last year, and these are the highest first quarter cat losses we've had since 2010. The timing of catastrophes is, of course, unpredictable, but this level of weather volatility is certainly within our playbook. We're confident in our ability to model and manage our exposures and that we're pricing appropriately for the risk.
In this case, it just so happens that by design, we have a healthy market share in the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex, where severe hailstorms were concentrated. Doreen will have more to say about the severity and about our claim analytics.
The real story this quarter is about our execution in the marketplace, and across all our businesses, we couldn't be more pleased. In our commercial businesses, we continue to be successful in our efforts to maximize retentions on our best-performing accounts and improve profitability on poor-performing business. Retentions in the quarter were again at very high levels by historical standards, and renewal premium change was positive. We believe these production results are right on target given our view of product returns, but as we've explained before, we don't manage the business on an aggregate basis. We execute deliberately account by account or class by class, and you can see this on Slide 13 of the webcast, which displays the distribution of rate changes for our Middle Market accounts in the first quarter.
As you can see from the slide, most accounts received a single-digit rate increase, and there were a number of accounts that had a rate increase of greater than 5% or even 10%. So even now with the headline pure rate change just slightly negative, we continue to achieve rate gains in excess of loss trend on our poor-performing business. The real takeaway from this slide is that the aggregate rate number is simply an average of thousands of individual account actions and that success in this business is not about the aggregate rate number. It's about taking the right action on each account and generating an appropriate return over time.
Our execution in the quarter also benefited from a commercial lines pricing environment that, from our vantage point, continues to be remarkably stable. The outlook that we provided this morning in our 10-Q for our BII and BSI segments suggests more of the same: continued high levels of retention and broadly consistent underlying underwriting margins.
In terms of execution, we were just as successful in our Personal Insurance business, with strong retentions and higher PIF counts in both Agency Auto and Agency Homeowners. Importantly, Quantum Auto 2.0 continues to meet our expectations on all fronts. The successful execution across all our businesses resulted in consolidated net written premiums that were about 5% higher in the quarter than they were in the prior year. Both new business levels and historically high levels of retention, particularly in our Middle Market business, contributed significantly to the top line growth. 
The quality and breadth of our products and services, our extraordinary talent in the field and the strength of the relationships that we have with our agent and broker partners put us in a great position to win. In addition to that, we believe that we benefited in the quarter, both in terms of new and renewal business, from the stability and consistency we provide in the marketplace compared to some of our competitors who are experiencing varying degrees of disruption.
Turning to capital management. As a reflection of the confidence that we have in our business, today our Board of Directors declared an approximately 10% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.67 per share, the 12th consecutive year of dividend increases and bringing the compound annual growth rate of the dividend to almost 10% over that time.
All in all, despite an active quarter from a catastrophe perspective, a great start to the year.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Jay Benet."
392856,311922492,961445,"The Travelers Companies, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2016",2016-04-21,"Earnings Calls","The Travelers Companies, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Alan. I'll start by saying that we were pleased with our first quarter results, operating income of $698 million and operating return on equity of 12.5%, despite their being lower than the prior year quarter. As Page 4 of the webcast indicates,",707,"Thanks, Alan. I'll start by saying that we were pleased with our first quarter results, operating income of $698 million and operating return on equity of 12.5%, despite their being lower than the prior year quarter. 
As Page 4 of the webcast indicates, the $129 million decrease in operating income from last year's first quarter did not come about due to lower underlying underwriting results. Our consolidated underlying combined ratio is 90% this quarter, 30 basis points better than the prior year quarter. Rather, the decrease in operating income, along with the decrease in operating ROE, resulted from 2 items: cat losses that were $101 million higher on an after-tax basis than those in the first quarter of 2015; and as we anticipated in the outlook section of our 2015 10-K, a $24 million after-tax reduction in fixed income net investment income that was driven by the continuing low interest rate environment.
Page 4 also provides an analysis as to how our reported results compared to analysts' estimates. As best we can tell, analysts' estimates for cat losses were significantly lower than what actually occurred, which more than accounts for the difference. Our net investment income was $439 million after tax this quarter, which was $39 million lower than the prior year quarter. In addition to the lower fixed income returns, non-fixed income NII was down $15 million after tax due to lower hedge fund returns that resulted from the more challenging capital market conditions in recent months.
Each of our business segments once again contributed to net favorable prior year reserve development, which totaled $180 million on a pre-tax basis. In Business and International Insurance, net favorable development of $93 million resulted from better-than-expected loss experience in workers' comp excess coverages for accident years 2006 and prior; in general liability, primarily for excess coverages for accident years 2011 and 2013; in commercial auto for accident years 2010 and prior; and in our European and Canadian operations. In Bond & Specialty Insurance, net favorable development of $60 million resulted from better-than-expected loss experience in surety for accident years 2012 through 2014. And in Personal Insurance, net favorable development of $27 million resulted from better-than-expected loss experience in Homeowners & Other for liability coverages for accident year 2014 and in Auto for accident year 2014.
On a combined stat basis, for all of our U.S. subs, all accident years developed favorably other than the 2015 accident year, which is currently showing $65 million of unfavorable development due to a few large property losses that occurred late in 2015 and a decision we made to rebalance Personal Insurance reserves among various accident years. In addition, other than commercial multi-peril, all product lines either developed favorably or had de minimis unfavorable development this quarter. While CMP developed unfavorably by $35 million, there was offsetting favorable development in the property product line as Middle Market property losses that had been recorded in the property line at year-end 2015 were subsequently determined to be CMP-related.
Operating cash flows of $850 million remained very strong, and we ended the quarter with holding company liquidity of over $1.7 billion. All of our capital ratios were at or better than their target levels. Net unrealized investment gains were approximately $2.7 billion pretax or $1.8 billion after tax, up from $2 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively, at the beginning of the year. While book value per share of $82.65 and adjusted book value per share of $76.63 increased 4% and 2%, respectively, from the beginning of the year.
We continue to generate much more capital than we need to support our businesses, allowing us to return $790 million of excess capital to our shareholders this quarter. We paid dividends of $181 million and repurchased $609 million of our common shares this quarter, including $550 million under our publicly announced share repurchase program, consistent with our ongoing capital management strategy, and $59 million to partially offset shares issued under employee incentive plans, mostly to cover employee withholding taxes due upon the vesting and payout of performance and restricted stock awards. And as Alan said, the board raised our quarterly dividend from $0.61 to $0.67 per share.
So with that, let me turn the mic over to Brian."

In Business and International Insurance, operating income was $476 million with a combined ratio of 94.8%. The underlying combined ratio, which excludes the impact of cats and prior year reserve development, was 93.3%, up about 0.5 point compared to the first quarter of 2015, reflecting a typical level of quarterly fluctuations within both the loss and expense ratios. This result is in line with our expectations, and we continue to feel very good about our underlying results.
Net written premiums for the quarter were up 3% year-over-year, with domestic business insurance premiums up about 5%, driven by the strong production results across all our businesses. In domestic business insurance, we remain pleased with the continued execution of our pricing strategy. Given the attractive returns that we are generating in this business, our focus continues to be on retention, and accordingly, we're very pleased that retention is at a historical high of 85% for the quarter. Renewal premium change came in at 2.2 points, while renewal rate change was down slightly in the quarter and about flat overall. New business increased to $575 million, reflecting strong results across all our businesses.
Turning to the individual businesses, beginning with Select. We achieved strong retention of 81% and renewal premium change of nearly 7%. Rate change was down about 1 point versus the fourth quarter of 2015, driven in large part by recently filed rate changes in workers' compensation. We generated new business of $103 million, up slightly year-over-year.
In Middle Market, retention reached a historic high of 88%, with renewal premium change of 1 point, in line with the fourth quarter of 2015. Importantly, retention of our best-performing business was approximately 90%, while for our poorer-performing accounts, we achieved rate gains in excess of loss trend.
New business of $321 million was up 8% year-over-year, due in large part to strong results in our construction business. In Other Business Insurance, retention of 82% was up both year-over-year and compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. Renewal premium change of about 1 point was in line with recent quarters, while new business of $151 million was up 24% versus the prior year, driven by inland marine, boiler and transportation lines of business.
So across domestic business insurance, we achieved strong retention and saw an increased level of new business opportunities in the marketplace. As Alan mentioned, our agents and brokers view us as a stable market with industry-leading products and services, which we believe had a favorable impact on both retention and new business, particularly in this environment where several significant competitors are experiencing some degree of disruption.
Turning to International. Net written premiums for the first quarter were down about 10% year-over-year primarily due to the adverse impact of foreign exchange rates. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, net written premiums were down about 4%, driven by disciplined underwriting in the face of highly competitive market conditions in the property lines at Lloyd's.
Retention for the quarter was strong at 82%. Renewal premium change was slightly negative but above recent quarters. And new business of $76 million was up more than 30% year-over-year, driven primarily by Optima, our new strategic personal lines auto product in Canada. This product was modeled after our U.S.-based Quantum Auto 2.0 product, and while we're still in the early days of the rollout, we're encouraged by the response as we continue to see a significant increase in new business volume. In summary, in the segment, we achieved strong underlying underwriting and production results, a great start to 2016.
And with that, let me turn it over to Doreen."

For the quarter, operating income was $144 million, up from",904,"Thank you, Brian, and good morning, everyone. Bond & Specialty Insurance started 2016 with a strong first quarter, and we remain exceptionally pleased with the financial returns in this segment. For the quarter, operating income was $144 million, up from the first quarter of 2015 due primarily to a higher level of net favorable prior year reserve development but also improved underlying underwriting results.
The underlying combined ratio of 81.1% was almost 2 points better than the prior year, driven by 2 items: one, the favorable expense impact of certain customer-related intangible assets, which became fully amortized during second quarter of 2015; and second, lower loss levels in certain Management Liability businesses.
Underlying returns in this segment were once again very strong and remain well within our target level. Results like this do not happen by accident. Insights provided by our deep industry expertise and analytics, along with disciplined execution of long-term strategies, have positioned us to successfully navigate rising economic challenges, the most recent being the disruption in the coal and broader energy sectors.
As for top line, we generated higher net written premiums for the quarter as compared to 2015 in both our Management Liability and Surety businesses. The increased Surety production reflected higher contract bond activity from midsize construction accounts. Across our Management Liability businesses, retention remains strong at 87%. New business premium was up more than 20% from the first quarter of 2015. And renewal premium change was up from recent quarters, driven by the non-rate components of RPC, including slight increases in average policy duration and insured exposures.
These results reflect the execution of our strategy to retain our best accounts and write more business in our return-adequate product segments. In sum, strong top and bottom line results for Bond & Specialty, and we continue to feel great about this segment's performance.
I'll now turn to Personal Insurance. Operating income for the quarter was $139 million, down $113 million from the prior year quarter due to $69 million in higher cats and $68 million in lower net favorable prior year reserve development. The segment's underlying combined ratio for the quarter was 86.1%, 1.4 points better than the 2015 quarter. This improvement was driven by a lower expense ratio, which was due in large part to higher premium volume. We continue to be pleased with production results and underlying financial returns in both Agency Auto and Agency Homeowners & Other.
Looking at Agency Auto, we once again generated strong top line results, and the loss experience of Quantum Auto 2.0 continues to perform in line with expectations. The combined ratio of 95.2% for the quarter was 5 points higher than the prior year quarter due primarily to higher cats and a lower level of net favorable prior year reserve development.
The underlying combined ratio of 94% was up 1 point from last year, in line with our expectations for the quarter. As we've discussed before, the significant levels of new business we've added in the last couple of years will result in a higher calendar year loss ratio in the early years and improve over time. Quantum Auto 2.0 is priced to our long-term target return and is maturing in line with our expectation. As for our overall view of loss trend, blended frequency and severity remains unchanged at around 3%.
Production results continue to be exceptional at Agency Auto, with net written premiums up 13% year-over-year, driven by higher new business premium and strong retention. We continue to grow policies in force, which increased 55,000 during the quarter.
Turning to Agency Homeowners & Other. We generated a combined ratio of 90.4%, even including catastrophes of 16 points. While cats were higher this quarter, the underlying combined ratio of 76.2% improved more than 3 points from the prior year quarter, driven by favorable non-cat weather. As you all know, weather will be volatile from period to period. As Alan mentioned, this quarter was particularly impacted by severe hailstorms in the greater Dallas-Fort Worth area. Slide 21 of the webcast is an extract from our hail dashboard, which many of you will recognize from our Investor Day.
This view is CAT 21, the most substantial event in the quarter, and shows you how much of the area was impacted by 2- and even 3-inch hail. This demonstrates our proprietary capability to get near real-time data about hail size and duration as well as potentially impacted policies. Using this information facilitates a more effective claim response and assists us in estimating losses.
Using these tools, as well as our on-site work in the area, we identified this as a significant event early on and were somewhat surprised at how low the industry estimates were. As more information has become public, it would appear that industry estimates for this event will rise.
Notwithstanding the weather volatility, we remain very pleased with the underlying financial returns we're generating in this business as we continue to execute our disciplined underwriting and pricing strategies.
As for production in Agency Homeowners & Other, we continue to make good progress, in line with our expectations. New business premium was up more than 30% from the prior year quarter. Retention remained strong at 85%, and we added 26,000 policies during the quarter. So even with the significant cats during the quarter, a great start to the year for Personal Insurance.
With that, I'll turn the call back to Gabby."

We expect to make that payment in the second quarter, so that will have an impact as well. Something else that affects the average invested assets, some of our assets are denominated in foreign currency.

And then this discount for connected homes. And if you think about it, similar to what we would do for someone who has an alarm or something of that sort, but we do have both of our claims -- both of our homes of that Claim U are connected homes, so we can study how the data comes in. We can study what that changes about the underwriting process and the claim process.

We talked a lot about it at  [indiscernible]. We know that others have commented on frequency in the industry. Some have commented that they're seeing higher frequency. Some have not commented at all. So we don't feel like it's the thing that's just ripping through the industry. It's affecting very specific companies. And the most important thing for us is where you're starting from, what assumptions have you made. So we have not assumed flat frequency for a number of years, it's been 0.5 point. The other thing I'll -- and we may have talked about this last quarter, so I apologize if it's repetitive. But in '14, there were some observations that frequency was dropping. We analyzed that very, very carefully and really didn't think it was systemic or sustainable. And so at that point, while we recognized the financial impact of that lower frequency for '14, we went into '15 assuming that trend was going to go back to where it was, and it did.

We've got a transportation company, Northland Insurance, that does the smaller end of the trucking business, so not the large fleets primarily. They've had some neat opportunities. There's been some opportunity in the inland marine and boiler business, again, somewhat a result of some actions that other carriers have taken. So I think all of those things have added up to it.

So I don't know, but what I would point you to is the way we've been able to manage returns across all 3 business segments over a long period of time throughout a bunch of different conditions. And so you look at what Doreen and Greg and Michael have done in Personal Insurance by taking some difficult actions and repositioning that business and rolling out a new product. You look at what Tom Kunkel did in Bond & Specialty in a bunch of credit-sensitive businesses through a very difficult period and a financial crisis. Think about what we've done in Business Insurance going back to 2010, when you look at the -- we went back, then we looked at the outlook for returns and realized that we had to do some things differently. So your perspective that it might fall off beyond where we're giving guidance for suggests purely current course and speed, and I would say that we're at current course and speed now because we like product returns. And when we get to a point in time where we don't like product returns, then we'll do different things. So we -- I wouldn't necessarily draw the conclusion you're drawing. But I don't know for sure.

Especially in light of a relatively high lev",735,"Thank you, Gabby. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. This morning, we reported first quarter operating income of $698 million or $2.33 per share and operating return on equity of 12.5%. Especially in light of a relatively high level of catastrophe losses in the quarter, our underwriting results across the board remained strong, as reflected in our combined ratio of 92.3%. 
To put the weather in some context, our catastrophe losses were about $100 million after tax higher in the quarter than they were last year, and these are the highest first quarter cat losses we've had since 2010. The timing of catastrophes is, of course, unpredictable, but this level of weather volatility is certainly within our playbook. We're confident in our ability to model and manage our exposures and that we're pricing appropriately for the risk.
In this case, it just so happens that by design, we have a healthy market share in the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex, where severe hailstorms were concentrated. Doreen will have more to say about the severity and about our claim analytics.
The real story this quarter is about our execution in the marketplace, and across all our businesses, we couldn't be more pleased. In our commercial businesses, we continue to be successful in our efforts to maximize retentions on our best-performing accounts and improve profitability on poor-performing business. Retentions in the quarter were again at very high levels by historical standards, and renewal premium change was positive. We believe these production results are right on target given our view of product returns, but as we've explained before, we don't manage the business on an aggregate basis. We execute deliberately account by account or class by class, and you can see this on Slide 13 of the webcast, which displays the distribution of rate changes for our Middle Market accounts in the first quarter.
As you can see from the slide, most accounts received a single-digit rate increase, and there were a number of accounts that had a rate increase of greater than 5% or even 10%. So even now with the headline pure rate change just slightly negative, we continue to achieve rate gains in excess of loss trend on our poor-performing business. The real takeaway from this slide is that the aggregate rate number is simply an average of thousands of individual account actions and that success in this business is not about the aggregate rate number. It's about taking the right action on each account and generating an appropriate return over time.
Our execution in the quarter also benefited from a commercial lines pricing environment that, from our vantage point, continues to be remarkably stable. The outlook that we provided this morning in our 10-Q for our BII and BSI segments suggests more of the same: continued high levels of retention and broadly consistent underlying underwriting margins.
In terms of execution, we were just as successful in our Personal Insurance business, with strong retentions and higher PIF counts in both Agency Auto and Agency Homeowners. Importantly, Quantum Auto 2.0 continues to meet our expectations on all fronts. The successful execution across all our businesses resulted in consolidated net written premiums that were about 5% higher in the quarter than they were in the prior year. Both new business levels and historically high levels of retention, particularly in our Middle Market business, contributed significantly to the top line growth. 
The quality and breadth of our products and services, our extraordinary talent in the field and the strength of the relationships that we have with our agent and broker partners put us in a great position to win. In addition to that, we believe that we benefited in the quarter, both in terms of new and renewal business, from the stability and consistency we provide in the marketplace compared to some of our competitors who are experiencing varying degrees of disruption.
Turning to capital management. As a reflection of the confidence that we have in our business, today our Board of Directors declared an approximately 10% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.67 per share, the 12th consecutive year of dividend increases and bringing the compound annual growth rate of the dividend to almost 10% over that time.
All in all, despite an active quarter from a catastrophe perspective, a great start to the year.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Jay Benet."
392856,311922492,961480,"The Travelers Companies, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2016",2016-04-21,"Earnings Calls","The Travelers Companies, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Alan. I'll start by saying that we were pleased with our first quarter results, operating income of $698 million and operating return on equity of 12.5%, despite their being lower than the prior year quarter. As Page 4 of the webcast indicates,",707,"Thanks, Alan. I'll start by saying that we were pleased with our first quarter results, operating income of $698 million and operating return on equity of 12.5%, despite their being lower than the prior year quarter. 
As Page 4 of the webcast indicates, the $129 million decrease in operating income from last year's first quarter did not come about due to lower underlying underwriting results. Our consolidated underlying combined ratio is 90% this quarter, 30 basis points better than the prior year quarter. Rather, the decrease in operating income, along with the decrease in operating ROE, resulted from 2 items: cat losses that were $101 million higher on an after-tax basis than those in the first quarter of 2015; and as we anticipated in the outlook section of our 2015 10-K, a $24 million after-tax reduction in fixed income net investment income that was driven by the continuing low interest rate environment.
Page 4 also provides an analysis as to how our reported results compared to analysts' estimates. As best we can tell, analysts' estimates for cat losses were significantly lower than what actually occurred, which more than accounts for the difference. Our net investment income was $439 million after tax this quarter, which was $39 million lower than the prior year quarter. In addition to the lower fixed income returns, non-fixed income NII was down $15 million after tax due to lower hedge fund returns that resulted from the more challenging capital market conditions in recent months.
Each of our business segments once again contributed to net favorable prior year reserve development, which totaled $180 million on a pre-tax basis. In Business and International Insurance, net favorable development of $93 million resulted from better-than-expected loss experience in workers' comp excess coverages for accident years 2006 and prior; in general liability, primarily for excess coverages for accident years 2011 and 2013; in commercial auto for accident years 2010 and prior; and in our European and Canadian operations. In Bond & Specialty Insurance, net favorable development of $60 million resulted from better-than-expected loss experience in surety for accident years 2012 through 2014. And in Personal Insurance, net favorable development of $27 million resulted from better-than-expected loss experience in Homeowners & Other for liability coverages for accident year 2014 and in Auto for accident year 2014.
On a combined stat basis, for all of our U.S. subs, all accident years developed favorably other than the 2015 accident year, which is currently showing $65 million of unfavorable development due to a few large property losses that occurred late in 2015 and a decision we made to rebalance Personal Insurance reserves among various accident years. In addition, other than commercial multi-peril, all product lines either developed favorably or had de minimis unfavorable development this quarter. While CMP developed unfavorably by $35 million, there was offsetting favorable development in the property product line as Middle Market property losses that had been recorded in the property line at year-end 2015 were subsequently determined to be CMP-related.
Operating cash flows of $850 million remained very strong, and we ended the quarter with holding company liquidity of over $1.7 billion. All of our capital ratios were at or better than their target levels. Net unrealized investment gains were approximately $2.7 billion pretax or $1.8 billion after tax, up from $2 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively, at the beginning of the year. While book value per share of $82.65 and adjusted book value per share of $76.63 increased 4% and 2%, respectively, from the beginning of the year.
We continue to generate much more capital than we need to support our businesses, allowing us to return $790 million of excess capital to our shareholders this quarter. We paid dividends of $181 million and repurchased $609 million of our common shares this quarter, including $550 million under our publicly announced share repurchase program, consistent with our ongoing capital management strategy, and $59 million to partially offset shares issued under employee incentive plans, mostly to cover employee withholding taxes due upon the vesting and payout of performance and restricted stock awards. And as Alan said, the board raised our quarterly dividend from $0.61 to $0.67 per share.
So with that, let me turn the mic over to Brian."

In Business and International Insurance, operating income was $476 million with a combined ratio of 94.8%. The underlying combined ratio, which excludes the impact of cats and prior year reserve development, was 93.3%, up about 0.5 point compared to the first quarter of 2015, reflecting a typical level of quarterly fluctuations within both the loss and expense ratios. This result is in line with our expectations, and we continue to feel very good about our underlying results.
Net written premiums for the quarter were up 3% year-over-year, with domestic business insurance premiums up about 5%, driven by the strong production results across all our businesses. In domestic business insurance, we remain pleased with the continued execution of our pricing strategy. Given the attractive returns that we are generating in this business, our focus continues to be on retention, and accordingly, we're very pleased that retention is at a historical high of 85% for the quarter. Renewal premium change came in at 2.2 points, while renewal rate change was down slightly in the quarter and about flat overall. New business increased to $575 million, reflecting strong results across all our businesses.
Turning to the individual businesses, beginning with Select. We achieved strong retention of 81% and renewal premium change of nearly 7%. Rate change was down about 1 point versus the fourth quarter of 2015, driven in large part by recently filed rate changes in workers' compensation. We generated new business of $103 million, up slightly year-over-year.
In Middle Market, retention reached a historic high of 88%, with renewal premium change of 1 point, in line with the fourth quarter of 2015. Importantly, retention of our best-performing business was approximately 90%, while for our poorer-performing accounts, we achieved rate gains in excess of loss trend.
New business of $321 million was up 8% year-over-year, due in large part to strong results in our construction business. In Other Business Insurance, retention of 82% was up both year-over-year and compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. Renewal premium change of about 1 point was in line with recent quarters, while new business of $151 million was up 24% versus the prior year, driven by inland marine, boiler and transportation lines of business.
So across domestic business insurance, we achieved strong retention and saw an increased level of new business opportunities in the marketplace. As Alan mentioned, our agents and brokers view us as a stable market with industry-leading products and services, which we believe had a favorable impact on both retention and new business, particularly in this environment where several significant competitors are experiencing some degree of disruption.
Turning to International. Net written premiums for the first quarter were down about 10% year-over-year primarily due to the adverse impact of foreign exchange rates. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, net written premiums were down about 4%, driven by disciplined underwriting in the face of highly competitive market conditions in the property lines at Lloyd's.
Retention for the quarter was strong at 82%. Renewal premium change was slightly negative but above recent quarters. And new business of $76 million was up more than 30% year-over-year, driven primarily by Optima, our new strategic personal lines auto product in Canada. This product was modeled after our U.S.-based Quantum Auto 2.0 product, and while we're still in the early days of the rollout, we're encouraged by the response as we continue to see a significant increase in new business volume. In summary, in the segment, we achieved strong underlying underwriting and production results, a great start to 2016.
And with that, let me turn it over to Doreen."

Bond & Specialty Insurance started 2016 with a strong first quarter, and we remain exceptionally pleased with the financial returns in this segment. For the quarter, operating income was $144 million, up from",904,"Thank you, Brian, and good morning, everyone. Bond & Specialty Insurance started 2016 with a strong first quarter, and we remain exceptionally pleased with the financial returns in this segment. For the quarter, operating income was $144 million, up from the first quarter of 2015 due primarily to a higher level of net favorable prior year reserve development but also improved underlying underwriting results.
The underlying combined ratio of 81.1% was almost 2 points better than the prior year, driven by 2 items: one, the favorable expense impact of certain customer-related intangible assets, which became fully amortized during second quarter of 2015; and second, lower loss levels in certain Management Liability businesses.
Underlying returns in this segment were once again very strong and remain well within our target level. Results like this do not happen by accident. Insights provided by our deep industry expertise and analytics, along with disciplined execution of long-term strategies, have positioned us to successfully navigate rising economic challenges, the most recent being the disruption in the coal and broader energy sectors.
As for top line, we generated higher net written premiums for the quarter as compared to 2015 in both our Management Liability and Surety businesses. The increased Surety production reflected higher contract bond activity from midsize construction accounts. Across our Management Liability businesses, retention remains strong at 87%. New business premium was up more than 20% from the first quarter of 2015. And renewal premium change was up from recent quarters, driven by the non-rate components of RPC, including slight increases in average policy duration and insured exposures.
These results reflect the execution of our strategy to retain our best accounts and write more business in our return-adequate product segments. In sum, strong top and bottom line results for Bond & Specialty, and we continue to feel great about this segment's performance.
I'll now turn to Personal Insurance. Operating income for the quarter was $139 million, down $113 million from the prior year quarter due to $69 million in higher cats and $68 million in lower net favorable prior year reserve development. The segment's underlying combined ratio for the quarter was 86.1%, 1.4 points better than the 2015 quarter. This improvement was driven by a lower expense ratio, which was due in large part to higher premium volume. We continue to be pleased with production results and underlying financial returns in both Agency Auto and Agency Homeowners & Other.
Looking at Agency Auto, we once again generated strong top line results, and the loss experience of Quantum Auto 2.0 continues to perform in line with expectations. The combined ratio of 95.2% for the quarter was 5 points higher than the prior year quarter due primarily to higher cats and a lower level of net favorable prior year reserve development.
The underlying combined ratio of 94% was up 1 point from last year, in line with our expectations for the quarter. As we've discussed before, the significant levels of new business we've added in the last couple of years will result in a higher calendar year loss ratio in the early years and improve over time. Quantum Auto 2.0 is priced to our long-term target return and is maturing in line with our expectation. As for our overall view of loss trend, blended frequency and severity remains unchanged at around 3%.
Production results continue to be exceptional at Agency Auto, with net written premiums up 13% year-over-year, driven by higher new business premium and strong retention. We continue to grow policies in force, which increased 55,000 during the quarter.
Turning to Agency Homeowners & Other. We generated a combined ratio of 90.4%, even including catastrophes of 16 points. While cats were higher this quarter, the underlying combined ratio of 76.2% improved more than 3 points from the prior year quarter, driven by favorable non-cat weather. As you all know, weather will be volatile from period to period. As Alan mentioned, this quarter was particularly impacted by severe hailstorms in the greater Dallas-Fort Worth area. Slide 21 of the webcast is an extract from our hail dashboard, which many of you will recognize from our Investor Day.
This view is CAT 21, the most substantial event in the quarter, and shows you how much of the area was impacted by 2- and even 3-inch hail. This demonstrates our proprietary capability to get near real-time data about hail size and duration as well as potentially impacted policies. Using this information facilitates a more effective claim response and assists us in estimating losses.
Using these tools, as well as our on-site work in the area, we identified this as a significant event early on and were somewhat surprised at how low the industry estimates were. As more information has become public, it would appear that industry estimates for this event will rise.
Notwithstanding the weather volatility, we remain very pleased with the underlying financial returns we're generating in this business as we continue to execute our disciplined underwriting and pricing strategies.
As for production in Agency Homeowners & Other, we continue to make good progress, in line with our expectations. New business premium was up more than 30% from the prior year quarter. Retention remained strong at 85%, and we added 26,000 policies during the quarter. So even with the significant cats during the quarter, a great start to the year for Personal Insurance.
With that, I'll turn the call back to Gabby."

And it also looked like there was, in the 10-Q, an allusion to a $0.5 billion payment on the asbestos side that's coming in the second quarter. So just trying to understand, when you think about that $25 million to $30 million quarterly drag, is that contemplating sort of a lower level of invested assets? Or should we think about that as all just being driven by your view of lower investment rates?"

It is a combination of our view as to what the rate environment looks like as well as what the average invested assets are and will be. As you recall, in the first quarter of last year, we had a large payment to finalize the Direct Action's settlement for asbestos. That brought the average down a little bit. And as you rightly point out, we're expecting to make a final payment on the PPG settlement when other parties finalize some of the remaining issues, which are -- we don't view as significant issues, in the second quarter. We expect to make that payment in the second quarter, so that will have an impact as well. Something else that affects the average invested assets, some of our assets are denominated in foreign currency. So you do have some currency exchange taking place, where, in effect, the assets are still the same, just the currency-adjusted value is a little lower. But those are the 2 primary things, the 2 asbestos payments, that bring it down."

And on top of that, this quarter, as both Brian and I noted, there was some disruption in the marketplace, and given our stability out there, we do think we benefit from that. It's hard, probably impossible, for any of us to try to put a finer point on the allocation of dollars to one cause or another, but we do think all those things coming together resulted in the higher new business levels."

And what it really does is it covers what's called the trolling period until there's a match. Then the coverage is clear that there isn't any personal insurance coverage. And then this discount for connected homes. And if you think about it, similar to what we would do for someone who has an alarm or something of that sort, but we do have both of our claims -- both of our homes of that Claim U are connected homes, so we can study how the data comes in. We can study what that changes about the underwriting process and the claim process. And we're also a member of CNET, which has a very sophisticated connected home in Kentucky, and we're the only insurer on that CNET home board looking for all the applications in the connected space.

We've seen a normalized trend of 3%, which includes 0.5 point for frequency and 2.5 points for severity.

We talked a lot about it at  [indiscernible]. We know that others have commented on frequency in the industry. Some have commented that they're seeing higher frequency. Some have not commented at all. So we don't feel like it's the thing that's just ripping through the industry. It's affecting very specific companies. And the most important thing for us is where you're starting from, what assumptions have you made. So we have not assumed flat frequency for a number of years, it's been 0.5 point. The other thing I'll -- and we may have talked about this last quarter, so I apologize if it's repetitive. But in '14, there were some observations that frequency was dropping. We analyzed that very, very carefully and really didn't think it was systemic or sustainable. And so at that point, while we recognized the financial impact of that lower frequency for '14, we went into '15 assuming that trend was going to go back to where it was, and it did. And so the 0.5 point remains unchanged. The trend remains unchanged, and it really goes back to where you start from."

As I also said, we're obsessing over the quality, so we're looking at all of those deals. In the Other Business Insurance world, there are some specific opportunities. We've got a transportation company, Northland Insurance, that does the smaller end of the trucking business, so not the large fleets primarily. They've had some neat opportunities. There's been some opportunity in the inland marine and boiler business, again, somewhat a result of some actions that other carriers have taken. So I think all of those things have added up to it.

And one of the reasons that we give outlook for 3 or 4 quarters is because just our perspective beyond that gets unreliable. So I don't know, but what I would point you to is the way we've been able to manage returns across all 3 business segments over a long period of time throughout a bunch of different conditions. And so you look at what Doreen and Greg and Michael have done in Personal Insurance by taking some difficult actions and repositioning that business and rolling out a new product. You look at what Tom Kunkel did in Bond & Specialty in a bunch of credit-sensitive businesses through a very difficult period and a financial crisis. Think about what we've done in Business Insurance going back to 2010, when you look at the -- we went back, then we looked at the outlook for returns and realized that we had to do some things differently. So your perspective that it might fall off beyond where we're giving guidance for suggests purely current course and speed, and I would say that we're at current course and speed now because we like product returns. And when we get to a point in time where we don't like product returns, then we'll do different things. So we -- I wouldn't necessarily draw the conclusion you're drawing. But I don't know for sure.

Especially in light of a relatively high lev",735,"Thank you, Gabby. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. This morning, we reported first quarter operating income of $698 million or $2.33 per share and operating return on equity of 12.5%. Especially in light of a relatively high level of catastrophe losses in the quarter, our underwriting results across the board remained strong, as reflected in our combined ratio of 92.3%. 
To put the weather in some context, our catastrophe losses were about $100 million after tax higher in the quarter than they were last year, and these are the highest first quarter cat losses we've had since 2010. The timing of catastrophes is, of course, unpredictable, but this level of weather volatility is certainly within our playbook. We're confident in our ability to model and manage our exposures and that we're pricing appropriately for the risk.
In this case, it just so happens that by design, we have a healthy market share in the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex, where severe hailstorms were concentrated. Doreen will have more to say about the severity and about our claim analytics.
The real story this quarter is about our execution in the marketplace, and across all our businesses, we couldn't be more pleased. In our commercial businesses, we continue to be successful in our efforts to maximize retentions on our best-performing accounts and improve profitability on poor-performing business. Retentions in the quarter were again at very high levels by historical standards, and renewal premium change was positive. We believe these production results are right on target given our view of product returns, but as we've explained before, we don't manage the business on an aggregate basis. We execute deliberately account by account or class by class, and you can see this on Slide 13 of the webcast, which displays the distribution of rate changes for our Middle Market accounts in the first quarter.
As you can see from the slide, most accounts received a single-digit rate increase, and there were a number of accounts that had a rate increase of greater than 5% or even 10%. So even now with the headline pure rate change just slightly negative, we continue to achieve rate gains in excess of loss trend on our poor-performing business. The real takeaway from this slide is that the aggregate rate number is simply an average of thousands of individual account actions and that success in this business is not about the aggregate rate number. It's about taking the right action on each account and generating an appropriate return over time.
Our execution in the quarter also benefited from a commercial lines pricing environment that, from our vantage point, continues to be remarkably stable. The outlook that we provided this morning in our 10-Q for our BII and BSI segments suggests more of the same: continued high levels of retention and broadly consistent underlying underwriting margins.
In terms of execution, we were just as successful in our Personal Insurance business, with strong retentions and higher PIF counts in both Agency Auto and Agency Homeowners. Importantly, Quantum Auto 2.0 continues to meet our expectations on all fronts. The successful execution across all our businesses resulted in consolidated net written premiums that were about 5% higher in the quarter than they were in the prior year. Both new business levels and historically high levels of retention, particularly in our Middle Market business, contributed significantly to the top line growth. 
The quality and breadth of our products and services, our extraordinary talent in the field and the strength of the relationships that we have with our agent and broker partners put us in a great position to win. In addition to that, we believe that we benefited in the quarter, both in terms of new and renewal business, from the stability and consistency we provide in the marketplace compared to some of our competitors who are experiencing varying degrees of disruption.
Turning to capital management. As a reflection of the confidence that we have in our business, today our Board of Directors declared an approximately 10% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.67 per share, the 12th consecutive year of dividend increases and bringing the compound annual growth rate of the dividend to almost 10% over that time.
All in all, despite an active quarter from a catastrophe perspective, a great start to the year.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Jay Benet."

Our consolidated underlying combined ratio is 90% this quarter, 30 basis points better than the prior year quarter. Rather, the decrease in operating income, along with the decrease in operating ROE, resulted from 2 items: cat losses that were $101 million higher on an after-tax basis than those in the first quarter of 2015; and as we anticipated in the outlook section of our 2015 10-K, a $24 million after-tax reduction in fixed income net investment income that was driven by the continuing low interest rate environment.
Page 4 also provides an analysis as to how our reported results compared to analysts' estimates. As best we can tell, analysts' estimates for cat losses were significantly lower than what actually occurred, which more than accounts for the difference. Our net investment income was $439 million after tax this quarter, which was $39 million lower than the prior year quarter. In addition to the lower fixed income returns, non-fixed income NII was down $15 million after tax due to lower hedge fund returns that resulted from the more challenging capital market conditions in recent months.
Each of our business segments once again contributed to net favorable prior year reserve development, which totaled $180 million on a pre-tax basis. In Business and International Insurance, net favorable development of $93 million resulted from better-than-expected loss experience in workers' comp excess coverages for accident years 2006 and prior; in general liability, primarily for excess coverages for accident years 2011 and 2013; in commercial auto for accident years 2010 and prior; and in our European and Canadian operations. In Bond & Specialty Insurance, net favorable development of $60 million resulted from better-than-expected loss experience in surety for accident years 2012 through 2014. And in Personal Insurance, net favorable development of $27 million resulted from better-than-expected loss experience in Homeowners & Other for liability coverages for accident year 2014 and in Auto for accident year 2014.
On a combined stat basis, for all of our U.S. subs, all accident years developed favorably other than the 2015 accident year, which is currently showing $65 million of unfavorable development due to a few large property losses that occurred late in 2015 and a decision we made to rebalance Personal Insurance reserves among various accident years. In addition, other than commercial multi-peril, all product lines either developed favorably or had de minimis unfavorable development this quarter. While CMP developed unfavorably by $35 million, there was offsetting favorable development in the property product line as Middle Market property losses that had been recorded in the property line at year-end 2015 were subsequently determined to be CMP-related.
Operating cash flows of $850 million remained very strong, and we ended the quarter with holding company liquidity of over $1.7 billion. All of our capital ratios were at or better than their target levels. Net unrealized investment gains were approximately $2.7 billion pretax or $1.8 billion after tax, up from $2 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively, at the beginning of the year. While book value per share of $82.65 and adjusted book value per share of $76.63 increased 4% and 2%, respectively, from the beginning of the year.
We continue to generate much more capital than we need to support our businesses, allowing us to return $790 million of excess capital to our shareholders this quarter. We paid dividends of $181 million and repurchased $609 million of our common shares this quarter, including $550 million under our publicly announced share repurchase program, consistent with our ongoing capital management strategy, and $59 million to partially offset shares issued under employee incentive plans, mostly to cover employee withholding taxes due upon the vesting and payout of performance and restricted stock awards. And as Alan said, the board raised our quarterly dividend from $0.61 to $0.67 per share.
So with that, let me turn the mic over to Brian."

In Business and International Insurance, operating income was $476 million with a combined ratio of 94.8%. The underlying combined ratio, which excludes the impact of cats and prior year reserve development, was 93.3%, up about 0.5 point compared to the first quarter of 2015, reflecting a typical level of quarterly fluctuations within both the loss and expense ratios. This result is in line with our expectations, and we continue to feel very good about our underlying results.
Net written premiums for the quarter were up 3% year-over-year, with domestic business insurance premiums up about 5%, driven by the strong production results across all our businesses. In domestic business insurance, we remain pleased with the continued execution of our pricing strategy. Given the attractive returns that we are generating in this business, our focus continues to be on retention, and accordingly, we're very pleased that retention is at a historical high of 85% for the quarter. Renewal premium change came in at 2.2 points, while renewal rate change was down slightly in the quarter and about flat overall. New business increased to $575 million, reflecting strong results across all our businesses.
Turning to the individual businesses, beginning with Select. We achieved strong retention of 81% and renewal premium change of nearly 7%. Rate change was down about 1 point versus the fourth quarter of 2015, driven in large part by recently filed rate changes in workers' compensation. We generated new business of $103 million, up slightly year-over-year.
In Middle Market, retention reached a historic high of 88%, with renewal premium change of 1 point, in line with the fourth quarter of 2015. Importantly, retention of our best-performing business was approximately 90%, while for our poorer-performing accounts, we achieved rate gains in excess of loss trend.
New business of $321 million was up 8% year-over-year, due in large part to strong results in our construction business. In Other Business Insurance, retention of 82% was up both year-over-year and compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. Renewal premium change of about 1 point was in line with recent quarters, while new business of $151 million was up 24% versus the prior year, driven by inland marine, boiler and transportation lines of business.
So across domestic business insurance, we achieved strong retention and saw an increased level of new business opportunities in the marketplace. As Alan mentioned, our agents and brokers view us as a stable market with industry-leading products and services, which we believe had a favorable impact on both retention and new business, particularly in this environment where several significant competitors are experiencing some degree of disruption.
Turning to International. Net written premiums for the first quarter were down about 10% year-over-year primarily due to the adverse impact of foreign exchange rates. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, net written premiums were down about 4%, driven by disciplined underwriting in the face of highly competitive market conditions in the property lines at Lloyd's.
Retention for the quarter was strong at 82%. Renewal premium change was slightly negative but above recent quarters. And new business of $76 million was up more than 30% year-over-year, driven primarily by Optima, our new strategic personal lines auto product in Canada. This product was modeled after our U.S.-based Quantum Auto 2.0 product, and while we're still in the early days of the rollout, we're encouraged by the response as we continue to see a significant increase in new business volume. In summary, in the segment, we achieved strong underlying underwriting and production results, a great start to 2016.
And with that, let me turn it over to Doreen."
392856,311922492,962062,"The Travelers Companies, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2016",2016-04-21,"Earnings Calls","The Travelers Companies, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Brian, and good morning, everyone. Bond & Specialty Insurance started 2016 with a strong first quarter, and we remain exceptionally pleased with the financial returns in this segment. For the quarter, operating income was $144 million, up from",904,"Thank you, Brian, and good morning, everyone. Bond & Specialty Insurance started 2016 with a strong first quarter, and we remain exceptionally pleased with the financial returns in this segment. For the quarter, operating income was $144 million, up from the first quarter of 2015 due primarily to a higher level of net favorable prior year reserve development but also improved underlying underwriting results.
The underlying combined ratio of 81.1% was almost 2 points better than the prior year, driven by 2 items: one, the favorable expense impact of certain customer-related intangible assets, which became fully amortized during second quarter of 2015; and second, lower loss levels in certain Management Liability businesses.
Underlying returns in this segment were once again very strong and remain well within our target level. Results like this do not happen by accident. Insights provided by our deep industry expertise and analytics, along with disciplined execution of long-term strategies, have positioned us to successfully navigate rising economic challenges, the most recent being the disruption in the coal and broader energy sectors.
As for top line, we generated higher net written premiums for the quarter as compared to 2015 in both our Management Liability and Surety businesses. The increased Surety production reflected higher contract bond activity from midsize construction accounts. Across our Management Liability businesses, retention remains strong at 87%. New business premium was up more than 20% from the first quarter of 2015. And renewal premium change was up from recent quarters, driven by the non-rate components of RPC, including slight increases in average policy duration and insured exposures.
These results reflect the execution of our strategy to retain our best accounts and write more business in our return-adequate product segments. In sum, strong top and bottom line results for Bond & Specialty, and we continue to feel great about this segment's performance.
I'll now turn to Personal Insurance. Operating income for the quarter was $139 million, down $113 million from the prior year quarter due to $69 million in higher cats and $68 million in lower net favorable prior year reserve development. The segment's underlying combined ratio for the quarter was 86.1%, 1.4 points better than the 2015 quarter. This improvement was driven by a lower expense ratio, which was due in large part to higher premium volume. We continue to be pleased with production results and underlying financial returns in both Agency Auto and Agency Homeowners & Other.
Looking at Agency Auto, we once again generated strong top line results, and the loss experience of Quantum Auto 2.0 continues to perform in line with expectations. The combined ratio of 95.2% for the quarter was 5 points higher than the prior year quarter due primarily to higher cats and a lower level of net favorable prior year reserve development.
The underlying combined ratio of 94% was up 1 point from last year, in line with our expectations for the quarter. As we've discussed before, the significant levels of new business we've added in the last couple of years will result in a higher calendar year loss ratio in the early years and improve over time. Quantum Auto 2.0 is priced to our long-term target return and is maturing in line with our expectation. As for our overall view of loss trend, blended frequency and severity remains unchanged at around 3%.
Production results continue to be exceptional at Agency Auto, with net written premiums up 13% year-over-year, driven by higher new business premium and strong retention. We continue to grow policies in force, which increased 55,000 during the quarter.
Turning to Agency Homeowners & Other. We generated a combined ratio of 90.4%, even including catastrophes of 16 points. While cats were higher this quarter, the underlying combined ratio of 76.2% improved more than 3 points from the prior year quarter, driven by favorable non-cat weather. As you all know, weather will be volatile from period to period. As Alan mentioned, this quarter was particularly impacted by severe hailstorms in the greater Dallas-Fort Worth area. Slide 21 of the webcast is an extract from our hail dashboard, which many of you will recognize from our Investor Day.
This view is CAT 21, the most substantial event in the quarter, and shows you how much of the area was impacted by 2- and even 3-inch hail. This demonstrates our proprietary capability to get near real-time data about hail size and duration as well as potentially impacted policies. Using this information facilitates a more effective claim response and assists us in estimating losses.
Using these tools, as well as our on-site work in the area, we identified this as a significant event early on and were somewhat surprised at how low the industry estimates were. As more information has become public, it would appear that industry estimates for this event will rise.
Notwithstanding the weather volatility, we remain very pleased with the underlying financial returns we're generating in this business as we continue to execute our disciplined underwriting and pricing strategies.
As for production in Agency Homeowners & Other, we continue to make good progress, in line with our expectations. New business premium was up more than 30% from the prior year quarter. Retention remained strong at 85%, and we added 26,000 policies during the quarter. So even with the significant cats during the quarter, a great start to the year for Personal Insurance.
With that, I'll turn the call back to Gabby."

And that's been something that we've basically had baked into our results for 2 to 3 years at this point. So let me just go back a little bit on frequency because I know we've talked a lot about it. We talked a lot about it at [indiscernible]. We know that others have commented on frequency in the industry. Some have commented that they're seeing higher frequency. Some have not commented at all. So we don't feel like it's the thing that's just ripping through the industry. It's affecting very specific companies. And the most important thing for us is where you're starting from, what assumptions have you made. So we have not assumed flat frequency for a number of years, it's been 0.5 point. The other thing I'll -- and we may have talked about this last quarter, so I apologize if it's repetitive. But in '14, there were some observations that frequency was dropping. We analyzed that very, very carefully and really didn't think it was systemic or sustainable. And so at that point, while we recognized the financial impact of that lower frequency for '14, we went into '15 assuming that trend was going to go back to where it was, and it did. And so the 0.5 point remains unchanged. The trend remains unchanged, and it really goes back to where you start from."

I think in Middle Market, in particular, we've been doing a lot of things with our process and our people to be really active in the marketplace.

I think it's also linked to -- and again, as Alan said, you can't draw perfect connections here, but there is disruption in the marketplace amongst some significant competitors. And I think our strong position with agents and brokers and the breadth of products that we have and capabilities have really helped us there. So I think we're very comfortable. As I also said, we're obsessing over the quality, so we're looking at all of those deals. In the Other Business Insurance world, there are some specific opportunities. We've got a transportation company, Northland Insurance, that does the smaller end of the trucking business, so not the large fleets primarily. They've had some neat opportunities. There's been some opportunity in the inland marine and boiler business, again, somewhat a result of some actions that other carriers have taken. So I think all of those things have added up to it. And it's not -- I think -- I guess the main point: it's not tied directly to pricing and price change opportunity."

Think about what we've done in Business Insurance going back to 2010, when you look at the -- we went back, then we looked at the outlook for returns and realized that we had to do some things differently. So your perspective that it might fall off beyond where we're giving guidance for suggests purely current course and speed, and I would say that we're at current course and speed now because we like product returns.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. This morning, we reported second quarter operating income of $649 million or $2.20 per share, and an operating return on equity of 11.6%. Our underwriting results remain strong",651,"Thank you, Gabby. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. This morning, we reported second quarter operating income of $649 million or $2.20 per share, and an operating return on equity of 11.6%. Our underwriting results remain strong as reflected in our 93.1% combined ratio for the quarter, despite the impact of higher catastrophe and non-cat weather-related costs year-over-year. 
For the 6 months, we reported operating income of $1.35 billion or $4.52 per share and an operating return on equity of 12%. Given the cumulative impact of declining interest rates on our investment portfolio, and also relative to the fresh lows in the risk-free rate, we felt terrific about the returns we continue to generate. Our expertise and risk selection and pricing, our thoughtful and consistent investment strategy and our active approach to capital management, all come together to enable to achieve our objectives of delivering superior returns and creating shareholder value. 
Turning to production, the second quarter was another example of the successful execution of our marketplace strategies. We're very pleased with the record volume of premium that we brought in the quarter. And we continue to be very pleased with the model returns in the business writing. In our commercial businesses, retentions remain high and no premium change was positive. Underneath that, consistent with our very granular approach to execution, in middle market, we retained 19% of the premium from our best performance accounts with only modest decline in renewal rate change on that business. 
One our poor performance accounts, we achieved renewal rate change in excess of lost trend. You might have noticed that renewal rate change in domestic business insurance was slightly positive as compared to slightly negative in the second quarter. And annual rate change in the market improved by 4-point. We don't forecast rate and we're not calling a bottom, but the significance of this to us is that the market remains remarkably stable and we're generally successful and achieving our written return objectives. 
In terms of new business, we are actively seeking and finding opportunities that meet our return thresholds. And we delivered strong new business growth in our commercial businesses including 10% growth in new business and domestic business insurance. 
In Personal Insurance, net written premiums were 9% to a recordable $2.1 billion with accelerating momentum in both Auto and Homeowners. New business was up 21% year-over-year, driven by the success of the Quantum product. Quantum Auto 2.0 continues to meet our financial expectations and are successfully enhancing our market position. Our success in the marketplace across all our businesses really speak to the value of the talent that we have in the home office and in the field. And their ability to leverage our data and analytics and work with our distribution partners to deliver great products and services at their prices to our customers. 
Franchise value matters. Before turning the call over to Jay Benet, I'd like to acknowledge and thank all of our colleagues in the claim organization for their extraordinary efforts in handling the claims of our customers, affected by severe weather and fire so far this year. These experts are on the frontline for us delivering on the promise we extend with every policy that we write, and it has been a very active year so far for them. Their responsiveness and expertise are great to our customers and an important competitive advantage for us. 
In Canada, where we felt significant wildfires in Fort McMurray area, both our customers and we benefited from the work we've done to replicate our U.S. claim model, which enables us to respond to large-scale events with our own highly trained professionals and resources, without resorting to independent adjusters. So all in all, results in the quarter first, particularly the weather and wildfires and continued excellent execution in the marketplace. And with that, I'll turn it over to Jay Benet."

As I did in the first quarter, I'd like to start by saying that we're pleased with our results, operating income of $649 million and operating return on equity of 11.6%, despite they being lower than in the prior year quarter. This reduction",916,"Thanks, Alan. As I did in the first quarter, I'd like to start by saying that we're pleased with our results, operating income of $649 million and operating return on equity of 11.6%, despite they being lower than in the prior year quarter. This reduction did not result from significant changes in underlying business trends. Notably, as indicated on Page 4 of the webcast, the quarter-over-quarter decrease in operating income was impacted by, among other things, PCS cat events and lower fixed income, net investment income. 
Losses from PCS cat events with net or exceeded our threshold for recording its cat, was $79 million higher after tax than in the prior year quarter. The losses from PCS CAT events that filed below our cat thresholds, which we recorded as part of non-cap weather related losses within underlying underwriting results were $56 million after tax than in the prior year quarter. 
And fixed income NII was $21 million lower after tax, primarily due to the continuing low interest rate environment as we had anticipated in the outlook section of our first quarter 2016 10-Q. Everything else was pretty much a wash. 
We continue to experience net favorable prior year result development, which totaled $288 million pretax or $192 million after tax this quarter, up from $207 million pretax or $133 million after tax in the prior year quarter. The business in international insurance, net favorable development of $138 million pretax or $94 million after tax, primarily resulted from better-than-expected loss in domestic workers comp.  For accident years 2006 and prior, an accident year 2015. Better-than-expected loss experience in domestic general liability for accident years 2011 and 2015 and better-than-expected loss experience in our European operations, partially offset by an $82 million pretax or $53 million after tax increase to environmental reserves. 
In Bond and Specialty Insurance, net favorable development of $150 million pretax or $98 million after tax, primarily resulted from better-than-expected loss experience. And fidelity and Surety for accident years, 2010, 2013 and 2014 and better-than-expected loss experience in GL for accident years, 2007 through 2011. 
Year-to-date, on a combined basis where all of our U.S. subs, all accident years have developed favorably or had deminimus unfavorable development. In addition, other than commercial multi-parallel or product lines have developed favorably year-to-date. While CMP has developed unfavorably by $42 million year-to-date, you may recall, my telling you in the first quarter, that there was an offsetting favorable development in the property product line as middle market property losses that had been recorded in the property line at year end 2015 were subsequently determined to be CMP related. 
Operating cash flows of $443 million was very strong, particularly recognizing that there were net of the $524 million payment we made this quarter, as final settlement of the PPG litigation. We ended the quarter with holding company liquidity of $1.75 billion and all of our capital ratios were at or better than their target levels. 
Net unrealized investment gains increased to approximately $3.6 billion pretax or $2.3 billion after tax, up from $2 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively, at the beginning of the year, while book value per share of $85.73 and adjusted book value per share of $77.61 increased 7% and 3%, respectively, also from the beginning of the year. 
We continue to generate much more capital than we need to support our business. And consistent with our ongoing capital management strategy, we returned $747 million of excess capital to our shareholders this quarter through dividends of $197 million of share repurchases of $550 million. Year-to-date, we returned over $1.5 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Before turning the microphone over to Brian, there's 1 additional topic I'd like to cover or cap reinsurance coverage. 
In addition to our corporate cat aggregate which had renewed at the beginning of the year, our cap reinsurance included cap bonds that were specific to the Northeast U.S. along with the Northeast gen cap trading. 
With respect to the cat bonds, 1, that had provided up to $300 million of coverage for certain losses, expired as scheduled in May 2016, and given our current risk profile, we decided not to replace them. With respect to the remaining cat bond, which will not expire until May 2018, the attachment point and maximum limit will reset as required annually to adjust the model expected loss of the layer within the predetermined range. For the year beginning May, 16, 2016, we will begin recovering amounts under this cat bond as losses in the covered area for single occurrence, reaching additional attachment amount of $1.968 billion. The full $300 million coverage amount is available on a proportional basis until such covered losses reach a maximum $2.468 billion. 
And finally, our Northeast Gen Cat treaty renewed on July 1. This treaty provides up to $800 million, part of $850 million of coverage, subject to $2.25 billion retention. The certain losses arising from hurricanes, tornadoes, health storms, earthquakes, and winter storms or freeze losses from Virginia to main. A more complete description of our cat reinsurance coverage in pulling a description of earthquake and international coverage is included in our second quarter 10-Q, which we filed earlier today as well as in our 2015 10-K. 
While the total cost of these treaties is small, in relation to our operational income, we were able to save some money by not replacing the expiring cat bond. And with that, let me turn the microphone over to Brian."

In business and international insurance, we're pleased with the results this quarter. In domestic business insurance, we achieved a very strong retention along with the modest increase in renewal rate change versus the first quarter and highe",1194,"Thanks, Jay. In business and international insurance, we're pleased with the results this quarter. In domestic business insurance, we achieved a very strong retention along with the modest increase in renewal rate change versus the first quarter and higher levels of new business. Our strategy has not changed as we strive to retain our best-performing accounts, get rate where needed and right new business when it meets our target returns. 
It has been our strategy for some time. And as a result, will continue to be viewed by the stable and financially strong market by our distributors and customers. Along with the meaningful competitive advantages that we deliver, this consistent leadership position is resulting in additional growth opportunities for us. 
Turning to the financial results for the segment, operating income was $393 million with the combined ratio of $97.5 million. Cat losses for the quarter were $143 million net after-tax, which included $61 million from the Canadian wildfires. Excluding the Canadian fires, cat losses were slightly higher than the prior year quarter. The underlying combined ratio, which excludes the impact of cat in prior-year reserve development, was 95.5, up 2.4 points compared to the second quarter of 2015. The loss ratio increased by 1.7 points, driven primarily by non-cat weather, which was higher than prior year quarter and our expectation. The expense ratio was up 7 tenths of a point over last year, driven primarily by commissions as the second quarter of 2015 benefited from a one-time favorable adjustment. 
Net written premiums for the quarter were in line with the prior year quarter with domestic business insurance premiums, up about 2%. Given the returns that we are generating in this business, our focus continues to be on retention. And so, we were very pleased with that retention remains at 85% for the quarter, renewal premium change was just over 2 points, including renewal rate change that was slightly positive. New business of $525 million was up 10% versus the second quarter of 2015. 
Turning to the individual businesses within Business Insurance. Beginning with select, we achieved retention of 82% and renewal premium change of nearly 6%. Rate change was down slightly versus the first quarter of 2016, while exposure was in line with recent period and new business was up slightly year-over-year. In middle market, retention remained very strong at 87% with renewal premium change of about 0.51 in line with recent quarters. 
In terms of new business opportunities, given our leadership position in the market, submissions were up year-over-year. Accordingly, we had more opportunities to quote on the types and classes of business we find attractive and to grow our new business while maintaining our return thresholds. 
In Other Business Insurance, retention of 82% was up point year-over-year, while renewal premium change was 0.5. and new business of $154 million was consistent with the second quarter of 2015. As we've mentioned in the past, our business insurance includes our National Property Business. While there continues to be some rate pressure in this business, returns remain attractive, and as a result, retention is our priority. 
As you can see, on Page 13 of the webcast, excluding national property, renewal rate change or Other Business Insurance remain positive and was relatively consistent with recent quarters. In International, net written premiums for the second quarter were down about 12% quarter-over-quarter, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, net written premiums were down about 9%, driven by disciplined underwriting actions in our U.K. business, along with lower economic activity impacting the Marine and energy lines of our Lloyd's business. 
New business of $107 million was up 67% year-over-year, driven primarily by Optima, our new strategic Personal Lines Auto product in Canada, which was modeled after our U.S.-based Quantum Auto 2.0 product. So all in a good quarter for the segment with strong production and profitability. 
I'll turn now to Bond and Specialty Insurance where we had another terrific quarter. Operating income of $202 million was up significantly from the prior year quarter, driven by a higher level of net favorable prior year reserve development. The underlying combined ratio of 80.9% remains exceptionally strong. As for topline, net written premiums for the quarter were in line with the prior year, as growth in Management Liability was offset by lower Surety premium. The lower Surety volume was due almost entirely to favorable one-time reinsurance impacts in the prior year quarter. 
Across our Management Liability business, retention remained at historically high levels and new business volumes were up. As we continue to execute our strategy of retaining our best accounts, underwriting more business in our return adequate product segment. We continue to feel great about this segment's performance. 
In Personal Insurance, results were again strong and remain particularly pleased with our ability to add topline growth at appropriate financial returns. Net written premiums for the quarter, up $2.1 billion were an all-time high with double-digit growth in Agency Auto, while growth also accelerated in Agency Homeowners and other. In both products, we continue to produce strong retention and new business levels. Agent and consumer receptivity to Quantum Auto 2.0 remains exceptional and importantly, as significant amount of Quantum Auto 2.0 business are now coming through their renewal cycles. We're pleased with the retention rates we're seeing on those policies. 
In Homeowners, our growth momentum is building due to crossover benefits from Quantum Auto 2.0 as well as pricing changes and improvements to agent and customer experience. 
Turning to profitability, operating income for the segment was down compared to the prior year quarter, due primarily to lower net favorable prior-year reserve development. The underlying combined ratio of 89.5% was in line with our expectations, but up about point from the prior year, driven by the impact of the significant new business volume in recent years and normal quarterly volatility in weather and other loss activity. 
In Agency Auto, the 101.3 combined ratio included 2.7 points in cash, primarily resulting from hail storms. Weather also impacted the underwriting combined ratio with 1.7 points of non-GAAP weather-related losses, which is approximately 1 point higher than both our expectations and the second quarter of 2015. 
The remaining increase in the underlying combined ratio was driven by the high levels of new business that I just mentioned. As we've noted before, the Quantum Auto 2.0 business is price 2 to our long-term target returns and loss experiences for performing in-line with our expectations. 
Turning to Agency Homeowners and other, underlying financial results remain strong. The second quarter underlying combined ratio of 78.2% is well within our target return levels as we continue to execute our disciplined underwriting and pricing strategies. So overall, for Personal Insurance, we feel great about the growth in the financial return that the business in generating. 
Before I turn it back to Gabby, I would like to take a moment to recognize who and our retirement from Travelers' effective September 1 of this year. Over the past 30 years, Doreen has played an important role on our management team and we wish her well as she enjoy the new chapter of her life. With that, let me turn it over to Gabby."

Looks like, take them in order. So as far as workers comp, you're absolutely right, when you have a very long tail line of business, you look very, very carefully at things have happened in the short-term and don't necessarily area react to them. In the case of workers comp, what you're seeing here is favorable development in 2015 that related to relatively short component of it, relating to medical where medical bills coming quickly, they get resolved quickly. And the assumption that we had put in there for medical inflation was just too high. So while the line itself is a longtail line, there are components offered that are more short tail, and that's primarily lower and reacted to there. As far as the environmental piece is concerned, I think, if you look at us, as well as the industry, you'll see similar pattern, if you will. People trying to, at various points in time, estimate what the ultimate is going to be for Environmental losses. And recognizing that, you're dealing with something that is a very difficult kind of reserve to fully evaluate. So in doing so, you have to make various assumptions as to what the future is going to look like in terms of new claims, new policyholders, what the average frequency and severity might be associated with things that have been reported or not quarter. And it's those assumptions that you're constantly updating as time goes on. So what we disclosed, I point it to the 10-Q, what we disclosed this year is actually very similar to what we've disclosed in prior periods and what you've seen other companies disclosed that there really hasn't been a change in the environment, per se, things have gotten a little better, but the rate of them getting better has just been less -- previously assumed or hope for. And that's a chunk of the reserve addition. In addition to that, subject to judicial rulings or other things to take place episodically in various jurisdictions. And now there was 1 that came out of the northwest increased modestly, some of their claim cost there that we also recognized. And then finally, on the Bond and Specialty, this was a quarter for a fairly large prior year reserve development benefit. I wouldn't say there was anything unusual about it. This is, as you know, it's high severity, low-frequency business. It's 1 where information emerges slowly as it emerges, you're always evaluating whether or not it's blossomed to a level where you really feel action is appropriate. So there are things that had been taking place whether it's in items related to the financial crisis, whatever that we have been watching like things quarter point this quarter where we recognized that there was appropriate to take some reserve action. There wasn't any one product line, it wasn't anyone particular claim or things like that, it was pretty much spread across the whole Management Liability and Surety book of business."

And I'm just kind of curious, as you lap the elevated new business and you get rid of the lower non-cat weather, why would margins not be improving kind of as you look out in the 2017?"

So we feel great that we are building real embedded value in that portfolio. But it is going to take longer. The stronger the production topline is, the longer it is going to take for that to really to work through the loss ratio. The other point I'd make is, the Quantum 2.0 product also was designed to have a lower expense ratio and a little bit higher on loss side. So you have to look at the combined in total to get that product. So..."

One of the things we actually added to the queue this quarter was in the outlook section, we have previously spoken to underlying underwriting margins. So we thought it was important to add combined ratio, because people often use those terms interchangeably. And as you know, the combined ratio is assumption of the premium volume, whereas, the margins are just dollars. And just to clarify what we're saying here in the queue is, for Auto, it's I think what we're talking about, the early part of '17, the company expects underlying underwriting margins, the dollars to be slightly higher because of what's taking place with writing higher volumes of business, that's profitable. But writing higher percentage of new business relative to the base is also causing a slight uptick in the underlying combined ratio. So you have this feature here where the dollars are going up, at the same time, that the combined ratio is going up. So I just want to clarify that."

You have to really think about both components of what's going on here, right. So first, you need to think about a vintage and think about a book of business we're writing to given policy year, and that new business that we write in that term. That comes on at a higher loss ratio early, and then as we revenue, it improves. If you look at the production such as that we've been disclosing and the high levels of new business, what's happening inside the portfolio then, which is the second piece is on average, the portfolio is getting younger, right. And if younger business carries a higher loss ratio, that's what we described as the increase in the combined. So when you look at the outlook for the first half of -- I'm sorry, the second of '16, we see the combined ratio will be higher due to the impact of the higher new business we have been writing. That is the underlying dynamic that's flowing through the book. That does conclude the Mac in the first half of '17, it just gets offset by an expectation of return to normalized non-cat weather levels. And so, the underlying dynamic of the book getting younger, meaning less tenure, right, we've had the accounts not as long, continued into '17, recognize also though that as we write more Quantum Auto 2.0 business, there is a benefit for the combined ratio from an offsetting improvement in the expense ratio, because it carries a commission. So that underlying aging of the book or reducing average tenure of the book, does continue into '17. It just gets offset by again an expectation of return to more normalized weather, that's why the outlook attention, not an expectation."

If you look at this quarter, we made a bit more real estate than we figured real estate as 2 components, rentals from and NII from real estate funds. Hedge funds were below what we expected, but positive and the big variable was private equity, where the portfolio was almost flat maybe, a few million dollars. We would expect it about $50 million pretax. Now what's interesting is that cash flow from that portfolio has remained at historic levels. And we haven't contained as much NII in the past. So we still -- we would aim for a double-digit pretax return on these assets. And if we didn't feel, we could do that, we probably reduce our allocation.

This morning, we reported second quarter operating income of $649 million or $2.20 per share and an operating return on equity of 11.6%. Our underwriting results remain strong as reflected in our 93.1% combined ratio for the quarter, despite the impacts of higher catastrophe and non-cat weather-related losses year-over-year. 
For the 6 months, we reported operating income of $1.35 billion or $4.52 per share and an operating return on equity of 12%. Given the cumulative impact of years and years [ph] of declining interest rates on our investment portfolio and also relative to the fresh lows in the risk-free rate, we felt terrific about the returns we continue to generate. Our expertise in risk selection and pricing, our thoughtful and consistent investment strategy and our active approach to capital management all come together to enable us to achieve our objectives of delivering superior returns and creating shareholder value. 
Turning to production. The second quarter was another example of the successful execution of our marketplace strategies. We're very pleased with the record volume of premium that we wrote in the quarter. And we continue to be very pleased with the modeled returns in the business we're writing. 
In our commercial businesses, retentions remain high and renewal premium change was positive. Underneath that, consistent with our very granular approach to execution, in Middle Market, we retained 90% of the premium from our best-performing accounts, with only a modest decline in renewal rate change on that business. 
On our poor-performing accounts, we achieved renewal rate change in excess-of-loss trends. You might have noticed that renewal rate change in domestic business insurance was slightly positive as compared to slightly negative in the second quarter, and renewal rate change in Middle Market improved by a full point. We don't forecast rate and we're not calling a bottom, but the significance of this to us is that the market remains remarkably stable and we're generally successful in achieving our written return objectives. 
In terms of new business, we are actively seeking and finding opportunities that meet our return thresholds. And we delivered strong new business growth in our commercial businesses, including 10% growth in new business and domestic business insurance. 
In Personal Insurance, net written premiums grew 9% to a record of over $2.1 billion, with accelerating momentum in both Auto and Homeowners. New business was up 21% year-over-year, driven by the success of the Quantum product. Quantum Auto 2.0 continues to meet our financial expectations and is successfully enhancing our market position. Our success in the marketplace across all our businesses really speaks to the value of the talent that we have in the home office and in the field and their ability to leverage our data and analytics and work with our distribution partners to deliver great products and services at fair prices to our customers. Franchise value matters. 
Before turning the call over to Jay Benet, I'd like to acknowledge and thank all of our colleagues in the claim organization for their extraordinary efforts in handling the claims of our customers affected by severe weather and fire so far this year. These experts are on the frontline for us, delivering on the promise we extend with every policy that we write, and it has been a very active year so far for them. Their responsiveness and expertise are great for our customers and an important competitive advantage for us. 
In Canada, where we felt significant wildfires in the Fort McMurray area, both our customers and we benefited from the work we've done to replicate our U.S. claim model, which enables us to respond to large-scale events with our own highly trained professionals and resources without resorting to independent adjusters. So all in all, solid results for the quarter in the first half, particularly in light of the weather and wildfires, and continued excellent execution in the marketplace. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Jay Benet."
392856,311922501,1009772,"The Travelers Companies, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 21, 2016",2016-07-21,"Earnings Calls","The Travelers Companies, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Alan. As I did in the first quarter, I'd like to start by saying that we were pleased with our results, operating income of $649 million and operating return on equity of 11.6%, despite they're being lower than in the prior year quarter. These red",921,"Thanks, Alan. As I did in the first quarter, I'd like to start by saying that we were pleased with our results, operating income of $649 million and operating return on equity of 11.6%, despite they're being lower than in the prior year quarter. These reductions did not result from significant changes in underlying business trends. Notably, as indicated on Page 4 of the webcast, the quarter-over-quarter decrease in operating income was impacted by, among other things, PCS-cat events and lower fixed income, net investment income. 
Losses from PCS cat events have met or exceeded our threshold for recording its cats was $79 million higher after tax than in the prior year quarter. The losses from PCS cat events that fell below our cat thresholds, which we recorded as part of non-cat weather-related losses within underlying underwriting results, were $56 million higher after tax than in the prior year quarter. 
And fixed income NII was $21 million lower after tax, primarily due to the continuing low-interest-rate environment as we had anticipated in the Outlook section of our first quarter 2016 10-Q. Everything else was pretty much a wash. 
We continue to experience net favorable prior year reserve development, which totaled $288 million pretax or $192 million after tax this quarter, up from $207 million pretax or $133 million after tax in the prior year quarter. 
In Business and International Insurance, net favorable development of $138 million pretax or $94 million after tax, primarily resulted from better-than-expected loss in domestic Workers' Comp for accident years 2006 and prior and accident year 2015; better-than-expected loss experience in domestic general liability for accident years 2011 and 2015; and better-than-expected loss experience in our European operations, partially offset by an $82 million pretax or $53 million after-tax increase to environmental reserves. 
In Bond & Specialty Insurance, net favorable development of $150 million pretax or $98 million after tax, primarily resulted from better-than-expected loss experience; and fidelity and surety for accident years 2010, 2013 and 2014; and better-than-expected loss experience in GL for accident years 2007 through 2011. 
Year-to-date, on a combined stat basis for all of our U.S. subs, all accident years have developed favorably or had de minimis unfavorable development. In addition, other than commercial multi-peril, all product lines have developed favorably year-to-date. While CMP has developed unfavorably by $42 million year-to-date, you may recall, my telling you in the first quarter, that there was an offsetting favorable development in the property product line, as Middle Market property losses that had been recorded in the property line at year-end 2015 were subsequently determined to be CMP-related. 
Operating cash flows of $443 million were very strong, particularly recognizing that there were net of the $524 million payment we made this quarter as final settlement of the PPG Asbestos Litigation. We ended the quarter with holding company liquidity of $1.75 billion. And all of our capital ratios were at or better than their target levels. 
Net unrealized investment gains increased to approximately $3.6 billion pretax or $2.3 billion after tax, up from $2 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively, at the beginning of the year. While book value per share of $85.73 and adjusted book value per share of $77.61 increased 7% and 3%, respectively, also from the beginning of the year. 
We continue to generate much more capital than we need to support our business. And consistent with our ongoing capital management strategy, we returned $747 million of excess capital to our shareholders this quarter through dividends of $197 million and share repurchases of $550 million. Year-to-date, we returned over $1.5 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Before turning the microphone over to Brian, there's one additional topic I'd like to cover, our cat reinsurance coverage. 
In addition to our corporate cat --  corporate cat aggregate XOL treaty, which had renewed at the beginning of the year, our cat reinsurance includes cat bonds that are specific to the Northeast U.S. along with the Northeast Gen Cat treaty. 
With respect to the cat bonds, one, that had provided up to $300 million of coverage for certain losses, expired as scheduled in May 2016, and given our current risk profile, we decided not to replace them. With respect to the remaining cat bond, which will not expire until May 2018, the attachment point and maximum limit will reset as required annually to adjust the modeled expected loss off the layer within a predetermined range. For the year beginning May, 16, 2016, we will begin recovering amounts under this cat bond if losses in the covered area for single occurrence reach an additional attachment amount of $1.968 billion. The full $300 million coverage amount is available on a proportional basis until such covered losses reach a maximum $2.468 billion. 
And finally, our Northeast Gen Cat treaty was renewed on July 1. This treaty provides up to $800 million, part of $850 million of coverage, subject to a $2.25 billion retention for certain losses arising from hurricanes, tornadoes, hail storms, earthquakes and winter storms or freeze losses from Virginia to Maine. A more complete description of our cat reinsurance coverage, including a description of earthquake and international coverage, is included in our second quarter 10-Q, which we filed earlier today as well as in our 2015 10-K. 
While the total cost of these treaties is small, in relation to our operational income, we were able to save some money by not replacing the expiring cat bond. 
And with that, let me turn the microphone over to Brian."

In Business and International Insurance, we're pleased with the results this quarter. In domestic business insurance, we achieved very strong retention along with the modest increase in renewal rate change versus the first quarter and higher",1202,"Thanks, Jay. In Business and International Insurance, we're pleased with the results this quarter. In domestic business insurance, we achieved very strong retention along with the modest increase in renewal rate change versus the first quarter and higher levels of new business. Our strategy has not changed as we strive to retain our best-performing accounts, get write where needed and write new business when it meets our target returns. 
This has been our strategy for some time. And as a result, we continue to be viewed as a stable and financially strong market by our distributors and customers. Along with the meaningful competitive advantages that we deliver, this consistent leadership position is resulting in additional growth opportunities for us. 
Turning to the financial results for the segment, operating income was $393 million with a combined ratio of $97.5 million. Cat losses for the quarter were $143 million net after tax, which included $61 million from the Canadian wildfires. Excluding the Canadian fires, cat losses were slightly higher than the prior year quarter. The underlying combined ratio, which excludes the impact of cats in prior year reserve development, was 95.5%, up 2.4 points compared to the second quarter of 2015. The loss ratio increased by 1.7 points, driven primarily by non-cat weather, which was higher than both the prior year quarter and our expectation. The expense ratio was up 0.7 point over last year, driven primarily by commissions as the second quarter of 2015 benefited from a onetime favorable adjustment. 
Net written premiums for the quarter were in line with the prior year quarter, with domestic business insurance premiums up about 2%. Given the returns that we are generating in this business, our focus continues to be on retention. And so we were very pleased that retention remains at 85% for the quarter, renewal premium change was just over 2 points, including renewal rate change that was slightly positive. New business of $525 million was up 10% versus the second quarter of 2015. 
Turning to the individual businesses within Business Insurance. Beginning with Select, we achieved retention of 82% and renewal premium change of nearly 6%. Rate change was down slightly versus the first quarter of 2016, while exposure was in line with recent periods, and new business was up slightly year-over-year. In Middle Market, retention remained very strong at 87%, with renewal premium change of about 1.5 point in line with recent quarters. 
In terms of new business opportunities, given our leadership position in the market, submissions were up year-over-year. Accordingly, we had more opportunities to quote on the types and classes of business we find attractive and to grow our new business while maintaining our return thresholds. 
In Other Business Insurance, retention of 82% was up 1 point year-over-year, while renewal premium change was 0.5 point, and new business of $154 million was consistent with the second quarter of 2015. As we've mentioned in the past, Other Business Insurance includes our National Property business. While there continues to be some rate pressure in this business, returns remain attractive, and as a result, retention is our priority. 
As you can see on Page 13 of the webcast, excluding National Property, renewal rate change for Other Business Insurance remains positive and was relatively consistent with recent quarters. 
In International, net written premiums for the second quarter were down about 12% quarter-over-quarter, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, net written premiums were down about 9%, driven by disciplined underwriting actions in our U.K. business, along with lower economic activity impacting the marine and energy lines of our Lloyd's business. 
New business of $107 million was up 67% year-over-year, driven primarily by Optima, our new, strategic Personal Lines Auto product in Canada, which was modeled after our U.S.-based Quantum Auto 2.0 product. So all in a good quarter for the segment with strong production and profitability. 
I'll turn now to Bond and Specialty Insurance where we had another terrific quarter. Operating income of $202 million was up significantly from the prior year quarter, driven by a higher level of net favorable prior year reserve development. The underlying combined ratio of 80.9% remains exceptionally strong. As for top line, net written premiums for the quarter were in line with the prior year, as growth in Management Liability was offset by lower Surety premium. The lower Surety volume was due almost entirely to favorable one-time reinsurance impacts in the prior year quarter. 
Across our Management Liability business, retention remained at historically high levels, and new business volumes were up. As we continue to execute our strategy of retaining our best accounts and writing more business in our return adequate product segment. We continue to feel great about this segment's performance. 
In Personal Insurance, results were again strong and remain particularly pleased with our ability to add top line growth at appropriate financial returns. Net written premiums for the quarter, up $2.1 billion, were an all-time high, with double-digit growth in Agency Auto, while growth also accelerated in Agency Homeowners and Other. In both products, we continue to produce strong retention and new business levels. Agent and consumer receptivity to Quantum Auto 2.0 remains exceptional and importantly, as significant amounts of Quantum Auto 2.0 business are now coming through their renewal cycles, we're pleased with the retention rates we're seeing on those policies. 
In Homeowners, our growth momentum is building, due to crossover benefits from Quantum Auto 2.0 as well as pricing changes and improvements to agent and customer experience. 
Turning to profitability. Operating income for the segment was down compared to the prior year quarter, due primarily to lower net favorable prior year reserve development. The underlying combined ratio of 89.5% was in line with our expectations, but up about 1 point from the prior year, driven by the impact of the significant new business volume in recent years and normal quarterly volatility in weather and other loss activity. 
In Agency Auto, the 101.3 combined ratio included 2.7 points in cats, primarily resulting from hail storms. Weather also impacted the underwriting combined ratio, with 1.7 points of non-cat weather-related losses, which is approximately 1 point higher than both our expectations and the second quarter of 2015. 
The remaining increase in the underlying combined ratio was driven by the high levels of new business that I just mentioned. As we've noted before, the Quantum Auto 2.0 business is priced to our long-term target returns and loss experiences performing in line with our expectations. 
Turning to Agency Homeowners & Other, underlying financial results remain strong. The second quarter underlying combined ratio of 78.2% is well within our target return levels as we continue to execute our disciplined underwriting and pricing strategies. So overall, for Personal Insurance, we feel great about the growth in the financial returns that the business is generating. 
Before I turn it back to Gabby, I would like to take a moment to recognize Doreen Spadorcia who announced her retirement from Travelers' effective September 1 of this year. Over the past 30 years, Doreen has played an important role on our management team, and we wish her well as she enjoys a new chapter of her life. 
With that, let me turn it over to Gabby."

There is a relatively small piece of earned rate versus loss trend coming through. And one of the reasons we showed you Page 4 in the webcast was to try to put that in a little bit of context. So really what's impacting year-over-year is the weather. You get -- as we said before, we've tried to make clear that rate and loss trend is one small piece of what goes on, but there's also taxes, expenses, day share, mix, the impact of changes in claims handling, things like that.

This is Jay Benet. What's -- let's try to take them in order. So as far as the workers' comp, you're absolutely right, when you have a very long tail line of business, you look very, very carefully at things that happen in the short term and don't necessarily react to them. In the case of workers' comp, what you're seeing here is favorable development in 2015 that related to a relatively short component of it, relating to medical where medical bills come in quickly, they get resolved quickly. And the assumption that we had put in there for medical inflation was just too high. So while the line itself is a long-tail line, there are components of it that are more short tail, and that's primarily what we reacted to there. As far as the environmental piece is concerned, I think if you look at us as well as the industry, you'll see a similar pattern, if you will. People trying to, at various points in time, estimate what the ultimate is going to be for Environmental losses. And recognizing that, you're dealing with something that is a very difficult kind of reserve to truly evaluate. So in doing so, you have to make various assumptions as to what the future is going to look like in terms of new claims, new policyholders, what the average frequency and severity might be associated with things that have been reported or not reported. And it's those assumptions that you're constantly updating as time goes on. So what we disclosed -- and I'll point you to the 10-Q. What we disclosed this year is actually very similar to what we've disclosed in prior periods and what you've seen other companies disclosed that there really hasn't been a change in the environment, per se. Things have gotten a little better, but the rate of them getting better has just been less than what was previously assumed or hope for. And that's a chunk of the reserve addition. In addition to that, we're always subject to judicial rulings or other things that take place episodically in various jurisdictions. And yes, there was one that came out of the northwest that they have increased modestly some of our claim costs there that we also recognized. And then finally, on the Bond and Specialty, this was a quarter for a fairly large prior year reserve development benefit. I wouldn't say there was anything unusual about it. This is, as you know, it's a high severity, low-frequency business. It's one where information emerges slowly. As it emerges, you're always evaluating whether or not it's blossomed to a level where you really feel action is appropriate. So there are things that have been taking place whether it's in items related to the financial crisis or whatever that we've been watching but things got to a point this quarter where we recognized that it was appropriate to take some reserve action. It wasn't any one product line, it wasn't any one particular claim or things like that, it was pretty much spread across the whole Management Liability and Surety book of business."

But I think -- we think more broadly, has also created a little bit of a mood in the marketplace of flight to quality. So like I said, we've seen our submission activity up a decent amount. And we've also, consistent with that, been driving a message to our organization, not strategically to do anything different with returns but to be more active. And to be out there quoting more.

One of the things we actually added to the Q this quarter was, in the Outlook section, we have previously spoken to underlying underwriting margins. So we thought it was important to add combined ratio because people often use those terms interchangeably. And as you know, the combined ratio is a function of the premium volume, whereas, the margins are just dollars. And just to clarify what we're saying here in the Q is, for Auto, so I think is what we're talking about, the early part of '17, the company expects underlying underwriting margins, the dollars to be slightly higher because of what's taking place with writing higher volumes of business that's profitable. But writing a higher percentage of new business relative to the base is also causing a slight uptick in the underlying combined ratio.

And it has been moving in that direction for some number of quarters. So as anybody, as we would've expected, as that earns in over time, there will be some negative pressure on margins. But what we've said in the past is you've got to look at that in the context of all the other moving pieces that impact underlying underwriting margin, things like we have a tax impact year-over-year this quarter, there's expenses, there's day shares, there's mix, all those other things going to that number. And what we've shown you this quarter is all of that comes out to about a wash. And I guess, I'd also point you to the outlook where we can give you a sense of over the next four quarters or so that we would expect the underlying underwriting margins obviously subject to the volatility of weather and whatnot to continue to be broadly consistent."

So first, you need to think about a vintage and think about a book of business we're writing to a given policy year and that new business that we write in that term. That comes on at a higher loss ratio early, and then as we renew it, it improves. If you look at the production statistics that we've been disclosing and the high levels of new business, what's happening inside the portfolio then, which is the second piece is, on average, the portfolio is getting younger, right? And if younger business carries a higher loss ratio, that's what we describe as the increase in the combined. So when you look at the outlook for the first half of -- or, I'm sorry, the second half of '16, we'd say the combined ratio will be higher due to the impact of the higher new business levels we've been writing. That is the underlying dynamic that's flowing through the book. That does continue into the first half of '17, it just gets offset by an expectation of return to normalized non-cat weather levels. And so the -- to the underlying dynamic of the book getting younger, meaning less tenured, right, we've had the accounts not as long, continued into '17, recognize also though that as we write more Quantum Auto 2.0 business, there is a benefit to the combined ratio from an offsetting improvement in the expense ratio because it carries a commission. So that underlying aging of the book or reducing average tenure of the book does continue into '17. It just gets offset by, again, an expectation of return to more normalized weather. That's why the outlook reads the way it does."

I think an expected return for non-safety income ought to be in the high single digits pretax. If you look at this quarter, we made a bit more real estate than we figured real estate as 2 components, rentals from properties we own and NII from real estate funds. Hedge funds were below what we expected but positive, and the big variable was private equity, where the portfolio was almost flat maybe a few million dollars. And we would have expected about $50 million pretax. Now what's interesting is the cash flow from that portfolio has remained at historic levels. And except we haven't contained as much NII in the past. So we still -- we would aim for a double-digit pretax return on these assets. And if we didn't feel we could do that, we probably reduce our allocation. But I think a fair expectation is high single-digit pretax."

This morning, we reported second quarter operating income of $649 million or $2.20 per share and an operating return on equity of 11.6%. Our underwriting results remain strong as reflected in our 93.1% combined ratio for the quarter, despite the impacts of higher catastrophe and non-cat weather-related losses year-over-year. 
For the 6 months, we reported operating income of $1.35 billion or $4.52 per share and an operating return on equity of 12%. Given the cumulative impact of 8 or so [ph] years [ph] of declining interest rates on our investment portfolio and also relative to the fresh lows in the risk-free rate, we feel terrific about the returns we continue to generate. Our expertise in risk selection and pricing, our thoughtful and consistent investment strategy and our active approach to capital management all come together to enable us to achieve our objectives of delivering superior returns and creating shareholder value. 
Turning to production. The second quarter was another example of the successful execution of our marketplace strategies. We're very pleased with the record volume of premium that we wrote in the quarter. And we continue to be very pleased with the modeled returns in the business we're writing. 
In our commercial businesses, retentions remain high and renewal premium change was positive. Underneath that, consistent with our very granular approach to execution, in Middle Market, we retained 90% of the premium from our best-performing accounts, with only a modest decline in renewal rate change on that business. 
On our poor-performing accounts, we achieved renewal rate change in excess-of-loss trends. You might have noticed that renewal rate change in domestic business insurance was slightly positive as compared to slightly negative in the first quarter, and renewal rate change in Middle Market improved by a full point. We don't forecast rate and we're not calling a bottom, but the significance of this to us is that the market remains remarkably stable and we're generally successful in achieving our written return objectives. 
In terms of new business, we are actively seeking and finding opportunities that meet our return thresholds. And we delivered strong new business growth in our commercial businesses, including 10% growth in new business and domestic business insurance. 
In Personal Insurance, net written premiums grew 9% to a record of over $2.1 billion, with accelerating momentum in both Auto and Homeowners. New business was up 21% year-over-year, driven by the success of the Quantum product. Quantum Auto 2.0 continues to meet our financial expectations and is successfully enhancing our market position. Our success in the marketplace across all our businesses really speaks to the value of the talent that we have in the home office and in the field and their ability to leverage our data and analytics and work with our distribution partners to deliver great products and services at fair prices to our customers. Franchise value matters. 
Before turning the call over to Jay Benet, I'd like to acknowledge and thank all of our colleagues in the claim organization for their extraordinary efforts in handling the claims of our customers affected by severe weather and fire so far this year. These experts are on the frontline for us, delivering on the promise we extend with every policy that we write, and it has been a very active year so far for them. Their responsiveness and expertise are great for our customers and an important competitive advantage for us. 
In Canada, where we saw significant wildfires in the Fort McMurray area, both our customers and we benefited from the work we've done to replicate our U.S. claim model, which enables us to respond to large-scale events with our own highly trained professionals and resources without resorting to independent adjusters. So all in all, solid results for the quarter in the first half, particularly in light of the weather and wildfires, and continued excellent execution in the marketplace. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Jay Benet."

As I did in the first quarter, I'd like to start by saying that we were pleased with our results, operating income of $649 million and operating return on equity of 11.6%, despite they're being lower than in the prior year quarter. These red",921,"Thanks, Alan. As I did in the first quarter, I'd like to start by saying that we were pleased with our results, operating income of $649 million and operating return on equity of 11.6%, despite they're being lower than in the prior year quarter. These reductions did not result from significant changes in underlying business trends. Notably, as indicated on Page 4 of the webcast, the quarter-over-quarter decrease in operating income was impacted by, among other things, PCS-cat events and lower fixed income, net investment income. 
Losses from PCS cat events have met or exceeded our threshold for recording as cats was $79 million higher after tax than in the prior year quarter. The losses from PCS cat events that fell below our cat thresholds, which we recorded as part of non-cat weather-related losses within underlying underwriting results, were $56 million higher after tax than in the prior year quarter. 
And fixed income NII was $21 million lower after tax, primarily due to the continuing low-interest-rate environment as we had anticipated in the Outlook section of our first quarter 2016 10-Q. Everything else was pretty much a wash. 
We continue to experience net favorable prior year reserve development, which totaled $288 million pretax or $192 million after tax this quarter, up from $207 million pretax or $133 million after tax in the prior year quarter. 
In Business and International Insurance, net favorable development of $138 million pretax or $94 million after tax, primarily resulted from better-than-expected loss in domestic Workers' Comp for accident years 2006 and prior and accident year 2015; better-than-expected loss experience in domestic general liability for accident years 2011 and 2015; and better-than-expected loss experience in our European operations, partially offset by an $82 million pretax or $53 million after-tax increase to environmental reserves. 
In Bond & Specialty Insurance, net favorable development of $150 million pretax or $98 million after tax, primarily resulted from better-than-expected loss experience; and fidelity and surety for accident years 2010, 2013 and 2014; and better-than-expected loss experience in GL for accident years 2007 through 2011. 
Year-to-date, on a combined stat basis for all of our U.S. subs, all accident years have developed favorably or had de minimis unfavorable development. In addition, other than commercial multi-peril, all product lines have developed favorably year-to-date. While CMP has developed unfavorably by $42 million year-to-date, you may recall, my telling you in the first quarter, that there was an offsetting favorable development in the property product line, as Middle Market property losses that had been recorded in the property line at year-end 2015 were subsequently determined to be CMP-related. 
Operating cash flows of $443 million were very strong, particularly recognizing that they were net of the $524 million payment we made this quarter as final settlement of the PPG Asbestos Litigation. We ended the quarter with holding company liquidity of $1.75 billion. And all of our capital ratios were at or better than their target levels. 
Net unrealized investment gains increased to approximately $3.6 billion pretax or $2.3 billion after tax, up from $2 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively, at the beginning of the year. While book value per share of $85.73 and adjusted book value per share of $77.61 increased 7% and 3%, respectively, also from the beginning of the year. 
We continue to generate much more capital than we need to support our business. And consistent with our ongoing capital management strategy, we returned $747 million of excess capital to our shareholders this quarter through dividends of $197 million and share repurchases of $550 million. Year-to-date, we returned over $1.5 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Before turning the microphone over to Brian, there's one additional topic I'd like to cover, our cat reinsurance coverage. 
In addition to our corporate cat --  corporate cat aggregate XOL treaty, which had renewed at the beginning of the year, our cat reinsurance includes cat bonds that are specific to the Northeast U.S. along with the Northeast Gen Cat treaty. 
With respect to the cat bonds, one, that had provided up to $300 million of coverage for certain losses, expired as scheduled in May 2016, and given our current risk profile, we decided not to replace them. With respect to the remaining cat bond, which will not expire until May 2018, the attachment point and maximum limit will reset as required annually to adjust the modeled expected loss of the layer within a predetermined range. For the year beginning May, 16, 2016, we will begin recovering amounts under this cat bond if losses in the covered area for single occurrence reach an additional attachment amount of $1.968 billion. The full $300 million coverage amount is available on a proportional basis until such covered losses reach a maximum $2.468 billion. 
And finally, our Northeast Gen Cat treaty was renewed on July 1. This treaty provides up to $800 million, part of $850 million of coverage, subject to a $2.25 billion retention for certain losses arising from hurricanes, tornadoes, hail storms, earthquakes and winter storms or freeze losses from Virginia to Maine. A more complete description of our cat reinsurance coverage, including a description of earthquake and international coverage, is included in our second quarter 10-Q, which we filed earlier today as well as in our 2015 10-K. 
While the total cost of these treaties is small, in relation to our operating income, we were able to save some money by not replacing the expiring cat bond. 
And with that, let me turn the microphone over to Brian."

In Business and International Insurance, we're pleased with the results this quarter. In domestic business insurance, we achieved very strong retention along with the modest increase in renewal rate change versus the first quarter and higher",1203,"Thanks, Jay. In Business and International Insurance, we're pleased with the results this quarter. In domestic business insurance, we achieved very strong retention along with the modest increase in renewal rate change versus the first quarter and higher levels of new business. Our strategy has not changed as we strive to retain our best-performing accounts, get write [ph] where needed and write new business when it meets our target returns. 
This has been our strategy for some time. And as a result, we continue to be viewed as a stable and financially strong market by our distributors and customers. Along with the meaningful competitive advantages that we deliver, this consistent leadership position is resulting in additional growth opportunities for us. 
Turning to the financial results for the segment, operating income was $393 million with a combined ratio of $97.5 million. Cat losses for the quarter were $143 million net after tax, which included $61 million from the Canadian wildfires. Excluding the Canadian fires, cat losses were slightly higher than the prior year quarter. The underlying combined ratio, which excludes the impact of cats in prior year reserve development, was 95.5%, up 2.4 points compared to the second quarter of 2015. The loss ratio increased by 1.7 points, driven primarily by non-cat weather, which was higher than both the prior year quarter and our expectation. The expense ratio was up 0.7 point over last year, driven primarily by commissions as the second quarter of 2015 benefited from a onetime favorable adjustment. 
Net written premiums for the quarter were in line with the prior year quarter, with domestic business insurance premiums up about 2%. Given the returns that we are generating in this business, our focus continues to be on retention. And so we were very pleased that retention remains at 85% for the quarter, renewal premium change was just over 2 points, including renewal rate change that was slightly positive. New business of $525 million was up 10% versus the second quarter of 2015. 
Turning to the individual businesses within Business Insurance. Beginning with Select, we achieved retention of 82% and renewal premium change of nearly 6%. Rate change was down slightly versus the first quarter of 2016, while exposure was in line with recent periods, and new business was up slightly year-over-year. In Middle Market, retention remained very strong at 87%, with renewal premium change of about 1.5 point in line with recent quarters. 
In terms of new business opportunities, given our leadership position in the market, submissions were up year-over-year. Accordingly, we had more opportunities to quote on the types and classes of business we find attractive and to grow our new business while maintaining our return thresholds. 
In Other Business Insurance, retention of 82% was up 1 point year-over-year, while renewal premium change was 0.5 point, and new business of $154 million was consistent with the second quarter of 2015. As we've mentioned in the past, Other Business Insurance includes our National Property business. While there continues to be some rate pressure in this business, returns remain attractive, and as a result, retention is our priority. 
As you can see on Page 13 of the webcast, excluding National Property, renewal rate change for Other Business Insurance remains positive and was relatively consistent with recent quarters. 
In International, net written premiums for the second quarter were down about 12% quarter-over-quarter, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, net written premiums were down about 9%, driven by disciplined underwriting actions in our U.K. business, along with lower economic activity impacting the marine and energy lines of our Lloyd's business. 
New business of $107 million was up 67% year-over-year, driven primarily by Optima, our new, strategic Personal Lines Auto product in Canada, which was modeled after our U.S.-based Quantum Auto 2.0 product. So all in a good quarter for the segment with strong production and profitability. 
I'll turn now to Bond and Specialty Insurance where we had another terrific quarter. Operating income of $202 million was up significantly from the prior year quarter, driven by a higher level of net favorable prior year reserve development. The underlying combined ratio of 80.9% remains exceptionally strong. As for top line, net written premiums for the quarter were in line with the prior year, as growth in Management Liability was offset by lower Surety premium. The lower Surety volume was due almost entirely to favorable one-time reinsurance impacts in the prior year quarter. 
Across our Management Liability business, retention remained at historically high levels, and new business volumes were up. As we continue to execute our strategy of retaining our best accounts and writing more business in our return adequate product segment. We continue to feel great about this segment's performance. 
In Personal Insurance, results were again strong and remain particularly pleased with our ability to add top line growth at appropriate financial returns. Net written premiums for the quarter, up $2.1 billion, were an all-time high, with double-digit growth in Agency Auto, while growth also accelerated in Agency Homeowners and Other. In both products, we continue to produce strong retention and new business levels. Agent and consumer receptivity to Quantum Auto 2.0 remains exceptional and importantly, as significant amounts of Quantum Auto 2.0 business are now coming through their renewal cycles, we're pleased with the retention rates we're seeing on those policies. 
In Homeowners, our growth momentum is building, due to crossover benefits from Quantum Auto 2.0 as well as pricing changes and improvements to agent and customer experience. 
Turning to profitability. Operating income for the segment was down compared to the prior year quarter, due primarily to lower net favorable prior year reserve development. The underlying combined ratio of 89.5% was in line with our expectations, but up about 1 point from the prior year, driven by the impact of the significant new business volume in recent years and normal quarterly volatility in weather and other loss activity. 
In Agency Auto, the 101.3 combined ratio included 2.7 points in cats, primarily resulting from hail storms. Weather also impacted the underwriting combined ratio, with 1.7 points of non-cat weather-related losses, which is approximately 1 point higher than both our expectations and the second quarter of 2015. 
The remaining increase in the underlying combined ratio was driven by the high levels of new business that I just mentioned. As we've noted before, the Quantum Auto 2.0 business is priced to our long-term target returns and loss experiences performing in line with our expectations. 
Turning to Agency Homeowners & Other, underlying financial results remain strong. The second quarter underlying combined ratio of 78.2% is well within our target return levels as we continue to execute our disciplined underwriting and pricing strategies. So overall, for Personal Insurance, we feel great about the growth and the financial returns that the business is generating. 
Before I turn it back to Gabby, I would like to take a moment to recognize Doreen Spadorcia who announced her retirement from Travelers' effective September 1 of this year. Over the past 30 years, Doreen has played an important role on our management team, and we wish her well as she enjoys a new chapter of her life. 
With that, let me turn it over to Gabby."

So really what's impacting year-over-year is the weather.

This is Jay Benet. What's -- let's try to take them in order. So as far as the workers' comp, you're absolutely right, when you have a very long tail line of business, you look very, very carefully at things that happen in the short term and don't necessarily react to them. In the case of workers' comp, what you're seeing here is favorable development in 2015 that related to a relatively short component of it, relating to medical where medical bills come in quickly, they get resolved quickly. And the assumption that we had put in there for medical inflation was just too high. So while the line itself is a long-tail line, there are components of it that are more short tail, and that's primarily what we reacted to there. As far as the environmental piece is concerned, I think if you look at us as well as the industry, you'll see a similar pattern, if you will. People trying to, at various points in time, estimate what the ultimate is going to be for Environmental losses. And recognizing that you're dealing with something that is a very difficult kind of reserve to truly evaluate. So in doing so, you have to make various assumptions as to what the future is going to look like in terms of new claims, new policyholders, what the average frequency and severity might be associated with things that have been reported or not reported. And it's those assumptions that you're constantly updating as time goes on. So what we disclosed -- and I'll point you to the 10-Q. What we disclosed this year is actually very similar to what we've disclosed in prior periods and what you've seen other companies disclose that there really hasn't been a change in the environment, per se. Things have gotten a little better, but the rate of them getting better has just been less than what was previously assumed or hoped for. And that's a chunk of the reserve addition. In addition to that, we're always subject to judicial rulings or other things that take place episodically in various jurisdictions. And yes, there was one that came out of the northwest that increased modestly some of our claim costs there that we also recognized. And then finally, on the Bond and Specialty, this was a quarter for a fairly large prior year reserve development benefit. I wouldn't say there was anything unusual about it. This is, as you know, it's a high severity, low-frequency business. It's one where information emerges slowly. As it emerges, you're always evaluating whether or not it's blossomed to a level where you really feel action is appropriate. So there are things that have been taking place whether it's in items related to the financial crisis or whatever that we've been watching but things got to a point this quarter where we recognized that it was appropriate to take some reserve action. It wasn't any one product line, it wasn't any one particular claim or things like that, it was pretty much spread across the whole Management Liability and Surety book of business."

But I think -- we think more broadly, has also created a little bit of a mood in the marketplace of flight to quality. So like I said, we've seen our submission activity up a decent amount. And we've also, consistent with that, been driving a message to our organization, not strategically to do anything different with returns but to be more active. And to be out there quoting more.

One of the things we actually added to the Q this quarter was, in the Outlook section, we have previously spoken to underlying underwriting margins. So we thought it was important to add combined ratio because people often use those terms interchangeably. And as you know, the combined ratio is a function of the premium volume, whereas, the margins are just dollars. And just to clarify what we're saying here in the Q is, for Auto, which I think is what we're talking about, for the early part of '17, the company expects underlying underwriting margins, the dollars, to be slightly higher because of what's taking place with writing higher volumes of business that's profitable. But writing a higher percentage of new business relative to the base is also causing a slight uptick in the underlying combined ratio. So you have this feature here where the dollars are going up at the same time that the combined ratio is going up. So I just want to clarify that."

But the long-term return targets for the product will remain consistent with where they've been."

And obviously, anybody could look at rate which is sort of around 0 and loss trend, which is something north of 0, on a written basis. And it has been moving in that direction for some number of quarters. So as anybody, as we would've expected, as that earns in over time, there will be some negative pressure on margins. But what we've said in the past is you've got to look at that in the context of all the other moving pieces that impact underlying underwriting margin, things like we have a tax impact year-over-year this quarter, there's expenses, there's day [ph] shares, there's mix, all those other things going to that number. And what we've shown you this quarter is all of that comes out to about a wash. And I guess, I'd also point you to the outlook where we can give you a sense of over the next four quarters or so that we would expect the underlying underwriting margins obviously subject to the volatility of weather and whatnot to continue to be broadly consistent."

We're managing our mix, we're taking actions in underwriting selection, we're taking actions in claim execution, which are all impacting our loss trend. And then we're reacting to weather volatility, et cetera, that might be moving through the business.

From the profitability perspective, just as it's true of all business that we've ever written in this product, it matures over the years. And so there's a tenure impact. And as Michael just said, the younger-tenured business is typically not as profitable as we write the business where we're targeting a tenured, longer-term return and we're on track to do that.

So first, you need to think about a vintage and think about a book of business we're writing to a given policy year and that new business that we write in that term. That comes on at a higher loss ratio early, and then as we renew it, it improves. If you look at the production statistics that we've been disclosing and the high levels of new business, what's happening inside the portfolio then, which is the second piece is, on average, the portfolio is getting younger, right? And if younger business carries a higher loss ratio, that's what we describe as the increase in the combined. So when you look at the outlook for the first half of -- or, I'm sorry, the second half of '16, we'd say the combined ratio will be higher due to the impact of the higher new business levels we've been writing. That is the underlying dynamic that's flowing through the book. That does continue into the first half of '17, it just gets offset by an expectation of return to normalized non-cat weather levels. And so the -- to the underlying dynamic of the book getting younger, meaning less tenured, right, we've had the accounts not as long, continued into '17, recognize also though that as we write more Quantum Auto 2.0 business, there is a benefit to the combined ratio from an offsetting improvement in the expense ratio because it carries a commission. So that underlying aging of the book or reducing average tenure of the book does continue into '17. It just gets offset by, again, an expectation of return to more normalized weather. That's why the outlook reads the way it does."

And we'll just pick the numbers in the particular quarter that we're doing the share buyback. So for a longer-term view to say, in this particular quarter, 550 sounds like the right number.

This morning, we reported second quarter operating income of $649 million or $2.20 per share and an operating return on equity of 11.6%. Our underwriting results remain strong as reflected in our 93.1% combined ratio for the quarter, despite the impacts of higher catastrophe and non-cat weather-related losses year-over-year. 
For the 6 months, we reported operating income of $1.35 billion or $4.52 per share and an operating return on equity of 12%. Given the cumulative impact of 8 or so [ph] years [ph] of declining interest rates on our investment portfolio and also relative to the fresh lows in the risk-free rate, we feel terrific about the returns we continue to generate. Our expertise in risk selection and pricing, our thoughtful and consistent investment strategy and our active approach to capital management all come together to enable us to achieve our objectives of delivering superior returns and creating shareholder value. 
Turning to production. The second quarter was another example of the successful execution of our marketplace strategies. We're very pleased with the record volume of premium that we wrote in the quarter. And we continue to be very pleased with the modeled returns in the business we're writing. 
In our commercial businesses, retentions remain high and renewal premium change was positive. Underneath that, consistent with our very granular approach to execution, in Middle Market, we retained 90% of the premium from our best-performing accounts, with only a modest decline in renewal rate change on that business. 
On our poor-performing accounts, we achieved renewal rate change in excess-of-loss trends. You might have noticed that renewal rate change in domestic business insurance was slightly positive as compared to slightly negative in the first quarter, and renewal rate change in Middle Market improved by a full point. We don't forecast rate and we're not calling a bottom, but the significance of this to us is that the market remains remarkably stable and we're generally successful in achieving our written return objectives. 
In terms of new business, we are actively seeking and finding opportunities that meet our return thresholds. And we delivered strong new business growth in our commercial businesses, including 10% growth in new business and domestic business insurance. 
In Personal Insurance, net written premiums grew 9% to a record of over $2.1 billion, with accelerating momentum in both Auto and Homeowners. New business was up 21% year-over-year, driven by the success of the Quantum product. Quantum Auto 2.0 continues to meet our financial expectations and is successfully enhancing our market position. Our success in the marketplace across all our businesses really speaks to the value of the talent that we have in the home office and in the field and their ability to leverage our data and analytics and work with our distribution partners to deliver great products and services at fair prices to our customers. Franchise value matters. 
Before turning the call over to Jay Benet, I'd like to acknowledge and thank all of our colleagues in the claim organization for their extraordinary efforts in handling the claims of our customers affected by severe weather and fire so far this year. These experts are on the frontline for us, delivering on the promise we extend with every policy that we write, and it has been a very active year so far for them. Their responsiveness and expertise are great for our customers and an important competitive advantage for us. 
In Canada, where we saw significant wildfires in the Fort McMurray area, both our customers and we benefited from the work we've done to replicate our U.S. claim model, which enables us to respond to large-scale events with our own highly trained professionals and resources without resorting to independent adjusters. So all in all, solid results for the quarter in the first half, particularly in light of the weather and wildfires, and continued excellent execution in the marketplace. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Jay Benet."
392856,311922501,1010284,"The Travelers Companies, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 21, 2016",2016-07-21,"Earnings Calls","The Travelers Companies, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Alan. As I did in the first quarter, I'd like to start by saying that we were pleased with our results, operating income of $649 million and operating return on equity of 11.6%, despite they're being lower than in the prior year quarter. These red",921,"Thanks, Alan. As I did in the first quarter, I'd like to start by saying that we were pleased with our results, operating income of $649 million and operating return on equity of 11.6%, despite they're being lower than in the prior year quarter. These reductions did not result from significant changes in underlying business trends. Notably, as indicated on Page 4 of the webcast, the quarter-over-quarter decrease in operating income was impacted by, among other things, PCS-cat events and lower fixed income, net investment income. 
Losses from PCS cat events have met or exceeded our threshold for recording as cats was $79 million higher after tax than in the prior year quarter. The losses from PCS cat events that fell below our cat thresholds, which we recorded as part of non-cat weather-related losses within underlying underwriting results, were $56 million higher after tax than in the prior year quarter. 
And fixed income NII was $21 million lower after tax, primarily due to the continuing low-interest-rate environment as we had anticipated in the Outlook section of our first quarter 2016 10-Q. Everything else was pretty much a wash. 
We continue to experience net favorable prior year reserve development, which totaled $288 million pretax or $192 million after tax this quarter, up from $207 million pretax or $133 million after tax in the prior year quarter. 
In Business and International Insurance, net favorable development of $138 million pretax or $94 million after tax, primarily resulted from better-than-expected loss in domestic Workers' Comp for accident years 2006 and prior and accident year 2015; better-than-expected loss experience in domestic general liability for accident years 2011 and 2015; and better-than-expected loss experience in our European operations, partially offset by an $82 million pretax or $53 million after-tax increase to environmental reserves. 
In Bond & Specialty Insurance, net favorable development of $150 million pretax or $98 million after tax, primarily resulted from better-than-expected loss experience; and fidelity and surety for accident years 2010, 2013 and 2014; and better-than-expected loss experience in GL for accident years 2007 through 2011. 
Year-to-date, on a combined stat basis for all of our U.S. subs, all accident years have developed favorably or had de minimis unfavorable development. In addition, other than commercial multi-peril, all product lines have developed favorably year-to-date. While CMP has developed unfavorably by $42 million year-to-date, you may recall, my telling you in the first quarter, that there was an offsetting favorable development in the property product line, as Middle Market property losses that had been recorded in the property line at year-end 2015 were subsequently determined to be CMP-related. 
Operating cash flows of $443 million were very strong, particularly recognizing that they were net of the $524 million payment we made this quarter as final settlement of the PPG Asbestos Litigation. We ended the quarter with holding company liquidity of $1.75 billion. And all of our capital ratios were at or better than their target levels. 
Net unrealized investment gains increased to approximately $3.6 billion pretax or $2.3 billion after tax, up from $2 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively, at the beginning of the year. While book value per share of $85.73 and adjusted book value per share of $77.61 increased 7% and 3%, respectively, also from the beginning of the year. 
We continue to generate much more capital than we need to support our business. And consistent with our ongoing capital management strategy, we returned $747 million of excess capital to our shareholders this quarter through dividends of $197 million and share repurchases of $550 million. Year-to-date, we returned over $1.5 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Before turning the microphone over to Brian, there's one additional topic I'd like to cover, our cat reinsurance coverage. 
In addition to our corporate cat --  corporate cat aggregate XOL treaty, which had renewed at the beginning of the year, our cat reinsurance includes cat bonds that are specific to the Northeast U.S. along with the Northeast Gen Cat treaty. 
With respect to the cat bonds, one, that had provided up to $300 million of coverage for certain losses, expired as scheduled in May 2016, and given our current risk profile, we decided not to replace them. With respect to the remaining cat bond, which will not expire until May 2018, the attachment point and maximum limit will reset as required annually to adjust the modeled expected loss of the layer within a predetermined range. For the year beginning May, 16, 2016, we will begin recovering amounts under this cat bond if losses in the covered area for single occurrence reach an additional attachment amount of $1.968 billion. The full $300 million coverage amount is available on a proportional basis until such covered losses reach a maximum $2.468 billion. 
And finally, our Northeast Gen Cat treaty was renewed on July 1. This treaty provides up to $800 million, part of $850 million of coverage, subject to a $2.25 billion retention for certain losses arising from hurricanes, tornadoes, hail storms, earthquakes and winter storms or freeze losses from Virginia to Maine. A more complete description of our cat reinsurance coverage, including a description of earthquake and international coverage, is included in our second quarter 10-Q, which we filed earlier today as well as in our 2015 10-K. 
While the total cost of these treaties is small, in relation to our operating income, we were able to save some money by not replacing the expiring cat bond. 
And with that, let me turn the microphone over to Brian."

In Business and International Insurance, we're pleased with the results this quarter. In domestic business insurance, we achieved very strong retention along with the modest increase in renewal rate change versus the first quarter and higher",1203,"Thanks, Jay. In Business and International Insurance, we're pleased with the results this quarter. In domestic business insurance, we achieved very strong retention along with the modest increase in renewal rate change versus the first quarter and higher levels of new business. Our strategy has not changed as we strive to retain our best-performing accounts, get write [ph] where needed and write new business when it meets our target returns. 
This has been our strategy for some time. And as a result, we continue to be viewed as a stable and financially strong market by our distributors and customers. Along with the meaningful competitive advantages that we deliver, this consistent leadership position is resulting in additional growth opportunities for us. 
Turning to the financial results for the segment, operating income was $393 million with a combined ratio of $97.5 million. Cat losses for the quarter were $143 million net after tax, which included $61 million from the Canadian wildfires. Excluding the Canadian fires, cat losses were slightly higher than the prior year quarter. The underlying combined ratio, which excludes the impact of cats in prior year reserve development, was 95.5%, up 2.4 points compared to the second quarter of 2015. The loss ratio increased by 1.7 points, driven primarily by non-cat weather, which was higher than both the prior year quarter and our expectation. The expense ratio was up 0.7 point over last year, driven primarily by commissions as the second quarter of 2015 benefited from a onetime favorable adjustment. 
Net written premiums for the quarter were in line with the prior year quarter, with domestic business insurance premiums up about 2%. Given the returns that we are generating in this business, our focus continues to be on retention. And so we were very pleased that retention remains at 85% for the quarter, renewal premium change was just over 2 points, including renewal rate change that was slightly positive. New business of $525 million was up 10% versus the second quarter of 2015. 
Turning to the individual businesses within Business Insurance. Beginning with Select, we achieved retention of 82% and renewal premium change of nearly 6%. Rate change was down slightly versus the first quarter of 2016, while exposure was in line with recent periods, and new business was up slightly year-over-year. In Middle Market, retention remained very strong at 87%, with renewal premium change of about 1.5 point in line with recent quarters. 
In terms of new business opportunities, given our leadership position in the market, submissions were up year-over-year. Accordingly, we had more opportunities to quote on the types and classes of business we find attractive and to grow our new business while maintaining our return thresholds. 
In Other Business Insurance, retention of 82% was up 1 point year-over-year, while renewal premium change was 0.5 point, and new business of $154 million was consistent with the second quarter of 2015. As we've mentioned in the past, Other Business Insurance includes our National Property business. While there continues to be some rate pressure in this business, returns remain attractive, and as a result, retention is our priority. 
As you can see on Page 13 of the webcast, excluding National Property, renewal rate change for Other Business Insurance remains positive and was relatively consistent with recent quarters. 
In International, net written premiums for the second quarter were down about 12% quarter-over-quarter, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, net written premiums were down about 9%, driven by disciplined underwriting actions in our U.K. business, along with lower economic activity impacting the marine and energy lines of our Lloyd's business. 
New business of $107 million was up 67% year-over-year, driven primarily by Optima, our new, strategic Personal Lines Auto product in Canada, which was modeled after our U.S.-based Quantum Auto 2.0 product. So all in a good quarter for the segment with strong production and profitability. 
I'll turn now to Bond and Specialty Insurance where we had another terrific quarter. Operating income of $202 million was up significantly from the prior year quarter, driven by a higher level of net favorable prior year reserve development. The underlying combined ratio of 80.9% remains exceptionally strong. As for top line, net written premiums for the quarter were in line with the prior year, as growth in Management Liability was offset by lower Surety premium. The lower Surety volume was due almost entirely to favorable one-time reinsurance impacts in the prior year quarter. 
Across our Management Liability business, retention remained at historically high levels, and new business volumes were up. As we continue to execute our strategy of retaining our best accounts and writing more business in our return adequate product segment. We continue to feel great about this segment's performance. 
In Personal Insurance, results were again strong and remain particularly pleased with our ability to add top line growth at appropriate financial returns. Net written premiums for the quarter, up $2.1 billion, were an all-time high, with double-digit growth in Agency Auto, while growth also accelerated in Agency Homeowners and Other. In both products, we continue to produce strong retention and new business levels. Agent and consumer receptivity to Quantum Auto 2.0 remains exceptional and importantly, as significant amounts of Quantum Auto 2.0 business are now coming through their renewal cycles, we're pleased with the retention rates we're seeing on those policies. 
In Homeowners, our growth momentum is building, due to crossover benefits from Quantum Auto 2.0 as well as pricing changes and improvements to agent and customer experience. 
Turning to profitability. Operating income for the segment was down compared to the prior year quarter, due primarily to lower net favorable prior year reserve development. The underlying combined ratio of 89.5% was in line with our expectations, but up about 1 point from the prior year, driven by the impact of the significant new business volume in recent years and normal quarterly volatility in weather and other loss activity. 
In Agency Auto, the 101.3 combined ratio included 2.7 points in cats, primarily resulting from hail storms. Weather also impacted the underwriting combined ratio, with 1.7 points of non-cat weather-related losses, which is approximately 1 point higher than both our expectations and the second quarter of 2015. 
The remaining increase in the underlying combined ratio was driven by the high levels of new business that I just mentioned. As we've noted before, the Quantum Auto 2.0 business is priced to our long-term target returns and loss experiences performing in line with our expectations. 
Turning to Agency Homeowners & Other, underlying financial results remain strong. The second quarter underlying combined ratio of 78.2% is well within our target return levels as we continue to execute our disciplined underwriting and pricing strategies. So overall, for Personal Insurance, we feel great about the growth and the financial returns that the business is generating. 
Before I turn it back to Gabby, I would like to take a moment to recognize Doreen Spadorcia who announced her retirement from Travelers' effective September 1 of this year. Over the past 30 years, Doreen has played an important role on our management team, and we wish her well as she enjoys a new chapter of her life. 
With that, let me turn it over to Gabby."

This is Jay Benet. What's -- let's try to take them in order. So as far as the workers' comp, you're absolutely right, when you have a very long tail line of business, you look very, very carefully at things that happen in the short term and don't necessarily react to them. In the case of workers' comp, what you're seeing here is favorable development in 2015 that related to a relatively short component of it, relating to medical where medical bills come in quickly, they get resolved quickly. And the assumption that we had put in there for medical inflation was just too high. So while the line itself is a long-tail line, there are components of it that are more short tail, and that's primarily what we reacted to there. As far as the environmental piece is concerned, I think if you look at us as well as the industry, you'll see a similar pattern, if you will. People trying to, at various points in time, estimate what the ultimate is going to be for Environmental losses. And recognizing that you're dealing with something that is a very difficult kind of reserve to truly evaluate. So in doing so, you have to make various assumptions as to what the future is going to look like in terms of new claims, new policyholders, what the average frequency and severity might be associated with things that have been reported or not reported. And it's those assumptions that you're constantly updating as time goes on. So what we disclosed -- and I'll point you to the 10-Q. What we disclosed this year is actually very similar to what we've disclosed in prior periods and what you've seen other companies disclose that there really hasn't been a change in the environment, per se. Things have gotten a little better, but the rate of them getting better has just been less than what was previously assumed or hoped for. And that's a chunk of the reserve addition. In addition to that, we're always subject to judicial rulings or other things that take place episodically in various jurisdictions. And yes, there was one that came out of the northwest that increased modestly some of our claim costs there that we also recognized. And then finally, on the Bond and Specialty, this was a quarter for a fairly large prior year reserve development benefit. I wouldn't say there was anything unusual about it. This is, as you know, it's a high severity, low-frequency business. It's one where information emerges slowly. As it emerges, you're always evaluating whether or not it's blossomed to a level where you really feel action is appropriate. So there are things that have been taking place whether it's in items related to the financial crisis or whatever that we've been watching but things got to a point this quarter where we recognized that it was appropriate to take some reserve action. It wasn't any one product line, it wasn't any one particular claim or things like that, it was pretty much spread across the whole Management Liability and Surety book of business."

But I think -- we think more broadly, has also created a little bit of a mood in the marketplace of flight to quality. So like I said, we've seen our submission activity up a decent amount. And we've also, consistent with that, been driving a message to our organization, not strategically to do anything different with returns but to be more active. And to be out there quoting more.

One of the things we actually added to the Q this quarter was, in the Outlook section, we have previously spoken to underlying underwriting margins. So we thought it was important to add combined ratio because people often use those terms interchangeably. And as you know, the combined ratio is a function of the premium volume, whereas, the margins are just dollars. And just to clarify what we're saying here in the Q is, for Auto, which I think is what we're talking about, for the early part of '17, the company expects underlying underwriting margins, the dollars, to be slightly higher because of what's taking place with writing higher volumes of business that's profitable. But writing a higher percentage of new business relative to the base is also causing a slight uptick in the underlying combined ratio. So you have this feature here where the dollars are going up at the same time that the combined ratio is going up. So I just want to clarify that."

There is a trend there, but I think what we've told in the past is, there is some danger to looking at that very narrow definition of rate versus loss trend. And obviously, anybody could look at rate which is sort of around 0 and loss trend, which is something north of 0, on a written basis. And it has been moving in that direction for some number of quarters. So as anybody, as we would've expected, as that earns in over time, there will be some negative pressure on margins. But what we've said in the past is you've got to look at that in the context of all the other moving pieces that impact underlying underwriting margin, things like we have a tax impact year-over-year this quarter, there's expenses, there's day [ph] shares, there's mix, all those other things going to that number. And what we've shown you this quarter is all of that comes out to about a wash. And I guess, I'd also point you to the outlook where we can give you a sense of over the next four quarters or so that we would expect the underlying underwriting margins obviously subject to the volatility of weather and whatnot to continue to be broadly consistent."

And so you shouldn't have the impression that we're just sitting by, and as Alan just said, pricing is at roughly 0 this quarter rate and loss trend is something north of that, that we're just conceding that margins will recede. We're managing our mix, we're taking actions in underwriting selection, we're taking actions in claim execution, which are all impacting our loss trend. And then we're reacting to weather volatility, et cetera, that might be moving through the business. So there's no denying that the sheer arithmetic of that narrow piece, the loss trend and the rate right now is a negative.

From the profitability perspective, just as it's true of all business that we've ever written in this product, it matures over the years. And so there's a tenure impact. And as Michael just said, the younger-tenured business is typically not as profitable as we write the business where we're targeting a tenured, longer-term return and we're on track to do that.

So first, you need to think about a vintage and think about a book of business we're writing to a given policy year and that new business that we write in that term. That comes on at a higher loss ratio early, and then as we renew it, it improves. If you look at the production statistics that we've been disclosing and the high levels of new business, what's happening inside the portfolio then, which is the second piece is, on average, the portfolio is getting younger, right? And if younger business carries a higher loss ratio, that's what we describe as the increase in the combined. So when you look at the outlook for the first half of -- or, I'm sorry, the second half of '16, we'd say the combined ratio will be higher due to the impact of the higher new business levels we've been writing. That is the underlying dynamic that's flowing through the book. That does continue into the first half of '17, it just gets offset by an expectation of return to normalized non-cat weather levels. And so the -- to the underlying dynamic of the book getting younger, meaning less tenured, right, we've had the accounts not as long, continued into '17, recognize also though that as we write more Quantum Auto 2.0 business, there is a benefit to the combined ratio from an offsetting improvement in the expense ratio because it carries a commission. So that underlying aging of the book or reducing average tenure of the book does continue into '17. It just gets offset by, again, an expectation of return to more normalized weather. That's why the outlook reads the way it does."

There's nothing that's changed, there's nothing that's surprising us, and everything is consistent with what we reported to you on a written basis over the last 4 quarters. The real reason we put it in there is we wanted to be completely transparent about it. So it's very small piece. So we thought, if we didn't put it in there, you or somebody would have said to us, ""Gee, how can this not be happening, because we're looking at your written numbers over the last 3 or 4 quarters. "" So I'll just reiterate, it's small, it's within our expectations, it's wrapped up with all the other things that are typically moving around in the quarter. It's about a wash in terms of the year-over-year impact. And nothing, no message intended in terms of anything out of the ordinary. Completely expected, completely consistent with what we've seen on a written basis, and we continue to be very pleased with the modeled returns on the business that we're writing."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Unfortunately, I need to start on a sad note this morning. This is my fourth earnings call as CEO but the first since we lost our friend, Jay Fishman. I know I'm not alone in feeling his loss. Many of you sent thoughts and prayers. Thank you, we appreciate it. 
All of us at Travelers take a great deal of comfort in knowing that we're carrying on in a culture of excellence, performance and innovation that Jay left behind. It outlives him. It's an enormous part of his legacy, and we're grateful for it. To sum it up in Jay's words, we all feel remarkably fortunate to have known him and worked with him. 
At this point, Jay, would of course, demand that we get back to work, so let's get to the results.
This morning, we reported third quarter operating income of $701 million or $2.40 per share and operating return on equity of 12.5%. Our underwriting results remained strong, as reflected in our 92.9% combined ratio, and our net investment income was down only slightly from the prior year quarter. Across all our businesses, the third quarter was another example of the successful execution of our marketplace strategies. 
And generally speaking, underlying trends have not changed. Pricing and retention remained stable and consistent with recent trends. In our commercial businesses, retention continues to be at historic highs, with positive renewal premium change. In domestic business insurance, renewal rate change has improved a little bit for 2 sequential quarters, led by middle market business, where rate has also increased sequentially month-to-month in the quarter. 
Underneath that Middle Market, we again achieved rate gains in excess of loss trend on our poorest-performing segments. We also benefited from a mix shift in our better-performing settlements, as the loss ratio on the retained business in those segments was better than the loss ratio on non-renewed business, the results of managing the business on a very granular level. 
In Personal Insurance, we continued to achieve strong top line growth in the quarter, with continued growth in policies in-force in both our Agency Auto and Homeowners businesses. We believe that being able to deliver an account solution in our customers and agents is an important and meaningful competitive advantage. 
More than half of our personalized premium come from accounts for which we write both auto and home policies. When we write both the auto and the home, we can be more competitive in the pricing for our customers since it creates higher customer lifetime value for us through higher retentions and a more complete view of the risk. While we manage the profitability on the auto and home lines independently, we also manage to a portfolio return. We'll be focusing more than usual on the performance of the auto business this morning, but we shouldn't lose sight of the fact that the all-in combined ratio for our personal lines business was 94.1% for the 9 months, a very good result. 
Turning back the consolidated results for all 3 segments. Underwriting results for the quarter were impacted by lower levels of net favorable prior year reserve development, higher non-cat weather-related losses, and in personal lines, higher-than-expected losses associated with auto bodily injury. Jay Benet will have more to say about the prior year development. 
The higher bodily injury severity in personal auto had a $29 million after tax impact on the current accident year, $20 million of which related to the first and second quarters, a modest impact. Brian will discuss it in more detail. 
I'd like to highlight that we believe that the increase in auto bodily severity is environmental and not specific to the Quantum Auto 2.0 product, as we see it across all our Personal Insurance auto program and in our commercial auto and trucking books. In anticipation of this trend continuing, we are addressing it through pricing, and we believe that the product remains positioned to deliver target returns over time. 
I'd also add that it's important to understand that when trends change in any part of our business, and they will, what's important is having the ability to recognize it and react quickly. We believe our leading analytics give us an important advantage in this regard. 
In terms of net investment income, fixed income returns declined in line with our expectations and we were pleased to see an improvement in our returns from the non-fixed income portfolio. All of this resulted in a very strong operating return on equity in the quarter and year-to-date. Given the continued historically low interest rate environment and the other items impacting our results this quarter, we're particularly pleased with that result. 
In terms of the strategy going forward, you can expect more of the same. In this low interest rate environment where underwriting matters more than ever, we have significant competitive advantages in our data and analytics expertise, claim and risk control capabilities and talent. Combining that with our active capital management strategy, we remain well positioned to continue to deliver industry-leading returns over time. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Jay Benet."
392856,311922517,1057481,"The Travelers Companies, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 20, 2016",2016-10-20,"Earnings Calls","The Travelers Companies, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Alan. Consistent with what we had said about the first 2 quarters of the year, we are once again pleased with our results this quarter: Operating income of $701 million and operating return on equity of 12.5%, notwithstanding their being lower tha",822,"Thanks, Alan. Consistent with what we had said about the first 2 quarters of the year, we are once again pleased with our results this quarter: Operating income of $701 million and operating return on equity of 12.5%, notwithstanding their being lower than the prior year quarter. As in the first half of the year, these reductions did not result from fundamental changes in business trends, rather, as Alan said, they were primarily driven by lower net favorable prior year reserve development and higher non-cat weather-related losses. 
Net investment income, which totaled $472 million after tax, was down only $12 million from the prior year quarter, entirely due to the continuing impact of the low interest rate environment on fixed income returns. Non-fixed income returns improved from recent quarters to a level that was slightly higher than the prior year quarter. 
We continue to experience net favorable prior year reserve development on a consolidated basis, which totaled $39 million pretax, down from $199 million pretax in the prior year quarter. 
In Business and International Insurance, net favorable development of $19 million pretax primarily resulted from better than expected loss experienced in GL ex A&E for accident years 2006 and prior and for 2014 and 2015, and workers' comp for accident years 2006 and prior and for 2015 and in commercial auto for accident years 2011 and prior, partially offset by a $225 million increase to our asbestos reserves.
The asbestos reserves increased related to a broad number of policyholders and was driven by higher estimates for projected settlement and defense cost for mesothelioma claims than we had previously assumed. Notwithstanding these higher cost estimates, our overall view of the underlying asbestos environment remained essentially unchanged from recent periods. 
In Bonds & Specialty Insurance, net favorable development of $41 million pretax primarily resulted from better than expected loss experience in Fidelity and Surety for accident years 2009 through 2015, while reserve development in Personal Insurance, which remained favorable to date, Homeowners and Other had a modest amount of unfavorable development this quarter, $21 million pretax, primarily resulting from higher than expected loss experienced for a small number of liability claims related to the 2013 and 2014 accident years. Notwithstanding this current quarter activity, the Homeowners and Other 2013 and 2014 accident years have developed net favorably since their inception.
I should also point out that the unfavorable development in Homeowners and Other this quarter did not result from any change in our reserve-setting philosophy or methodologies. As we've stated in the past and in our Qs and Ks, we always book to our best estimates and we use our advanced data and analytics to respond as quickly as we can to new information. 
By its nature, reserve development is episodic, and in lines like Homeowners and Other, much of it is historically related to true-ing up estimated losses caused by storm damage. The number of severe storms in recent reporting periods, their timing in relation to the reporting period in which they occurred, the causes and severity of the losses, such as wind versus water, the actual size and extent of any hail, the actual amount of additional living expenses provided, et cetera, has and will cause significant fluctuations in reserve development from period to period, and changes in levels of reserve development should not be regarded as a ""trend."" 
Ex A&E, on a combined stat basis for all of our U.S. subs, all accident years across all product lines in the aggregate and all product lines across all accident years in the aggregate, developed favorably or had de minimis unfavorable development year to date. 
While CMP currently looks as if it developed unfavorably year to date by $37 million, as I pointed out in the second quarter, there was offsetting favorable development in the property product line, as Middle Market property losses that had been recorded in the property line at year end 2015 were subsequently determined to be CMP-related.
Operating cash flows of $1.77 billion were very strong this quarter. We ended the quarter with holding company liquidity of $1.8 billion, and all of our capital ratios remained at or better than their target levels. Net unrealized investment gains were approximately $3.1 billion pretax or $2 billion after tax, up from $2 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively, at the beginning of the year. While book value per share at $86.04 and adjusted book value per share of $78.82 increased 8% and 5%, respectively, also from the beginning of the year. 
We continue to generate much more capital than we need to support our businesses, and consistent with our ongoing capital management strategy, we returned $755 million of excess capital to our shareholders this quarter through dividends of $193 million and share repurchases of $562 million. And year to date, we returned nearly $2.3 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. 
So with that, I'll turn things over to Brian."

I'll start with Business and International Insurance where we had another good quarter with strong returns and production results. We were very pleased that retention remained at historically high levels while we achieved positive renewal premium change and solid new business results. 
Turning to the financial results for the segment. Operating income was $457 million with a combined ratio of 96.1%. The underlying combined ratio was 94.7%, up 2.2 points compared to the prior year. The increase in the underlying loss ratio was driven primarily by non-cat weather, which was higher than both the prior year quarter and our expectation, and about 0.75 points impact from loss cost trends in excess of earned pricing. These were partially offset by lower large loss activity.
Turning to production. Given the returns that we are generating in the segment, our focus continues to be on retention, and so we're very pleased that retention for our domestic business remained at 85% for the quarter. Renewal premium change was nearly 3 points, including renewal rate change that was slightly positive, while we produced new business of $431 million.
Turning to the individual businesses. In select, retention continued to remains strong at 82%, while renewal premium change was over 5 points, and we're quite pleased that new business was up 7% over the prior year. In Middle Market, retention of 87% remains at a historical high, with renewal premium change of over 2 points. New business dollars were essentially consistent with prior year, with submissions, quotes and the number of new accounts written in the quarter up. The average size of accounts written was down slightly versus last year, but we're encouraged by the increased activity. 
In Other Business Insurance on Page 12, you can see that rate and RPC both improved in the quarter and retention remained strong. New business of $124 million was down compared to the third quarter of 2015, reflecting continued disciplined underwriting for larger accounts where we don't feel that market pricing will allow us to achieve target returns.
In international, we achieved 82% retention with positive renewal premium change and a 46% increase in new business volume, resulting in a 4% increase in net written premium, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. These increases were driven by our new global construction and renewable energy groups in Lloyd's and continued success in Canada with our recently introduced Personal Lines Auto product, Optima. So all-in, a good quarter for the segment with strong production and profitability.
Turning to bonds and specialty insurance. This business continues to perform exceptionally well. Operating income for the quarter of $146 million was down from the prior year quarter, driven primarily by lower -- a lower level of net favorable prior year reserve development. The underlying combined ratio of 77.4% remained strong and well within our target return levels.
On top line, net written premiums for the quarter were flat to the prior year. Across our Management Liability businesses, retention remained at historically high levels and new business volumes were up as we continued to execute our strategy of retaining our best accounts and writing more business in our return-adequate product segments. So Bonds & Specialty results remained terrific, and we continue to feel great about the segment's performance and execution in the marketplace. 
I'll now turn to Personal Insurance. Alan touched on the highlights. We once again had a solid quarter with a combined ratio of 92.9% and net written premiums reaching an all-time high of $2.2 billion.  Auto continues to be the bigger factor driving the growth, but Homeowners' growth continues to accelerate as well. And both products generated strong retention and new business levels.
We believe being a portfolio provider sets us apart in the marketplace and we remain pleased with the financial performance of the overall segment. The third quarter underlying combined ratio of 91% was impacted by an adjustment to our auto loss ratio that I'll discuss in a moment. And year to date underlying combined ratio of 88.9% remained strong, a very good result.
Looking at auto profitability. The underlying combined ratio for the quarter was 101.1%, up about 5 points from the prior year. About 4.5 points of this increase was due to the year-to-date impact of an adjustment we made to the loss ratio related to bodily injury severity for 2016, which for the most part, reflects higher severity in our smaller claims. About 3 points of that increase relates to the first 2 quarters of this year. 
With respect to this change, I want to emphasize a few points. First, as Alan said, we believe this is environmental in nature, that is, we are seeing it across all our auto products, both in personal and commercial lines; second, what we are seeing is from the last 4 accident quarters, and for a long-tail line like auto liability, that is very recent activity; lastly, while we have been closely watching and talking to you about auto bodily injury severity for a number of years and reflecting it in our underwriting claim, pricing and reserving, recently, severity has increased to a level that's a little more than we anticipated. In response to this recent trend, we're taking the appropriate pricing actions. 
Looking at auto frequency, overall, year to date 2016 frequency is generally in line with our long-term view. That said, we have seen some texture within the year. Collision frequency for the first half of the year was favorable to our long-term view while the third quarter was unfavorable. We believe the frequency volatility that we've seen in 2016 reflects normal period-to-period fluctuations. As always, we are watching the data closely and will adjust if and when appropriate, but as of now, we have not changed our long-term frequency expectations. 
For perspective, the net adjustments we have made year to date related to collision frequency have less than a $3 million after tax unfavorable impact. Normally, we wouldn't talk about a variance this small, but given the amount of recent industry discussion on the topic, we felt the disclosure would be helpful.
We've also been talking to you about the impact of tenure on our auto loss ratio for a while. So let me take a few minutes to walk you through the slide on Page 19 that we've added to demonstrate the impact of tenure on a loss ratio. 
Exhibit 1 in the upper left illustrates the underlying dynamic that drives the impact of tenure, namely that the loss ratio of a given cohort of business improves over time, as poorer-performing business defects and pricing segmentation improves on the business that is retained.
Moving to exhibits 2 through 4, of course, any given calendar period consists of a number of cohorts ranging from new to multiple years of age. In these exhibits, the curved line represents loss ratio by tenure, think policy year. The vertical bars represent premium volume remaining for those years and the horizontal line is the calendar period loss ratio for all cohorts, which is a premium-weighted average of the loss ratio of each cohort of business during that calendar period.
Exhibit 2 demonstrates a steady-state growth scenario, think base case. During periods of consistent growth, the newer cohorts blend with the older ones, and the calendar period loss experience will generate the target loss ratio. 
Exhibit 3 illustrates the impact of a higher new business growth environment, where calendar period results are more heavily influenced by the newer cohorts of business that naturally have a higher loss ratio. This drives the calendar period loss ratio higher. 
Exhibit 4 illustrates a return to steady-state growth at the higher levels of premium volume. The balance between the older and newer cohorts improves, the calendar paired loss ratio returns to target levels, and in addition, increased volume brings additional profit dollars. 
So obviously, these are theoretical illustrations that raise a few important questions for our business. First, what is the current impact of tenure on our auto loss ratio? And the answer is, that the loss ratio -- our loss ratio is about 2 points higher than it would've been excluding this tenure impact. 
Second, do we believe that our Quantum Auto 2.0 product is performing as expected? And the answer to this is that it's been maturing in line with our loss ratio expectations. 
Of course, we manage the business at a very granular level and monitor the book across multiple dimensions. For example, loss cost, retention and other proxies of profitability, such as limits profile, prior experience and insurance score. In aggregate, based on all the data we have, we believe this businesses on track to produce appropriate returns. We clearly realize that the product is still relatively new in the marketplace, having launched late in 2013, but 3 years in, we are very pleased with the performance.
Turning to Homeowners. The underlying combined ratio for the quarter was a very strong 78.3%, although up about 7 points year-over-year due primarily to an unusually low amount of non-catastrophe weather-related losses last year. The current quarter result is in line with our expectations, and we remain very pleased with the returns we're seeing in this business.
So stepping back from a lot of moving pieces in the quarter, this is a franchise with a year-to-date combined ratio of 94.1% and 9% premium growth, results we feel very good about. 
And with that, let me turn it back to Gabby."

Another thing that -- when speaking, a lot of our commentary was to loss ratio. And importantly, remember, in this business, as we rolled out quantum, it was really built around a pretty decent change to our cost structure.

First, when we look at claim experience across our business, and we see it in personal lines, in recently written business, legacy long-tenured business across pretty much the entire spectrum of customer profile and we see it in our commercial business from small to large trucking, that tells us that this isn't something specific to our underwriting some product we have in marketplace. So it would be, in our view, highly unlikely that we'd see it that broad based and have it be just our issue. I would also talk to -- I would completely agree with the comment that auto liability, any liability line of business, it's hard to see clarity in the near-term. And so we're constantly watching these events. I am very confident, though, that we're as on top of this as anybody. And for reference, I'd just comment, I'd say look back to commentary we had going back as far as 2011, 2012 into 2013. We were talking about liability trends, what we were seeing in the auto product relative to distracted driving, relative to increased litigation, relative to increased utilization of medical diagnostic tools and the impacts on bodily injury. And to be totally honest, there were a couple of years there where we were getting a lot of questions from folks on this call about why are you seeing something no one else is talking about? And over the years, I think everybody has been talking about it. So I'm not saying that we've got it perfectly right or we ever do, but we're looking at the trends very, very closely. And what we've seen in the last 3 or 4 accident quarters has been somewhat of an elevation, as we said, particularly on the lower end of the claim size, but driving more complexity. So..."

And we don't know, we do have a plan, we do price for weather, but that reflects generally speaking, longer-term trends. So it's -- we just don't feel it would be particularly meaningful for us to give you a plan for next quarter or next year just given the volatility. So we shy away from getting that specific relative to our expectations. What I will tell you, in case it's helpful is on a year-to-date basis for the company, weather was about $70 [ph] million, the non-cat weather was about $70 million worse after tax than it was in the prior year. So I know that's not exactly what you asked for, maybe it's a little bit of color that would be helpful. But were just a little hesitant to start giving you planned numbers."

So taking those things separately, I mean, is it possible that the growth that you've seen just might have occurred at a difficult time sort of before some of these loss trends emerge? Then following up on a prior question, should that imply that at some point we see that growth revert back until you calibrate those things?

And a lot of the growth you're seeing is high in percentage terms because it's off a smaller base after a couple of years of shrinking. So that's I think just an important context to keep in mind. We don't go out there and try to manage the growth. We try to go out there based on everything that we see and price for the return that we're looking for. And based on the market, we'll grow or we won't grow. And we feel very good about the growth. Maybe we don't have it exactly right. Maybe we'll have to adjust, I'm not really sure. And honestly, we could adjusting up or down, not really sure. And this isn't unusual for any line of business that we have. As I said before, loss trends are going to change for one reason or another. We've got other trends in other parts of our business that have emerged favorably.

The real -- we're not going to disclose exactly what the timing is because that would leave someone to be able to triangulate exactly how we're pricing in the returns where specific returns were targeting. But the answer is, it's kind of a function of when -- what do you think is going to happen to our growth. It's not going to reverse in the next year or 2. It's going to take a while to play out. The other thing that is certainly worth noting is we talk a lot about the ratio as we grow and it performs, we're generating profit dollars that are incremental to the franchise and obviously, that's a good thing."

When you look at the outlook, the outlook reflects the comments we've made this morning that we're [ph][indiscernible]  with price and so the outlook, I think literally says, we believe price will exceed loss trend which would be a good guide. The outlook says, I believe, that that offsets some continued adverse impact from tenure. And then other big component is an expectation about more normalized loss levels, which relates a little bit to the non-cat weather conversation we've been having this morning and just a broader, more consistent expectation on loss level. So again, I think the pricing and the outlook anticipate that the bodily injury severity, the higher levels of bodily injury severity are with us going forward but we're responding with price, and believe that we'll get price ahead of loss trend in '17."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Unfortunately, I need to start on a sad note this morning. This is my fourth earnings call as CEO but the first since we lost our friend, Jay Fishman. I know I'm not alone in feeling his loss. Many of you sent thoughts and prayers. Thank you, we appreciate it. 
All of us at Travelers take a great deal of comfort in knowing that we're carrying on in a culture of excellence, performance and innovation that Jay left behind. It outlives him. It's an enormous part of his legacy, and we're grateful for it. To sum it up in Jay's words, we all feel remarkably fortunate to have known him and worked with him. 
At this point, Jay, would of course, demand that we get back to work, so let's get to the results.
This morning, we reported third quarter operating income of $701 million or $2.40 per share and operating return on equity of 12.5%. Our underwriting results remained strong, as reflected in our 92.9% combined ratio, and our net investment income was down only slightly from the prior year quarter. Across all our businesses, the third quarter was another example of the successful execution of our marketplace strategies. 
And generally speaking, underlying trends have not changed. Pricing and retention remained stable and consistent with recent trends. In our commercial businesses, retention continues to be at historic highs, with positive renewal premium change. In domestic business insurance, renewal rate change has improved a little bit for 2 sequential quarters, led by middle market business, where rate has also increased sequentially month-to-month in the quarter. 
Underneath that Middle Market, we again achieved rate gains in excess of loss trend on our poorest-performing segments. We also benefited from a mix shift in our better-performing settlements, as the loss ratio on the retained business in those segments was better than the loss ratio on non-renewed business, the results of managing the business on a very granular level. 
In Personal Insurance, we continued to achieve strong top line growth in the quarter, with continued growth in policies in-force in both our Agency Auto and Homeowners businesses. We believe that being able to deliver an account solution in our customers and agents is an important and meaningful competitive advantage. 
More than half of our personalized premium come from accounts for which we write both auto and home policies. When we write both the auto and the home, we can be more competitive in the pricing for our customers since it creates higher customer lifetime value for us through higher retentions and a more complete view of the risk. While we manage the profitability on the auto and home lines independently, we also manage to a portfolio return. We'll be focusing more than usual on the performance of the auto business this morning, but we shouldn't lose sight of the fact that the all-in combined ratio for our personal lines business was 94.1% for the 9 months, a very good result. 
Turning back the consolidated results for all 3 segments. Underwriting results for the quarter were impacted by lower levels of net favorable prior year reserve development, higher non-cat weather-related losses, and in personal lines, higher-than-expected losses associated with auto bodily injury. Jay Benet will have more to say about the prior year development. 
The higher bodily injury severity in Personal Auto had a $29 million after tax impact on the current accident year, $20 million of which related to the first and second quarters, a modest impact. Brian will discuss it in more detail. 
I'd like to highlight that we believe that the increase in auto bodily severity is environmental and not specific to the Quantum Auto 2.0 product, as we see it across all our Personal Insurance auto program and in our commercial auto and trucking books. In anticipation of this trend continuing, we are addressing it through pricing, and we believe that the product remains positioned to deliver target returns over time. 
I'd also add that it's important to understand that when trends change in any part of our business, and they will, what's important is having the ability to recognize it and react quickly. We believe our leading analytics give us an important advantage in this regard. 
In terms of net investment income, fixed income returns declined in line with our expectations and we were pleased to see an improvement in our returns from the non-fixed income portfolio. All of this resulted in a very strong operating return on equity in the quarter and year-to-date. Given the continued historically low interest rate environment and the other items impacting our results this quarter, we're particularly pleased with that result. 
In terms of the strategy going forward, you can expect more of the same. In this low interest rate environment where underwriting matters more than ever, we have significant competitive advantages in our data and analytics expertise, claim and risk control capabilities and talent. Combining that with our active capital management strategy, we remain well positioned to continue to deliver industry-leading returns over time. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Jay Benet."
392856,311922517,1057586,"The Travelers Companies, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 20, 2016",2016-10-20,"Earnings Calls","The Travelers Companies, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Alan. Consistent with what we had said about the first 2 quarters of the year, we are once again pleased with our results this quarter: Operating income of $701 million and operating return on equity of 12.5%, notwithstanding their being lower tha",822,"Thanks, Alan. Consistent with what we had said about the first 2 quarters of the year, we are once again pleased with our results this quarter: Operating income of $701 million and operating return on equity of 12.5%, notwithstanding their being lower than the prior year quarter. As in the first half of the year, these reductions did not result from fundamental changes in business trends, rather, as Alan said, they were primarily driven by lower net favorable prior year reserve development and higher non-cat weather-related losses. 
Net investment income, which totaled $472 million after tax, was down only $12 million from the prior year quarter, entirely due to the continuing impact of the low interest rate environment on fixed income returns. Non-fixed income returns improved from recent quarters to a level that was slightly higher than the prior year quarter. 
We continue to experience net favorable prior year reserve development on a consolidated basis, which totaled $39 million pretax, down from $199 million pretax in the prior year quarter. 
In Business and International Insurance, net favorable development of $19 million pretax primarily resulted from better than expected loss experienced in GL ex A&E for accident years 2006 and prior and for 2014 and 2015, and workers' comp for accident years 2006 and prior and for 2015 and in commercial auto for accident years 2011 and prior, partially offset by a $225 million increase to our asbestos reserves.
The asbestos reserves increased related to a broad number of policyholders and was driven by higher estimates for projected settlement and defense cost for mesothelioma claims than we had previously assumed. Notwithstanding these higher cost estimates, our overall view of the underlying asbestos environment remained essentially unchanged from recent periods. 
In Bonds & Specialty Insurance, net favorable development of $41 million pretax primarily resulted from better than expected loss experience in Fidelity and Surety for accident years 2009 through 2015, while reserve development in Personal Insurance, which remained favorable to date, Homeowners and Other had a modest amount of unfavorable development this quarter, $21 million pretax, primarily resulting from higher than expected loss experienced for a small number of liability claims related to the 2013 and 2014 accident years. Notwithstanding this current quarter activity, the Homeowners and Other 2013 and 2014 accident years have developed net favorably since their inception.
I should also point out that the unfavorable development in Homeowners and Other this quarter did not result from any change in our reserve-setting philosophy or methodologies. As we've stated in the past and in our Qs and Ks, we always book to our best estimates and we use our advanced data and analytics to respond as quickly as we can to new information. 
By its nature, reserve development is episodic, and in lines like Homeowners and Other, much of it is historically related to true-ing up estimated losses caused by storm damage. The number of severe storms in recent reporting periods, their timing in relation to the reporting period in which they occurred, the causes and severity of the losses, such as wind versus water, the actual size and extent of any hail, the actual amount of additional living expenses provided, et cetera, has and will cause significant fluctuations in reserve development from period to period, and changes in levels of reserve development should not be regarded as a ""trend."" 
Ex A&E, on a combined stat basis for all of our U.S. subs, all accident years across all product lines in the aggregate and all product lines across all accident years in the aggregate, developed favorably or had de minimis unfavorable development year to date. 
While CMP currently looks as if it developed unfavorably year to date by $37 million, as I pointed out in the second quarter, there was offsetting favorable development in the property product line, as Middle Market property losses that had been recorded in the property line at year end 2015 were subsequently determined to be CMP-related.
Operating cash flows of $1.77 billion were very strong this quarter. We ended the quarter with holding company liquidity of $1.8 billion, and all of our capital ratios remained at or better than their target levels. Net unrealized investment gains were approximately $3.1 billion pretax or $2 billion after tax, up from $2 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively, at the beginning of the year. While book value per share at $86.04 and adjusted book value per share of $78.82 increased 8% and 5%, respectively, also from the beginning of the year. 
We continue to generate much more capital than we need to support our businesses, and consistent with our ongoing capital management strategy, we returned $755 million of excess capital to our shareholders this quarter through dividends of $193 million and share repurchases of $562 million. And year to date, we returned nearly $2.3 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. 
So with that, I'll turn things over to Brian."

I'll start with Business and International Insurance where we had another good quarter with strong returns and production results. We were very pleased that retention remained at historically high levels while we achieved positive renewal premium change and solid new business results. 
Turning to the financial results for the segment. Operating income was $457 million with a combined ratio of 96.1%. The underlying combined ratio was 94.7%, up 2.2 points compared to the prior year. The increase in the underlying loss ratio was driven primarily by non-cat weather, which was higher than both the prior year quarter and our expectation, and about 0.75 points impact from loss cost trends in excess of earned pricing. These were partially offset by lower large loss activity.
Turning to production. Given the returns that we are generating in the segment, our focus continues to be on retention, and so we're very pleased that retention for our domestic business remained at 85% for the quarter. Renewal premium change was nearly 3 points, including renewal rate change that was slightly positive, while we produced new business of $431 million.
Turning to the individual businesses. In select, retention continued to remains strong at 82%, while renewal premium change was over 5 points, and we're quite pleased that new business was up 7% over the prior year. In Middle Market, retention of 87% remains at a historical high, with renewal premium change of over 2 points. New business dollars were essentially consistent with prior year, with submissions, quotes and the number of new accounts written in the quarter up. The average size of accounts written was down slightly versus last year, but we're encouraged by the increased activity. 
In Other Business Insurance on Page 12, you can see that rate and RPC both improved in the quarter and retention remained strong. New business of $124 million was down compared to the third quarter of 2015, reflecting continued disciplined underwriting for larger accounts where we don't feel that market pricing will allow us to achieve target returns.
In international, we achieved 82% retention with positive renewal premium change and a 46% increase in new business volume, resulting in a 4% increase in net written premium, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. These increases were driven by our new global construction and renewable energy groups in Lloyd's and continued success in Canada with our recently introduced Personal Lines Auto product, Optima. So all-in, a good quarter for the segment with strong production and profitability.
Turning to bonds and specialty insurance. This business continues to perform exceptionally well. Operating income for the quarter of $146 million was down from the prior year quarter, driven primarily by lower -- a lower level of net favorable prior year reserve development. The underlying combined ratio of 77.4% remained strong and well within our target return levels.
On top line, net written premiums for the quarter were flat to the prior year. Across our Management Liability businesses, retention remained at historically high levels and new business volumes were up as we continued to execute our strategy of retaining our best accounts and writing more business in our return-adequate product segments. So Bonds & Specialty results remained terrific, and we continue to feel great about the segment's performance and execution in the marketplace. 
I'll now turn to Personal Insurance. Alan touched on the highlights. We once again had a solid quarter with a combined ratio of 92.9% and net written premiums reaching an all-time high of $2.2 billion.  Auto continues to be the bigger factor driving the growth, but Homeowners' growth continues to accelerate as well. And both products generated strong retention and new business levels.
We believe being a portfolio provider sets us apart in the marketplace and we remain pleased with the financial performance of the overall segment. The third quarter underlying combined ratio of 91% was impacted by an adjustment to our auto loss ratio that I'll discuss in a moment. And year to date underlying combined ratio of 88.9% remained strong, a very good result.
Looking at auto profitability. The underlying combined ratio for the quarter was 101.1%, up about 5 points from the prior year. About 4.5 points of this increase was due to the year-to-date impact of an adjustment we made to the loss ratio related to bodily injury severity for 2016, which for the most part, reflects higher severity in our smaller claims. About 3 points of that increase relates to the first 2 quarters of this year. 
With respect to this change, I want to emphasize a few points. First, as Alan said, we believe this is environmental in nature, that is, we are seeing it across all our auto products, both in personal and commercial lines; second, what we are seeing is from the last 4 accident quarters, and for a long-tail line like auto liability, that is very recent activity; lastly, while we have been closely watching and talking to you about auto bodily injury severity for a number of years and reflecting it in our underwriting claim, pricing and reserving, recently, severity has increased to a level that's a little more than we anticipated. In response to this recent trend, we're taking the appropriate pricing actions. 
Looking at auto frequency, overall, year to date 2016 frequency is generally in line with our long-term view. That said, we have seen some texture within the year. Collision frequency for the first half of the year was favorable to our long-term view while the third quarter was unfavorable. We believe the frequency volatility that we've seen in 2016 reflects normal period-to-period fluctuations. As always, we are watching the data closely and will adjust if and when appropriate, but as of now, we have not changed our long-term frequency expectations. 
For perspective, the net adjustments we have made year to date related to collision frequency have less than a $3 million after tax unfavorable impact. Normally, we wouldn't talk about a variance this small, but given the amount of recent industry discussion on the topic, we felt the disclosure would be helpful.
We've also been talking to you about the impact of tenure on our auto loss ratio for a while. So let me take a few minutes to walk you through the slide on Page 19 that we've added to demonstrate the impact of tenure on a loss ratio. 
Exhibit 1 in the upper left illustrates the underlying dynamic that drives the impact of tenure, namely that the loss ratio of a given cohort of business improves over time, as poorer-performing business defects and pricing segmentation improves on the business that is retained.
Moving to exhibits 2 through 4, of course, any given calendar period consists of a number of cohorts ranging from new to multiple years of age. In these exhibits, the curved line represents loss ratio by tenure, think policy year. The vertical bars represent premium volume remaining for those years and the horizontal line is the calendar period loss ratio for all cohorts, which is a premium-weighted average of the loss ratio of each cohort of business during that calendar period.
Exhibit 2 demonstrates a steady-state growth scenario, think base case. During periods of consistent growth, the newer cohorts blend with the older ones, and the calendar period loss experience will generate the target loss ratio. 
Exhibit 3 illustrates the impact of a higher new business growth environment, where calendar period results are more heavily influenced by the newer cohorts of business that naturally have a higher loss ratio. This drives the calendar period loss ratio higher. 
Exhibit 4 illustrates a return to steady-state growth at the higher levels of premium volume. The balance between the older and newer cohorts improves, the calendar paired loss ratio returns to target levels, and in addition, increased volume brings additional profit dollars. 
So obviously, these are theoretical illustrations that raise a few important questions for our business. First, what is the current impact of tenure on our auto loss ratio? And the answer is, that the loss ratio -- our loss ratio is about 2 points higher than it would've been excluding this tenure impact. 
Second, do we believe that our Quantum Auto 2.0 product is performing as expected? And the answer to this is that it's been maturing in line with our loss ratio expectations. 
Of course, we manage the business at a very granular level and monitor the book across multiple dimensions. For example, loss cost, retention and other proxies of profitability, such as limits profile, prior experience and insurance score. In aggregate, based on all the data we have, we believe this businesses on track to produce appropriate returns. We clearly realize that the product is still relatively new in the marketplace, having launched late in 2013, but 3 years in, we are very pleased with the performance.
Turning to Homeowners. The underlying combined ratio for the quarter was a very strong 78.3%, although up about 7 points year-over-year due primarily to an unusually low amount of non-catastrophe weather-related losses last year. The current quarter result is in line with our expectations, and we remain very pleased with the returns we're seeing in this business.
So stepping back from a lot of moving pieces in the quarter, this is a franchise with a year-to-date combined ratio of 94.1% and 9% premium growth, results we feel very good about. 
And with that, let me turn it back to Gabby."

I would also talk to -- I would completely agree with the comment that auto liability, any liability line of business, it's hard to see clarity in the near-term. And so we're constantly watching these events. I am very confident, though, that we're as on top of this as anybody. And for reference, I'd just comment, I'd say look back to commentary we had going back as far as 2011, 2012 into 2013. We were talking about liability trends, what we were seeing in the auto product relative to distracted driving, relative to increased litigation, relative to increased utilization of medical diagnostic tools and the impacts on bodily injury. And to be totally honest, there were a couple of years there where we were getting a lot of questions from folks on this call about why are you seeing something no one else is talking about? And over the years, I think everybody has been talking about it. So I'm not saying that we've got it perfectly right or we ever do, but we're looking at the trends very, very closely. And what we've seen in the last 3 or 4 accident quarters has been somewhat of an elevation, as we said, particularly on the lower end of the claim size, but driving more complexity. So..."

And a lot of the growth you're seeing is high in percentage terms because it's off a smaller base after a couple of years of shrinking. So that's, I think, just important context to keep in mind. We don't go out there and try to manage the growth. We try to go out there based on everything that we see and price for the return that we're looking for. And based on the market, we'll grow or we won't grow. And we feel very good about the growth. Maybe we don't have it exactly right. Maybe we'll have to adjust, I'm not really sure. And honestly, we could be adjusting up or down, not really sure. And this isn't unusual for any line of business that we have.

The real -- and we're not going to disclose exactly what the timing is because that would leave someone to be able to triangulate exactly how we're pricing and the returns that we're -- where specific returns we're targeting. But the answer is it's kind of a function of when -- what do you think is going to happen to our growth. It's not going to reverse in the next year or 2. It's going to take a while to play out. The other thing that is certainly worth noting is we talk a lot about the ratio. As we grow and it performs, we're generating profit dollars that are incremental to the franchise.

When you look at the outlook, the outlook reflects the comments we've made this morning, and that we're responding with price. And so the outlook, I think, literally says, ""We believe price will exceed loss trend,"" which will be a good guy. The outlook says, ""I believe, that, that offsets some continued adverse impact from tenure."" And then other big component is an expectation about more normalized loss levels, which relates a little bit to the non-cat weather conversation we've been having this morning and just a broader, more consistent expectation on loss level. So again, I think the pricing and the outlook anticipate that the bodily injury severity -- the higher levels of bodily injury severity are with us going forward. But we're responding with price and believe that we'll get price ahead of loss trend in '17."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Unfortunately, I need to start on a sad note this morning. This is my fourth earnings call as CEO but the first since we lost our friend, Jay Fishman. I know I'm not alone in feeling his loss. Many of you sent thoughts and prayers. Thank you, we appreciate it. 
All of us at Travelers take a great deal of comfort in knowing that we're carrying on in a culture of excellence, performance and innovation that Jay left behind. It outlives him. It's an enormous part of his legacy, and we're grateful for it. To sum it up in Jay's words, we all feel remarkably fortunate to have known him and worked with him. 
At this point, Jay, would of course, demand that we get back to work, so let's get to the results.
This morning, we reported third quarter operating income of $701 million or $2.40 per share and operating return on equity of 12.5%. Our underwriting results remained strong, as reflected in our 92.9% combined ratio, and our net investment income was down only slightly from the prior year quarter. Across all our businesses, the third quarter was another example of the successful execution of our marketplace strategies. 
And generally speaking, underlying trends have not changed. Pricing and retention remained stable and consistent with recent trends. In our commercial businesses, retention continues to be at historic highs, with positive renewal premium change. In domestic business insurance, renewal rate change has improved a little bit for 2 sequential quarters, led by our middle market business, where rate has also increased sequentially month-to-month in the quarter. 
Underneath that Middle Market, we again achieved rate gains in excess of loss trend on our poorest-performing segments. We also benefited from a mix shift in our better-performing settlements, as the loss ratio on the retained business in those segments was better than the loss ratio on nonrenewed business, the results of managing the business on a very granular level. 
In Personal Insurance, we continued to achieve strong top line growth in the quarter, with continued growth in policies in-force in both our Agency Auto and Homeowners businesses. We believe that being able to deliver an account solution to our customers and agents is an important and meaningful competitive advantage. 
More than half of our personalized premium come from accounts for which we write both auto and home policies. When we write both the auto and the home, we can be more competitive in the pricing for our customers since it creates higher customer lifetime value for us through higher retentions and a more complete view of the risk. While we manage the profitability of the auto and home lines independently, we also manage to a portfolio return. We'll be focusing more than usual on the performance of the auto business this morning, but we shouldn't lose sight of the fact that the all-in combined ratio for our personal lines business was 94.1% for the 9 months, a very good result. 
Turning back to consolidated results for all 3 segments. Underwriting results for the quarter were impacted by lower levels of net favorable prior year reserve development, higher noncat weather-related losses, and in personal lines, higher-than-expected losses associated with auto bodily injury. Jay Benet will have more to say about the prior year development. 
The higher bodily injury severity in Personal Auto had a $29 million after tax impact on the current accident year, $20 million of which related to the first and second quarters, a modest impact. Brian will discuss it in more detail. 
I'd like to highlight that we believe that the increase in auto bodily severity is environmental and not specific to the Quantum Auto 2.0 product, as we see it across all our Personal Insurance auto program and in our commercial auto and trucking books. In anticipation of this trend continuing, we are addressing it through pricing, and we believe that the product remains positioned to deliver target returns over time. 
I'd also add that it's important to understand that when trends change in any part of our business, and they will, what's important is having the ability to recognize it and react quickly. We believe our leading analytics give us an important advantage in this regard. 
In terms of net investment income, fixed income returns declined in line with our expectations and we were pleased to see an improvement in our returns from the nonfixed income portfolio. All of this resulted in a very strong operating return on equity in the quarter and year-to-date. Given the continued historically low interest rate environment and the other items impacting our results this quarter, we're particularly pleased with that result. 
In terms of the strategy going forward, you can expect more of the same. In this low interest rate environment where underwriting matters more than ever, we have significant competitive advantages in our data and analytics expertise, claim and risk control capabilities and talent. Combining that with our active capital management strategy, we remain well positioned to continue to deliver industry-leading returns over time. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Jay Benet."

Consistent with what we had said about the first 2 quarters of the year, we are once again pleased with our results this quarter: Operating income of $701 million and operating return on equity of 12.5%, notwithstanding their being lower than the prior year quarter. As in the first half of the year, these reductions did not result from fundamental changes in business trends, rather, as Alan said, they were primarily driven by lower net favorable prior year reserve development and higher noncat weather-related losses. 
Net investment income, which totaled $472 million after tax, was down only $12 million from the prior year quarter, entirely due to the continuing impact of the low interest rate environment on fixed income returns. Nonfixed income returns improved from recent quarters to a level that was slightly higher than the prior year quarter. 
We continue to experience net favorable prior year reserve development on a consolidated basis, which totaled $39 million pretax, down from $199 million pretax in the prior year quarter. 
In Business and International Insurance, net favorable development of $19 million pretax primarily resulted from better than expected loss experienced in GL ex A&E for accident years 2006 and prior and for 2014 and 2015, and workers' comp for accident years 2006 and prior and for 2015 and in commercial auto for accident years 2011 and prior, partially offset by a $225 million increase to our asbestos reserves.
The asbestos reserves increased related to a broad number of policyholders and was driven by higher estimates for projected settlement and defense cost for mesothelioma claims than we had previously assumed. Notwithstanding these higher cost estimates, our overall view of the underlying asbestos environment remained essentially unchanged from recent periods. 
In Bonds & Specialty Insurance, net favorable development of $41 million pretax primarily resulted from better than expected loss experience in Fidelity and Surety for accident years 2009 through 2015, while reserve development in Personal Insurance, which remained favorable to date, Homeowners and Other had a modest amount of unfavorable development this quarter, $21 million pretax, primarily resulting from higher than expected loss experienced for a small number of liability claims related to the 2013 and 2014 accident years. Notwithstanding this current quarter activity, the Homeowners and Other 2013 and 2014 accident years have developed net favorably since their inception.
I should also point out that the unfavorable development in Homeowners and Other this quarter did not result from any change in our reserve-setting philosophy or methodologies. As we've stated in the past and in our Qs and Ks, we always book to our best estimates and we use our advanced data and analytics to respond as quickly as we can to new information. 
By its nature, reserve development is episodic, and in lines like Homeowners and Other, much of it is historically related to trueing up estimated losses caused by storm damage. The number of severe storms in recent reporting periods, their timing in relation to the reporting period in which they occurred, the causes and severity of the losses, such as wind versus water, the actual size and extent of any hail, the actual amount of additional living expenses provided, et cetera, has and will cause significant fluctuations in reserve development from period to period, and changes in levels of reserve development should not be regarded as a ""trend."" 
Ex A&E, on a combined stat basis for all of our U.S. subs, all accident years across all product lines in the aggregate and all product lines across all accident years in the aggregate, developed favorably or had de minimis unfavorable development year to date. 
While CMP currently looks as if it developed unfavorably year to date by $37 million, as I pointed out in the second quarter, there was offsetting favorable development in the property product line, as Middle Market property losses that had been recorded in the property line at year end 2015 were subsequently determined to be CMP-related.
Operating cash flows of $1.77 billion were very strong this quarter. We ended the quarter with holding company liquidity of $1.8 billion, and all of our capital ratios remained at/or better than their target levels. Net unrealized investment gains were approximately $3.1 billion pretax or $2 billion after tax, up from $2 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively, at the beginning of the year. While book value per share of $86.04 and adjusted book value per share of $78.82 increased 8% and 5%, respectively, also from the beginning of the year. 
We continue to generate much more capital than we need to support our businesses, and consistent with our ongoing capital management strategy, we returned $755 million of excess capital to our shareholders this quarter through dividends of $193 million and share repurchases of $562 million. And year to date, we returned nearly $2.3 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. 
So with that, I'll turn things over to Brian."

I'll start with Business and International Insurance where we had another good quarter with strong returns and production results. We were very pleased that retention remained at historically high levels while we achieved positive renewal premium change and solid new business results. 
Turning to the financial results for the segment. Operating income was $457 million with a combined ratio of 96.1%. The underlying combined ratio was 94.7%, up 2.2 points compared to the prior year. The increase in the underlying loss ratio was driven primarily by noncat weather, which was higher than both the prior year quarter and our expectation, and about 0.75 points impact from loss cost trends in excess of earned pricing. These were partially offset by lower large loss activity.
Turning to production. Given the returns that we are generating in the segment, our focus continues to be on retention, and so we're very pleased that retention for our domestic business remained at 85% for the quarter. Renewal premium change was nearly 3 points, including renewal rate change that was slightly positive, while we produced new business of $431 million.
Turning to the individual businesses. In Select, retention continued to remains strong at 82%, while renewal premium change was over 5 points, and we're quite pleased that new business was up 7% over the prior year. In Middle Market, retention of 87% remains at a historical high, with renewal premium change of over 2 points. New business dollars were essentially consistent with prior year, with submissions, quotes and the number of new accounts written in the quarter up. The average size of accounts written was down slightly versus last year, but we're encouraged by the increased activity. 
In Other Business Insurance on Page 12, you can see that rate and RPC both improved in the quarter and retention remained strong. New business of $124 million was down compared to the third quarter of 2015, reflecting continued disciplined underwriting for larger accounts where we don't feel that market pricing will allow us to achieve target returns.
In International, we achieved 82% retention with positive renewal premium change and a 46% increase in new business volume, resulting in a 4% increase in net written premium, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. These increases were driven by our new global construction and renewable energy groups in Lloyd's and continued success in Canada with our recently introduced Personal Lines Auto product, Optima. So all-in, a good quarter for the segment with strong production and profitability.
Turning to Bonds and Specialty Insurance. This business continues to perform exceptionally well. Operating income for the quarter of $146 million was down from the prior year quarter, driven primarily by lower -- a lower level of net favorable prior year reserve development. The underlying combined ratio of 77.4% remained strong and well within our target return levels.
On top line, net written premiums for the quarter were flat to the prior year. Across our Management Liability businesses, retention remained at historically high levels and new business volumes were up as we continued to execute our strategy of retaining our best accounts and writing more business in our return-adequate product segments. So Bonds & Specialty results remained terrific, and we continue to feel great about the segment's performance and execution in the marketplace. 
I'll now turn to Personal Insurance. Alan touched on the highlights. We once again had a solid quarter with a combined ratio of 92.9% and net written premiums reaching an all-time high of $2.2 billion.  Auto continues to be the bigger factor driving the growth, but Homeowners' growth continues to accelerate as well. And both products generated strong retention and new business levels.
We believe being a portfolio provider sets us apart in the marketplace and we remain pleased with the financial performance of the overall segment. The third quarter underlying combined ratio of 91% was impacted by an adjustment to our auto loss ratio that I'll discuss in a moment. And year to date underlying combined ratio of 88.9% remained strong, a very good result.
Looking at auto profitability. The underlying combined ratio for the quarter was 101.1%, up about 5 points from the prior year. About 4.5 points of this increase was due to the year-to-date impact of an adjustment we made to the loss ratio related to bodily injury severity for 2016, which for the most part, reflects higher severity in our smaller claims. About 3 points of that increase relates to the first 2 quarters of this year. 
With respect to this change, I want to emphasize a few points. First, as Alan said, we believe this is environmental in nature, that is, we are seeing it across all our auto products, both in personal and commercial lines; second, what we are seeing is from the last 4 accident quarters, and for a long-tail line like auto liability, that is very recent activity; lastly, while we have been closely watching and talking to you about auto bodily injury severity for a number of years and reflecting it in our underwriting claim, pricing and reserving, recently, severity has increased to a level that's a little more than we anticipated. In response to this recent trend, we're taking the appropriate pricing actions. 
Looking at auto frequency, overall, year to date 2016 frequency is generally in line with our long-term view. That said, we have seen some texture within the year. Collision frequency for the first half of the year was favorable to our long-term view while the third quarter was unfavorable. We believe the frequency volatility that we've seen in 2016 reflects normal period-to-period fluctuations. As always, we are watching the data closely and will adjust if and when appropriate, but as of now, we have not changed our long-term frequency expectations. 
For perspective, the net adjustments we have made year to date related to collision frequency have less than a $3 million after tax unfavorable impact. Normally, we wouldn't talk about a variance this small, but given the amount of recent industry discussion on the topic, we felt the disclosure would be helpful.
We've also been talking to you about the impact of tenure on our auto loss ratio for a while. So let me take a few minutes to walk you through the slide on Page 19 that we've added to demonstrate the impact of tenure on a loss ratio. 
Exhibit 1 in the upper left illustrates the underlying dynamic that drives the impact of tenure, namely that the loss ratio of a given cohort of business improves over time, as poorer-performing business defects and pricing segmentation improves on the business that is retained.
Moving to exhibits 2 through 4, of course, any given calendar period consists of a number of cohorts ranging from new to multiple years of age. In these exhibits, the curved line represents loss ratio by tenure, think policy year. The vertical bars represent premium volume remaining for those years and the horizontal line is the calendar period loss ratio for all cohorts, which is a premium-weighted average of the loss ratio of each cohort of business during that calendar period.
Exhibit 2 demonstrates a steady state growth scenario, think base case. During periods of consistent growth, the newer cohorts blend with the older ones, and the calendar period loss experience will generate the target loss ratio. 
Exhibit 3 illustrates the impact of a higher new business growth environment, where calendar period results are more heavily influenced by the newer cohorts of business that naturally have a higher loss ratio. This drives the calendar period loss ratio higher. 
Exhibit 4 illustrates a return to steady state growth at the higher levels of premium volume. The balance between the older and newer cohorts improves, the calendar paired loss ratio returns to target levels, and in addition, increased volume brings additional profit dollars. 
So obviously, these are theoretical illustrations that raise a few important questions for our business. First, what is the current impact of tenure on our auto loss ratio? And the answer is, that the loss ratio -- our loss ratio is about 2 points higher than it would've been excluding this tenure impact. 
Second, do we believe that our Quantum Auto 2.0 product is performing as expected? And the answer to this is that it's been maturing in line with our loss ratio expectations. 
Of course, we manage the business at a very granular level and monitor the book across multiple dimensions. For example, loss cost, retention and other proxies of profitability, such as limits profile, prior experience and insurance score. In aggregate, based on all the data we have, we believe this businesses on track to produce appropriate returns. We clearly realize that the product is still relatively new in the marketplace, having launched late in 2013, but 3 years in, we are very pleased with the performance.
Turning to Homeowners. The underlying combined ratio for the quarter was a very strong 78.3%, although up about 7 points year-over-year due primarily to an unusually low amount of noncatastrophe weather-related losses last year. The current quarter result is in line with our expectations, and we remain very pleased with the returns we're seeing in this business.
So stepping back from a lot of moving pieces in the quarter, this is a franchise with a year-to-date combined ratio of 94.1% and 9% premium growth, results we feel very good about. 
And with that, let me turn it back to Gabby."

I would also talk to -- I would completely agree with the comment that auto liability, any liability line of business, it's hard to see clarity in the near-term. And so we're constantly watching these events. I am very confident, though, that we're as on top of this as anybody. And for reference, I'd just comment, I'd say look back to commentary we had going back as far as 2011, 2012 into 2013. We were talking about liability trends, what we were seeing in the auto product relative to distracted driving, relative to increased litigation, relative to increased utilization of medical diagnostic tools and the impacts on bodily injury. And to be totally honest, there were a couple of years there where we were getting a lot of questions from folks on this call about why are you seeing something no one else is talking about? And over the years, I think everybody has been talking about it. So I'm not saying that we've got it perfectly right or we ever do, but we're looking at the trends very, very closely.

And a lot of the growth you're seeing is high in percentage terms because it's off a smaller base after a couple of years of shrinking. So that's, I think, just important context to keep in mind. We don't go out there and try to manage the growth. We try to go out there based on everything that we see and price for the return that we're looking for. And based on the market, we'll grow or we won't grow. And we feel very good about the growth. Maybe we don't have it exactly right. Maybe we'll have to adjust, I'm not really sure. And honestly, we could be adjusting up or down, not really sure. And this isn't unusual for any line of business that we have.

The real -- and we're not going to disclose exactly what the timing is because that would leave someone to be able to triangulate exactly how we're pricing and the returns that we're -- where specific returns we're targeting. But the answer is it's kind of a function of when -- what do you think is going to happen to our growth. It's not going to reverse in the next year or 2. It's going to take a while to play out. The other thing that is certainly worth noting is we talk a lot about the ratio. As we grow and it performs, we're generating profit dollars that are incremental to the franchise.

When you look at the outlook, the outlook reflects the comments we've made this morning, and that we're responding with price. And so the outlook, I think, literally says, ""We believe price will exceed loss trend,"" which will be a good guy. The outlook says, ""I believe, that, that offsets some continued adverse impact from tenure."" And then other big component is an expectation about more normalized loss levels, which relates a little bit to the noncat weather conversation we've been having this morning and just a broader, more consistent expectation on loss level.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Unfortunately, I need to start on a sad note this morning. This is my fourth earnings call as CEO but the first since we lost our friend, Jay Fishman. I know I'm not alone in feeling his loss. Many of you sent thoughts and prayers. Thank you, we appreciate it. 
All of us at Travelers take a great deal of comfort in knowing that we're carrying on in a culture of excellence, performance and innovation that Jay left behind. It outlives him. It's an enormous part of his legacy, and we're grateful for it. To sum it up in Jay's words, we all feel remarkably fortunate to have known him and worked with him. 
At this point, Jay, would of course, demand that we get back to work, so let's get to the results.
This morning, we reported third quarter operating income of $701 million or $2.40 per share and operating return on equity of 12.5%. Our underwriting results remained strong, as reflected in our 92.9% combined ratio, and our net investment income was down only slightly from the prior year quarter. Across all our businesses, the third quarter was another example of the successful execution of our marketplace strategies. 
And generally speaking, underlying trends have not changed. Pricing and retention remained stable and consistent with recent trends. In our commercial businesses, retention continues to be at historic highs, with positive renewal premium change. In domestic business insurance, renewal rate change has improved a little bit for 2 sequential quarters, led by our middle market business, where rate has also increased sequentially month-to-month in the quarter. 
Underneath that Middle Market, we again achieved rate gains in excess of loss trend on our poorest-performing segments. We also benefited from a mix shift in our better-performing settlements, as the loss ratio on the retained business in those segments was better than the loss ratio on nonrenewed business, the results of managing the business on a very granular level. 
In Personal Insurance, we continued to achieve strong top line growth in the quarter, with continued growth in policies in-force in both our Agency Auto and Homeowners businesses. We believe that being able to deliver an account solution to our customers and agents is an important and meaningful competitive advantage. 
More than half of our personalized premium come from accounts for which we write both auto and home policies. When we write both the auto and the home, we can be more competitive in the pricing for our customers since it creates higher customer lifetime value for us through higher retentions and a more complete view of the risk. While we manage the profitability of the auto and home lines independently, we also manage to a portfolio return. We'll be focusing more than usual on the performance of the auto business this morning, but we shouldn't lose sight of the fact that the all-in combined ratio for our personal lines business was 94.1% for the 9 months, a very good result. 
Turning back to consolidated results for all 3 segments. Underwriting results for the quarter were impacted by lower levels of net favorable prior year reserve development, higher noncat weather-related losses, and in personal lines, higher-than-expected losses associated with auto bodily injury. Jay Benet will have more to say about the prior year development. 
The higher bodily injury severity in Personal Auto had a $29 million after tax impact on the current accident year, $20 million of which related to the first and second quarters, a modest impact. Brian will discuss it in more detail. 
I'd like to highlight that we believe that the increase in auto bodily severity is environmental and not specific to the Quantum Auto 2.0 product, as we see it across all our Personal Insurance auto program and in our commercial auto and trucking books. In anticipation of this trend continuing, we are addressing it through pricing, and we believe that the product remains positioned to deliver target returns over time. 
I'd also add that it's important to understand that when trends change in any part of our business, and they will, what's important is having the ability to recognize it and react quickly. We believe our leading analytics give us an important advantage in this regard. 
In terms of net investment income, fixed income returns declined in line with our expectations and we were pleased to see an improvement in our returns from the nonfixed income portfolio. All of this resulted in a very strong operating return on equity in the quarter and year-to-date. Given the continued historically low interest rate environment and the other items impacting our results this quarter, we're particularly pleased with that result. 
In terms of the strategy going forward, you can expect more of the same. In this low interest rate environment where underwriting matters more than ever, we have significant competitive advantages in our data and analytics expertise, claim and risk control capabilities and talent. Combining that with our active capital management strategy, we remain well positioned to continue to deliver industry-leading returns over time. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Jay Benet."
392856,311922517,1058409,"The Travelers Companies, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 20, 2016",2016-10-20,"Earnings Calls","The Travelers Companies, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Alan. Consistent with what we had said about the first 2 quarters of the year, we are once again pleased with our results this quarter: Operating income of $701 million and operating return on equity of 12.5%, notwithstanding their being lower tha",821,"Thanks, Alan. Consistent with what we had said about the first 2 quarters of the year, we are once again pleased with our results this quarter: Operating income of $701 million and operating return on equity of 12.5%, notwithstanding their being lower than the prior year quarter. As in the first half of the year, these reductions did not result from fundamental changes in business trends, rather, as Alan said, they were primarily driven by lower net favorable prior year reserve development and higher noncat weather-related losses. 
Net investment income, which totaled $472 million after tax, was down only $12 million from the prior year quarter, entirely due to the continuing impact of the low interest rate environment on fixed income returns. Nonfixed income returns improved from recent quarters to a level that was slightly higher than the prior year quarter. 
We continue to experience net favorable prior year reserve development on a consolidated basis, which totaled $39 million pretax, down from $199 million pretax in the prior year quarter. 
In Business and International Insurance, net favorable development of $19 million pretax primarily resulted from better than expected loss experienced in GL ex A&E for accident years 2006 and prior and for 2014 and 2015, and workers' comp for accident years 2006 and prior and for 2015 and in commercial auto for accident years 2011 and prior, partially offset by a $225 million increase to our asbestos reserves.
The asbestos reserves increased related to a broad number of policyholders and was driven by higher estimates for projected settlement and defense cost for mesothelioma claims than we had previously assumed. Notwithstanding these higher cost estimates, our overall view of the underlying asbestos environment remained essentially unchanged from recent periods. 
In Bonds & Specialty Insurance, net favorable development of $41 million pretax primarily resulted from better than expected loss experience in Fidelity and Surety for accident years 2009 through 2015, while reserve development in Personal Insurance, which remained favorable to date, Homeowners and Other had a modest amount of unfavorable development this quarter, $21 million pretax, primarily resulting from higher than expected loss experienced for a small number of liability claims related to the 2013 and 2014 accident years. Notwithstanding this current quarter activity, the Homeowners and Other 2013 and 2014 accident years have developed net favorably since their inception.
I should also point out that the unfavorable development in Homeowners and Other this quarter did not result from any change in our reserve-setting philosophy or methodologies. As we've stated in the past and in our Qs and Ks, we always book to our best estimates and we use our advanced data and analytics to respond as quickly as we can to new information. 
By its nature, reserve development is episodic, and in lines like Homeowners and Other, much of it is historically related to trueing up estimated losses caused by storm damage. The number of severe storms in recent reporting periods, their timing in relation to the reporting period in which they occurred, the causes and severity of the losses, such as wind versus water, the actual size and extent of any hail, the actual amount of additional living expenses provided, et cetera, has and will cause significant fluctuations in reserve development from period to period, and changes in levels of reserve development should not be regarded as a ""trend."" 
Ex A&E, on a combined stat basis for all of our U.S. subs, all accident years across all product lines in the aggregate and all product lines across all accident years in the aggregate, developed favorably or had de minimis unfavorable development year to date. 
While CMP currently looks as if it developed unfavorably year to date by $37 million, as I pointed out in the second quarter, there was offsetting favorable development in the property product line, as Middle Market property losses that had been recorded in the property line at year end 2015 were subsequently determined to be CMP-related.
Operating cash flows of $1.77 billion were very strong this quarter. We ended the quarter with holding company liquidity of $1.8 billion, and all of our capital ratios remained at/or better than their target levels. Net unrealized investment gains were approximately $3.1 billion pretax or $2 billion after tax, up from $2 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively, at the beginning of the year. While book value per share of $86.04 and adjusted book value per share of $78.82 increased 8% and 5%, respectively, also from the beginning of the year. 
We continue to generate much more capital than we need to support our businesses, and consistent with our ongoing capital management strategy, we returned $755 million of excess capital to our shareholders this quarter through dividends of $193 million and share repurchases of $562 million. And year to date, we returned nearly $2.3 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. 
So with that, I'll turn things over to Brian."

I'll start with Business and International Insurance where we had another good quarter with strong returns and production results. We were very pleased that retention remained at historically high levels while we achieved positive renewal premium change and solid new business results. 
Turning to the financial results for the segment. Operating income was $457 million with a combined ratio of 96.1%. The underlying combined ratio was 94.7%, up 2.2 points compared to the prior year. The increase in the underlying loss ratio was driven primarily by noncat weather, which was higher than both the prior year quarter and our expectation, and about 0.75 points impact from loss cost trends in excess of earned pricing. These were partially offset by lower large loss activity.
Turning to production. Given the returns that we are generating in the segment, our focus continues to be on retention, and so we're very pleased that retention for our domestic business remained at 85% for the quarter. Renewal premium change was nearly 3 points, including renewal rate change that was slightly positive, while we produced new business of $431 million.
Turning to the individual businesses. In Select, retention continued to remains strong at 82%, while renewal premium change was over 5 points, and we're quite pleased that new business was up 7% over the prior year. In Middle Market, retention of 87% remains at a historical high, with renewal premium change of over 2 points. New business dollars were essentially consistent with prior year, with submissions, quotes and the number of new accounts written in the quarter up. The average size of accounts written was down slightly versus last year, but we're encouraged by the increased activity. 
In Other Business Insurance on Page 12, you can see that rate and RPC both improved in the quarter and retention remained strong. New business of $124 million was down compared to the third quarter of 2015, reflecting continued disciplined underwriting for larger accounts where we don't feel that market pricing will allow us to achieve target returns.
In International, we achieved 82% retention with positive renewal premium change and a 46% increase in new business volume, resulting in a 4% increase in net written premium, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. These increases were driven by our new global construction and renewable energy groups in Lloyd's and continued success in Canada with our recently introduced Personal Lines Auto product, Optima. So all-in, a good quarter for the segment with strong production and profitability.
Turning to Bonds and Specialty Insurance. This business continues to perform exceptionally well. Operating income for the quarter of $146 million was down from the prior year quarter, driven primarily by lower -- a lower level of net favorable prior year reserve development. The underlying combined ratio of 77.4% remained strong and well within our target return levels.
On top line, net written premiums for the quarter were flat to the prior year. Across our Management Liability businesses, retention remained at historically high levels and new business volumes were up as we continued to execute our strategy of retaining our best accounts and writing more business in our return-adequate product segments. So Bonds & Specialty results remained terrific, and we continue to feel great about the segment's performance and execution in the marketplace. 
I'll now turn to Personal Insurance. Alan touched on the highlights. We once again had a solid quarter with a combined ratio of 92.9% and net written premiums reaching an all-time high of $2.2 billion.  Auto continues to be the bigger factor driving the growth, but Homeowners' growth continues to accelerate as well. And both products generated strong retention and new business levels.
We believe being a portfolio provider sets us apart in the marketplace and we remain pleased with the financial performance of the overall segment. The third quarter underlying combined ratio of 91% was impacted by an adjustment to our auto loss ratio that I'll discuss in a moment. And year to date underlying combined ratio of 88.9% remained strong, a very good result.
Looking at auto profitability. The underlying combined ratio for the quarter was 101.1%, up about 5 points from the prior year. About 4.5 points of this increase was due to the year-to-date impact of an adjustment we made to the loss ratio related to bodily injury severity for 2016, which for the most part, reflects higher severity in our smaller claims. About 3 points of that increase relates to the first 2 quarters of this year. 
With respect to this change, I want to emphasize a few points. First, as Alan said, we believe this is environmental in nature, that is, we are seeing it across all our auto products, both in personal and commercial lines; second, what we are seeing is from the last 4 accident quarters, and for a long-tail line like auto liability, that is very recent activity; lastly, while we have been closely watching and talking to you about auto bodily injury severity for a number of years and reflecting it in our underwriting claim, pricing and reserving, recently, severity has increased to a level that's a little more than we anticipated. In response to this recent trend, we're taking the appropriate pricing actions. 
Looking at auto frequency, overall, year to date 2016 frequency is generally in line with our long-term view. That said, we have seen some texture within the year. Collision frequency for the first half of the year was favorable to our long-term view while the third quarter was unfavorable. We believe the frequency volatility that we've seen in 2016 reflects normal period-to-period fluctuations. As always, we are watching the data closely and will adjust if and when appropriate, but as of now, we have not changed our long-term frequency expectations. 
For perspective, the net adjustments we have made year to date related to collision frequency have less than a $3 million after tax unfavorable impact. Normally, we wouldn't talk about a variance this small, but given the amount of recent industry discussion on the topic, we felt the disclosure would be helpful.
We've also been talking to you about the impact of tenure on our auto loss ratio for a while. So let me take a few minutes to walk you through the slide on Page 19 that we've added to demonstrate the impact of tenure on a loss ratio. 
Exhibit 1 in the upper left illustrates the underlying dynamic that drives the impact of tenure, namely that the loss ratio of a given cohort of business improves over time, as poorer-performing business defects and pricing segmentation improves on the business that is retained.
Moving to exhibits 2 through 4, of course, any given calendar period consists of a number of cohorts ranging from new to multiple years of age. In these exhibits, the curved line represents loss ratio by tenure, think policy year. The vertical bars represent premium volume remaining for those years and the horizontal line is the calendar period loss ratio for all cohorts, which is a premium-weighted average of the loss ratio of each cohort of business during that calendar period.
Exhibit 2 demonstrates a steady state growth scenario, think base case. During periods of consistent growth, the newer cohorts blend with the older ones, and the calendar period loss experience will generate the target loss ratio. 
Exhibit 3 illustrates the impact of a higher new business growth environment, where calendar period results are more heavily influenced by the newer cohorts of business that naturally have a higher loss ratio. This drives the calendar period loss ratio higher. 
Exhibit 4 illustrates a return to steady state growth at the higher levels of premium volume. The balance between the older and newer cohorts improves, the calendar paired loss ratio returns to target levels, and in addition, increased volume brings additional profit dollars. 
So obviously, these are theoretical illustrations that raise a few important questions for our business. First, what is the current impact of tenure on our auto loss ratio? And the answer is, that the loss ratio -- our loss ratio is about 2 points higher than it would've been excluding this tenure impact. 
Second, do we believe that our Quantum Auto 2.0 product is performing as expected? And the answer to this is that it's been maturing in line with our loss ratio expectations. 
Of course, we manage the business at a very granular level and monitor the book across multiple dimensions. For example, loss cost, retention and other proxies of profitability, such as limits profile, prior experience and insurance score. In aggregate, based on all the data we have, we believe this businesses on track to produce appropriate returns. We clearly realize that the product is still relatively new in the marketplace, having launched late in 2013, but 3 years in, we are very pleased with the performance.
Turning to Homeowners. The underlying combined ratio for the quarter was a very strong 78.3%, although up about 7 points year-over-year due primarily to an unusually low amount of noncatastrophe weather-related losses last year. The current quarter result is in line with our expectations, and we remain very pleased with the returns we're seeing in this business.
So stepping back from a lot of moving pieces in the quarter, this is a franchise with a year-to-date combined ratio of 94.1% and 9% premium growth, results we feel very good about. 
And with that, let me turn it back to Gabby."

So it would be, in our view, highly unlikely that we'd see it that broad based and have it be just our issue. I would also talk to -- I would completely agree with the comment that auto liability, any liability line of business, it's hard to see clarity in the near-term. And so we're constantly watching these events. I am very confident, though, that we're as on top of this as anybody. And for reference, I'd just comment, I'd say look back to commentary we had going back as far as 2011, 2012 into 2013. We were talking about liability trends, what we were seeing in the auto product relative to distracted driving, relative to increased litigation, relative to increased utilization of medical diagnostic tools and the impacts on bodily injury. And to be totally honest, there were a couple of years there where we were getting a lot of questions from folks on this call about why are you seeing something no one else is talking about? And over the years, I think everybody has been talking about it. So I'm not saying that we've got it perfectly right or we ever do, but we're looking at the trends very, very closely.

And a lot of the growth you're seeing is high in percentage terms because it's off a smaller base after a couple of years of shrinking. So that's, I think, just important context to keep in mind. We don't go out there and try to manage the growth. We try to go out there based on everything that we see and price for the return that we're looking for. And based on the market, we'll grow or we won't grow. And we feel very good about the growth. Maybe we don't have it exactly right. Maybe we'll have to adjust, I'm not really sure. And honestly, we could be adjusting up or down, not really sure. And this isn't unusual for any line of business that we have.

And then I guess a follow-up for Brian, I guess, on the impact of tenure. So I guess over the last couple of years, it's been 2 points.

So I guess over the last couple of years, it's been 2 points. If we would have had this conversation a year ago, it would have been 1. So then, new business currently, I guess, is growing year-over-year. And I guess this introduces the question of just how and over what time period can we really get that 2 points back? I guess especially when you think about the fact that Quantum 2, it seems like it's supposed to be a more competitively priced product. So over time, there should be a higher percentage of premium in new business. So yes, I mean, just anything you can give us on getting that 2 points back and whether or not you can get it back and keep growth anywhere close to where it is for quantum."

So a couple of things, and again, this is back to the theoretical example. Although not possible, if you keep growing, you keep kind of chasing it. But if you keep growing with business that you believe has lifetime value that's meeting your returns,",181,"Yes. So a couple of things, and again, this is back to the theoretical example. Although not possible, if you keep growing, you keep kind of chasing it. But if you keep growing with business that you believe has lifetime value that's meeting your returns, then it's all a good thing. So -- and I get that that's a theoretical comment. The real -- and we're not going to disclose exactly what the timing is because that would leave someone to be able to triangulate exactly how we're pricing and the returns that we're -- where specific returns we're targeting. But the answer is it's kind of a function of when -- what do you think is going to happen to our growth. It's not going to reverse in the next year or 2. It's going to take a while to play out. The other thing that is certainly worth noting is we talk a lot about the ratio. As we grow and it performs, we're generating profit dollars that are incremental to the franchise. And obviously, that's a good thing."

I mean, there's always a risk it could change from here. It could change up, it could change down. When you look at the outlook, the outlook reflects the comments we've made this morning, and that we're responding with price. And so the outlook, I think, literally says, ""We believe price will exceed loss trend,"" which will be a good guy. The outlook says, ""I believe, that, that offsets some continued adverse impact from tenure."" And then other big component is an expectation about more normalized loss levels, which relates a little bit to the noncat weather conversation we've been having this morning and just a broader, more consistent expectation on loss level. So again, I think the pricing and the outlook anticipate that the bodily injury severity -- the higher levels of bodily injury severity are with us going forward. But we're responding with price and believe that we'll get price ahead of loss trend in '17."
